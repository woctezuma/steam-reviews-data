While free, the content is high quality in all aspects.\n\nHonestly, there was a part of me that was reluctant to start the game. I initially couldn't connect with the character because of her coarseness, and I was more curious of the story. But once I got into it, there was no return. I was hooked. It's shockingly free even though the time and effort and love put into the game is apparent. Whether it be the CG images, the music, or even the dialogue, this is amazing in its entirety.\n\nSo initially for all the plots, there was something weird about each character that made me squint my eyes at following their plot (will mention each) and thinking \"how am I going to like this plotline\", bUT even though I mainly just did routes because I was really [i] really [/i] interested in the story, I ended up liking them all. Like I said before, I was really reluctant to play the game, but it grew on me so much to the point where I love the game.\n\n[h1] Opinions/Insight On Each Storyline [/h1]\n[list]\n\n[*] [b] Rod: [/b] So I didn't realize until halfway through this plotline that oh sh-t this is an otome. Like the plot lines actually lead to love interests. So I started this route because I thought \"Oh this route will definitely be [u] easy for my protagonist [/u] .\" [i] *facepalm* [/i] So yeah, Rod was my first playthrough. Under normal circumstances, this plotline is highkey gross because half incest. BUT I actually really enjoyed this plot line because of Rod's character arc, his general awkwardness, and [spoiler] Sebby. Sebby's commentary is perfect. [/spoiler] Rod's awkwardness is utterly endearing and adorable. His arc is paced well and is believable. There are an abundance of fuzzy moments, and I loved it. If you're an achievement hunter, I recommend this plot for the Guided By Intuition achievement because Rod is quick to let you know you've done something wrong. Rod's was the second best for me.\n[*] [b] Rumpel: [/b] I actually switched Karma and Rumpel with the recommendation order unknowingly, so through this experience, there were parts in the story that weren't quite gaps but weren't quite in flow with how the information from the previous story goes into the next story. From this, I learned, yes follow their recommended order to playthrough each storyline. After Rod, I was worried to start Rumpel's because his personality is a completely different spectrum from Rod's. Going from a cute, awkward boy to a flirtatious man was ooh scary. But of course, I found myself loving this one too. This one is definitely focuses more on the development of the protagonist in more than just kindness but opening up to people. While in Rod's, I was gushing at how adorable Rod was. For Rumpel, his was more romantic and swoon worthy. Unfortunately, he ranked fifth of them all, but please note, this is not because his story wasn't enjoyable. \n[*] [b] Karma: [/b] You get introduced to Karma as a female initially, so my squinting stemmed from that. The personalities of Rumpel and Karma are very similar, so he too had swoon worthy moments. They both had the same amount ,but I honestly liked Karma's a lot more than Rumpel's because the bonding between the protagonist and Karma were better than with Rumpel's in my opinion. Also, I felt his fairytale curse fit the story better than Rumpel's. Bonus points to Karma too for [spoiler] two shirtless CGs. He's the only one who gets them. [/spoiler] I swooned at Karma just as often as the romantic moments. Karma is third for me just because Rod was the first and of course, the first is always a smidge more special.\n[*] [b] Fritz: [/b]: After playing through the first three storylines, you get some background on Fritz, and because of this, a lot of his story was more predictable when relating back to the story. What I did really like about Fritz that made him fourth and not fifth was that he had an initial relationship with your character. I really dug the guard and princess aspect because it added to making his motivations believable. Overall, Fritz is a sweetheart. His story was half sweetness and half uh/whoa moments just relating to his character, so this bumped him to at least fourth because of the tough competition. He's also not fifth because he had at least 3 heart wrenching moments. yEAH.\n[*] [b] Waltz: [/b] There's a reason the developer's recommend choosing Waltz last because his storyline takes all the information you've learned from the previous stories and shows them all executed as you would imagine and then some. Because of this, his story is so fleshed out. My initial yikes was [spoiler] that you meet Waltz as a boy. Not Rod being a teenager with boyish charm, like an actual boy that's shorter than you. You do find out from one of the storylines that whoa he's a charmer that's actually taller than you and (and from his) older, but it takes a bit for sure. But once he's in his older form, [/spoiler] My God is he the most attractive love choice. #TallDarkAndHandsome Obviously, I swooned the most just from that. But plus the moments? My heart was a flutter with this romance. He also has a relationship with the protagonist before the storyline so everything he does and says is just yes. Nearly all your encounters are sweet or romantic, and because he's the last one, h-ll yeah he gets all the best CGs. You can tell Waltz is definitely the favorite of the developers because of the extensive endings for him.\n\n[/list]\n\nLong story short, see the unfolding of this story yourself because the love plots are barely the surface of the story.

Each is afflicted by a different curse based on a classic fairytale, and you try to break their curse as they help you try to break your own curse, the Cinderella curse. You have gone from riches to rags in order to learn an important lesson, and the game doesn't just focus on your bachelor once you choose him - it has an amazing supporting cast as well who will make you feel every emotion, from anger to sorrow and everything in between.\n\nWhile the story is the most important thing in visual novels, the graphics here are also of high standard, which really helps to immerse you in the story. The music isn't repetitive or distracting, and it changes throughout the story to suit the scenarios you are in, which just adds to the experience. Once you have seen a particular dialgoue, you can then fast forward through it, and even skip to the next unseen dialogue or choice, which is very useful for the replays as there are 10 chapters to each story and they are very long.\n\nThe replayability is fantastic - there are 5 pursuable male characters, each with a good and a bad ending.

Each unique and awkward in their own way. Though Trust, Love and choices you can either get a good ending or a bad ending. That makes up to a total of 10 different endings each route is very unique and interesting in their own ways.\n\nSome heartwarming, some heartache, some inspiring, some Anger and lost\u2026 The mix of feeling just go on and on. \n\nEveryone in the story was under an influence of a Fairytale curse. The main protagonist was under Cinderella Curse and other character you interact with in the story have background in fairytale such as Beauty and Beast, Little Mermaid and Little Red Hood Etc.

Though this may be because I quite liked the Frits character from the beginning.[/spoiler] Another issue I had with Waltz' story in particular was, [spoiler]The protaganist also quickly doesn't have any sort of true emotion when told about her mothers wrong doing in his story compared to the other storylines where she shows a lot of emotion turmoil about the truth.[/spoiler]\n\nBUT overall I thoroughly enjoyed the game, it really did play with my heartstrings and I am not a person easily swayed.

They also kept the canon consistent and if played in the reccommended sequence, everything felt even more consistent and well thought. [spoiler] such as rumpel being a doctor [/spoiler] A few minor things that bothered me include the fact that i cant skip transistions to CGs (y'know, when they zoom in on the love interest for like a solid 5 seconds,) or when someone gives u an item. The art itself is sometimes a little wonky, (not that it matters, if you're a crybaby like me, you'll be crying half the time anyway) but if you can live with that, this is definitely a good game with an amazing plot, interesting characters and a well developped main character who isn't a normal helpless otoge heroine. Also it's a free anyway so you may as well give it a shot y'know...\n\nAlso another little and specific thing that irked me a little about this game is [spoiler] the fact that in Waltz's route, the main character changed a little too quickly compared to the other routes. As a result, the entire plot felt rushed and it generally felt underwhelming when compared to Fritz's, who is also a locked option. Too many things are also revealed in the previous routes, i.e Tinkerbell and Neverland. This bothered me because it's obvious that Waltz's route is meant to be [/spoiler] the \"true\" route. it felt difficult for me to feel attached [spoiler] to waltz [/spoiler] because we don't really see much of the character before the true route. The other locked route felt much more dramatic and kept me on edge instead...\n\nBut then again it may be my preference, but all in all, excellent game with a beautiful plot, music and loveable characters. 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1512310845, "timestamp_updated": 1512310922, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38023256": {"recommendationid": "38023256", "author": {"steamid": "76561198186651214", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 150, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512181848}, "language": "english", "review": "Kinda boring honestly i just played it for fun", "timestamp_created": 1512277376, "timestamp_updated": 1512277376, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.409836", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38003111": {"recommendationid": "38003111", "author": {"steamid": "76561198273899625", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512262309}, "language": "english", "review": "very nice game. the only con is it would be nice if the could qoutate speech to distinguish them between speech and thoughts", "timestamp_created": 1512220211, "timestamp_updated": 1512220211, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37995331": {"recommendationid": "37995331", "author": {"steamid": "76561198292133932", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 360, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512260227}, "language": "english", "review": "GIves actual pay to play games a run for it's money.

Which personally I recommend to play all of them to see the full Story. It will also give you all Achievements.\n\nThe only thing that bothered me was that you can't see the full story of the villains or choose them and have 2 Routes with them.\n\nI would love to see another VN from this Studio or even a DLC where you can see the Story of the Villains. I have spent 25 Hours on this Game and wouldn't mind supporting the developers.\n\nI recommend this Game to any Story Lover, Achievement Hunter, Otome new comer & Otome Fan.\n\nIf you have any Troubles 100% completing the game or going all routes.

Rumpel (...)\n\nIt's weird cuz in most Otome games, its usually easy to know why the girl falls in love with the guys but I sometimes get confused what even draws them to her. But in this story, I completely understand why they would all fall in love with her. The main character has a really strong personality. But I can only clearly see her fall in love with Karma and Rod. Seems to me that she got seduced by Karma and felt bonded with Rod.

The story had excellent set of characters, scripts, and the characters were completely fleshed out which made the story feel that much better.\n\nYou could really see and feel each characters perspective which made the game feel so unique not like other games that I have played that feel liek they have the same characters replayed.\n\n This game will also bring you to tears. This story will likely have you emotionally attached to the characters so be well prepared if you choose to play this game. \n\nThe art and music add to the fable-like story and characters really well.  I was really surprised that the choices in the game such as the choices you need for the good endings weren't always the virtuous type of decisions and that the story wants you to know each characters way of thinking before you can get that good ending, but being the good ending seeking type of person I always saved before the big choices so I could always get the good ending, but when I finished and started doing the bad endings I found out that wasn't always the good way to go.  \n\nThe bad endings left me feeling really emotional because the good endings really made me feel attached to the characters personalities, but I won\u2019t spoil any of the endings for you. \n\n I have to admit that Delora and Parfait played two great roles in this game helping move the story forward.  (For those who don\u2019t know those are two of the characters that you see in the game.)\n\nI honestly can't wait to see more games from the Dicesuki and I really hope the sequel will be somewhat similar to this storyline because I would love to see how my past character choices affect the future of the game.\n\nPros.\n\n\u2022\tMusic placement, it felt in place during each scene, chapter, or act in the story.\n\n\u2022\tUnique music, I loved the intro to the game and the songs throughout the game they made me happy, frightened, and sad.\n\n\u2022\tGreat script, I didn\u2019t notice any errors during my play through and it had me laughing, teary, and unhappy during my play through the game.\n\n\u2022\tMemorable characters, I can\u2019t forget any of the characters I met during the story they were indeed very memorable. \n\n\u2022\tMemorable endings, both the good endings and the bad endings were so very memorable, but the bad endings that I have done actually had me tearing up.\n\nCons. \n\n\u2022\tRepetitive music.\n(Although it wasn\u2019t an issue to me, I know there is definitely someone out there who thinks the same music is too receptive and how they would much rather have a different song playing, but it I don\u2019t think it will affect the story or game for you.)\n\n\u2022\tChoice bug where if you clicked anywhere it would pick the top choice.  \n(It stopped after I loaded my save thankfully, I just wanted to bring it up and also it only happened once for me so it shouldn\u2019t be that big of a problem as long as you save.)  \n\n\u2022\tMade me have sad feels.\n(Warning if you are emotional you will get sad during the bad endings and in some parts in the story.)\n\n\nFavorite character: The Main character was my favorite character. \uf04a\n\nMy rating on the game, 10/10, it made me feel a whirlwind of emotions which few games do.  I hope I was helpful and I didn't give you too much info that it would ruin the experience because it's much better to experience the game firsthand and hopefully I wasn't too long, I just had a lot of things to say about this game.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1511909165, "timestamp_updated": 1511909165, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37913299": {"recommendationid": "37913299", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133717651", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 376, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511968353}, "language": "german", "review": "A really beautiful novel, design and characters. - I can only say, wonderful work!", "timestamp_created": 1511907152, "timestamp_updated": 1511907152, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37907508": {"recommendationid": "37907508", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119686433", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 839, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512096150}, "language": "english", "review": "I've only played through Rods route so far and loved it !

This is not a choose your own adventure novel or one of those games with a large, dizzying array of choices. This is a visual novel with clearly defined paths that walk you down a story. The choices, while deciding the ending, don't really alter much. This is one of those Visual Novels that are more novel than game. That is not bad, in fact I quite enjoy such things, however, it is not for everyone. \n\nCriticism wise my biggest issue is the bad ends. They feel kinda tacked on. As stated above this could be more looked at as a series of short stories about the same characters where events play out differently. It feels to me as if the choices and the dual endings for each route were forced in to make it more game like. This is mostly because the bad ends could have been much more. I dearly wish they had done an epilogue for the bad ends. Even if Rod's curse failed to be broken in time, in his route Em and Lucette got closer so there could have been an epilogue about them seeking comfort from one another and becoming true sisters. Etc. Long story short, don't expect much from the bad ends. They could have been so much more, but instead they just end and leave you wondering about what would happen next.\n\nThe second criticism has been brought up in other reviews, but it can be a trick at times to tell when Lucette is thinking to herself or speaking aloud. Not a big deal since it can be easily figured out from the scene as a whole, but a bit annoying nevertheless.\n\nWhat it does well is making Lucette a complex character. Boy, did I hate her during the prologue. If this were a longer game they likely could have made the prologue start earlier, during her childhood, to give you a better feel for her instead of doling out the relative bits as dream sequences through out. That said how they did it does work very well form a literary point of view, it is just that the first bit can be really offputting for some folks who don't want to read about someone like what Lucette was at the start.\n\nMusic is great. It is too bad the digital art book doesn't come with a nicely formatted OST for us. \n\nArtwork is. . . Ok. There are times when the art is just a bit wonky. For example during Rumpel's kiss scene his arm is going through Lucette's shoulder. However, the art does what it needs to do, even if the style may not be for everyone or if there are odd bits here and there. Plus, free game. The art is really good for that production value.\n\nIn the end I highly recommend this game. There are things I wish were done differently, but nothing is perfect or so they say. Still, I can't help but wonder what the result would have been if this were a true kinetic novel, a visual novel where you have no choices. Instead of choosing a partner we could follow Lucette as she sought help from all the members. It just always felt to me like each route here was missing something since it was so short. We skip so much time, time that could have displayed other interactions she had. Of course pure kinetic novels tend to get a poor rap at times, but they can be so beautiful and I think this had the potential to pull that off.", "timestamp_created": 1511718841, "timestamp_updated": 1511718841, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508929", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37693233": {"recommendationid": "37693233", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118634348", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496716915}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best otome/visual novels I've ever played.

If for some reason you're not already playing it and you're an otome fan what are you even doing. Install it, get going. \n\nFor real the only thing I can find it in me to complain about is the opening song, that's it. I just thought that was lackluster. And if a skippable song is the only thing I can complain about you're doing something right. \n\nAs a summary, all the love interests and side characters are interesting. Each route stands out on its own and who you go for does have an effect on the story. It isn't just some lazy copy pasting. In fact, one character's route in particular really turns the tables. The art and writing is wonderful and despite my complaint about the opening theme, the rest of the score, is really really good, especially the main title music. \n\nFor any newbies going into this I highly suggest not playing Fritz's route last. Just don't do it, save yourself the suffering and play literally any other character last.

Not that I'm complaining, but it is seriously that good. The story is well written, the characters are interesting and fun, and the entire premise of the game is very different from the typical 'you're a high school girl looking for love' story that so many visual novels like this are. The music and art are beautiful as well, so that's a major plus.\n\nThe only thing negative I have to say(which isn't really negavite, depending on your own perspective) is this game does have a \"cannon route.\" If you are looking for a game where all of the characters live different lives and the stories don't tie into each other, you wouldn't like this one very much. All of the guys have questions come up in their routes that are answered by other routes, so playing a route out of order will leave you having answers to questions you haven't asked yet. Since I was SUPER in love with Waltz at the very beginning, as soon as I got his route I played it. That ruined a lot for me since I had yet to play Rumpel's or Fritz' routes yet.\n\nIn case you haven't read the About section, from playing the game I learned that the routes, according to the story, should be played in this order:\n\nRod > Karma > Rumpel > Fritz > Waltz", "timestamp_created": 1510622795, "timestamp_updated": 1510622795, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36501821": {"recommendationid": "36501821", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126701202", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 820, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510628458}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful visual novel, artwork and style is amazing along with an interesting plot and gorgeous soundtrack.\nI am still pacing myself through each character ending but I'm enjoying every minute of it. \nIncredible for a 'free to play' game.", "timestamp_created": 1510617958, "timestamp_updated": 1510617958, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36492127": {"recommendationid": "36492127", "author": {"steamid": "76561198191787910", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2689, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510447908}, "language": "english", "review": "I must say this is the first time I've played an Otome game that immersed me into its world so deeply that I feel the need to leave a review. \n\nThe creators did a marvelous job in weaving an interesting story influenced by well-known fairytales and adding their own twist to them. The story itself drew me in, but what kept me glued to the screen, re-reading bits and pieces here and there, was the excellent writing that (in my opinion) is on par with some commercial games that huge development companies release. Each character - even the antagonists and the supporting cast - has something special to offer, which makes the journey all the more pleasant. \n\nThe main character is complex and as she likes to emphasize every so often, she's no damsel in distress. Her development is well-paced and reasonable and I couldn't help admiring her confidence and elegance with which she held herself. She made even questionable morals and choices sound justified with her wit. She is flawed but that only makes her even more likeable and real as she learns from her own mistakes.\n\nThe gentlemen that our Lucette can romance are not ideal nor are they brooding over their \"Difficult Past\". Each one of them has a story to tell from which a player can learn a thing or two (I definitely did). What makes the playthrough even more enjoyable and different is the fact that depending on which route you're currently on, the general ending plot varies slightly and at the same time finishes the story. Every route uncovers different facts that others may lack and I personally think it is important to play through all of them to have the best experience (and love all of them, cause they definitely deserve it), leaving the most rewarding and satisfying one for last (Waltz's). The supporting characters were also very charming and made me want them to have seperate routes just to befriend or get to know them and their stories better, which only shows that they had depth and were very well-written.\n\nThe BGM was beautiful, well-suited to the current situation or mood and not disturbing at all, smoothly easing emotions from the pit of my hollow being. Personally I would've prefered the Opening song to be in piano version, but it was still really pretty and well-done. The Ending one stole my heart, not even once did I skip it after finishing a route with a good ending and I found myself searching for it in the music section of the gallery.\n\nAs for the art, it was breathtaking in all cases, be it the background, the CG's or the sprites. They were all very detailed, sometimes hilarious when it was needed, sometimes heartbreaking or full of happiness. Overall, my hungry eyes were satisfied, although sometimes the proportions or sharpness of certain features looked odd. However, the colours and designs made it all seem insignificant (I'm just picky about graphics, don't mind me).\n\nOverall, I fell in love with this story, its various characters, from villains to brooms, and wise and beautiful morals that stuck with me until now. \n\nI applaud the team at Dicesuki, for they made a masterpiece. Some of the developers could learn a thing or two from you ;)\n\nI look forward to the Fandisk and your future games. If I could, I would shower you with my nonexistent money.\n\nThank you for making it available to everyone <3\n\nAll the best,\nLemilia", "timestamp_created": 1510581640, "timestamp_updated": 1510581730, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36485991": {"recommendationid": "36485991", "author": {"steamid": "76561198176256861", "num_games_owned": 152, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1299, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498821137}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, far deeper storyline than I expected.", "timestamp_created": 1510551467, "timestamp_updated": 1510551467, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36483126": {"recommendationid": "36483126", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094426470", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 1833, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510534349}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow, this game blew me away.

I thought that this was going to be another visual novel will little detail and thought into it but OH BOY was i wrong!\n\nFor the people who has not yet played this game:\n\nThis game is about a girl named Lucette ( you can change her name if you want to ). She is a princess who gets a curse called \"the fairytale curse\" this curse causes everyone to forget her and she goes from riches to rags. She gets the curse because she is cold hearted and horrible to her new family. To break her curse she has to do 3 good deeds. She decides to partner up with someone to try and break her curse ( you can choose from Rod,Karma,Waltz,Fritz & Rumpel ) after partnering up with one of those characters many things happen and you grow closer to that character. Then you either get a good ending or a bad ending.\n\nNow back to the review! :D\n\nThe quality of this game is even better than a lot of visual novels that people have to pay for! I really think that this game deserves more recognition for how much love and effort this masterpeice took to make.\n\nAll the characters are super interesting and lovable, and the stories with these characters are breathtaking and it gets you hooked! ( for example ive been playing this game nonstop for the past week ) The characters make you think \"why do these guys not exist in real life?\". These boys are litteraly angels that has fallen from heaven! The bad endings are heartbreaking and i cried so much when i got them. Also the writing is specacular and while everything is happening you can feel their emotions!\n\nEvery single character is special in this game and they all have different personalities and backstories. All of them has their flaws and they learn grow and develop as a character. None of them are mary-sues and all of them has great character development and design.\n\nPersonally i love Rod's story the most because its very interesting to learn about him and its super fun to see how he starts to warm up to you through out the stoy and he is the most adorable thing in the world, he is like a tsudere which is super cute.\n\nThe artwork is something to die for! Being an artist myself im extremly pleased by the art style and i got inspired by it. The only problem i had with it was that sometimes they copy and pasted the eyes and it made the characters look like a goat with both eyes looking to different sides. Other than that the art was really detailed and beautiful!\n\nI think that the creator did a AMAZING job and that they really outdid themselves!

An overwhelmingly good one - enough so that I'm staying awake to write this when I really should be sleeping. I have done my best to keep spoilers out of this review.\n\nPositives:\n\nA whirlwind of emotions and compelling storytelling, this visual novel may very well rip your heart out in all the possible ways. I laughed, I cried (both in sadness and in joy), and I grinned ear to ear whenever something happened not just to the main character, but the characters around her. You see, with Cincerella Phenomenon, you don't realize you've fallen, not just for the main and her romantic interests, but also every single side character until you're cheering them on whenever they come on screen. I absolutely loved the characters - even the unpleasant ones - and that is a testiment to fantastic writing.\n\nThe writing itself, characters aside, was glorious. About halfway through the game (3/5 good endings unlocked) I spent an hour telling a friend about the lore of the story. Had I not spoiled it for them, they said they would have played simply for the story - and they do not play visual novels, much less otome games. Anyway, the story is so rich with bits of lore scattered throughout. You simply cannot only play one route - you have to do them all in order to understand everything. Typically when I play otome games I pick the guy I like best and only do one playthrough with him before tossing the game aside.\n\nNot this game. I binge-played it in 20 hours, unlocked all of the good endings (and one bad - the others I'm still working on), and am even planning to buy the digital artbook just to support the creators because this- was- fantastic. I literally could not stop playing this game because the story is so rich that I felt like I was reading a book.\n\nNegatives:\n\nMy negatives will likely not be too similar to those of the comments here that I have read. Cinderella Phenomenon touches on close to taboo topic(s) in certain areas (you will understand if you play it) but that wasn't what bothered me - if anything, I found the topic(s) interesting and would likely shove that up there in my positives section. No, what bothered me about Cinderella Phenomenon was a particular route that I will not go into too much detail with. I am trying to keep this spoiler-free, after all.\n\nAnyway... I enjoyed all of the routes, do not get me wrong, but there was one in particular that felt a little... \"mish-mashed.\" It is simultaneously my least favorite and favorite route. This route is not like the others and is messy, complicated, and feels ridiculously long in comparison to the other ones but it is the one that has the most feels (good or bad, I will leave that a mystery). As such I'm not sure if I can actually make this a true negative of the game, but it's the best I have got.\n\nCinderella Phenomenon was phenomenal and I eagerly look forward to more by this company.", "timestamp_created": 1509958106, "timestamp_updated": 1509958106, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36316179": {"recommendationid": "36316179", "author": {"steamid": "76561198294339164", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 850, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510034811}, "language": "english", "review": "I must say, that this is a very well-written visual novel with decent graphics. \nI personally enjoy fairy tale retolds and enjoy reading visual novels, and read some great reviews regarding this, and it has definitely met my expectations (much better than some games/VNs where you need to pay) and then some!\n\nEven though the main character only concentrates to break her curse, I loved to see that she slowly changed into a better person without realizing it herself.

Can someone who has closed off her heart be able to do good deeds? Can we trust others? Lucette or our protagonist faces these questions and more.\n\nIt's a masterpiece of storytelling. The five story routes tie in together. Even the side characters are well fleshed out - most of them are dynamic and round characters. There are lots of surprises in store.\n\nUnlike other Otomes games, Lucette or our protagonist (you can change her first name), has a personality. Instead of wish fulfillment, the game tells a story as we join Lucette on her and her friends' journey.\n\nPlay this for the story. The game play is the usual for a Ren'Py visual novel. There's even a right choice indicator to show you which choice scores a point with the character. Outside of getting the Guided by Intuition achievement once, with the right choice indicator, this is a pretty easy game if you invest time in it.\n\nThe programming and execution is top-notch. There are barely any bugs and the game is gorgeous. \n\nRather than a translation of Japanese, this is a full blown English language and culture story. It's so satisfying to see them do curtsies and English mannerisms and values. (I've read too many Chinese Imperial Court stories and Japanese stories by then). Finally, a good Otome game in English based on English culture.\n\nThis is THE English language Otome/Visual Novel I never realized I was waiting for. How is this free?! I'm surprised this is only Dicesuki's 2nd published game. Thank you too to the Kickstarter backers that made the game even more gorgeous!

I really enjoyed Karma's route. I would have quit the story if I played Rod's route first. I suggest getting the guided by intuition achievement in Rod's route. [spoiler] Karma and Rumpel hate being flirted at. So if it's your first time at otomes or if you use common sense, you'll only get a bad ending on their routes.[/spoiler]\n\n> Play Fritz's route fourth. It's got a lot of drama/revelations that may make the other three routes pale. But it can get depressing. You do NOT want to play this route last.\n\n> Play Waltz's route last. I suggest getting the good ending first. Once the good ending chapter starts, save, don't finish it yet. Go get the bad ending and watch it. Only after then, watch the good ending. May it satisfy you ^_~\n\nThe route you pick also fleshes out certain side characters. It's a fun bonus\n[spoiler]\nRod -> Emelaigne, Viorica - I dub this the Emelaigne route! Care for Emelaigne, and you'll have the key to Rod's heart ^_~\n\nKarma -> Jurien and Garlan, plus crossdressing and sword fighting\n\nRumpel -> Parfait, Bria, plus healing and the fastest way to kill a person\n\nFritz -> Delora, Varg, Mythros -> You'll get to see all the suffering Hildyr wants to unleash. You'll really get to know Delora in this story.\n\nWaltz -> I dub this the Lucette route. She'll finally know the truth about her father and mother in this route. Care for Lucette's development, and Waltz will open up to you. We finally get to see her use magic!

Each route is very well-written, and it's fun to see how Lucette gets along with her chosen partner. The central theme of the game is also very original, seeing curses that are based off of Fairytales.\n\nI also love the fact that Lucette is not your typical Otome protagonist. Instead of being a blank slate, Lucette has personality and starts out with a frigid heart. As you progress through each route, you get to see her character develop to a warmer personality. The reactions of all the guys when they see her smile for the first time is always fun to see, and you'd likely have a similar reaction when you see it; it's a very nice smile.\n\nEvery guy has a unique personality, from your tsundere stepbrother, to a crossdressing and secretive man, to a nearly shameless flirt, to your personal knight, to the mysterious child street magician. I must say that I really like Waltz' route in particular for several reasons. He's enjoys giving puppet shows to children, is very protective of Lucette, knows how to do magic [spoiler]due to him being a witch trained under Lucette's mother, the Tenebrarum Bearer, and is Lucette's childhood friend.[/spoiler] Let's not forget how adorable he is while he's cursed, as well as when he blushes.\n\nI've already finished all the routes, and I just can't stop replaying each one. Although I've already seen all the good endings, I'm reluctant to get the bad ones. I purchased the digital artbook recently, and the bad end CGs are rather heart-wrenching. I will warn anyone who plays this game to watch out for such moments, because when you reach them, you'll likely have to reach for a box of tissues.\n\nOverall, Cinderella Phenomenon is a very nice Visual Novel/Otome game to pick up if you have never done so before. It's completely free, so there's no harm is trying it out. Also, I heard a fandisk will be released sometime soon, either by the end of the year or early next year, so keep a lookout for that. I'm extremely excited to get it, and hope to get closure for the routes then. I recommend that you head to Dicesuki's official tumblr account after playing, since they sometimes give answers to little bits of trivia and some further insight into the personalites of the main cast. I don't usually get this excited for these kind of games, but I'm glad to say that this one has rekindled my interest. I hope that when you play this, you'll feel the same way.

This is worth playing and pressumably any sequel this team does will be worth a follow up. \n\nThe game is high quality. I wish that there was at least one female romance option because that's always fun,  but the love interests were varied enough that I wanted to do more than just one play through and see what happens.\n\nMy only real complain is that IF you make more than I believe one wrong choice, out of maybe 15 or 20 choices (?) you automatically do not get your path's good ending. So you play and play and everything is going great, then all of a sudden, a bad ending. Not sure if that was the best employment of the interaction system. Essentially, there is no indication you are going to get a bad ending other than that crystal that flashes, because the entire game plays along the same path, without the flexibility of you expressing your choices through your character.

I'd just play my favorite character and be done with it. In Cinderella Phenomenon, I have a legitimate drive to want to complete each route for all the available bachelors, not only because all of the stories are very well connected and intertwined, but because each one of them has something unique to offer. The fairy tale theme lends itself extremely well to this. All of the characters, main characters and side characters, were likeable, well rounded, and interesting. The game gives you the opportunity to get to know several who otherwise might have simply blended into the background.\n\nWhat I really appreciated about this game was also the writing of the main character/heroine, who is extremely effective in the story the game is trying to tell. There's nothing shallow or empty about her, you honestly feel connected to the character while playing her. She manages to be a strong female lead who doesn't have to compromise her feelings or personality for the sake of pleasing any of the bachelors. That was incredibly refreshing to see. \n\nOverall, I definitely would recommend this game to anyone looking for a sweet, interesting little story (with a price that's unbelievable-- you can't really beat it, haha).

The storyline is well written and gets you gripped so quickly, the characters and their development throughout the story makes you love them all so quickly (even one of the antagonists, if you can call him that in the end). \nHere's my pros and cons of the game and my overall thoughts and feelings:\n\n[b] Pros: [/b]\n- Storyline is well written, it's an intriguing story which develops well and clears everything up at the end of Waltz' route so there's no confusion. The recommended route order is on their store page (Rod, Karma, Rumpel, Fritz then Waltz). This order is best as you learn the entire story with no gaps by the end. Plus you can't do Fritz or Waltz' routes without doing 2 endings first.\n- Character development was on point in my opinion. I loved Waltz the moment I first spotted him reading this story, I knew his route would be my favourite and it was, closely followed by Rod! You learn everything about the characters and even a considerate amount of their backstory to understand them better as a person, it makes you feel like you're part of the story developing with them.\n- Art design, I personally think the design is beautiful although there are minimual background changes and they're repetitive but that didn't matter much to me as the story had me gripped more than the backgrounds. Each character is unique with their own style, they're beautifully drawn.\n- Music. The music used in the visual novel really set the mood for what was happening or what was about to happen or simply for how your character is feeling. They set the moods perfectly for me.\n- Routes, however only having 2 endings, good and bad. They don't fail on the emotional side of them, Rod's and Karma's bad endings had me crying like a baby but I enjoyed them nonetheless\n\n[b] Cons: [/b]\n- Lack of choices. There is only 3 choices per chapter (chapters 1-9) there is a chapter 10 however that's just the finale so it's pure reading until the credits.\n- Routes, as it is a pro it is also a con in my opinion. Simply because the bad endings aren't very long, they're short and simple which kinda sucks. The longest bad ending is Waltz' but it's still very short in comparison to the good ending.\n\n[b] Overall: [/b]\nI loved the reading, it was fun and enjoyable. I honestly couldn't put it down, I was stuck at my laptop reading it non-stop until I'd finished everybody's endings. It was happy and sad, gets the waterworks going when the worst happens but it's still so amazing. It's free so why not give it a go? For a free read it sure will leave you pleased and if you're not, well you didn't waste cash, just your time so don't complain too much (it could be a lot worse).\nIf you do decide to give this a go then I do recommend following the route recommendation on the store page: [b] Rod, Karma, Rumpel, Fritz then Waltz [/b] because it will fill in ALL the blanks by the end of Waltz' route.\nEnjoy and happy reading!\n", "timestamp_created": 1509168769, "timestamp_updated": 1509168769, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36038436": {"recommendationid": "36038436", "author": {"steamid": "76561198196350615", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509097868}, "language": "english", "review": "i cant belive that this game was free! such a well written story", "timestamp_created": 1509097912, "timestamp_updated": 1509097912, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36025528": {"recommendationid": "36025528", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114565080", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1728, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510015673}, "language": "english", "review": "I absolutley loved this game.

Its sheer length alone, minimum twelve hours gameplay, is admirable for a free VN - and it isn't long, nor wordy, for the sake of extending the experience.\n\nWhat did I like?\n\nThe protagonist is really likeable and relatable. Her situation is very much exaggerated, but I think there exists a little bit of Lucette in everyone. Even in the beginning, when her character is very one-dimensional, you instinctively know that there's more to her than meets the eye and you want to learn more. I think one of the things the writers did best with this our Cinderella is how she matures DIFFERENTLY on each route, based on the things she's experienced. \n\nThe love interests are varied and there's something for everyone here. Can't go into too much details without spoilers, but every route is unique.\n\nThe choices aren't obvious; it isn't painfully obvious what is the \"right\" choice. This VN actually offers a right choice indicator, which I did not use for my first playthrough, as I play a lot of VNs and figured I could easily trigger the good ending. I failed three consecutive times before turning it on. Telling your love interest what you think they want to hear isn't always the best choice; sounds like real life, doesn't it?\n\nThe amount of work put into the aesthetics of this game is praiseworthy. The game has a full soundtrack, which I believe was composed for the game, and at no point during the story does the music not step up to match it. Most of the songs are short instrumental clips, but they do the job properly. The art is plentiful: each character route has 10+ CGs, and there are 20+ common CGs. And, more importantly, the art is gorgeous--this goes for characters as well as backgrounds, which to me is often overlooked in VNs.\n\nThe different routes tie into one another very well. Just because you picked romantic interest A does not mean that B, C, D, and E disappear. They're all interwoven into one another's fairytale journeys. This is also very important to me, as I believe it makes the game much more believable and submersive.\n\nWhat didn't I like?\n\nThis is the only free VN I know of to include a theme song and theme song animation. The animation is nothing to write home about (features very little original art not already seen in the VN), which is fine; but the song is HORRIBLE. The singer sounds like he was recovering from a loss of voice when he recorded it. It's scratchy, off-key, flat (in the musical sense). It would have been much better to omit it completely than to include it in the game.\n\nThe writing isn't very balanced. I feel like some routes got way more attention than others. There's one route in particular where the romantic interest is literally absent for half of the entire route. In certain routes, I could feel our Cinderella falling in love and I was falling in love too. In others, I had to go \"What?\" as dramatic changes just kind of occurred without rhyme or reason.\n\nThe writing is a bit too formulaic. Every route has a set number of chapters, with a set number of choices in each chapter. It was also a little bothersome that you needed to make no more than two wrong choices, out of 27-30 total, to trigger the good ending for each character. And even this seems to be somewhat random: I tested it with three different romantic interests, and made exactly three wrong choices in each of their routes. I triggered the bad ending in only two out of the three. So not too balanced. \n\nCertain characters are far too cliche. I understand that fairytales are a fundamental theme to this VN, and thus it makes sense for a love interest's route to align with their particular fairytale. However, just because a person is put under a curse that relates to a fairytale does not mean that person automatically transforms into the one-dimensional character from said fairtyale. Also, I found that only certain curses required the one cursed to reflect and grow as a person (for example, there's one curse that's broken by finding an object). It's impossible to discuss this in detail without irreparably spoiling the story, and probably some people will disagree with me on this point. That's fine. Play for yourself, and see.\n\nAsymmetrical character development - relates to my last point as well. Certain characters have their past shown in great detail whereas others barely get a one sentence mention. Certain characters are flawed, but are redeemed or at least are given an explanation, and are given a chance at sympathy. But other characters (the most important being the primary antagonist) stay the same the entire time, and it really destroyed the story for me as I completed more routes and got a better understanding of the overall world and situation. It's not up to the writers how their audience feels about the characters, but every character should at least have a chance at making the audience feel something. And especially when someone as important as the primary antagonist is sidelined, it sucks. In fact, most of the antagonists suffer from this. In a game that is literally about fairytales misleading and corrupting people into thinking good is only good and bad is only bad, it's horrible to not give the antagonists a fair representation. It undermines the whole story.\n\nConclusion:\n\nI did thoroughly enjoy Cinderella Phenomenon, and I will be remembering it for a long time to come. It's definitely one of the best VNs I've ever experienced - in certain areas. However, I do feel that this game has certain flaws that cannot be ignored, and that keep it from being as good as it could be.

It was cool to see her grow, but I feel like there was so much time in the beginning showing how cruel of a person she is that made me NOT want to help break her curse. That in itself didn't really encourage me to continue playing the game, but I did because a friend recommended the game to me.\n\nI played through Rod's route, because Rumpel is an annoying womanizer, and Karma ... I wanted to play through Karma's route, but I disliked their art. We're introduced to Karma as a Beautiful Woman, but I thought Karma was easily the least attractive character. So I played Rod's route, because honestly he was cute. I couldn't really believe that I could win Rod over, and I sort of didn't even want to. Rod comes in saying that life is better without Lucettex. Of course it is! She's a binch! Rod's family deserves to be happy without her. I didn't want to disrupt that, but I wanted to get to Waltz' route, so I went ahead with Rod's story.\n\nRod's route didn't make sense to me. There were some choices that seemed pretty similar, but you only got points if you chose one of them. Sometimes the choices were inconsistent: Sometimes you don't get points if you choose the option that's more confrontational; sometimes you DO get points if you choose the option that's more confrontational. I found myself saying, \"What!\" when I chose the nicer option and didn't get a diamond; then loaded a save and chose the more confrontational option and then Rod would blush and the diamond would appear. You started off not liking when I was more brash; and now you like it? What do you want from me!\n\n[SPOILERS] I was very dissatisfied with Rod's ending. I thought it was going to end with Delora giving Lucettex an option to be a princess again but she wouldn't be able to be with Rod; or stay as a maid and be with Rod. And the best ending is to choose to stay a maid because you realize that Rod's family is happier without you, and now you get to be with Rod. But?? Instead you become a princess and sneak out with Rod every once in a while to be with him? And Rod's sister and mom are OK with that? That doesn't make sense. Also that's not an ending to a story; that's a beginning of another one. They can't possibly be satisfied with living a life in secret... again! Also there was no resolution to Lucettex's relationship with her father or the commonfolk. And what happened to Fritz? He turns into Varg, doesn't he? But what happens to Varg? The last we saw of Mythros was that he's stuck in an ice sculpture, but ... what happens after that?? Did I miss some text somewhere? If so, then that's totally my bad. But if those loose ends were never tied up, then... [END SPOILERS]\n\nAfter I was done with Rod's route, I said OK, now I can finally do Waltz' route. He's cute. And nice. So I started going through it again. The new Fast Forward feature I unlocked brought me into a debug mode of the game or something? A weird screen where I had the option to ignore the problem and continue forward... so I did? And instead of hitting Fast Forward this time, I just sped up the text. And that's when I realized just how much text there was just setting up the story and grounding me into hating Lucettex. I don't think there should be [i]this much[/i] exposition. I also realized that Lucettex is a janitor for such a short period of time if you chose Rod's route? So short a time that it really didn't even need to be included in Rod's route.\n\nThen I realized that I needed to complete SOMEONE ELSE'S ROUTE BEFORE UNLOCKING WALTZ' ROUTE! At this point, I gave up. I don't really want to look at Karma, and I think I'd be too annoyed at Rumpel's route. And I'd just be annoyed at Lucettex the entire time. All of this is not worth playing Waltz' route, which might be just as disappointing as Rod's route anyway.\n\nOK. So that's all the narrative stuff.\n\nIn terms of art, I like the cutscene art, but the in-game art during dialogue looks flat and is considrerably not as pretty as the cutscene art. \n\nThe music is good! I found it stuck in my head after hours of playing the game. I did catch it stop its loop once, though, if you let the game sit there for a bit, so I know it's not an [i]actual[/i] loop. I'm not a programmer so I don't know how hard it is to loop audio, but the programmer might want to change that.\n\nI do want to end this with saying that it is cool that pretty much one person made the whole game, the art, music, story, etc. That's very respectable!", "timestamp_created": 1508697246, "timestamp_updated": 1508697246, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.459512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35925634": {"recommendationid": "35925634", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090490309", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 37, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508683347}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a good game.", "timestamp_created": 1508690347, "timestamp_updated": 1508690347, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35910135": {"recommendationid": "35910135", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041377786", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1065, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508644076}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was amazing, especially considering it's free.

There is also the drawback that once you figure out the \"secret\" of the main character you can see a lot of the twists coming; which I mostly found when I played Rod's (1st) and Rumple's (3rd) routes.\nThe story can get quite boring for some characters where I wouldn't want to play-through them again.

I would recommend this for a first time VN-reader.\n\nMy route order: Rod > Karma > Rumpel > Fritz > Waltz. I can\u2019t choose a favourite!\n\nCinderella Phenomenon is a 100 percent free visual novel with a female protagonist. It took me approximately 19 hours to complete all the routes, keeping in mind that I skipped content I had already read and didn\u2019t start from the beginning for every route. This leaves approximately 4 hours for each route, which seems accurate.\n\nThe novel has a pretty interesting and original take on the concept of fairytales, witches, and fairies. The good endings aren\u2019t truly one hundred percent \u201cgood\u201d and not quite a happily ever after \u2013 good people unavoidably die, no matter what you do, or perhaps [i]because[/i] of what you do. Nonetheless, the VN has a good storyline with an endearing message and competently written characters. The main heroine has a real personality as opposed to simply being a self-insert doormat, and she has her own agency. All the other characters, including the male love interests, have varying amounts of depth to them that make them thoughtfully crafted.\n\nThere are 5 love interests and 10 endings: one bad and one good ending for each guy. Every route is told in 10 chapters, wherein only the final chapter actually changes based on whether or not you have a good or a bad ending. Overall, the biggest problem with Cinderella Phenomenon is that in the end, choices don\u2019t feel like they truly matter. The VN would benefit from a couple more bad endings earlier in the storyline. In addition, there are no true branching paths. You will do the same things and achieve the same overall outcome no matter what choice you make, which begs the question of, why are there choices in the first place?\n\nThe requirements for achieving a good ending are a little too strict. If you deviate even one answer from the guide, you will obtain a bad ending, no matter what choice it was. Case in point: I played the game blind for Rod\u2019s playthrough, and obtained the bad ending even though, after looking at the guide, I could see only two or three of my choices deviated from the given path. You are shoehorned in a particular role and personality \u2013 telling Rod off or being honest with him at certain parts of the story is apparently the bad thing to do and will give you a ticket to the bad ending. That being said, it seems that making the wrong choices in chapter 9 doesn\u2019t matter \u2013 you need to go back a couple chapters in the storyline if you want to snag a bad ending without skipping through the entire novel from the very beginning. Starting the novel from the beginning isn\u2019t all that necessary, since, as stated, there are no branching paths and no matter your choice you will ultimately have the same outcome. Only a few lines of dialogue change here and there.\n\nBut don\u2019t let this dissuade you whatsoever. For a free product, Cinderella Phenomenon is honestly outstanding. Each route tells an [i]entirely[/i] different story. They were all enjoyable \u2013 I really cannot choose which route I liked the most, as they were all interesting and never felt boring or bloated with filler. The writing was competent and hardly ever came across as too amateurish, though there were scenes where I felt more appropriate words could have been selected. Cinderella Phenomenon\u2019s artwork is also rather high quality; despite some CGs being a little awkward looking, it\u2019s quite obvious the artist spent a lot of time and work on the art. The sprites are all fantastic, backgrounds are detailed, and most of the CGs are very pretty. There were a few scenes that I felt could have used a CG to bolster the impact of what was happening, but since this is a free work, I think that can be forgiven. Really, almost 20 hours of reading, depending on your speed, for [i]free[/i]\u2026\n\nOverall, Cinderella Phenomenon is definitely worth a look. It\u2019s free and has an interesting storyline\u2026you can't possibly go wrong with picking this VN up.

I can't stop playing it and already get 4 good endings at this point. Now I can say that this one is definitely my favorite one in this genre, and I feel I just have to write a positive review for this game to express my appreciation.\nThe graphics is overall fair, the music is great, and the plot, OMG, it's simply amazing and genuinely heart warming.\nEvery character has their own unique background, plot and dialogue, both the main ones and the supporting ones, and the player character, the princess herself, is also a very unique and intersting character, she has her full personality yet it  still feels natural to play the game through her, it's easy to understand her and to feel for her. \nI see some complaints about some of the characters not being someone's cup of tea, well, I guess it's a matter of personal preferences/tastes. Lucky for me, three out of five available bachelors in the game are exactly my type, my cup of tea... I GENUINELY fell in love for Rod, Fritz, and Waltz, and even feel sad when realizing the romance is only whihin the game and that I could not have more interactions with them after their endings is achivied... \nSo far, my favorite route is Rod and Waltz. Both are happy and heart warming endings. For Fritz, though I love him as a character, I do agree that his plot is not that good... it's kind of sad, heavy and tragic, and the romace part is sort of weak, but I guess it does fit the big picture, shows a typical ending when the princess choose to trust her mother's follower and revive her mother.\nAnyway, I certainly enjoy this game, A LOT, and I think I will always remember and cherish the great moments that I've experienced in this game...", "timestamp_created": 1507774836, "timestamp_updated": 1507774836, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35646030": {"recommendationid": "35646030", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045141591", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 1106, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507794015}, "language": "english", "review": "I recommend Cinderella Phenomenon to anyone that likes visual novels, which blends cuteness, magic, family, tragedy, and love. The game isn't really for those that want a big interactive experience. The meat of the game is you experiencing our little \"Cinderella\" (Called Cinderella in this review, you get to choose her name) going through the story, and occasionally you get to pick between a few dialogue options, some so similar you will have no clue why one leads to a bad ending and one to a good.\n\nI did very much enjoy the stories, and it did leave me both feeling awwww and at other times teary eyed. I still have some criticism, but because the game is overwhelmingly story-heavy, I will use spoiler for most of this review... So yeah, like visual novels you might like this game. If you want to read my rant about silly parts of the game read the spoiler parts.\n\n[u]Negatives[/u]\n[spoiler]So, the negatives out of the way first. It kind of hurts some of the stories, that Cinderella must have a romantic partner\u2026 I get that generally these kinds of games have a romantic subplot, but with the possibility of five storylines we could have some without the romance. Especially since it is (for me at least) is the weakest part of the story in some cases. I am not opposed to romance as a central point of some of the storylines. With Karma it felt like the core of the story and natural given the situation. Rampel and Waltz\u2019 weren\u2019t as necessary, but it added more than it took away to their stories. \nHowever, with Rod\u2026 I was far more interested in Cinderella\u2019s relationship with her step-sister and step-mother. I feel a step-family dynamic should have been the sole character focus of that story. I was also interested in her relationship with Rod as her step-brother\u2026 But then it got weird. I know that they are not blood related so they have a right to have feelings for each other, but it is still creepy that it is a happy ending that she \u201cromance\u201d her brother in secret. I mean really? Couldn\u2019t they just end up as friends? I felt it was much more interesting exploring the concept of a melded family.\nFritz\u2019\u2026 Okay, as a character (pre-curse) I actually think he was a good fit for Cinderella. But his whole romance plot coupled with his curse was WEIRD! Plus, here we got some of the best scenes (in my opinion) between Cinderella and Delora (witch who cursed Cinderella) and they had such a good dynamic. I\u2019m not sure what you would call it daughter-guardian? I want to see that! I want a happy mommy-daughter ending for those at the end of that story! Funny enough Fritz\u2019 storyline was the one where I cared the least about him, because the romance plot just turned out so bizarre. [/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler] Now onto the king. I had a massive problem with this character. Not because of him directly, but because everyone talks about him like is a good king. Look, he is a great person, a good step-father, a bad father, but a horrible king. He married an evil tyrant because a she threatened to kill the woman he loved. The action of a good person, but the action of a truly incompetent king. You can\u2019t put the life of one person over your kingdom. Then his incompetence leads him to surround himself with scheming advisors, one of which he was directly warned about. This man has no intuition or judge of character. A good king obvious can\u2019t know everything, but he needs to make sure his top advisors are competent in their field and loyal\u2026 \nThen the fact that he is a bad father\u2026 Seriously dude? Seventeen years and you have not once told your daughter you loved her? Her mother has been gone for four years, so you can\u2019t use her as an excuse. Even if she was distant (because you ignored her throughout childhood and didn\u2019t give obvious secret hints that you cared) would it have been so hard to just once pull her aside and say \u201cCinderella\u2026 you know that I love you right?\u201d Sure, it would be awkward, but seriously you literally look at beggars kindlier than her. That is not \u201cher being distant\u201d that is you being an a-hole. \nThen the multiple \u201cchoices that matter\u201d, sometimes they make sense other times it is just different words \u201cI want to help\u201d versus \u201cIs there anything I can do to help?\u201d How are you supposed to know which leads to a bad 10th chapter and which doesn\u2019t? Personally, I\u2019d say since the focus is mostly on the story and it is a more reading, just use one of the steam-guides if you want to be sure to see the happy ending(s). The focus is more on the story than the choices, and I don\u2019t feel like it takes anything away. \n\nI find it odd that some of the storylines sees the removal of ALL fairy tale curses as a good thing. Don\u2019t get me wrong some were cruel and underserved (Waltz and Fritz), but others lead to character growth including our Cinderella. Removing all the curses would prevent some from learning valuable lessons and grow as human beings. Cinderella, Karma, and Rumpel all leads to them becoming better versions of themselves. I am not sure where Rod fits, but he is certainly on the deserved it spectrum, since he did make a deal to get his curse, but I am not sure prince friendzone learned anything. (Which is also a reason his romance was weird even if it helped with breaking his curse) [/spoiler]\n\n[u]Positives:[/u]\n[spoiler]And with the negativity done for we go to the positives. It is nice to have five separate storylines, and it not simply being your romance partner that is different but the entire storyline that ends up diverging, even to the point of a different bad guy being on top at the climax of the story. \n\nI like that Cinderella wasn\u2019t cursed because she was evil or cruel. Even if Delora kind of says that at first. It is not so black and white. She was cursed because the witch believed she could break it, and that she could grow to be better and see the world as better, than what her mother taught her, and some of the humans taught her. Even if her mother is portraited as evil and removed some of her memories, it isn\u2019t stated that she implanted her with false memories, just took out certain good ones\u2026 So yeah, she hasn\u2019t always been the luckiest girl. Other girls no longer wanting to play with her because she didn\u2019t want to \u201cshare\u201d her toys, after they didn\u2019t return the last ones she borrows them\u2026 Maids in her palace mocking her behind her back, because she talks more to her dolls than other people\u2026  Her dad never openly showing affection to her while the mother is still alive (and barely showing it four years after) \u2026 Whenever she goes into town everyone sends her dirty looks and judge her based on her mother\u2019s actions. I mean it is horrible, but it is nice that even though the story is about thawing her heart, it isn\u2019t like the people around her were always nice. \n\nHer stepsister was genuinely nice, but there we have some dynamics of her not trusting her intentions. Which is also part of other nobles being very secretive and wearing fake smiles in the kingdom, and despising her father showing more open affection towards the \u201cfake daughter\u201d than his real one. Adding more complexity to Cinderella rather than just being mean. And it is nice that it is first when she starts seeing her stepsister at her worst (or at least more flawed than usual) that she starts to open up to her and relate to her.\n\nThe negative rants are a lot longer than the positives, but it is just generally easier to rant about negative points, especially with an overall positive experience. I could list off many more great moments with Mr. Broom, Doll-Delora, some of the more memorable and/or adorable good deeds that Cinderella performs, but I bet you would rather experience those, as well as some of the sad moment, for yourself. [/spoiler]\n\nSo yeah, hope you will enjoy the game, and end up thinking way too hard on some of the elements. Like I did.\n\n[u]Edit Note:[/u]\nNomination: \"Choices Matter\" I nominated it for this 2017 award because all the different romance options alter the story.", "timestamp_created": 1507752911, "timestamp_updated": 1511446104, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.677473", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35610849": {"recommendationid": "35610849", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153985367", "num_games_owned": 368, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 809, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508099458}, "language": "english", "review": "This free visual novel was much more satisfying than many of the ones that I've purchased.

Wheras here, she is strong and can take care of herself, she dosen't let people use her and she stands up for herself if one of the love interests are being inappropriate towards her. I just love how every relationship in this novel has the man and the woman respect each other and both are EQUAL to each other. \n~ Every single choice you make determins the route you ultimately end up with which I love. Not to mention there are also twists that are both positive and negative. \n~ I love how each love interest's curse is based upon a fairy tale, including the main protagonist as I grew up with them. \n\nCONS\n....Honestly there are non for me personally....if I really had to well, maybe in some moments the story tends to drag on a bit and the bad endings really break my heart but other than that, it's perfect.

I especially like the MC, Lucette. It is interesting to play as a character who is hated by seemingly everyone and who seems to hate everyone as well.

Now a thing that i REALLY LOVED in this game was the passage of time, it makes the history a lot more emersive because we know that a person can't change in one week but in a year things start to change, it also gives the love interest scenes a lot more cute and lovey dovey air.\nThe other thing that i liked also it's that the creator it's not \"family friendly\" if someone need's to die, they die, that's it! No such thing as \"My magic can bring them back from the death\" bullshit. \nIt's realistic, it's free and truly it's one of the best otome games i've played.

I enjoyed each and single route. The writing is good, each route differs and it's a whole new experience, I really admire Icesuki for this work. Even in otomate there has been games where different character routes are just Ctrl C + Ctrl V or routes that has been just plain boring. However Cinderella Phenomenon really had me focusing on each and every route despite them not being my favourite.\n\nThe only issue I have is how the CG differs a lot from the sprite, I understand that art requires a lot of effort and beside, it is a free game so I should not complain, however I feel that the game will be much more remarkably stunning if the artwork remains constant.\n\nFurthermore, some writing seem slightly iffy. I was not able to feel much for Mythos, Hildyr or Ophelis and her family. The game did not go in depth into their backstory. It was really iffy how the King is still able to love Lucette despite everything, it was not really well-explained. Same goes for Ophelis, her love was seperated from her for so long, and yet she is able to just put on a smile and accept everything.\n\nI really feel that the game will be a much more touching and wonderful experience if they add in various detailed backstory.\n\nOverall, I feel that Cinderella Phenomenon is a really really good game. I was very surprised that it is free to play.

Now usually in otome/harem games the main character is disappointingly bland. Maybe they'll have particular trait or quirk if you're lucky, but usually they're kept as more or less a blank state so that the player can fully project himself/herself on them. Not here! Lucette has her very own concrete, dinstinct personality, and the game is not concerned about making it a palatable one. In fact she starts the game as an ice cold, condescending and distant princess, and yet despite how off-putting that sounds it's actually not that hard to feel sympathy for her. She has reasons reasons for acting the way she does, with a background of emotional abuse that is slowly revealed, and her struggle to become a better person is a genuine one.\n\nAnd it's precisely Lucette's character development through the game that made this such a unique experience for me. Again, in these kind of games I'm used to making choices based solely on whether the character I'm romancing will approve or not. Who cares if it's not something I agree with, or if it makes the main character ping pong through radically different opinions like a crazy person? The goal is to achieve romance, and by god I will ruthlessly and pragmatically manipulate emotions and situations like a freaking sociopath to achieve that goal! \n\nBut in [b][i]Cinderella Phenomenon[/i][/b], my motive was placed not on other characters but on Lucette herself.  Each choice was for her benefit, to see how she would react and what she would think, to see if she could truly change her ways. It's easy to get invested in her and understand her, since we're privy to her inner thoughts and chains of logic, and there's something very heartwarming about witnessing her slow but true growth as a person. In the end she turns out to be a very remarkable character, with a surprising amount of agency and drive, and she is by far my favourite part of the game.\n\nOf course this is still an otome game, so there's got to be some romance. And the available Love Interests are indeed well-crafted and fun to interact with [spoiler](tho some are much more fun than others *cough*Karma*cough*)[/spoiler] but thankfully there's equal attention paid to the plot too. LIke in all good visual novels the routes are interconnected, with each playthrough adding more and more details to the bigger picture, and there's quite a bit of action and suspense too. By the time I finished all routes I was blown away by how much fun and excitment I ended up having!\n\nI was also impressed by the production values, which were excellent. The art, while a step below professional, was very nice to look at, and I particularly loved the character designs as well as their various expressions. The UI was also slick and pretty, and the music beautiful and appropriate to each scene. The writing was of course top-notch. As for the playtime, I clocked a very respectable 15 hours playing all five routes, and spent a few extra hours replaying and getting all endings/achievements. Not bad for a free game!\n\nAnd it's honestly unbelieavable to me that [b][i]Cinderella Phenomenon[/i][/b] is available for free. The game is brimming with quality, and it definitely deserves to be noticed for it. It was a joy to play, and I for one am eagerly awaiting whatever new games this developer team will bring us in the future.", "timestamp_created": 1505146736, "timestamp_updated": 1505146736, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.784025", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34882342": {"recommendationid": "34882342", "author": {"steamid": "76561198225007576", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 978, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513492792}, "language": "english", "review": "Dear jesus I love this game.

They are not going to ask you for money to get some item, time or etc. I would like to pay for it. But at the credits, there is a list of  kickstarter backers. My guess is they collect money through kickstarter to make this game possible and when they finish it, they didn't find suitable to sell  it for this reason. This is my second otome game after long while. I find them highly addictive and am trying to play as less as possible. I have works to do unfortunately T_T \n\nAt the beginning this game, you're learning the story behind the game through intro. The background was pretty convincing for me that did a good job on detailing it. After a short history lesson, you're starting from your character's point of view which is the princess of Angielle. So, because this Fairytale curse, which has been explained during intro, she went from riches to rags and she has to do three good deeds to break her curse. You can get help from five different love interest to break your curse. You choose your path after a common playthrough. \n\nBut you're still making some decisions in this common path that might effect your ending. This game has right choice indicator and when you choose something right, a crystal appears on right upper corner of the screen. If you keep them in mind you can get the right path without any trouble. But, this will prevent you getting the badge \"Guided by Intuition\".\n\nThis game has pretty straightforward and have one good and one bad ending unlike to Amnesia that I played before. If you choose the option that your love interest favors you're leading good ending and if not here comes the bad ending. I need to state I was pretty good with finding the bad endings. Thank god there are several walkthroughs. \n\nThe most interesting thing in this game is how they embedded fairy tales into the context and to the endings. I would like to emphasize how good they were again. The artwork was kinda different for me, sometimes I find it unpleasant sometime pleasing. I'm more used to manga type lines. Music was nice but sometimes too repetitive. The storylines were nice and smooth. Every character has some depths to some extent and their character was consistent in every storyline. Which is very nice, you learn new things in every path you choose. This helps you to get the whole picture behind the story.\n\nWhat I like the most about the game is their fast forward option. I love them for it and thank you very much for this. When you want to see every possible option, it became a time saver.

Unlike other games, where you will either be railroaded along one and only one path with minute deviations which serve mostly as illusions of choice, or where you will be given a heavily branched tree of possibilities with great influence over it and the ability to achieve all the available goals of the game, this one takes a completely different approach.\n\nNear the very beginning of the game, you are required to choose between 5 possible paths (2 are locked until you have completed 2 of the first 3 paths open to you). Any choices you make are still contained within the path you've chosen, and each of these 5 paths rolls out a completely different development of the same story.\n\nWhat's interesting about this is that, because of that, you do not really find out all the information you need to piece the entire story (though you might guess some of it yourself along the way, with the foreshadowing provided here and there) unless you take more than one of these paths. This really brings plenty of reasons to the table to replay the game, moreso because each different development also means the end differs significantly. Besides whom you may end up with,\n [spoiler]some characters will die in some of these paths that survive in other paths.[/spoiler]\n\nAll the same, I must admit it's a little bit sad that you can't achieve all of the good goals in the game; some of the endings are brighter than others, but that's also part of the way fairytales go, so I guess it's still good.\n\nDefinitely recommended, especially since it's free.

It's so good I would have been glad to throw money at it. \n\nThe title of the game, art style and premise intruiged me - it certainly did not look or feel like your typical otome/visual novel game. From what I have seen and experienced of this genre, as well as the opposite )whatever the name is - male lead with lots of females, usually in a school) everybody and everything is shallow or annoying, or even outright disturbing and creepy (or all three at once).\n\nNot this. This is beautiful, damn interesting and heartfelt. I never expected the plot to be so intruiging, deep or mysterious as it became (very quickly). It keeps you guessing and even wracking your brains at points trying to figure out the issues plaguing the male love interest you choose before your character does. You have to really pay attention to what's being said along with the narration by your character in order to slowly but surely piece the puzzles together, and even then the story will almost definitely pull a very interesting twist you weren't expecting. It's brilliant.\n\nI love how the characters' stories are woven into one another, so that you're never just stuck with your character and the chosen love interest the whole time if you have chosen to see their story through, and so where you are and who you pick as your lover (and your choices) will impact others as well as your couple. It really gives a great deal more layers to the overarching story.\n\nAs far as the characters go, I love them all so far, even the ones I was sure I wasn't going to like. Testament to how clever and great the writing of this game is. They might rub you the wrong way at first, but when you get closer to them, you end up loving them and really get invested in them. That's why it broke my heart a little to get Rod's bad ending first (Rod's was the first route I played through) because I had gotten so invested in his story and I desperately wanted to save him and for him and my character to get together and Jesus the feels!\n\nNot going to ramble anymore - PLAY THIS GAME IT'S AMAZING!", "timestamp_created": 1504042603, "timestamp_updated": 1504042603, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34584913": {"recommendationid": "34584913", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128099907", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 368, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494791185}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a ridiculously good game.

The only thing I would ask to make this perfect is a Varg route. The big bad wolf deserves love :(\n\n\nThe music fits the mood. My favorite track would be Forgotten. I would actually like to grab some of them.\n\n\nI have mixed feelings for the art. The character portraits are very appealing but some of the CGs can be a miss. Like, I really really REALLY like Rod's character portrait, but he didn't look as good in his CGs :( The only guy I think that looked good both in portrait and all of his CGs is Waltz. I still love the art, just hope that some of the guys good looks were translated better in their CGs.\n\n\n\nThe story, especially for a free game, is very very good. I like the spin it gave to fairytales and it's also not afraid to break your heart. \n\n\nAnd last would be about Lucette. I really, really love her character. It was enjoyable to see her growth in every route. She's now in my best MC list :D\n\n\nOverall it's a great game. Can't wait for the fandisk. And if Dicesuki releases their next title as a paid title, I would be glad to throw all my money at them.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1503616408, "timestamp_updated": 1503616408, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34465104": {"recommendationid": "34465104", "author": {"steamid": "76561198378942967", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 658, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503949931}, "language": "english", "review": "At first I did not have high expectations of a free otome game, but DAMN,,  The characters, the music, the artstyle; all of it was amazing.

I think you all know, but sometimes life shuffles cards on your own destiny table. That's why our heroine was a princess, but it seemed to her that all around her lie and help the fairies she became an unknown girl. Having lost its own gonor and selfishness - a gemple turnaround is being dismantled, because the main heroes who were with you in the past, now relate to you as an outsider, which makes it possible to shape your image in a situation - to be a heroine - from a feminist to a chaste hostess, to choose for himself A couple of common people or princes. Find the true story and intrigue of the throne being only a maid. It is a pleasure that the choice has its poles both positive and negative with the death of the character of the ruth. From the negative I would have noticed the lack of figured faces in the background characters - it's wildly obstructing me as a player.\nGraphic design - 11/12\nMusic - 12/12\nPlot - 10/12\nOverall score 11/12 is a good ometem for free use\n\n\u0417\u043d\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u043a\u0443 \u043e \u0417\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0435? \u042f \u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u044e \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0435, \u043d\u043e \u0438\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u044b \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0443\u0434\u044c\u0431\u044b. \u0412\u043e\u0442 \u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0448\u0430 \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0438\u043d\u044f \u0431\u044b\u043b\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0446\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043e\u0439, \u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430\u043a\u043e \u0435\u0439 \u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0432\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0443\u0433 \u0435\u0439 \u043b\u0433\u0443\u0442 \u0438 \u0437\u0430\u0434\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0443\u044e \u0444\u0435\u0438 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u043d\u0435 \u0438\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0434\u0435\u0432\u0443\u0448\u043a\u043e\u0439. \u041f\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0440\u044f\u0432 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0433\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0440 \u0438 \u044d\u0433\u043e\u0438\u0437\u043c -

I've yet to play Waltz's storyline, but completed 8 out of the 10 possible endings so far.  I found the order that was suggested by the gamemakers to be a very good one and would suggest newcomers follow it for the most plot enjoyment.  \n\nI want to emphasize that every good review given here by the many other people who played this game is pretty much spot on accurate, and I agree with most of them.  So rather than rehash what's already been praised about this game, I'll go straight to the hopefully constructive critique I have.  That in no way means I did not enjoy this game very much, even more than the stories packed in some extremely popular paid games by major developers (why hello there, Square-Enix).\n\nI personally thought the Rumple storyline was a bit weak compared to the others; it seemed to exist more to give background information on the world and other characters than to develop Rumple in a truly meaningful way.  I also would have liked to see some \"normal\" friendship-style endings thrown in between the extremes of \"Happily Ever After\" and \"Shakespearian Tragedy.\"  That's really just splitting hairs, because the overall worldbuilding and plot was very strong in this game and I suppose I'd have loved to see even more of it!  Lastly, some of the romance tropes were very clich\u00e9d - nearly every guy had a scene which involved trapping our lovely leading lady between his arms, against some sort of flat surface, while sticking his face into the heroine's in a suave way.  Not that the pulp romance fan in me doesn't love those tropes, but they were very static, almost predictable \"love cut scenes\" in an otherwise refreshing and engaging writing style.\n\nI'm both looking forward to and dreading playing the last bachelor's route in this game, if just because I know it will bring me that much closer to \"completing\" it.  It truly has been an enjoyable experience and I want to thank the developers from the bottom of my heart for having the creative energy and drive to build a game this great from the ground up for the rest of us, and not even charge us for the pleasure.

A part of me was kind of disappointed when I heard their next project was a fairytale game, a concept that has been beaten to death. A pleasant surprise for me, I got to see a VERY new twist on the concept! The world was rich and the characters were appealing. I adored the writing and I cried on multiple occasions. I definitely was sucked into the world and I would love to see another game set in the same universe.\n\nI'd have to say some of it's best aspects were the art and CGs. I was also pleased by the actual difficulty of decisions, like most Otome games I find are very easy to tell what the right path is. I really enjoyed watching the protagonist grow while still ending up realistically like the same person.

exiled prince with a dark and mysterious past with lucious hair and lips, mad style and eyelashes for days!!!!! Also the detail of the story is so good I would even go as far as to call it SENSUAL. UGH LORE GIVE IT TO ME BABY\n\nI have no idea why it's free but I will recommend this to EVERYONE and may or may not also tell my grandma about it. If this was out few years ago when I was really into these (I'm not anymore lol pffft obvs hem hem), it would have probably made my entire life and it would have been a bit creepy so be glad you released it now and not then\n\nAnyway, I'm going to replay it to unlock all the other HOT ANIME GUY PATHS and will be thinkin about my new boo KLAUDE because we're cute like that\n\n\nEDIT------ (after completing all the paths) MINOR SPOILERS\n\nThis was really an amazing game, Waltz's story had me in absolute tears at 3am in the morning. I played it in the suggested order, and it was a really good finale, and now it's left me wondering: did I finish the game or did the game finish me??\n\nIt's a really breathtaking game, the story is amazing and I only spotted one minor punctuation error. The art is really gorgeous and I loved all the guys (apart from Rumpel's mullet - oh no baby) - all of them had heartwarming, 3 dimensional backstories and interesting personalities. I like how almost all of the endings were bittersweet which struck a chord with me because it teaches you that having a hot bae will always have repercussions :/ - (SPOILER kinda) a character almost always dies in every ending, and since you've played through it multiple times to get the different paths, you do get attached to all of the characters too. My heart even went out to Sir Alcaster who is a knobhead, but also Fritz's beloved father, and therefore my beloved father-in-law\n\nMy only complaint is one thing these guys all have in common is the whole \"I'm going to protect you\" complex, which some people might dig, but it just has me like :/ this spindly doctor boy is gonna try shielding my badass princess witch ice queen from danger? please kiss my airs\n\nAnyway, thanks for an AMAZING game, and I can't wait to see what future games you have in store :)", "timestamp_created": 1501790057, "timestamp_updated": 1502158635, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33999677": {"recommendationid": "33999677", "author": {"steamid": "76561198207890919", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1578, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501699915}, "language": "english", "review": "This was an incredibly well written free story to experience!

In this branch of the story, the princess is truly trying to solve the problems among her Father, Mother and herself, instead of falling love with some guy and telling little about the real barrier in her heart to be as kind as she could be. The story is so touching about a girl to reveal the love of her distant father and fight against her evil mother to protect the ones she loves.

Instead I'll just emphasize how great it is as a story and concept, regardless of it being free or not.\nI normally don't like the idea of a \"recommended route\" because it seemingly takes away the element of 'choice' in a dating sim -- why wouldn't I want to date the boy I think is the cutest first? And yet, with Cinderella Phenomenon, it's so rewarding to do it in their order. Another review said that the game is boring after you finish one route, but I personally disagree. The story unfolds more and more with every romance, clueing you into what the endgame will be, and making the final romance, Waltz's route, all the more enjoyable.\n\nAnd while the love interests are great, it's refreshing that I found myself loving all of the side characters as well. From King Genaro to Delora to Annice, I adored them all so dearly. \nI loved the way the fairytales were utilized, it was fun to wrack my brain trying to remember how a story went in its original tale and how it would manifest in this game. Even when I thought I understood how a curse would work, I found myself pleasantly surprised with the twists! \n\nHonestly, tl;dr if you like visual novels (particularly otomes/games with romance), good character development, and/or fairytales you should give this one a shot. It's free so you have nothing to lose and everything to gain.", "timestamp_created": 1501706362, "timestamp_updated": 1501706362, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33978467": {"recommendationid": "33978467", "author": {"steamid": "76561198273956598", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501702440}, "language": "english", "review": "For a free game, Cinderella Phenomenon really is good.\n\nThere are five playable bachelors, but the last two can only be unlocked once you've finished at least two of the three routes first made available to you.\n\nThe developers recommend you play Rod's route first, but that's not really necessary. Rod's route does explain some things, but frankly, he's such a boring and snotty character that it's difficult to get through. Also, he looks about twelve years old, which is so unappealing. Rod fits into the archetypical Serious Otome Boy trope, and it gets real old, real quick.\n\nI liked Rumpel's and Karma's routes (though I do admit I liked Karma's a bit better). They do get repetitive purely because the plot is practically the same, and you have to read the same explanations about the MC's true self and what makes her so special, blah blah blah.\n\nWhen you finally get to unlock Fritz and Waltz, the game actually becomes interesting.\n\nFritz's route, for me, was easily the best and most enjoyable. The plot is completely different than the rest of them, so it's actually refreshing, and more things are explained, including certain relationships between characters. Fritz's route makes the entire world and the dynamic between the MC and others more believable. (For example, before Fritz's route I wanted to strangle Delora and could not understand why the MC did not! Fritz's route cleared some things up for me.)\n\nFinally, Waltz's route seems to wrap the entire story of the game up nicely, and his good ending is probably the \"ideal\" conclusion to the game, if there is one. I did not enjoy it as much as Fritz's, but the story was still better than the first three and Waltz was pretty endearing at times. (Also, adult!Waltz is hot. Good character design, guys.)\n\nTo wrap this review up:\n\nPros\n- The game is free, so even if it were crap it'd be worth a shot.\n\n- The writing is above average, especially for an otome game.\n\n- The message of the plot/game is good!\n\n- The MC is not just a pushover, though I did not agree with her reasoning a lot of the time.\n\n- It's a lot of play-time for a free game.\n\n- The art style can be really nice sometimes.\n\nCons\n- The first three routes are really repetitive.\n\n- It seems as if the men fall in love with the MC out of nowhere. Even if you make the wrong choices, the men still fall in love with the MC!\n\n- In the same vein, the bad routes are genuinely just...bad. Not interesting or thrilling or exciting or horrifying. They're repetitive and boring and, frankly, they don't make sense. Seriously, why would these guys fall in love with a girl who keeps doing everything they dislike? (Especially if you're trying to get the bad routes on purpose and just end up insulting the bachelors more often than not...) Only Waltz's bad route was somewhat interesting, and the rest were...blah.\n\n- Most of the time, the art style is just decent (why is every VN anime style anyway?), so if you care about that, it's something to consider.\n\n- Until you play all of the routes, some things are incomprehensible, and the dynamics between the characters change rapidly and seemingly without purpose. This does get better as more things are explained.\n\n- I *hate* how some characters (namely Delora) treat the MC at the beginning of each route. MC was horribly abused by her mother and pretty much everyone is aware of this, but it's almost never mentioned. Seriously, the girl deserves sympathy, not villification.\n\n- No female romance options, no people of color (or, at least, no one who is overtly brown/black). It's 2017, folks. The least you can do is make an inclusive *fantasy* setting. (Karma does dress up like a woman sometimes, so there's that, I guess.)\n\n- Some typos exist, but they're rare and unbothersome for the most part.\n\nIn conclusion, I would recommend this game. It's not perfect, but it's good, and Waltz's and Fritz's good routes are worth checking it out.", "timestamp_created": 1501704872, "timestamp_updated": 1501706427, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33970905": {"recommendationid": "33970905", "author": {"steamid": "76561198353833165", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501259607}, "language": "english", "review": "SIMPLY AMAZING!

Chesterton[/b]\n\nAs a preliminary declaration, I am astonished that an Otome VN with this caliber being a freeware, and it also being the first ever project of Dicesuki development team. I mean, it is surprisingly good for a first trial in the Otome genre, even better compared to products of some veteran developers. Let's take a closer look at the game and discuss its various other qualities aside being free, huh? Because there are many.\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a not so sweet little princess named Lucette. Sure she was fair and pretty as most princesses, but she was also cold, rude and mean; taking no interest in any other's feelings or needs whatsoever. She was selfish and cruel also, to a degree that even her own family were wary of her. So... what to do with this little meanie? Why, curse her of course: put a spell on her so everyone would forget that she is royalty, thus living as an ordinary person would teach her some humility, kindness or maybe even compassion in the long run. In her challenge to break her own curse, the princess must accomplish three good deeds. It may sound plain and simple, but not so much for someone who has never committed a single good deed in all her life. For her trial to learn goodness, Lucette choses one of the five fine gentlemen who are also cursed, to serve as a partner and a companion. In trying to help each other breaking their curses, romance arises, but that is not the center of Lucette's story. Things may start simple or even comedic, but given time, Lucette is to find herself in a conspiracy concerning the crown and the fate of the kingdom.\n\nThere are five romance paths concerning some really well-written gentlemen here, but I'll get there. In each path, aside the relationship build, you gather different nuances, anecdotes or clues concerning the grand picture. Answers to some questions may lie in different paths, so even though you wouldn\u2019t be interested romantically, I advise playing all paths. When they all are played and their good endings are acquired, the full picture is revealed. Events prior to the story, backgrounds of different romance options, NPCs\u2019 own interrelation and the story consistency itself are gradually revealed and all are imaginative, interesting and attractive. All characters - whether they be main romance options or ordinary NPCs - harbor well thought stories of their own with distinct personalities. I am happy to declare that I didn't encounter any stereotypes in this game. If someone looks like a stereotype, it means that there are things to be revealed about him/her yet. That, I can assure.\n\nWhat we were saying? Ah, romance options! Sure, this is an Otome in the end, huh? Well, all boys are mostly interesting with well written paths, both their personalities and curses that make their path worthy to play. Rod is our step brother and the current crown prince who lost his voice thanks to the Mermaid's curse. He is stubborn and disinterested mostly, but he has a golden heart. Karma is the pretty, reckless and bohemian creature that no one knows anything about - aside him/her being a master swordsman and a grade A slacker. He bears the Beauty and the Beast curse, and he is one of my favorites in the game. Rumpel was my least favorite, considering his route was mostly slow pacing and his involvement lacks anything related to the main character to begin with. He seems like a womanizer who forgot his own name and throws cheesy compliments around like its wedding confetti, who actually harbors a deep trauma concerning the value of life. Well, then comes Fritz... It's hard to explain about Fritz without giving spoilers but it should be suffice to say that he is our knight, who genuinely likes us and wishes to protect us without any apparent ulterior motive. He is solely a good guy. Huh, who would have thought? Then, my favorite ever - and the last of the routes that should be played: Waltz. He is a street magician by the age of 12 - or is he? Well, telling anything else would spoil the magic. Let\u2019s just say he is older than he looks to be.\n\nThe game is made in classical Ren'Py engine. You have 30 or so choices to make in each playthrough to see what happens. Your choices do change the end game, and alter the pace of the main story in some small amount but whatever you do or say, the boy of your choice will love you. Your choices only affect the end game circumstances, which would create either a happy ending or an uncontrollable tragedy. According to the amount of correct choice, you either grab a happy ending by the side of your love, or fail to reach happiness due to a dire mishap. Btw, it might be useful to note that whatever you do, some bloodshed is unavoidable, befitting to any crown conspiracy - especially in a world involving magic.\n\nArt works are not miraculous, but they are beautiful and elegant with an anime style. Background artwork is pretty much run of the mill, but character artworks are especially fetching. I must say that the diversity of expressions used for each character is more than satisfying too. No voice acting present, but CG scenes are plenty and they are plenty pretty. The game soundtrack is more than fitting, and sound effects are well timed with appropriate mood influences. Oh, there are also Steam achievements involved, and all this game has to offer - which is 30 hours or so gameplay - is free.\n\nIf you are even remotely interested in the Otome genre or would like to try one without anything to lose, this is one of the better options for you. It doesn't contain any fan service - which is a huge pro for me - and it harbors an elaborate setting that packs a good amount of story. So... go ahead\u2026 I bet you'll get a favorite path of your own in no time. As a side note, I would recommend getting the DLC that contains game art to support the developer for a measly 5 dollars. The game itself actually deserves far more, and I hope that it would encourage the developer to bring us other beautiful games like this in the future.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ladystoryteller#curation]here[/url] - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!", "timestamp_created": 1501084199, "timestamp_updated": 1514012506, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 62, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.870115", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33788865": {"recommendationid": "33788865", "author": {"steamid": "76561198160607223", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3777, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512050876}, "language": "english", "review": "This game quickly became one of my favorites.

One of the main themes of this game is that no one is completely good nor evil. There's always a balance. And yet, villains like [spoiler]Mythros and Alcaster[/spoiler] seemed to be displayed as your typical evil villains.

There's a lot of content and beautiful art and both heart warming and heart wrenching endings, and I'm honestly in awe that this is a free game. I've paid $20 for games with stories less endearing than these and I've only completed 2 characters (I've gotten both endings for Karma and only the bad end for Rod). This game will make think everything is great and then BAM! turns out you've got the bad ending and your heart is broken [spoiler] just like the MC's [/spoiler] The bad endings hurt so good though, you'll want to experience them, if only to make the good endings better. \nMy only problem is it can be a little difficult to get the good ending (or at least it was difficult for me) because some of the choices to get the good ending (at least in Karma's case) are opposite of what you might think. I got a bad ending three times in a row before I managed to finally figure it out, but don't let that stop you from playing the game. If you're not super dedicated to playing through the same route multiple times with minor tweaks, there are walkthroughs out there to guide you. Or if you're stubborn and prideful (me), the game does have an amazing fast forward feature to go ahead and get to the choices. The fast forward can be a bit slow or give you an error message if you skip too far ahead (i.e. if the next choice is all the way in the next chapter), but nothing game breaking as far as I've experienced. \nThe MC actually has a personality aside from the usual ditzy/clueless/airhead/etc. usually found in these types of games, and over the course of the story, you actually get to see that personality change. Some of the love confessions can seem a bit abrupt but they're not nearly as sudden as in other games, and I personally didn't have a problem with them. \n\nOverall, amazing game and definitely worth a look at least.

So I want to review not only the positive, but the negative aspects. I do it first for the whole game, then for each story, so it is going to be pretty long.\n\nThe game:\n+ grafics (i mean if you look at it as a free game. ofc games like Amnesia have asthonishing grafics, but then they are also very pricey)\n+ music (i think the music was okay, but got a little bit annoying after a while, when playing different routes with the same bg music...)\n+ idea (i think it's not a common idea to use fairy tales as plot for a visual novel. and the idea to reverse them was also really good.)\n+ characters (for a free game the characters were unexpectigly deep. they had a personality - it was not like the  focus was on the romance, but also how the characters deal with the feelings, making it more like a story than a otome for me.)\n+ plot (it was not really deep (my opinion) but they carried it really well out. the stories were connected and if you played it in the right order, then you also understood the idea at the end)\n+ main character (she had a personality, not being a lifeless doll or a total damsel in distress. i liked it)\n\n- main character (she had maybe even too much personality. often i couldn't really emphatize with her. In some routes like Fritz she was overly selfish and like a damsel in distress, but then in the routes of Rumpel or Waltz she was so selfless that I'd call her stupid.)\n- characters (somehow, I still think that they had more potential than in the game. e.g. Waltz had really much potential, so that the plot could be much longer)\n- plot (well, I'm sorry, but there are some things I don't like about this. The thing with the reversed fairy tales was great. Also the idea about her mother. But then in the plot... I think that the focus lied on the tragic story with the MCs mother, the fairy tale curses making just a shard of the story... I mean, the idea was new, it was great. There could be more done with it e.g. that they lived like in the story: there was peter pan, a child, who couldn't grew up. But he had a lot of friends and the MC became like Wendy for him. But then it was his curse to not leave Neverland and Wendy wanted to leave. So he wanted to stay with her, but he couldn't. MC wants to make a good deed, so she tries to convince him, but then there's captain hook ... and so on )\n- choises (God, this really bothered me. I mean REALLY! You just can't get them right. I mean the text on the buttons and the things she said, often don't match. So you need to reload when doing most of the choises at least once every few choises. AND ITS SO FRUSTRATING! Like with Rod, i COULDNT GUESS ALMOST ANY OF THEM RIGHT ON MY FIRST TRY!? And, come on, I'm not so bad at otome games... most of them just didn't make sense for me... like e.g. biting Karmas hand (WHY WOULD U DO THIS?!??!?!?))\n\nWell, I don't want to complain so much, so let's move on to the routes.\n\nRod:\nI think it was the most understandable route of all, although I had a lot of problems with the choises. Rod has the spell of the little mermaid. And it's one of my favorite fairy tales. But well, he is like the mermaid himself. He doesn't want to bother anyone and is pretty shy, so I found him very adorable. There wasn't much of the main story in his route, but well, now we know, why Ophelia married the king (i still think that detail is pretty funny).\n\nKarma:\nWell, Karma is Karma. I love guys like him in vn because they are most of the times easy to deal with. Karma wants attention and he wants love. He has the curse... well you will know. But it's my second most beloved fairy tale. And the route itself was a little bit too short for me, but I kind of liked it. But well, the MC wasn't really good in this one I think. If you know, what I mean /coughts bad end /coughts. And that she would learn sword techniques was a little too much for me...\n\nRumpel:\nAhh, when I started this route, I thought it'd be the funniest one and I was right. This flirty idiot, whom I really wanted to slap a lot of times through the routes... well he had almost the best story (my third favorite). I really enjoyed, how he had grown in the story, realizing that sometimes you need to sacrifice in order to protect. And in this route the main was also really nice. I could almost every time agree with her choises.\n\nFritz:\nWell, this, this is my FAVORITE!!! I ship them. I really do. I think the main and Fritz are meant to be together (and don't you dare to say that Waltz is canon with her DON'T CHA). Fritz has the curse of the tale I think everybody knows. And I think it was the best idea to make it reversed like this in the game. This was the only story, where I really cried. It was killing me, how he was adoring the princess the whole time, willing to do everything just for her to be safe. After ... well when the queen was there and passed away, Fritz always watched her. He wanted her to be happy, to protect her. He wanted to stay with her and he was restless until he found her. Fritz has the saddest curse of all of them I think (besides Rods bad end /coughts), but he still is willing to give up his life for her. He has such strong feelings for her that he could overcome his curse... well... I just loved this story. It's really sad but adorable at the same time.\n\nWaltz:\nLast but not least. My favorite character. My favorite fairy tale. And then came the route. It had so much potential, god, but it was too short. I know that it is difficult to write a romantic story, when the hero knows that he loves her and spoils her a lot accordingly. I know that it's not easy to write the conclusion of main story, when you have to mind all the story pieces you had written before. But P L E A S E, don't make a fairy tale curse WITHOUT ALMOST NOTHING BASED ON THE FAIRY TALE (i don't mean the mettaphors e.g. queen = hook). And the MC... I was so devastated at her change. She turned into a person... well she just wanted to sacrifice herself for everyone. And... well I don't like it. The story turned into something like The Maid of Orl\u00e9ans and it displeased me greatly because I'm not fond of people rushing into death. Simply choises like her trying to stab herself, only to save her father... it's just too much drama for me I'm sorry. Nevertheless I loved Waltz personality. So it was nice having at least him around in the route ;)", "timestamp_created": 1499622137, "timestamp_updated": 1499622137, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33391988": {"recommendationid": "33391988", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125768150", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1428, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499503478}, "language": "english", "review": "I completed this pretty quickly, but I like the story and how engaging everything is.

Like others, I didn't expect much from this game because it's free to play. But don't let that fool you - I'd rate this game a 10/10!\n\nYou play as Lucette, a princess with a cold heart. This immediately caught my attention because the MC was flawed. She had her own issues to work with, and wasn't some spineless damsel in distress. While progressing through the game, you could feel the MC change and learn with you. This applies to not only the MC, but the five other love interests as well. Each of them have vastly different characters and storylines such that you won't feel like you're reading the same story five times. They don't appear as perfect men, but are guys with flaws that grow together with the MC.\n\nOther positive notes about this game were the amazing art, appropriate music soundtracks and with the right dose of humor and seriousness. Even the side characters were not sidelined and each had a part to play in the story.\n\nOne minor flaw about this game is actually a spoiler, so read at your own risk. [spoiler] I wished that Varg would get some love as well. I know it's ultimately still Fritz's body, but the guy that we saw more of was Varg. He was interesting, unpredictable, and I would like to have seen more of him / the darker side of Fritz that Varg stemmed from. [/spoiler]\n\nHowever, this game is definitely a lot better than some of the paid ones I've seen floating around, and this is just minor nitpicking from me.\n\nI would recommend playing Waltz's route the last, as his story ties up all the loose ends from the other routes the best.

The story takes place four years after the Great War between fairies and witches. In this world, witches are generally hated by the populace due to the fact that they are often portrayed as being villainous in fairy tales. You play as Lucette, the crown princess of the kingdom, who is arrogant, cynical, and generally looks down on people. That is until one day she is cursed by a witch. Like others who have been cursed, she suffers a type of \"fairy tale curse.\" Every curse is based on a well-known fairy tale. For Lucette, she suffers from the Cinderella curse. Her previous life of luxury as a member of royalty is gone. She now lives as a poor commoner and everyone, expect magical beings and other cursed individuals, has forgotten who she truly is. Now she must complete at least three good deeds in order to break the curse and return to her former life. Along the way, there is a colorful cast of characters to help her.\n\nThis game is a visual novel, a type of game that is entirely story-driven. In total, there are five major routes to choose from in this game, one for each romanceable man, each with his own curse to overcome. Each route has a good or bad ending, depending on the choices the player makes during the game, for a total of ten different endings.\n\nThe art in the game is very well done. This goes for all aspects with beautiful and detailed backgrounds and unique character designs. I also thought the music is pretty good, too, and it really helped with the atmosphere of the game.\n\nThe main attraction of any visual novel is the story. In this case, I found the game to be quite well-written. It would have been easy just to slap together a cheap romance plot for each guy, but the creators of this game really put in a lot more. To start, the world and lore presented is fairly interesting and as I kept playing I wondered what else I would learn about it. This also goes for the characters. Lucette is not some empty shell visual novel protagonist, but is written as a character  in her own right that fully develops throughout the story. Each of the characters in the game are written well, too, and you learn more about them as the game progresses. With five different routes to choose from, there is plenty of more story to experience on each play-through. You will never find out everything about the story line or the characters through a single route.\n\nOverall, for a free visual novel, this is a fantastic experience. I found this game to have good art and a well written story and characters. I would recommend this to those that like visual novels.", "timestamp_created": 1498874274, "timestamp_updated": 1498874274, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501720", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33061704": {"recommendationid": "33061704", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271466515", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 907, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498868350}, "language": "english", "review": "just because it's free doesn't mean it sucks, It does not suck, I can see how much love and hard work was poured into this otome.

I started playing otome when I was about 16 (I am 20 now), and I just loved the fact that otome games are like novels/stories where you play the role of the protagonist. This otome, out of the many I have played (many of which I have payed for) is by far one of my favorites along with midnight cinderella (although Midnight Cinderella is mostly P2W). I just cannot wrap my head around how this one is free!? I AM SERIOUS. This otome is truly worth money, and yet here it is for free.. I'm not complaining or anything, I am okay with that since I got to enjoy this, but I wish that the person who created this game would get more for it, since you can truly see all the detail and effort put into every character, story, artwork, and music.\n\n*Beyond this point might be slightly spoilerish as far as the MC goes; no spoilers on  the dateable characters however*\n\n1. I have never been the kind of person to complain about an MC (the heroine) as usually they are written rather blandly so that you can instead project your own personality onto her, but this MC really hit home for me. She is a lot like myself, and it really made me re-evaluate how I see people and the world in general. I am often told that I am cold and should smile more, and I don't allow people into my life nor trust anyone (even family) as I have been shown from a young age that no one can be trusted. Not even family. I won't go into further detail of my past as that is no one's business, but I will say that she (the MC) reminded me so much of myself. I actually cried when I came to that realization, but I was filled with hope seeing as how she was able to change such a demeaner/ way of thinking. I will try to make a conscious effort to do the same as I was very inspired by this story.\n\n2. Each character is so unique and different, all of them warmed my heart. The only route I was not excited about at first was Rumples, I just did not like him to begin with. After finishing his route, I actually liked and respected his character. Surprisingly, there was not a single route that I did not enjoy (which for me is a first... Especially since amnesia and mystic messenger -_-) \n\n3. The artwork is beautiful, and truly amazed me at how many CG's you get for EACH character! Not to mention all of the CG's actually look beautiful, AND IT'S FREE. Truly this game is amazing. I cannot digress how much I have enjoyed this game thus far.\n\n4. The story is so engaging and captivating, and for me very relateable. Maybe not for others (I don't really care), but for me it was. I think that is why this game was quiet dear to me.. I have never related to a main character before, but this one was different. I also enjoy the fact that each route is so unique and different from the other while still maintaining a steady plot. (I love reading, and writing my own stories) and I must say that this one is very well made. \n\n5. The music is beautiful! I will not lie however, when I first heard the intro song, I loved the music until the voice appeared. I scoffed at the voice and thought his voice sounded rather whiney and annoying, but it grew on me. Now, I won't even open the game without letting the intro song play.\n\n10/10 would reccomend. Even if it was not free, this game would most certainly be worth every penny. I hope that more games such as this will be released in the future. \n\n*On a sidenote* The moment I saw Waltz, I knew he would be my favorite character.

With games, you get what you pay for, and with free games my expectations are very low. At first, playing through the prologue, I got a little discouraged as the build-up was a little slow.

There have been visual novels I've played where the asking price is greater than $10, with not nearly as much content. Not to mention the amount of work put into the game! The art is gorgeous, and the music is really well chosen.\n\nHowever! Don't go thinking that this game sacrifices quality for quantity. Each route is unique, and has emotional weight that draws the player in. Every route feels like a fleshed out story, and the player wants to go back to the other routes to find out more about the world of the game. The protagonist is multifacted and has flaws, and she goes through an incredible journey of growth in every route. The characters are memorable and loveable, and not just the love interests.

Heartwrecking and gentle, it explores such heavy yet familiar to us all topics such as loneliness, abandoment and trust, struggle to be understood and accepted as we are, yet grow and be a better person. \nThere is really no cons here. The plot is simple, yet holds enough intrigue and depth to keep the reader engaged through all the routes, slowlly unravelling it's little detailes, the futher it goes. It also changes through the routes, so that you never really know what to expect from the next line, that appears on the screen. I also extremely enjoyed the writing itself. There is pretty much no mistakes, it is polished, smooth and pleasant, and you not even notice most of the time, how time flies by over reading. \nThe Best part for me was the heroine herself. If you, as I am, hate those hollow dummies, that exist only to serv as projections for the reader to emagine the romance Otome provides - well, you will be indeed pleased. Because here princess IS actual main hero, she has clearly defined personality, strengh and weaknesess, history, reasonable reasons for being who and how she is. And not lesser reasons to change, to grow and learn. She is consistent, deep and very real. Here relationships are not the only thing there is to know about her, yet they remain indefinetly important, just as for us our famylies, friends and loved ones. \nAbout the latter... The guys are gorgeous, all of them. Really different from each other, and even though can be define by usual types as the genre intales, they surpass these stereotypes. Just as heroine, they have personality, there own demons (sometimes literally), there own path, which they follow with MC equally, not dragging her behind them as decoration and not dissapearing in her shadow. \nAnd on top of it all, like the cherry on top of a cake, is overall art. Weirdly, my favourite part of it is interface and the chapters pages, along with ends. It is intricate and elegant, perfectly in synch with the rest of the art and the story itself.  The backgrounds are also beautiful, especially the forest, I honestly tried to just hide the interface a few times, simply to enjoy the picture. \nLastly, soundtrack is, as I think must be - is not annoying and not really notecable. As there is no voice acting, the tunes are there enough to not attract to much attention but highlight the story, and it is great. Also never noticed any breakes, music is perfectly looped. \nOverall, I think deves should definetely charge for this truly amasing work they've done.

The stories were also much darker than I expected.  Lots of death and violence, and heartbreak.  I was near tears several times, even on the good routes.  I was surprised by how much I liked all of the male characters.  Routes I wasn't initially all that intrigued by ended up surprising me with their twists, and I loved how all of the different pieces fit together to form the overarching story.

A lot of her actions feel mostly justified for her emotional state given her circumstances.\n\nThe added skip to next choice button is a nice add, but I feel like I lost immersion and some enjoyment of second playthroughs of a route by using it (I was too lazy to re-read though so reading the bad ends of each character first is a bad idea. Do not save the best ending for last unless it's Waltz's good ending.)\n\nThe cast is mostly likeable and the (at times humorous) interactions between the characters are entertaining and believable.  The love interests especially are almost all pleasing to me.  Except for [spoiler] Rumpel. His (at first funny, but later irritating) flirting didn't stop during the ending either. Also, screw him for using \"ladies should be pure\" logic that dissuaded the MC from killing Mythros before he killed Parfait... It makes sense though, since he's delusionally stupid. I felt good when he got what was coming during his bad end. [/spoiler] It would be most appropriate to play Waltz's route last, as his end has the most spoiler for other routes. \n\nThe quality and the detail of the art are surprising for a free game... but the love interests aren't attractive. I genuinely thought this game was a yuri game for a time when I had seen the promotional art. Don't get me wrong, they look decently drawn, but a wider jawline and a little more body mass would've helped. Relievingly, the piano and other instruments used for the soundtrack fit the game's softer, ornate artstyle and I love the main menu theme. \n\nOverall, the quality of the story, art, music, and care given to the game make it worth your time regardless of price if you are a fan of otome games.", "timestamp_created": 1498516579, "timestamp_updated": 1498516639, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32831784": {"recommendationid": "32831784", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053407030", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 774, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500768494}, "language": "english", "review": "I must admit I just turned this game on and ended up playing for 4 hours straight.

It was a pleasure to play and the art, writing, and gameplay are all done to a very high standard, so if you're wondering whether to check it out - do it! \n\nThe character routes are all quite different from each other and took longer to complete than I was expecting; it's easy to see that a lot of effort has gone into every aspect of the game. The plot is well thought out and the love interests all have a distinctive design and personality - I especially liked the [spoiler]fairytale character twists.[/spoiler] I was also relieved to discover that they all lack that sort of overly rude or demeaning attitude that a lot of otome games seem to think manly men need in order to be attractive, and that their conflict came across clearly without resorting to blaming or insulting the protagonist. Sad that this seperates the game from many others in this day and age but there you go.

For example, sometimes it felt as if there was external conflict and then suddenly - they're in love! [spoiler]Karma's relationship was probably the only exception as he is the most conflicted about his feelings for the protagonist.[/spoiler] The plot is very politically dramatic, if that makes sense, and less so when it comes to the relationships. \n\nThe art is very unique and beautiful, I especially love the eyes - they made the MC look fantastically cold and shrewd sometimes - I lived for her evil glare. On that note it was very fun seeing things from her perspective, she is one of the most interesting characters in the game. It would have been nice to see more recognition from the other characters regarding her [spoiler]childhood abuse and upbringing[/spoiler], as I think it's only briefly mentionned on the one route and I felt that really could have added to her developement or the ANGST. \n\nOverall though I made it through every route very easily and it was a joy to play - I can't wait to see what Dicesuki does next.", "timestamp_created": 1498234161, "timestamp_updated": 1498234353, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537202", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32673050": {"recommendationid": "32673050", "author": {"steamid": "76561198213895109", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1297, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495622394}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely wonderful!

I grew to really like the various characters, and even shed a few tears.", "timestamp_created": 1498117180, "timestamp_updated": 1498375094, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32632488": {"recommendationid": "32632488", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129084135", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2373, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499222300}, "language": "english", "review": "Kudos to the developers and designers, and everyone involved with the making of this game!\n\nTop three things I loved of this game:\n\n1. [b]The main character[/b]. It is quite refreshing to have a tsundere-kind of protagonist. I'm quite tired of the clich\u00e9d, crybaby, useless heroines.\n\n2. [b]The characters and illustrations[/b]. Simply gorgeous! I really enjoyed each and every one of them. \n\n3. [b]The stories[/b]. I love that you, guys, kept the \"reality\" and \"cruelty\" of the original fairytales in the bad endings. People - specially new generations - tend to believe in 'Happily Ever Afters' from Disney's movies... but we - the old school - grew reading fariytales and realized not all of them had one. I enjoyed those fairytales the most - not because I'm cruel or sadist, but because I do believe \"goodness\" cannot always win; and because life, luck, and love not always smile upon good people. Anyway, I'm not gonna say anything more or I'll probably spoil things for those that haven't played.\n\nThe rest of this is ranting... no need to stick around. =)\n\n** Thank you for not using the clich\u00e9d na\u00efve, stupid, good-for-nothing heroine. It is quite refreshing to have a tsundere-kind of protagonist. Unlike the crybaby heroines I have seen in many otome and dating games, this Princess has the guts and the drive to try to fight her way out of her predicament... and fall in love along the way.\n\nNow, for those that read my review (and played the game)... you may say that the girl is just as useless as the clich\u00e9d heroines - but at least she has the background to prove why she may not know how to do the simplest things. In other dating games (otome games) the girl usually lives alone and has to look for herself - I mean, anyone living like that should be self-suficient (and maybe proficient) for certain kind of things -, and yet those heroines cannot even boil water without setting the kitchen on fire (I wonder how they even lived as far as they did).\n\nRanting about other things, this is the list from \"My most favorite\" to \"my least favorite\" suitor: Waltz, Fritz, Rod, Karma, and Rumpel. Of course, since I couldn't play Walts and Fritz at the beginning, I played: Rod, Karma, and Rumpel.\n\nAnyway, I hope to see more otome games like this in the future and keep up the good job!

I coincidentally selected Rod's route, and then followed the recommended playing order from the description (Rod, Karma, Rumpel, Fritz, Waltz). My first time playing each route, I got the bad ending first, whether I wanted to or not. When I first played Fritz's route, I made 5 bad choices in the beginning and used a guide for the good ending for the rest of the choices, but I still got the bad end. I'm not sure if you need to be perfect for the good ends, or if you only get up to a certain amount of choices wrong, but be careful. Anyways, this game took me three days total, with a guide for the good ends. I did four routes each day, two for each character, and two on the last day for Waltz. I really recommend taking the plot-driven playing order recommended in the description. [spoiler] Also, I totally knew that was Fritz, even though I didn't want it to be true.

It seriously bothered me for the long words, absence of rhythm and the out of tune singing.\n- The introduction is too long.. it often made me bored and I stopped playing the game often.

Well, it takes ages to arrive at that point. And it takes so much time to understand who exactly you can date in the game.\n- Too little choiches, most of the game was about reading. As a player, I felt often useless.\n- Some endings felt too plain and (sadly) left me with a \"meh\" kind of feeling.\n\nI'm really looking forward for more games from DiceSuki, and hope that there will be titles with some voice acting in the future!

You may find this odd, but this will be coming from a guy (I'm assuming the Visual Novel is targeting girls so I just felt the need to point this out).\n\nStory: I'm a fantasy man. I've read the first two books in A Song of Ice and Fire so far and I'm currently reading The Wheel of Time series. I enjoy a good fantasy story. When I saw that this story was set in a secondary world with a twist on traditional fairy tales, I had to see the novel for myself. I don't know if this helps anyone but if you like the Kingdom Hearts series and how they play Disney Princesses and old fairy tales, and a little bit of romance in genreral, you'd like this.\n\nCharacters: \n\nLet's start with the Main Character (I'll be calling her Lucette but the game allows you to name her whatever you want). Some may find her personality in the beginning of the novel annoying or irritating but it serves an obvious purpose since it stems from her past and how she was raised. She is a layered character with flaws and a somewhat dark past. I really enjoyed how the novel developed her. She's rather confident and vocal--a nice change of pace from what I usually recieve which are boring, tasteless, one-dimensional MCs who I honestly do not care for. For once, the MC isn't completely incompetent. I cared for Lucette and wanted to see this character go through this trial that she has to undertake. Also, her character design is absolutely gorgeous, and the novel does well to show her emotions and expressions.\n\nNow, I've only played through Rumpel's route in the story, so I really am in no position to critique the other love interest's personalities, but from what interactions I've seen in my first playthrough, they've peaked my interest enough that I want to play through their route, except for Rod, and not because I don't like him or his character, but I saw the step-brother as something more platonic than romantic (That's just me). As stated previously, I've finished Rumpel's route, both good and bad ending, and I enjoyed it very much. I am curious to see the other gents!\n\nMusic -- The soundtrack did well to emphasize a moment in the story whenever it was appropriate. The Main Theme is very enjoyable as well!\n\nArt -- The art style is different from what I'm used to but this wasn't bad in this case. I very much liked the art style, both the design of its characters and the background art too. The only criticism I have is when a character zooms in on the screen, they do look a little blurry and perhaps needs some adjusting. Now this is just me, but I would have liked to have seen some differences or variation in the five main love interests' design. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for pretty boys (I am a seme after all) but having some more 'masculine' or 'macho' looking gentlemen wouldn't have been a bad thing. This is probably my own criticism of Anime-style art and not just this Visual Novel specifically. Other than that, the visuals are beautiful.\n\nOther Criticisms: This might be a major negative for some people, but this Visual Novel does not have voice acting in it. I found it to be no bother personally even though I've grown accustomed to hearing voiced characters. Though I would have liked to seen some voice acting in this, it's still great without it. I don't know any specifics, and I'm assuming, but since this is a free Visual Novel and the developers and creators aren't recieving money from a purchase, I can understand why they'd want to go without voice actors.\n\n\nThis was definitely the most enjoyable Visual Novel I've read in a long time. I hope to read more from these developers and creators!\n\nIf you want a quick answer from this review, here it is: give it a read and enjoy!", "timestamp_created": 1497677525, "timestamp_updated":

Ive gone through all the routes and I adore every one.  I highly recomend doing the character stories in the recomended order that is shown.  The background story builds onto itself if you do it in that order and as you go threough the characters so will slowly get more and more of the entire storyline. Waltz and Fritz are locked for a reason! They have the most story/background stuf and I highly suggest playing the three already unlock charcters first then Fritz's storyline then Waltz very last, believe me you will be glad you did. Im so glad I took a chance on this game and decided to dowlaod it.  I loved it so much I will most likely go through all my favorite routes again and again. I also intend to go through and get any/ all acheviments and gallery photos I might have missed as well. I cant wait too see other Otome VN stories from you guys <3 Thank you for this amazing game!\n\nCharacter routes in order of my greatest to least favorite:\n\n#1 Waltz\n#2 Karma\n#3 Fritz \n#4 Rod\n#5 Rumple\n\n\n\n\nSPOILERS BELOW!\n\n\n\nRods route:\nI loved it. Rod is a doll and so sweet when you break the cold exterior he towards the M.C.. I love how it adresses that fact that they are step siblings. I picked up quickly on twist with how Rods curse would be broken and I loved the simple and sweet ending it had. My only complaint was that It seemed so much shorter then the other story lines for some reason and I wish that there had been just a little more affection between the two with how sweet Rod became. \n\nKarama's route: \nThis Route was one of my favorites! I completely and utterly adore Klaude! This storyline made me laugh so much. I loved Klaudes fairytale curse it was also one of my favorites. Though he is a little vain he always said it in a joking manner that made me smile almost the entire story line. I figured out his curse pretty early in the game and when things started leaning that way I guessed instantly about the other side to it. Though I didnt know the spacifics the details of his curse were amazing.  I loved the heartfelt scene when his curse was broken it almost made me cry.  The only thing I would of liked to see was the story line continued just a little further to include the M.C. going with him to meet his family, Klaude asking the king for her had and a royal wedding would have been the best thing in the word for this line. The joining of the two kindoms <3 \n\n\nRumple's route:\nThis was my least favorite route. Rumple's personality just grated on my nerves a bit too much to the point where i was almost always rolling my eyes. Though there was slightly more closer at the end of this route then the previous two I didnt think it deserved it. I would of much rather had this one open ended and Karma's gotten more attention in its place. \n\n\nFritz's route: \nThis was my 3rd favorite route. Fritz is cute, sweet, kind and loyal and I adore him. In this storyline it seemed like the M.C didnt develope quite as much as she did in other story lines and I was rather sad for that especially how dense she was when it came to Vargs feelings for her that irritated me highly which is part of the reason this line was bumped down to 3rd favorite instead of second. I loved Varg's big bad wolf type character and how Fritz's curse fit with the little red riding hood faiytale. My only complaint is that I wish we would of gotten more chocies with Fritz and Varg. I would of loved to have had more interaction with Varg and seen more of the M.C develope feeling for him as well as Fitz.  It would has been awesome to have her fall in love with both halves after all they are both one in the same person even is they want to deny it. As much as I loved this story line I feel a lot of potential was lost with Varg and it was upsetting. I would of adored the choice for this line to has 3 differant good endings, 1 for if the M.C chose Fritz, 1 if she could chose Varg and 1 if she could find a way to chose and keep both with what would of been an amazing polyamorous relationship trio that I would of completely and utterly adored to the point were it might have made it my number one favorite route. \n\n\nWaltz's route:\nThis was my altime number one favorite route! Mainly becuse this stoy line had some of the most background details and with out a dobut the most closure. The M.C get closure with her father and family as well as the townspeople. We get to see her become queen and have a lovely scene of her and Waltz at the end. Again a wedding here would have been amazing but considering they are both witchs and the towns people are just getting over the fear still I can see why it wasnt done but I can still wish right? The background for these two was so well done! Thier past relationship leading to thier future one and M.C having the key to break his curse all along. Was a twist of fate that I just loved. His magic had been in tursed to his dear friend the entire time with out either of them knowing. I loved that. My only wish for this line would be that more of there past friendship as kids would of been shared with us. I also would of loved to see the M.c some how get her memories back or unlocked maybe when she became the crystal bearer. That would of been amazing to have her remeber him from when they were kids. I wish all of the other lines could of had as much closure to the story as this one did but then If they had it would of been much harder for me to chose a favorite.", "timestamp_created": 1497478396, "timestamp_updated": 1497478610, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32415207": {"recommendationid": "32415207", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031032936", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1302, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498077138}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like visual novels this one is a good one.

It was my first otome/visual novel of any kind.  I thought at first, that I enjoyed it so much simply because I didn't know any better.  So, FOR SIENCE!, I downloaded five other free games of the same type.  Let me just say that Cinderella Phenomenon blew each and every other game out of the water.  Now, I haven't played any of the upper tier, costly games of the same genre, so I cannot say how Cinderella stacks up against them, but as far as the free games go, Cinderella sits at the top.\n\nWhat makes it better than other free games?\n\n-The dialogue is always decent.  It isn't superb, but it never, ever made me want to fork my eyes out.\n\n-The art is lovely and consistent.  I enjoyed each character's art, all of the backgrounds and all of the special scenes.\n\n- The music is great.  Yes, tracks are repeated, but -none- of the tracks are annoying or ugly.\n\n- Each bachelor presents a different take on the main story.  No two are the same once you have comitted to a love interest.  In fact, unlike most free games, the unfolding of the story via the bachelors makes you -want- to replay the game.  You learn something new about the world, the past, and the MC herself with each play through.  Nothing is repeated save for the beginning.\n\n- My favorite thing:  The Main Character herself.  She's flawed and sometimes terrible.  But she's REAL.  She grows and changes, but stays recognizeably the same character.  I never once found myself saying, \"Right... she would never actually do that.\"  \n\n- The romances don't seem forced.  They grow and seem natural, with ups and downs.\n\nI can't possibly imagine what this company might produce with the proper funding.\n\nEDIT:  I have now played quite a few otome games, even a few costly ones!  And wow... Cinderella still holds a special place!  My absolute favorite thing is the MC.  She is never stupid, shy, stuttery or a doormat.

Nonetheless, seeing how positive the games rating was and that it was indeed free (thus I wouldn\u2019t be losing anything),  I thought I might as well check it out...I was not disappointed. \n \nPros: \n+ The MC actually has a personality, which is not common among VNs and Otome games, where the MC is often a creature with no backbone or personality to speak of. Even if Lucette didn\u2019t have the most \u2018pleasing\u2019 of personalities, I think it added to the charm. \n+ The story is actually interesting and there aren't much event overlaps between the individual character routes; even if they do follow a similar base (which is to be expected) each of them feels different thanks to the characters involved. \n+ Characters actually have *gasp* backgrounds and development through the routes, their actions (even if I personally wouldn\u2019t agree with many) feel like they are true to them and don\u2019t feel forced onto the story just for movement sake. \n+ Art in the game is lovely, the designs for each (main/named) character is memorable and clearly thought out, the art itself is clean and the environment designs are detailed. The CGs in the game are also well used, covering the majority of the important events. \n+ The music is fitting and doesn\u2019t feel distracting or bothersome in the long run. \n+ The game is Free, really, just trying it won\u2019t hurt you. \n \nCons:\n- As much as I love the story, I can\u2019t help but feel that it lacks the freedom of choice in many instances. In order to obtain the good ending, you can\u2019t afford to make even one bad choice. Which in itself isn\u2019t something I frown upon, the issue with it on this particular game is that the difference between the right and wrong choice is a few lines of dialogue at most, that are not ever reflected upon again, therefore it feels odd and even bothersome to have to follow a set path of choices till the end.\n- This is a completely biased point,[spoiler] but I feel like the bad endings were cut short and could have been carried out better/be a bit longer. Essentially the difference between the good and the bad was just one chapter and a dead character, which didn\u2019t feel right and I would have loved to see Lucette\u2019s actions after the death of her partner...especially in the case of Fritz's route, where I feel that it had a lot of potential that wasn\u2019t used fully; in the good and bad.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler] Verg and Mythos are routes that I feel would have made sense in the form of \u2018bad\u2019 routes for Fritz and Waltz respectively.

Often, otome games throw you into the action with little knowledge of who the character we are playing is and consequently, the MC tends to feel a little lacklustre sometimes. But this game spends a few chapters building on the characterisation and plot, so you really get to know the MC's personality, relationships, motivations and values before deciding on a route to pursue.

The story is pretty interesting with fun side characters and music. The curses are actually a lot of fun comedically and for real meaningful moments. I like fairytales in general so having them become curses rather than having someone just plopped into the story is much more intriguing.\n\nI also like the option of having to skip the tutorial and even to each of the prolouge choices that you have to make, if you've already had a run of the game previously. It helps especially when the prolouge is as long as it is which isn't a bad thing because it develops each of the characters' personalities. There's also a nice little tid bit at the end of each completeled Happy Ending which makes you feel acomplished everytime to come to the menu.\n\nI think some of the things that could be improved on the game would be more music scores, fitting slapping/punching sound effects, character involvement and possibly more poses for specific events. There are moments in the game where there are long sincere speeches but instead of the music stopping for dramatic effect rather than having the same song loop for the time you're still reading the speech. There are also times when certain events where a character will hit another character and the game tries to replicate that feeling with the characters moving but it doesn't translate before there's only two hand/body positions. There's a section in one of the charcters does physical violence and the impact sounds like a grasshopper hitting a feather. \n\nThere are so many different and interesting characters but since the story might not necessarily need them for a different story, they seem to lackluster when you have such intriguing backstories. It'd be nice to see them involved in a little more epic stuff other than the final battle. I'm not even suggesting the options for your love interest either, I'm talking about the side characters, like the main Witch Delora or the main Fairy Parfait (who's name still makes me hungry.) Both are intriguing characters that I wish would be more involved in your character's development other than as a guide in the beginning.\n\nBut overall for a game that's free to play, had so many backers, so much time, effort into the story, writing and programming? I'd give this one a solid 8.5, it still has some wiggle room but I really did enjoy every bit of this game.\n\n*SPOILERS!!!!*\nDuring the Karma ending, I was a little disappointed with the generic design of the beast.

Cinderella Phenomenon has given me plenty to say. I have only read three visual novels and honestly was deeply disappointed in the previous two so I did not hold a lot of hope for this one. Add to that Cinderella Phenomenon was free made me even more skeptical however I was bored so I decided to give it a try. Frankly, it is an experience that deserves to be paid for. Although the concept at first seemed simple and would lack depth it quickly taught me how wrong I was. The character development is fantastic. The storyline morphs and becomes more complex and enjoyable as you continue through the various paths. Every character has their own \"voice\" if you will, making certain that you will never confuse any of them. They are well defined and interesting. The main character I despised at first but she quickly grew on me and by the end I absolutely adored her. She is not a meek litte mouse or a faceless no one that you care nothing for. In fact, you learn to care about everyone a great deal and the story ensures to bring on the feels. If you are looking for an active game then keep looking as this will not suit your tastes. However, if you are an avid reader and want a good story then I highly suggest picking this up. I do not believe you will be dissapointed. \n\nNote: The creators of this novel suggest going through the paths starting with Rod, then Karma, Rumpel, Fritz and ending with Waltz.

The fact that it's free blows my mind. It's perhaps even a disservice to the game, as many people will assume that you get what you pay for. This game is so much more. The writing, story construction and characterisation easily rival games I've bought for $20 or more.\n\nMy favorite bits:\n. The main character is not a bland & boring milquetoast or a pure-as-snow waif who bravely endures her traumatic past. She has a traumatic past. And it's made her the nastiest piece of work this side of a Grim fairytale. Cinderella? Riiiight, she'd give the evil step-sisters a run for their money. But her characterisation makes perfect sense, and her starting point gives her huge possibilities for growth and a character arc.\n\n. Though sometimes random, it seems to me many of the choices are not \"choose what will please your romance option\" to get the good reaction, it's \"choose what makes sense for the main character to say at this juncture\" even if it's rude, or cruel, or aggressive. Which is a lot more satisfying and logical. Also, often more fun :)\n\n. Characterisation for both heroes and most of the villains is well thought out and detailed. There are no black-and-white characters here, just people who make mistakes. The difference is that the good guys try to fix things, the bad guys double down.\n\n. Once you get past the prologue and chapter 1 (and a good adaptive save system means you don't need to redo those, or you can skip them easily), each story is very different. You do NOT feel like you're reading the same book 5 times with slight variations. Each of the 5 paths concentrate on one or two other side characters to allow them to develop further. You really do have to play all the paths to get the full flavor of the story. More to the point, you'll really want to. \n\nMy only quibbles is that some of the choices really do seem a bit random. Also, they do not impact the story. This is not a story where your choices will influence the end game in any significant way. There are a few key choices, usually near the end and easily reversed if you've saved, that will shunt you into a Bad Ending, but other than that, most of them are for flavor or to underline how the main character has evolved.  This is not really a quibble, since that's just the kind of game it is, but it's good to be aware of.", "timestamp_created": 1495770532, "timestamp_updated": 1495770532, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31962885": {"recommendationid": "31962885", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165913596", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1056, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497145412}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is absolutely fantastic.

This is an incredibly well-made game. I played the routes as recommended by Dicesuki and boy was I impressed. I absolutely love how the world is fleshed out more between each playthrough, so it's definitely worth it to play in order (Although I'm guilty of skipping Rumple because I didn't have enough time). If you love fairy tales, play this now.\n\nOverall, the writing was exquisite. I loved the pacing considering the length, but this is definitely a game you'll need to set some time aside for. This isn't some quickie otome. I can tell a lot of passion went into it. The music was also beautiful. I could listen to it for hours. And the CGs? God...Some of the best I've seen on a free game. Waltz definitely has my favorite gallery set of CGs...\n\nHere are some brief reviews on the routes. I'll try not to spoil\n\n[b]Rod[/b]: Rod's route was first for me. I was actually pleased with how the story handled the step-siblings trope. It didn't come off too heavy handed and I kinda enjoyed Lucette and Rod gradually learning to tolerate each other. Still, I didn't feel invested in their relationship that much. Rod's route is better suited for getting a feel for game as well as the setting and understanding the fairy tale curses. Good introductory route. \n\n[b]Karma[/b]: I was surprised at how much I liked him. Usually I'm not a fan of the \"vain\" type of characters, but Karma came off mysterious and humorous enough for me to stay invested in his story. I'm glad I did, because his route is actually where I started to tear up in certain moments. I was more emotionally invested in Karma than Rod, but still not \"sold\" as my number one route. It was nice to see Lucette more involved and show more initiative in this route, though. \n\n[b]Rumple[/b]: yeah...skipped him for now. I'll do his soon...sorry\n\n[b]Fritz[/b]: ....Why you do dis, Dicesuki? In all seriousness, if you want to cry ugly tears, play this route. In all the previous routes, Fritz goes \"missing\". You'll finally be able to find out what happened and how your loyal knight is involved in the plot. This one is by far the most heart-wrenching, but still utterly sweet. Both Fritz's and Waltz's route were beautifully written, but if I had to compare them...this one wins in feeling empathetic with a character. I feel like the further down we go, the more emotional I get. Fritz's route sheds a ton more light on the world of Angielle, as well as the other side-characters in the game. Prepare the tissues, folks. [spoiler]I desperately wish Varg had a happy ending, but I understand from a writer's standpoint why it had to end the way it did.[/spoiler]\n\n[b]Waltz[/b]: Although Dicesuki remains silent on their FAQ page, I consider this the \"canon\" route. Where to begin...I fell in love with Waltz way before I got to his route, and when I finally got there...I don't think I can go back. Waltz's story is incredibly endearing, but I'm struggling on how to describe it without spoiling. I think Lucette shows the most character development in this route and I found myself eagerly cheering her on through my tears lol. Definitely my favorite route despite my inability to write much about it. It simply has to be experienced. \n\nI'm definitely buying the fandisc when it comes out <3\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1495759380, "timestamp_updated": 1495759380, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31959587": {"recommendationid": "31959587", "author": {"steamid": "76561198356477206", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1824, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512705920}, "language": "english", "review": "The best otome/visual novel type game I've ever played.

I believe this game has twisted fairytales to another level. Going through all the routes and discovering every bit of the plot was fun and captivating to the point that i could consider it real in a way. It's free to dream after all, so why not have a tiny bit of hope that magic is indeed, or have been at one time, real.\n\nGood replay value for me. Each route held its own set of secrets. I started out just rooting for the characters i preferred but in the end, i played them all due to pure curiousity. There's a sense of joy in unraveling the mysteries. Wanting to know just how a certain fairytale was twisted into a curse fit for a character's life and how they're supposed to change from it. What lesson they're supposed to be taught. \n\nThe game also shows that in looking through different perspectives, you can end up with a different impression or opinion. Something that may seem bad, isn't really. Something done out of kindness, might not be. I had this urge to look deeper into the backstory. Hence, ended up looking through every route i could from good and bad endings to right and wrong choices. I like how some wrong choices don't always end at a bad ending. There seems to only be major choices that require a right one to trigger the good ending.\n\nGraphics: \nLovely. The art is well-drawn and the colors are easy on the eyes.\n\nMusic:\nThe soundtrack really syncs with the flow of the story. I like the song at the opening.\n\nCinematics:\nThe opening video is fun to watch. I don't seem to tire of watching it every time i start the game to play.\n\nStory:\nRich, satisfying and urges you to look into it deeper and at different perspectives. \n\nControls:\nEasy point and click. The usual for majority of VNs. The fast forward to the next choice button tends to get buggy time to time but when you choose to ignore the bug message, you can easily continue with your play.

I don't understand why it had to be romantic, the main character treated her step family horribly it easily could have been a route about finding peace with things you have no control over, and healing past wrongs. Which is the essence of the game anyway. Garlan could have made a good alternative.\n\nThe storyline with Rumpel was my least favorite, he was such an ingenuine character that I couldn't even empathize or care about him at all.

And there, in one we're almost whole time in the castle, in other we're stick to the tavern and in yet another we don't even have a lot of occasions to see people (\"people\" *cough cough*) that we were seeing constantly in previous ones. I've finished 4 routes for now and I'm definitly going to start the last one soon. Highly reccomended (y)\n\nps.

While Steam is a sea of shoddy free to play games, this is one of the ones that floats above the rest.\n\nEach character has their own personality, with each route featuring unique scenarios while following key plot points - each of which can and do change depending upon which route you choose. This makes each route interesting in its own right, despite the overarching goal being the same. The game does not shy away from being hard on characters. Background characters have their own stories, and even some 'faceless' characters have reasonable personality and worth here. Not everyone adores the Princess, and it's easy to see why from the start. She has a personality that is deeper than what's on the surface, but is believeably unlikeable for honest and realistic reasons.\n\nChange is not instant. It's gradual and commented upon. She never starts out with the goal of falling in love, rather the emotion develops naturally over the course of the characters' time spent with one another. Two-dimensional it is not, which is quite a lot to say compared to many games that cost money.\n\nThe writing is good. Solid, in my opinion and I feel didn't ever feel particularly awkward. The choice of music is excellent and often fit the moods of the scenes. Just as a free game can be good, the choices made from royalty-free music was also very well done.\n\nThe game's artwork is beautiful, though some of the CGs suffered from some awkward and sometimes stiff poses.

I only mention Hakuoki because it's basically the only \"good\" otome that's well-known here. In fact, it's a bit better, in my opinion, since you don't have to trudge through four chapters of common route every time you want to get a new story. What the hell?

Well that and the lack of quirky fan-fic writing styles that are rampant in indie games. I didn't have to lynch my inner English hypocrite in order to enjoy it, nor did I have to suffer extensive truncated sentences and redundant word choices that basically kicked me in the teeth until I was too concussed to be bothered by them anymore. Yeah. \n\nThe music is awesome too! I never tired of it.\n\nDownload this. Give me another one Dicesuki.

In a heartbeat.\n\nI was skeptical about this game initially because it was free to play, but the saying \"Don't judge a book by it's cover\" definitely rings true with this game. I honestly didn't know what to expect at the beginning, but I quickly became enraptured with the storyline, but this was mostly due to the characters in the game. What I'm probably most thrilled with is the main character's development, really well done there. I've partnered with almost all of the characters in the game, and I'm amazed each time at how different the story plays out for each character path. The endings are completely different for each person you choose to be with, and that's what makes each playthrough exciting and leaves me wanting more. Each potential mate has their own unique personalities and has a little bit of something for everyone, depending on your taste. I would suggest playing through each character, as each story reveals more about the lore of the world and the characters in it (Fritz' and Waltz' stories REALLY dig deep, you will not be disappointed).\n\nOverall, this game has replay value for me because I will want to experience the stories again and the characters within them. (Plus there's a handy-dandy fast-forward button to fly through the boring parts if you've already played through the scene once before.)\n\nFavorite partners in descending order (so far): Waltz > Karma > Fritz > Rod > Rumple", "timestamp_created": 1494438102, "timestamp_updated": 1494438102, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31669182": {"recommendationid": "31669182", "author": {"steamid": "76561198377180572", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1163, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501869396}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0414\u043b\u044f \u0431\u0435\u0441\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u044d\u0442\u0430 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u043e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f. \u0425\u043e\u0442\u044f \u0431\u044b \u0442\u0435\u043c, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0435\u0451 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0439\u043c\u0451\u0442 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0434\u043e \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0430, \u0437\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u044f \u0432\u0430\u0441 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043d\u0443\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u0446\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c\u044e. \n\u0427\u0442\u043e \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u0432 \u043d\u0435\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c, \u0442\u0430\u043a \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0442\u0438 \u043d\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0441 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u044f\u043c\u0438 (\u0445\u043e\u0442\u044f \u044f \u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043f\u043e\u043d\u044f\u043b\u0430 \u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043a\u0443 \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0435\u0439/\u043f\u043b\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0446\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0438). \u041f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0440\u0438\u0441\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0430, \u043d\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0432\u044f\u0437\u0447\u0438\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0435\u0434\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430\u044f \u043c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430, \u0430 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0436\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u043e \u043e\u0431\u044b\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u043a\u0438, \u043d\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c \u043d\u0435 \u0442\u0438\u043f\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \"\u043c\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0430\"-\u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0438\u043d\u044f, \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0437\u043b\u0438\u0448\u043d\u0435\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0439 -

I just had to do it on this one had to. This game is so good im shocked I didn't pay for it! There were of course as in all games some con's but all games have some sort of con's, and most of the cons are really just more my Personal option then problems with the game. So take my review with a grain of salt.\n\nPro's:\nFirst off the Picture's in the game were Beautiful! I loved them and it was obvious alot of effort went into this game just by the picture's alone. I loved when the face's started to appear after you Finished a guy's route it was really a nice touch! of course there were some picture's that were more Lackluster then other's but I can accept that as not every picture can come out perfect!\n\nThe Music was very nice and I liked listening to them they fit very well with the story! The intro's a little eh but even it grew on me after a while.\n\nThe routes. I bravo you for actually changing the plot for every route rather then using the same route for every character and just changing some scenes like some paid games I know *cough cough* Animal Lover *Cough cough* . But as with saying that one of the plot's Just felt Ehh to me In Fritz route and ill get to that in a minute but all in all the story was very Griping!  \n\nThe main character, I must say you did an amazing job on her! I grew from hating the main character to falling in love with her and wanting her to succeed! And which is funny because i actually expected to hate her. She's not super weak (Which is actually what I pefer in an otome game believe it or not) but she's not super strong either. She's a character I could actually relate to and understand where she was coming from as the game progressed. She wasn't as dramatic as i expected her to be and not as mean either. (Though i didn't play the bad routes..) \n\n Now Let's review the con's and to be honest I only have one\n[spoiler]  WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD: [/spoiler]\n\nFritz route.\n\nNow as I said before some of them were amazingly done (My favorite was Karma) however I will explain why i think Fritz route was really completly lack luster.\n\nOh lord where do I begin? First off I'd like to say there were barely ANY scenes with Fritz. Most of them were with Varg, and we got a couple of sweet scenes with Fritz in the begining but then that's it, he's basically gone after that and dosen't come back FOR A WHILE. So no character development should come in at that time right?  So You would assume romance dosen't either correct?!  Well for some odd and unexplainable reason the Main character is STILL falling for Fritz even when he is not in the picture. We see more of Varg then we see of Fritz in the whole damn game and whats more when we DID get a scene with Varg it wasn't even a nice or good scene but towards the end I STILL wanted to root for Varg  at least he had better charater development then Fritz did. Friz was a Goody two shoe's the whole damn time. Nothing was wrong with him at least with Varg you saw him CHANGING for the main character but no the main character only cares about Fritz. \"Where's Fritz,\" \"Give him back to me.\" Girl What has Fritz done to earn your love?! Yeah Fritz didn't want to kill you but towards the end Varg didn't either!!! The \"Happy\" ending with Fritz didn't really feel happy at all to me it just felt very lackluster and I really wish you had done something else with it, like I dont know Make Varg a secert charater you can pursue and with the power of magic gets his own personailty I dont care Just give Varg the happy ending HE DESERVES.What i'm saying is Fritz had it good from the start besides Hildyr he had no obstacles, No personality besides wanting to protect the main character and as the chapters neared the end I realized that's all Fritz was going to be and became extremely disapointed because I looked forward to playing him the most. Varg did more for the main character like try to change and try to overcome thing's like his master and treating her more gentle (HE STAYED WITH HER THE WHOLE DAMN WEEK WHEN SHE WAS SICK FOR CHRIST SAKE WHERE WAS FRITZ HMM HMM?!)  but she hates/Fears him!  Fritz dose practically nothing but, Avoid the Main character, Protect her only when in dire need, and come back because of dire need. and the main charater is hopelessly in love with him. Like what kind of bullcrap is this?  The charcter should not have loved Fritz is the point im trying to make she really should have loved Varg if anyone and this route was really to me a real con of the whole game.\n\nBut dont get me wrong I still love the game Proabably will replay it again sometime in the future and if this creater makes any games next time that cost money I will happily pay for it after this masterpieace and I highly reccomend this game even with Fritz route.

AND ITS FREE!!![/h1]\n\nI will definately say that I have enjoyed this Otome! Athough, I have goteen all the bad endings first (Some of which are so sad that I cried myself) I have thouroughly enjoyed the twists and turns of this storytelling of Fairytales that come into one place. And My heartstirngs have been pulled into so many directions that I couldn't help but love the entire cast!\n\nI will give my top Favorite Romantic routes in order:\n\nKarma: Flaymboyant? Yup. Slightly Narcisstic? Yeah, a bit of a flaw, Handsome beyond all compare? Definately. His rout and his Good Ending are definately something that I have come to enjoy. [spoiler]His Beauty and The Beast Curse was definately intriging, and Given the fact that his route plays after my Favorite Fairytale, I couldn't help but go to him first of all. It was defimnately all worth it, but watch out for his bad ending, You will come to tears.[/spoiler] Otherwise, He is my favorite of all the boys. Oh, and being a long-haired redhead was a plus, and his crossdressing is something that I have to say make me laugh and giggle all the way through. \n\nRumple: Oh gosh, his dramatic, over the top, and flirty attitude was something that I couldn't help but be annoyed by him. But Along with breaking his curse and going along his route, he became very endearing to me and showed me that he was very much more than just his flirty attidtude. Don't be too intimidated by his route, His route will grab and take you along for the ride. But if you want his good ending, here's a hint: [spoiler]Stay being the Ice Princess, and Rumple likes tsunderes, just throughint that out there for you if you are curious[/spoiler]\n\nRod: At first, being a bit conservitive in my veiws, I thought ar omance between siblings would be very much taboo, stepsiblings or no, I was a bit hesitant to try this route, BUT! I was plesently surprised of how the creators treated this kind of relationship. Due to his curse, that I will not mention because spoliers! BUT he is a very intreiging choice from the start. But thoughout his route, it was shown that due to the fact that they were not related by blood is possibly the only thing that saves this kind of relationship, taboo or no, I did enjoy this very very much. It was a bit bittersweet in his good ending, but i think that It was possibly the point. He still a cutie overall. \n\nWaltz and Fritz: I honestly believ that their routes were the longest I have played, which I didn't mind, but a bit too long for my tastes, but I still enjoyed their routes. They were wrapped in intrigue and passion, and amazing romantic tension in their routes, more so than the previous ones, but I have to admit that They also stole my heart as well. Their curses were practically and amazing twist of their fairytales and I enjoyed the twists and turns of how they turned out. But Beware! Their Bad endings are just as heartbreaking as the Others, but will strike you in the heart and pull you apart. Both have their looks and their wits, and I enjoyed their CG pics and I will still enjoy them. \n\n[b]Overall[/b]: I would definately say this is for very much the young woman and girl who want their fairytale romance with a twist. [strike] And the occasional male who wants to be romanced by hot men, I don't blame them![/strike] It is great for those who are starting out as beginners in looking for visual novels and other such otomes. The achievments are tricky to get and you have to really figure out if you made the right choice or not. Otherwise, just keep trying until you figure out which ones are correct. :)\n\nI really have enjoyed this game and will keep playing it to have the experiance all over again, and I hope that you guys have a chance to play it too. It may not be for everyone, but I think thatfor a free game like Cinderella Phenomanon, I'd say you have a damn good deal on this game. \n\nHappy Playing!", "timestamp_created": 1494316707, "timestamp_updated": 1494376072, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31640503": {"recommendationid": "31640503", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045934946", "num_games_owned": 176, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 179, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494303724}, "language": "english", "review": "A very creative story and  the best free game on steam in my experience thus far.

You could find a true masterpiece, a diamond in the rough, or a glorified choose your own adventure textwall. Cinderella Phenomenon is somewhere between the second and third. The ideas behind it, of a world brought into suffering by Grimms Fairytales via a curse that affects them in the way of the fairytale, is very clever. The characters are also very promising, with a temperous princess, a mute prince, a amnesiac playboy, and so on and so forth. \n\nProblem is, this game can't be bothered to do anything with that. \n\nTo start, this game hates you. Remember that. You are the bad person. Cinderella Phenomenon has this very odd, repeated habit of establishing its protagonist as 'like, the worst ever, you guys' yet in the end I felt more sorry for her than anyone else in the game. And there is no way to counter this. You either accept that you are 100% in the wrong and become a cloying sweetie who hugs her sister and dances in the woods, or bad end. Problem is that this takes away from player's ability to actually PLAY anything. You stop exploring a world and start saving at every question to ensure you get ALL of them right. It becomes less of an exploring experience and more like the game is yanking you from location to location. Now, this has been done right in other games -- just look to the Ace Attorney series if you want an example -- so why is it so bad here? \n\nBecause the choice is so LIMITED. Because what you say ultimately ends up having no damn effect aside from if you get even one question wrong, the ending chapter is different. But everything else is exactly the same. You still go here, go there, and ultimately only small chunks of dialogue are added if you pick the 'right' answer. This game just grabs you by the collar and takes you along for the ride. Because make no mistake, you are NOT in charge here -- the game is. Instead of the player playing the game, the game is playing the player. And its just boring, stupid, and infuriating. What if I WANT to argue with this idiot who is inarguably treating me like crap? Well, you can't, because you'll get a bad end if you slip up as much as once. \n\nSo positives are that this game has a great setting with a fun IDEA. But that's all it is: an idea. It's heavily dragged down by some of the most boring, annoying gameplay you'll ever find. You could go ahead and download this game, because its not like you're having to pay anything, or you could just save yourself the trouble and go read a book.

Be glad it's free and not $30.

This game is absolutely wonderful, [i] especially [/i] since it's 100% free. The story focuses on changing oneself for the better, and boy, they do one h*ll of an amazing job at it. The character development is so frickin' smooth and makes sense. It's not like one of those times where the protagonist (or any character really) suddenly has a drastic change of attitude (such as someone who is incredibly greedy suddenly becomes very generous because something happened due to their greed). This development is gradual and each major event has some sort of significance to the development of not only the plot, but the characters' personalities.\n\n   The protagonist, Lucette (name can be changed), is very well written and conceptualized. Her backstory fits the entire setting and plot as a whole. Her personality is fits her character role and backstory seemlessly and is most definitely [i]not[/i] cliche whatsoever. She's spoiled, cold, blunt, logical, and is quite a cynic (for a very good reason, poor girl) for a very good reason. Although she may be very cruel, she is still to some degree relatable and true to real life. Her dark (no, not [i]that[/i] kind of dark) past fits together with her attitude and disposition like puzzle pieces. And to be honest, she's one of, if not the best female leads I've seen in video games and written fiction. [strike] she's also savage af lol [/strike]\n\n   The love interests themselves also share the same relatability and realisticness, and also undergo the same character development [spoiler] Maybe except for Waltz? I don't remember seeing much development in his route it was mostly Lucette [/spoiler]. Their personalities, appearances and backstories are also very unique to each other.\n\n   The actual plot is very interesting and engaging, and also has a [spoiler] f*ck [/spoiler] ton of plot twists and reveals.

After beating the game, I can fully say that I'm glad I didn't brush this game off as another one of cliche meet romantic interest then happily ever after without character depth.\n\nMinor highlights: \n-great details to theme (i.e. bad end screen is different each route)\n-hidden cameo reference to previous game\n-background art is visually stunning\n-music and timing for the mood is great\n-FOR FREE!\n\nMain highlights:\n1) One thing that took me by surprise is the main character is not your typical sweet girl or blank slate, initially not likable at all. she does not go through a sudden change of character easily throughout the story, the change is rather on the perspective, she keeps her character intact. Unlike some other otome games, where there is sudden massive shift in character's personality just because you are on a different route like its a different writter for the script.\n\n2) Not just the main character, but the rest of the cast all have their own flaws and motives which are essentially explored in througout different routes. There isn't a fairytale perfect prince/romantic interest, and the imperfection really builds the character to be more believable. These imperfections are also not cut-paste stereotypes and sometimes diverge from fairytale. Thus, the few seconds of meeting the characters really don't give away how the romance will turn out or how they may react.  \n\n3) Each route is interaction and focus theme is different so it never felt like you are redoing the same story. It's more finding more pieces of the puzzle to understand the world, how it works and the characters in the story.\n\n4) Although the endings (good & bad) may not have been unique to many other otome games but it really fitted the world. I do enjoy how there is a short narritive to tie everything together once the game is complete that ties everything, It makes the player feel fulfilled rather than here is an acheivement unlock with say \"congratualation\"or \"thanks for playing\" picture exhibited in other games. The extra gesture is nice but I always find this emptiness or the lack of connection or meaning to the actual game. \n\n\nMinor criticism:\n-by utilizing the mouse to interact with the menu screen, load screen was too similiar to the save screeen. So I often save over my saves when I wanted to load previous screen instead. Maybe a different colour background could help seperate the two easier.\n-the romance in some routes may not be as furfilling as others due to the pace of events that happens in the game not allow enough time to give more character interaction. Also the emotional impact point may be stolen by other side characters (well developed ones) that the deep romanctic connection at the end lacked impact. This probably would be remedy in the upcoming fandisc.\n\nI enjoyed playing Cinderella Phenomenon more than I thought I would. It definitely has one of the more memoriable main character leads in otome games I've played (on par with \"Second Reproduction\"'s Christina). Frankly every character in their is quite memorable in itself making the story more enjoyable. Dicesuki is definitely one of the visual novel group that I look forward to seeing more works from.(Although I maybe biased from \"Locked Hearts\" which I recommend for an enjoyable  short cute otome with teddy bears). Their dedication and attentiveness to the player and the love for their creations really shows! \n\nPlease do check the game out =) \n", "timestamp_created": 1493758674, "timestamp_updated": 1493758674, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31508731": {"recommendationid": "31508731", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093141016", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493740251}, "language": "english", "review": "I got a bad ending just becaue Klaude died, but I didnt romanze him at all and instead of the story just continuing onwards after his dead I just get \"bad end\"..... erm, lol?", "timestamp_created": 1493740921, "timestamp_updated": 1493740921, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.335330", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31507911": {"recommendationid": "31507911", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071640278", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493654867}, "language": "english", "review": "This is my first otome game and to be honest I wasn't sure what I was going to expect. After playing mid way in my first round ( I chose Karma's route), I fell in love with the story line and I couldn't stop until I completed all the stories. It's not the typical game I would play but I am so glad I did. And it has a really good plot. I love how it delves into real situations of emotional abuse by someone close, not knowing what to do and learning how to overcome difficulties through opening up to the right people. The heroine, Lucette, is thrown into a life she cannot imagine which is a reverse Cinderella, riches to rags, after being cursed by a witch and has to overcome her situation by trusting people who are luckily kind  to help even though the rest of the town hates her for who she is. The story explains why the heroine is the way she is and why people misunderstood her.  In the end , she breaks her curse and lives happily ever after.\nEach story line you choose covers the plot holes and I do recommend playing each character twice to understand the full story.  My favourite routes  would be Karma, Walltz, Rod, Fritz and Rumpel. Though Waltz 's story wins hands down. (lol) Each story is so touching, has adequate humour and enough sadness to make your tears fall like nothing. Every ending is different and I loved the Bad endings as much as the Good endings. The choices you make are limited but they play an important role for what happens next. \n\nOverall, it was an exciting game to play and I'm glad it was Free to play as well.

I was in for a pleasant surprise.\n\nFirst, I usually cannot stomach otome VNs because the main characters are often too insipid for my taste. It's not about them being damsels in distress. It's that they always seem too eager to please, or they have such shining personalities that every passing pair of pants falls in love with them. \n\nThe MC in this game is a delightfully poisonous antidote to that, at least at the start. One great contributing factor is that, unlike most otome VNs, the dialogue here is more... rewarding if the MC stays true to self. She doesn't need to pander, which keeps her behaviour consistent and believable, and the developing lovelines realistic.  \n\nIt also helps that the plot isn't didactic beyond reason. There's still the standard trope of good vs evil, but it's delivered through storylines that recognise moral greyness to some extent, more so on some routes than others. I can get why some reviewers commented on the skintone/morality thing, but I personally liked those morally grey characters more, heh.\n\nThe prose is descriptive without being purple, properly QCed, and the music and art are both lovely.

I would have gladly paid money for it. \n\nPros:\n\n- The protagonist is quite different from the usual otome main character. She has a strong personality and she's strong-willed. She isn't a one-dimensional, boring character like so many otome VNs have. \n\n- The romantic options (5 men) aren't abusive or problematic. Several otome games feature men who take away the female protagonist's agency or treat her like a child. There are also certain otome games (which I'm not a fan of) that feature men who are r/a/p/e/y as f*ck (yes, Steam censors the word r/a/p/e). All of the men in this game treat the protagonist very well and don't interfere with her agency. \n\n- The game elicited many romantic feelings (butterflies), which is pretty important for me when I play otome games.\n\n- The story is very interesting and well-written. \n\n- Every romance path is VERY different from each other. When you read one character's path, there is no skipping read text when you go to the next character (except for the common route). The paths to the good and bad endings of each character are similar, but the endings themselves are very different\n\n- While the artwork can be slightly awkward a few times, overall, it's quite good. Beautiful illustrations of romantic scenes.\n\nCons:\n\n- Lack of diversity. Only two of the romance options aren't pale as f*ck, but even then, they're not particularly dark-skinned. Just a shade darker. Everyone else in the ENTIRE game is pale as f*ck. And this time, no one can argue \"Well, it's supposed to be Japan\" because this story takes place in an entirely fictional world, so there isn't any excuse for lack of people of color.\n\n- No female romance options. \n\n- A couple of typos; no big deal.\n\n- There's an effect that's slightly annoying. The scene shakes around whenever there's a shocking response from someone with exclamation points. It isn't too big a deal, but I thought it was unnecessary.\n\nOverall, this was a great otome VN and I highly recommend it to those who enjoy VNs.", "timestamp_created": 1493701371, "timestamp_updated": 1493701399, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 45, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.660153", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31499080": {"recommendationid": "31499080", "author": {"steamid": "76561198384784820", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1719, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1514128537}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was such a happy suprise.

Una excelente opci\u00f3n entre el mar de Otomes existentes, muchos de los cuales llegan a costar m\u00e1s de lo que valen.\n\nPara comenzar, al ser un juego gratuito, se esperar\u00eda que la calidad de Cinderella Phenomenon sea baja, pero el juego es s\u00f3lido, con un arte bonito, que a pesar de no ser perfecto es bastante \u00fanico. Adem\u00e1s de ello, la m\u00fasica es hermosa y emotiva, cautivadora desde el men\u00fa de inicio.\n\nLa duraci\u00f3n del juego es bastante respetable (alrededor de 3 horas cada ruta) y los finales no son dif\u00edciles de conseguir, mientras que la historia est\u00e1 bien planteada: narrada de forma simple pero llena de misterios que se van develando a lo largo de las cinco rutas existentes. Todos los personajes principales me parecen bien estructurados, espec\u00edficamente los prospectos amorosos, cada uno con un pasado y una historia interesante y un romance fluido, no forzado como en algunas otras novelas visuales.\n\nOtro punto fuerte en este juego es la protagonista, a mi parecer una de las mejores protagonistas que he visto en novelas visuales. Es fuerte y tiene una personalidad que cambia para bien con el paso del juego, una chica inteligente con la que es f\u00e1cil empatizar y tomarle cari\u00f1o.\n\nAl final de cuentas, Cinderella Phenomenon tiene sus peque\u00f1os detalles como cualquier juego, pero se pasan por alto con una historia tan original que involucra cuentos de hadas, unos personajes entra\u00f1ables y una calidad tan alta en todos los aspectos, que es dif\u00edcil de creer que es un juego gratuito.\n\nRecomendar\u00eda el siguiente orden al momento de hacer las rutas, para revelar poco a poco los secretos en la historia: Karma - Rod - Rumpel - Fritz - Waltz.\n\nTal vez para algunos jugadores sea dif\u00edcil entender el ingl\u00e9s, pero les aseguro que la narraci\u00f3n simple de la historia hace f\u00e1cil la comprensi\u00f3n del lenguaje.

L'histoire et originale, reprendre les conte d'Andersen pour les revoirs sous forme de malediction \"invers\u00e9\" est une tr\u00e8s bonne id\u00e9e, les personnages sont attachant.

Je crois que c'est ce qui m'as plus, trop souvent le personnage que l'on incarne n'as pas vraiment de background interessant, ce qui le rend plat ou aga\u00e7ant, mais l\u00e0 le fait d'avoir \u00e0 jouer un personnage aussi \"mauvais\" m'as donn\u00e9 envie de savoir pourquoi il \u00e9tait comme \u00e7a, cela donne aussi de la consistance au personnage, bref j'ai beaucoup appreci\u00e9!\nLes CG sont tr\u00e8s joli et le graphisme g\u00e9n\u00e9rale magnifique.

This is a big concern for me, granted if you go with the Rumpel Story (I havent tried the others yet) you find just as much behind her over time. I also feel the story after the second deed falls flat on it's face, and the ending almost felt like my decisions had no impact on the ending besides from the character I picked.

Los personajes bien dise\u00f1ados y fondos bonitos. Adem\u00e1s es importante que as\u00ed sea, porque los escenarios los est\u00e1s viendo en todo momento. Muchos juegos tienden a pasarlos por alto, este no. As\u00ed que creo que el balance del apartado art\u00edstico es, cuanto menos, bueno. \n\nInterfaz: en la parte inferior  derecha, vemos a nuestra prota (en un tama\u00f1o considerable) cuando habla y sino aparece un lirio blanco estilo vidriera/roset\u00f3n. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 menciono esto? Porque en algunos juegos, cuando la protagonista habla para s\u00ed misma o piensa, la pantalla se queda vacia, a veces con una interfaz donde el personaje es tan peque\u00f1ito que ni lo ves. Deja una mala sensaci\u00f3n que suele ir a m\u00e1s cuando esos momentos son largos. Pues bien, aqu\u00ed nos ahorramos pasar por ello. Otro punto positivo.\n\nHistoria: unas tres horas por ruta (o yo que me lo tomo con calma). La trama es muy buena. No es una estupidez de principio a fin, que de estas hay muchas. Poco a poco te vas dando cuenta de que las cosas no son lo que parecen, y de los peque\u00f1os matices. Mucho m\u00e1s profundo y bien estructurado que la mayor\u00eda de lo que me he encontrado hasta ahora.\n\nElecciones: aqu\u00ed siempre me pierdo un poco porque hay diferentes modos de plantearlo. Por lo general hay dos respuestas posibles (una con la que suena una m\u00fasica y la otra con la que no), y creo que en general tienen bastante sentido el identificar cu\u00e1l es. No creo que sea aventurado decir que sigue cierta coherencia, que si bien es lo deseable, no siempre se encuentra. No necesitas una gu\u00eda para jugar si no te apetece seguir ninguna, no se trata de un rompecabezas donde o te dan la pista alguien que lo haya jugado, o t\u00fa no llegas a la respuesta. En este sentido est\u00e1 muy bien hecho.\nRespecto a lo que podemos decidir y lo que no, aqu\u00ed la gente siempre entra en discusiones sobre si es suficiente o el personaje queda plano. No me gusta entrar en esto si no es muy evidente. Las opciones son las que son, creo que est\u00e1n bastante bien cubiertas y no fuerza demasiado. No he sentido que estuviese jugando con un personaje principal que de no haber estado, todo habr\u00eda sido m\u00e1s o menos igual. Cierto que al principio, quiz\u00e1s se hace un poco lento de empezar. Pero merece la pena insistir, es un buen juego.\n\n\u00bfA qu\u00e9 esperas?

For a free game, I didn't expect much, but I'm on the third route so far and I'm very, very impressed. While each route is relatively short (for a quick reader), they're very detailed stories with very good storylines. Apart from the prologue, none have shared plots or scenes, so it's unique with each playthrough, the stories are interesting, well-written, and engrossing, and the characters are interesting, too. Each route is long enough that I can actually see the characters coming to care about one another/learn about themselves, it's not just a sudden \"one day I'm in love with this person,\" which always feels hacked. The writers did a very good job of fitting each story to the fairytale from which it stems without making them obvious, and none feel too forced. The art is really good, too, and I love the character sprites.\n\n15/10, would highly recommend.

On the surface it's rather lighthearted, reminiscent of classic, good-vs-evil stories, but it is precisely that simplicity that invites further exploration, which then unfolds a surprisingly complex and well-thought out story throughout the different routes.\n\nCloaking such a heavy story in something as benign as a fantasy fairytale provides a very stark, very striking contrast as well, which, while not exactly a unique idea with how many fairytale adaptations have been popping up lately, is a refreshing take on an old subject. The art is quite beautiful, the characters are mostly all very charming (you know, different strokes), and the game as a whole is very well-done.\n\nI would also like to mention that after a while I found it a touch uncomfortable that almost all (not all, but enough for it to be noticeable) the characters of color in the end turned out to be either morally grey, or antagonists in some way, while the protagonists (or those wearing the facade of positivity) were almost all white. It's most noticeable in the discrepancy between the skintone of the protagonist and the mother (that was a bit of a \"yikes\" moment for me) or in the battles when multiple characters appear on screen at the same time, and while I'm almost sure it wasn't conscious, I would recommend keeping this in mind for future endeavors.\n\nIt definitely has some ways to go (maybe a skilled beta reader could have helped tie it all together a bit more tightly, remove or tweak some extra lines of dialogue that make some parts feel a bit clunky, and clean up something that is so full of ideas and obvious passion from the team), but overall, it is definitely worth your time.", "timestamp_created": 1493372913, "timestamp_updated": 1493372913, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505022", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31410531": {"recommendationid": "31410531", "author": {"steamid": "76561198172083998", "num_games_owned": 259, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493363488}, "language": "english", "review": "Best free VN I have ever played and one of the best I have played in general including ones I have paid for!", "timestamp_created": 1493364247, "timestamp_updated": 1493364247, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31409191": {"recommendationid": "31409191", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128996256", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1112, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509607387}, "language": "english", "review": "Can't believe such a good visual novel was free. <3", "timestamp_created": 1493357970, "timestamp_updated": 1493357970, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501562", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31407657": {"recommendationid": "31407657", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202315445", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498103475}, "language": "german", "review": "F\u00fcr alle deutschen Zocker: Gebt diesem kurzweiligen und liebevoll geschriebenen & gezeichneten Spiel eine Chance!

At first, you only have the ability to choose three of them, but after completing two of those three, the other two will unlock. The suggested path is Rod, Karma, Rumpel, Fritz and Waltz; the first three of which are the original choices.

If you enjoy visual novels, that is. In fact, the quality of Cinderella Phenomenon is higher than many games I've paid a pretty penny for.\n\nThis game is extremely well written. You can see my play time and not once did I ever tire of the story. There are also very few typos and for the amount of dialog there is, that's almost unbelievable. Music is excellent - also something I never tired of. Actually, I can't think of anything negative about Cinderella Phenomenon. Considering it's free, the only reason to not give it a try is if you're not at all interested in fairytale romances.\n\nThere are five love stories to pursue here that follow five different fairytales. All the characters are connected by the same plot but, still, each of the five paths are very different from each other. Five unique and gripping stories. You will have many choices throughout and though they don't really affect the immediate plot, they definitely have an impact on the ending. Also, just so you know, there are no half-naked women or explicit dialogs/scenes. A good love story doesn't need those.\n\nI actually debated quite awhile about writing this review because, as good as I (sometimes) am with words, I feel I just can't do this game justice. It's that good. I laughed and cried and gasped - all many times. Each story tugged at my heart. Then, on top of an amazing game, you add in Steam achievements, gorgeous gallery pictures, and access to all musical scores. How is this game free???? The way I play games: I download, play, and then uninstall. But if I uninstall Cinderella Phenomenon, it will disappear and I'll be sad. So this game will be an exception to the rule. I know I will play it again because it's better than most books I read for my book group. :p\n\nPlease give Cinderella Phenomenon a try and resist the urge to rush through it just to 100% it.

Bad case scenario you try, don't like it, erase it and no problem. It was free to play anyway. Worse case scenario, you don't try it and potentially miss out on a game that might have been a pleasantly surprising. So, try it. \n\nAnyway, my take on the game:\n\n--- Visually appealing. I have seen/played visual novels on Steam that are NOT free with \"way\" less appeal than the artwork of this game. Visually, I think, it competes with the bigger game titles easily. \n\n--- Plenty of depth and story. It is not a quick game you can skim through and finish with little time and effort. I tend to enjoy reading a lot and this was a plus to me. \n\n--- A decent amount of music backgrounds to compliment the story as you read. \n\n--- Plenty of dialogue options and choices. I also tend to like experimenting with those details. The only thing I will mention is that some of the choices you can make do not seem like terrible choices and too many will lead you to a bad end. Just saying. I had a difficult time figuring out Karma's personality, but in hindsight, I guess some of the choices that were not \"ideal\" made sense after you figure out his curse and why some of the choices might not be ideal. \n\n--- Many endings, two for each of the five main characters you pursue. \n\n--- I really enjoyed the fairy tale curses. One thing the story plot did was keep you on your toes with the main questions. 1. What is their curse? 2. Why did they get it? 3. In what way does that particular curse affect those characters. 4. and how do they end up breaking it? The fact that I kept these questions in my mind throughout the visual novel illustrates the depth of this story.\n\n--- The MC is not necessarily likable in the beginning, but she is not (by any means) a flat character because overtime she grows and changes. \n\n--- You may not like all the male characters. I didn't. I found it difficult to like Karma whatsoever simply because I could not shake the \"girly\" image from my mind after all that. I guess it makes sense after the fact as to why he dresses like a girl. I get it. BUT STILL. He was also a bit too arrogant for me. \n\n--- I am going to go out on a limb here and say [spoiler] Waltz [/spoiler] is the main male character. Why? Major spoilers ahead...[spoiler] It had the happiest ending (in some ways), he apparently loved the MC the longest (ever since the MC and him were kids), and unlike the other routes his story seem to wrap the end and felt more complete. Everyone gathered together to say their final farewells which they did not really do in the other routes. [/spoiler] I would recommend to do this route last. I also happened to have liked his route the most. \n\n--- I don't know. What I didn't like about this game? I did not care for Karma or Grumple and although I laughed a few times in both, I just didn't care for them a whole lot. The others were okay to play. I happen to like that broom character. It is a shame they only made it poke its character out from the corner of the screen once, but meh. There is such a thing as overdoing it. There were also other characters that brought life to the story and helped set the atmosphere well. I just do not feel like going into detail. Oh yeah. Varg's name is terrible. And also, [spoiler] he was a NEAT character and, in my opinion, a better character than his counterpart. Damn, I was sad to see him go =/ [/spoiler]\n\n--- There is zero voice audio. I technically don't mind a WHOLE lot. It is a nice extra feature, but I am a reader foremost and as long as it is a good story, audio takes second place. (Damn after playing a bunch of visual novels I do really like Japanese.)

I'm really glad Karma was the first route I decided to pick (The first route always leaves a special place in my heart lol).\n\nAfter Karma I decided to take Rumpel's route and it had a great story as well, though I didn't like his personality as much as Karma's.

Bitter and detached from years of neglect by her father and from her mother's constant warnings to her to avoid people, Lucette has a reputation for being the Ice Princess where most people she saw avoided her and feared her for unknown reasons. Despite attempts by King Genaro, stepmother Ophelia Widdensov and stepsister Emelaigne Widdensov to get closer to Lucette and convince Lucette to open up to them, Lucette remained distant to them. One day, one of the dolls Lucette has turned into a witch Delora who applied a Cinderella curse where Lucette is reduced to a peasant girl and her father and the guards at the palace somehow failed to recognize her.\n\nWith nowhere to go, Lucette ended up at the Marchen Tavern, where all people who were cursed go to and can try to find some way to undo their curse. At the tavern, Lucette is introduced to the fairy Parfait and Delora who told Lucette that the only way to break her curse was to complete 3 good deeds where her glass shoe necklace will eventually form a pair of glass shoes. At the tavern, Lucette is introduced to four people with a Fairytale Curse: Miss Karma/Klaude A.R.M. Almonte, a cross-dressing lost prince from the neighbouring kingdom of Brugantia with the Beauty and the Beast curse, Waltz Creswell, a street performer with the Neverland curse, Lucette's stepbrother Rod Widdensov with the Mermaid curse and Rumpel/Chevalier Du Mont a bespectacled man with a blank notebook and no memory of his name or past with the Rumpelstiltskin curse along with Annice Willowe, a former maid at the palace, Julien Valiente and Garlan Belrott, former knights at the Order of Caldira who help out at the Marchen and are non-cursed as additional supporting characters.\n\nAt the advice of Parfait and Delora, Lucette decides to partner with Karma, Rumpel or Rod to undo her curse and also help to undo her partner's curse over 10 chapters which can lead to a good or bad ending. Upon reaching a good ending, the title screen will have the character's portrait replacing a different coloured crystal icon. [spoiler]In subsequent playthroughs after reaching at least 2 different good endings, Lucette will also have additional unlocked routes with Sir Fritzgerald Leverton, her former knight and personal bodyguard at the palace with the Big Bad Wolf curse or with Waltz Creswell which can also lead to a good or bad ending. At least one achievement is reported and found to be buggy, it is recommended to save at least one good ending for the final playthrough and final ending achievement to be able to unlock the Happily Ever After and Never Ever After achievements correctly.[/spoiler]\n\nThe game has plenty of save slots to allow different gameplay and dialogue choices to be made during the game, with a red/purple/green/grey crystal popup icon to help players reach the good/bad endings of each route and the option to skip and fast-forward any part of the game. Each route requires approximately 2-3 hours to finish. Soundtracks, CGs and overall game presentation are great.

From it's non-existent price tag, wonderful characters, beautiful art and excellent story telling, this game is everything a good VN should be. \n\nCP takes those familiar fairy tales that we all know and love and gives them a little twist, making them the curses that plague the Lucette and the romanceable men. It's not done in a gimmicky way and never feels forced, it makes CP a breath of fresh air in a market when it still seems like a lot of otome/VNs are focused on slice-of-life, which isn't bad it just isn't new.  \n\nThe biggest thing that stands out to me in the this game and makes it memorable though is the MC herself. I was fully prepared to either spend the entire game hating Lucette or just uninstalling it and forgetting it after spending a few moments with her in the beginning. She isn't a person I would like to even be in the same room with. Lucette is rude, selfish, tactless, untrusting, and doesn't have a kind bone in her body, but as you slowly find out why she is this way, it makes sense. I quickly grew to love her and cheer for her as she went on her Cinderella journey to accomplish three good deeds. Lucette is flawed, and that's what makes her perfect. She grows throughout the whole story on every single route, and it's made even more believable since the game takes place over months instead of days. The relationships and character growth actually have a time line that make sense. \n\nThe romance options are all different and wonderful as well. They all have the same basic conflict at their core, but each story is diverse so you never feel as though you're playing the same route over and over again. My only complaint lies with Fritz's route as it almost felt as though he was....forgotten? I don't know if it was just me but I felt like we saw less of his story and more of another character, however it was still a well-written route.  \n\nAll the side characters are excellent as well, both the heroes and the villians. Everyone has a motivation for what they are doing, revenge, loyalty, love, greed, and all the characters feel full of life. I can easily say I loved all of them, even the villians. \n\nNow, the only problem I had with the game itself might have been a RenPy issues more than anything. There were a few times that the game would simply crash on me or it would freeze while transitioning to the next scene. I also had a few times where I couldn't use the skip feature despite having just finished that route, and also could not use the fast forward button in the prologue of the game. They were quick issues to fix and I was able to avoid some of them once I found what they were. \n\nThat aside Cinderella Phenomenon is certainly a game that I will still love years from now and I look forward to anything else that Dicesuke produces.

Music suits the atmosphere of the novel, and the timing is good too.\n\nBut I think the main attraction is the heroine, Lucette.

Of the otome I've played, this might actually be my favourite. Every storyline is different, no cutscenes are identical once you actually get started on a route even though some events happen in all five storylines, all five of the men are interesting and unique in their own ways but I found none of them distasteful, and the protagonist's journey to obtain three good deeds is constructed in a way so her character development is believable. It's like a really good book you just can't put down, but I don't think that description does it justice.\n\nI will say though, Peter Pan isn't a fairy tale in the way the other four are (that is, it's not a short story, it's a full-on book AND a play), but frankly I don't mind since I'm a huge fan of Peter Pan and Waltz's story might have been my favourite of the five. Also that's not really a complaint, it's a logic flaw.\n\nI went in the recommended order (Rod, Karma, Rumpel, Fritz, Waltz) by sheer coincidence, and it's the order I think it works best in having cleared all five of them. You could switch Fritz and Waltz, if you're concerned about being spoiled on how to break Waltz's curse, though, because how it's done is spoiled in Fritz's storyline, but Waltz's storyline also spoils Fritz's curse and Waltz tells you pretty early on how to break his, so either way you're going to have one of them spoiled.\n\nI'm struggling to understand why this one's free when it's so good- I've paid money for a few otome and not enjoyed them this much. I mean, I'm not complaining but wow, this one's really good, and I'd absolutely be interested to see more games from the people who made it. The act of not copy-pasting identical events between storylines might seem a small thing, but I appreciate that though this scene happens in all five stories, it's different in all five of them.

The art is gorgeous from the splash screen, to the sprites, and finally all the way to the backgrounds and the closeups. You can tell how much work the devs put into this and it definitely shows. The art style is what I would call a typical anime style, but that doesn't make it bad. \n\nNext, the music was beautiful. It wasn't super over the top and in your face, but it was exactly where it needed to be. It added the perfect amount of ambiance to set the mood for each scene. My only complaint would be that it could get repetitive, but really it's to be expected when you're trying to read through scenes over and over. It's a miniscule complaint really.\n\nThe storyline was well done. I enjoyed how every Fairytale curse has a slight twist, making the story more interesting while remaining similar to actual fairytales. This  would seem predictable,  but it allows the player to piece things together while still remaining in the dark, while simultaneously having an idea of what might possibly happen. I especially enjoyed each of the endings (for good endings) where there was still an almost bittersweetness to it all. \n(Here comes the fortune cookie bit) After all, life isn't 100% happy ending, there's going to be some sour with the good. \n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys some good fluff and good graphics.

This game I came on a chance when I watched a YouTuber play it. And I'm glad to say that this is one of the rare visiual/otome games I genuinely liked.\n\nFirst, I was instantly intrigued by the MC. She wasn't anything I've seen in a visual novel, where usually the MC is dense to a point where she lacks any character development at all. The MC was the oposite of what I expected from the usual. Her flaws were the best part about her, and it made her relatable. An unlikeable character, in my opinion, is better than some Mary-Sue. That being said,  my absolute FAVORITE parts of the game was the character development and writing style. It was realistic. Lucette didn't change overnight. She slowly became a better person through her actions and choices.\n\nMost importantly, she stood up for herself. She didn't let herself get mistreated or pushed around by anyone, even if they were the love interests. The MC helped herself and others become a better person. Yes, the game did use stereotypes, but it was well-done. It gave distinct traits that made characters unique and a three-dimensional person. I'm also very impressed that, while the game was fairly low-budget, the developers managed to weave a well-written story with depth and intrigue. The graphics weren't the highest of quality, but, again, even otome games with beautiful animation can have the crappiest plot and characters. \n\nVery long rant, but there was just much to say about the game! \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1491703871, "timestamp_updated": 1491703871, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31015352": {"recommendationid": "31015352", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035285721", "num_games_owned": 3763, "num_reviews": 403, "playtime_forever": 158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491519380}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]\"The story after the Cinderella story\"[/h1]\nComprehensive dialogues containing VN.

The music is beautiful and definitely helps to set the tone and mood of each scene (although I have to agree with a prior review stating the opening was a bit pitchy).

I laughed, cried, cheered and felt proud for the mc, just as I imagine she did as the story unfolded.

(I'm going by the recommended order) But, despite only having played one route , I can't even begin to even express how impressed I am with this game.  I have to say no pun intended that the story itself is phenomenal!\n\nI find the mc very likable ,she is cold, and  untrusting of others. However she is like this with good reason, and her growth in route is very realistic. Someone said they didn't think her actions in the beginning warranted her being cursed by a witch,and while I agree somewhat (because being the mc you can really sympathize with her) I would have to say in some aspects the curse is very necessary in her growth. For if you do play Rod's route first, you will see how her treatment toward her step family can be considered callous and cold. She does a very good job redeeming herself in the end though.And I In fact absoulutely loved the mc, I feel like she she often times comes off as tsundere in liue of cold and mean. Also for Delora while the curse may seem very cruel, I have this feeling she actually really cares deeply about mc. [/Spoiler : I mean afterall she was the doll that mc talked to every day ,and I would assume shared her emotions with.]\n\n[/ Spoiler: I legit got emotional when Lucette found out about her lineage, of being a witch ,and how her mother had actually forced her father to marry her. It broke my heart when she said \"no wonder father didn't care for me\" I hope to see some more clear reconciliation between the two in the other routes. Because Rod's didnt delve too much into it near the end. Although we do get some idea that her father did care deeply for her, because even after the spell that made him forget her existence, he did keep her room clean ,and told Emeliagne it belonged to someone special to him. Also Ophelia's blunder in her comment where she said he wanted to creat a better future for his child ,and then corrected herself and said children also indicates the dad's care for his daughter Lucette.]\n\nSo far I've only seen one clear grammatical error ,and I think it was during the tutorial in how to play.\n\n I will update my review once I play through more of the routes ,but so far I'm in love with this game.\n\nIt's so shocking to me that I was able to get such a treasure for free, I mean the art is gorgeous ,and the story is amazing and well written.\n\nI would have to agree with the person that said the intro song was a bit awkward ,but must also add that it can be easily  overlooked.\n\nI will update my review once I play through more of the routes ,but so far i'm in love with this game. Dicesuki you did an amazing job!\n\nUpdate: I have finished all the routes ,and suffice to say my eyes are blood shot from all the emotions that went through me playing them. I loved- absolutely loved all of the routes. I defintely think everyone should play in the order recommended because each route you get more and more backstory. \n\n10/10 would recommend this otome, and I would be willing to pay for a game like this.\n\nDicesuki, that ending will there perhaps be a sequel?

I wasn't expecting vocals so when those kicked in it became 10x more interesting! And the video itself was really well put together. The title screen looks lovely, in fact all of the art and UI look incredible - so much so that I can't believe this game is free! Now when I started playing all I could do was groan at the MC's awful attitude and horrible people skills. She's an awful person to start out with, and I could not sympathize with her in the least. This made me worried for how well the story was going to go and how much I'd enjoy it, but surprisingly (or maybe not? seems a little tropish) she does get better and eventually learns her lesson. In fact, watching her grow as a person was one of the most interesting parts of the game. I wasn't able to relate to her, but I enjoy her as a character.\n\nI was surprised to find out that you choose your route as an explicit option. No guessing the right responses to the right people to get the route you wanted; they are presented in a pretty list and you simply select one. You still have to get all of the right responses to get the good ending for that route, but that was to be expected. Speaking of that, the right choice indicator didn't work how I expected at all. If it's your first time through a route it'll make a small sound at some point after you made your choice (if it's right). If you've gotten the bad ending, it unlocks the fast forward feature which skips to the next choice, and the right choice indicator becomes a sound and a purple crystal in the top right. I think it would be nicer to have it indicate the right choice BEFORE you make it, not after, but it's not a big deal. Saving and loading is incredibly fast.\n\nThe story is incredible. Once I got to about Chapter 2 or 3 (can't remember), when things really start picking up as the MC meets some new people and is taken to a new place, I got sucked in. The characters are all interesting, and I was immediately curious as to everyone's backstories and why they act the way they do. After choosing Rod's route (I've decided to follow the recommended order), things pick up again and I started to really care about him and his problems. The partnership between him and the MC is a rocky road, but it seems to bring out the best in both of them and I loved that! A lot of plot points were fairly obvious and easy to figure out, but I still teared up at that bad end and felt the love with the good end :3 Now I'm eager to do the other routes to find out what thier issues are and how to resolve them. I'm not so much interested in dating them anymore, because Rod is best boy <3\n\nOh and there's cool visual treats like a simple bowing animation (yeah the portraits just bob up and down but it looks like bowing/curtseying!) or a special effect when magic is casted. I also like the inclusion of the MC's portrait in the corner when she's talking, and the super fancy font for names - so pretty! The game is unbelievable gorgeous and for that alone I wouldn't mind paying something for it, not to mention the incredible story is worth more on top of that!\n\nI only have a few nitpicks: there's a couple of typos and grammar errors, not many so far though so it's not a big deal. In fact, again, it is very well written! And I also wish there was a borderless window feature, as I was trying to talk to a friend while playing it and it was kind of frustrating, even with a second monitor. That's about all I can think of..\n\nI would definitely recommend this if you like visual novels/otome, fairy tales, and the subversion of fairy tale tropes!\n\nPS: I'd love an instrumental version of

game,Locked heart,right after it came out and i loved it.\nupon hearing they were creating another game,i was ecstatic and couldn't wait to get my hands on it~\ni downloaded the non-steam version as soon as it was released and moved my playthrough here as soon as i could.\nand i'll admit,i stayed up far too late last night eagerly playing through the routes.\nnow that i've finished all of them,i absolutely have to leave a review.\n\ni'll begin with the story.\ni found it to be a very interesting plot,and loved learning bits about it as i finished route after route- i love the fairytale theme,and found its betrayal very creative~ the idea behind 'fairytale curses' based off of stories,but twisted into something a little different feels very unique to me.\nand i may say this a lot in my reviews,but i mean it every time- i adore the characters~ by the time i was through,i was very attached to all of them~ (though i will admit to having some favorites [strike] *coughs* Karma and Waltz [/strike])\nThe art is very cute and enjoyable,and i love the colors and character designs involved.\nthe music in this game is also very good,and i very much enjoy the original music in the opening~\nanother thing i do want to mention is that i liked having the choice indicator option~ Personally for me,who sometimes prefers to know before hand if i'm making the right choices,it was nice to not need a walkthrough to know if i was doing well or not. though i also appreciate that you can turn it off,for anyone who prefers to play totally blind or just doesn't feel like its necessary.\n\ni feel sort of proud having finished- watching the main character come so far,as well- watching her grow and learn and form bonds with those around her.\nthis game made me very emotional at the end of it all,and i loved it.\nCinderella Phenomenon is- well,Phenomenal~ ;) hehe\nJokes aside,i really do highly  recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1491461840, "timestamp_updated":

Phenomenon is a free otome game and it absolutely should not be. I\u2019ve played far crappier VNs that I paid for real money for. The production value in this game is really off the charts with really smooth, pretty menus, appealing UI, and nice visual effects. There\u2019s no grammar errors, and the writing is competent and enjoyable - not the best I\u2019ve seen, and never really reaches sophisticated heights, but after going from Never Give Up! and Harmonia to this it felt like a breath of fresh air.\n\nYou play as a really mean princess. You are a jerk. Because you\u2019re a jerk, you get cursed with the Cinderella Curse. It\u2019s in reverse of the story - you no longer have your title, no one knows you, and you must do three good deeds to break the spell. This premise opens up into a lot of cool fantasy and some minor political intrigue, but I just found the protagonist so refreshing it overshadows a lot else. Your main character really grows and changes throughout the game, and you really come to understand why the is the way she is, and why she needs to change anyway.\n\nThe romance options (five of them, all boys) also fit around fairytale themes and they\u2019re all similarly cursed. It\u2019s light romance, nothing beyond some kissing, and holy fuck none of them molest the main character!!! Shocker!!! This whole VN is written at a young adult level - good young adult, but still young adult. It\u2019s decently long, with ten chapters in total (a prologue, two starting routes, and then seven chapters per route) but not long enough to really get into the real juicy parts of characterization. This was one of the few VNs (and games in general) to make me literally laugh out loud, though, so I\u2019m quite fond of it for that.\n\nPlease consider picking this up - you get a LOT of value out of 0 money.", "timestamp_created": 1516214251, "timestamp_updated": 1516214251, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.554780", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39408530": {"recommendationid": "39408530", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061714997", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1648, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 205, "last_played": 1515404742}, "language": "english", "review": "I can't beleive this was free.

I went into this game not expecting much, it being a free VN, but boy was I in for a surprise.\n\nPros: \n- First off, the story. I would say this is the game's strongest point. I was genuinely interested in the story, so much so that even if there was no romance- if it were JUST the story- I would still play it. \n\n- As for characters, I would say the game did a pretty good job. The MC in particular was incredibly interesting. So many times I have played otome VNs, only for the main character to either be a blank slate or as bland as stale bread. I enjoyed learning more about her and seeing her grow as a character, no matter how many routes I played. \n\n- The art is pleasant to look at for the most part (I really love the MC's character sprite). The backgrounds in particular were surprisingly detailed.\n\n- The music was nice and easy to listen to, always providing a fitting atmosphere to every scene. It never felt to repetetive.\n\n- The routes were a good length, in my opinion. They gave enough time to build up the characters so you could truly appreciate them, but never really felt like they were dragging on.\n\n- I cried\n\nCons:\n- I got so emotionally invested in a character that I had to put the game down for a week after completing a route because it wrecked me\n- Lowkey wanted a route were MC remains an ice princess\n[spoiler]- No happy ending for Varg[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1515893608, "timestamp_updated": 1515893608, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39312385": {"recommendationid": "39312385", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104470455", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 685, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 23, "last_played": 1515871828}, "language": "english", "review": "I have played a couple of Visual Novels here on steam and this game, by far, is the best visual novel I have encountered.

This might be the first otome that made me curious about all of the boys not just 2-3 \n- Story line - not just the main story itself and the boys' backgrounds but the way they made each storyline feel unique and worth of playing it to find out more about the boys and the protagonist\n- Endings - all endings (only played the good ones) depending on which men you chose as your partner had different consequences on the world and the other characters, this was truly a pleasant surprise to me\n\nThe negative:\n- I didn't feel like my choices mattered that much, it was more like a visual novel than a game but the great story made up for the lack of actual gameplay, I really enjoyed it :)\n\nOverall this game is 9/10 would recommend it to all VN and otome lovers out there and can't wait for other games from Dicesuki but I would love to pay for their games next time because I feel like I robbed them :D", "timestamp_created": 1515791464, "timestamp_updated": 1515791464, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39272742": {"recommendationid": "39272742", "author": {"steamid": "76561198265166728", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 942, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 942, "last_played": 1515731883}, "language": "english", "review": "great game, amaze story-- THE BEST PROTAG EVER I LOVE HER??

"english", "review": "Finally finished the game after finishing all the routes. This game is immensely satisfying. I'll assume you've read the description before reading this. It isn't groundbreaking in the storytelling or the visual novel genre, but it manages to pull off a decent story and retains that fairytale-like quality which initially attracted me to this game. The focus is largely on the guys, but some of the routes have a greater plot focus. While the writing says a lot of things are going on regarding the plot, most of the intense moments either have already happened or happen in the background, so don't come in expecting alot of action or intense thrills. The 5 possible guys you can choose to partner with(2 of which can be unlocked by completing 2 of the other routes) each have a curse loosely based off of a fairytale and had a fairly fleshed out route with their own strengths and weaknesses. I will say that the recommended route order in the description is worth following if you are more interested in the story, as that order ramps up the tension, but it's not quite necessary to follow it, and better to follow your own order, but keeping the locked routes, especially Waltz, last, like I did. Regarding gameplay, each route is broken down into 10 chapters, with the 10th route having two variants--good or bad-- based on your choices. You're allowed to make upto 2 mistakes before you get locked into the bad end, which seems somewhat harsh to people not using the right choice indicator. However, there is a sort of logic to the right decisions depending on the route, as I personally only needed help reaching the good end on two routes. Nevertheless, I still had a lot of fun reading this story. I can't pretend to be an expert in art and sound, but I felt the character and background art were beautiful and impressive for an indie game, with some of the face proportions being..off in some cases. The music was quite fitting, brings out the emotions in some scenes and surprising, given that it's royalty-free. I did like the opening theme and the main menu music, especially. I would say the time you take to complete this might be around 15-23 hours to complete every route, with each route taking around 2-4 hours depending on how fast you read. It's not a dark nor a light story to read, managing to stay somewhere in the middle(in a way, similar to the fairytales from which this is inspired). No nudity(aside from maybe a few shirtless moments, which, to me, seemed completely warranted, if a lil cliche), little gore(while it is mentioned in the writing, there is no gorey character art. However there is an animation with a black screen and blood spatter), and a few adult scenes(nothing beyond kissing) makes this a fairly safe novel for many to read, given how most visual novels need to use these tropes to make themselves interesting. This novel is worth your time and attention. It's surprisingly high quality, given its free nature, speaks even more for itself. I happen to be a straight male and I still enjoyed every moment.

The art, the design, the way the characters all have their unique facial expressions that are so beautifully drawn for every different moment.. There's so much build and release when you go through the story. I believe I could call it.. a well paced and lovely reward system that keeps you wanting more. Every choice is a challenge and a reward can either be earned or you'll sit there tugging at your hair because you chose the wrong one. But! My favorite part is that while you are making the choices, it's SAVABLE, so you can just load from that place and choose the correct one. I've never seen a visual novel so dedicated to looking out for its readers that it put that inside, so.. Brava! Honestly, sometimes I crave for more choices, more story, or roll my eyes in angst becaue of the cheesy personalities of characters when I read and play through visual novels but this was abosolutely FANTASTIC, and I will be looking up more games by the creator if they are available. There's just .. so much effort everywhere in this novel and it's so good that it doesn't even need voice acting to get your heart thumping to the time of the characters. I was truly, deeply engaged.

I'll admit, I went in with pretty low expectations since it was free (and I only tried it in the first place since it ended up in my discovery queue and had pretty art and I'm a sucker for VNs), but I love almost everything about this. The art is great, the characters are all wonderful and unique, and each romance is different and engaging - though some routes are better than others (which you like best is probably subjective). Lucette is also possibly the best protagonist I've seen in this kind of game, as she actually does grow and develop in every route, and the story is good just based on her backstory and character arc - the romances are just the cherry on top in some cases!\n\nI don't have any real complaints - just nitpicks. First, the game is sadly a little short. Depending on your reading speed it'll probably take somewhere between 2 and a half to 3 and a half hours to do the good and bad ending for a route. I would have loved if each arc was longer. Second, as good as the non-romance part of the plot can be, there are some routes where it really seems to overshadow the actual romance. For instance, a shocking number of choices in Fritz's route happened in relation to story stuff when he wasn't actually around and theoretically shouldn't have affected your relationship with him and therefore which ending you'd get. And while Waltz had a few really great romantic moments late route the emphasis was definitely more on the overarching plot and Lucette's character growth - the pair never really had any conflict or romantic tension. I liked all the routes and I DID like the overarching plot behind them, but the ones I liked the best were the ones that spent less time setting up a heavy plot to overcome and more time developing the relationship between Lucette and her love interest.\n\nRegardless, this game is wonderful and I highly recommend it - it has great characters, great romances, great music, great art, a pretty interesting story going on in the background of every route, AND one of the best protagonists I've ever seen in a romance VN.

However I do not like the game. I will elaborate.\n\nI finished the mute prince route and I played twice to see the true ending and the game was just interesting enough to push me to at least play upto that point.\n\nAs a male gamer I do not mind being put in the shoes of a female protagonist in a romance visual novel, however, I almost always find majority of the stories unappealing especially if written by female writers. It's probably attributed to psychologial difference between men and women; men tends to value logic while women tends to value emotions in general sense.\n\nThis game has interesting setting. A condescending princess who was cursed to turn into a homeless overnight, Fairytale curse, magical crystals and fairies and witches. However these never amount to anything fruitful. In the end you get a typical otome game like any other with a predictable outcome and all the interesting premises sidelined in favour of a typical romance plot. All setting, background, story elements are neglectable and won't matter much because the game puts so much focus on romance only.\n\nFrom Twilgiht to Cindrella Phenomenon, most romance fictions loved by youg female audience suffer from this problem; lack of strong plots. Characters act extremely dumb and illogical. I highly dislike this aspect in many otome games. For instance, in the game the protagonist will often go to bed and decide to deal with brewing plots later even after discovering about it because she is too tired and needs to go to bed. Utterly ridiculous stuffs like this happen all along, traitor plots are laughble both in its execution and complexity of 'political intrigues' involved, fairies and witches are there to just put the protagonist in an a predicament for the plots' sake. I won't explain in too much detail to avoid spoilers, but trust me on this; they will often make you go \"Seriously?\"\n\nIt's probably a fine or even good otome game for the right audience who typically don't care about anything else as long as the love intersts are charming. But as a male gamer, this game has weak story, plethora of plotholes, too much cliche, typical characters, and finally characters who are all dumb villains or heroes alike.\n\nI've experienced this quite a few times now that I don't usually bother with \"highly rated games loved by young female audience\" When you play those their stories serisouly suck and you are only left with a disappointment in the end.\n\nThis is a fine Otome game. I still wouldn't recommend this for gamers who are thinking \"The polical aspect/setting/story look intersting!\" when they read the download page because none of those are true. Those are simply disposable premises used to add a bit of a flavour to another typical otome dating sim.", "timestamp_created": 1515305452, "timestamp_updated": 1515438028, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.425000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39137152": {"recommendationid": "39137152", "author": {"steamid": "76561198362356636", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 243, "last_played": 1515289441}, "language": "english", "review": "The intro music feels extremely out of place with the heavy electronics sound and the lyrics a tad on the cheesy side compared to the rest of the story's soundtrack, which is more elegant in quality and much better fitting for the story.\n\nThe art is beautiful and crisp. The scenes where you're revisiting Lucette's memories are black drawings on parchment texture with more of a looser feel than the rest of the story's artwork. Although still beautiful, because there are so many lines, when it comes to illustrating shadow on characters I would've liked it to not be sketched in but rather filled. Maybe not with solid black, but a ghosted grey at something like 50% opacity but still a filled in area as all the lines can be a bit much to take in.\n\nI haven't done every character's route yet, but I'd like to eventually. On a side note, Delora is a wonderful character, I love her bluntness, sass, but also caring personality. She's my favorite, needless to say. But back on topic of characters, each are entertaining and filled with their own intriguing stories and curses, which are fascinating to see how they're implemented as a curse on each character, so it's worth repeated playthroughs to pursue each good ending for each character you can. Mr. Broom is exactly that, a broom, that helps Lucette clean Marchen Tavern, but it also serves as a little bit of comic relief with the speech bubble emoji faces and the way it literally pulls her along until the chore is completed. It was charming though took a little getting used to the first time I saw its emoji face pop up since it felt a little out of place initally, but easily accepted. Lucette's arrogance can easily become irksome to deal with, but the character development with her was well done, feeling natural rather than forced. While there are still instances where her old self manifests in some of her reactions, you can still see the growth with her character.\n\nThe beginning, before your choices matter too much as far as influencing which character's ending you get, can seem to drag on a bit, but the explanation for setting up the rest of the story and giving some insight to the history of the world (particularly the Great War), especially if it's your first time reading through the story, is useful and interesting. I do see this getting a little tiring with subsequent playthroughs, but if you already know what's going to be said you can breeze through it without having to closely read the text that's presented to you. As mentioned, your choices don't matter so much in the beginning until the end of Chapter 2, so don't stress too much about what you pick.\n\nAlthough I haven't played through every ending yet, I'd like to eventually. I'd recommend Cinderella Phenomenon for the replay value, the story, the characters, and the soundtrack.

It truly exceeds expectations. I'd like to give my two cents to support CP so I repost my tumblr review here.\n\nPROs:\n- The game is plot-driven (oh god, finally!). Developers have emphasized the fact that they boosted a lot of energy and resources into the plot. It\u2019s captivating and action-packed.\n\n- MC. One of the best (if not the best) otome heroines I\u2019ve seen. She enthralled me from the first lines (I\u2019m not exaggerating here). At the beginning of the game we see Lucette as a selfish, cold and arrogant person. She's alone and unhappy. Then she gradually experiences a great character growth. Truly refreshing for an otome game. I also like the balance of Lucette\u2019s character. She's independent, but she doesn\u2019t become an overly badass fighter. She's strong, but she stays feminine (unlike some western otome heroines whose gender becomes blurry).   \n\n- Various characters. Creators clearly took a step aside from usual otome cliches. Significant part of the story is based on the idea about fairy tale curses. Every main character has his own curse loosely based on a famous fairy tale. The curses are not revealed at the beginning and they are not plainly obvious since original fairy tales have been reworked. In some cases, these curses becomes a real engine of character\u2019s growth.\n\n-Side characters are very detailed, every one has a backstory.  \n\n-Beautiful sprites (I liked CGs less), great facial expressions. Beautiful backgrounds and interface.\n\n-The story itself is well-written. I\u2019ve mentioned the plot already, but the game is also packed with touching and even thought-provoking moments. A really 3-dimensional family conflict included.\n\n- Music is remarkable. Truly, the soundtrack is rarely notable in otome games.\n\n- Every route has two endings. It\u2019s pretty easy to make the preferable choice due to the \u201cright choice indicator\u201d that appears shortly after the choice is made. You won\u2019t need any walkthrough.\n\nCONs:\n- I can find faults of anatomical sort in the CGs, but overall the game is so great that it\u2019s easy to ignore. I believe that the team who has already achieved this amazing result will progress further, including the quality of drawing.\n\n- Some reviewers note that the game doesn\u2019t provide enough interaction and you just follow the plot, for example, you can\u2019t make Lucette completely evil, like in some RPG. I disagree with this point. There are many games now that provide a semblance of choice (not only VNs). And every time you end up following the plot. The best ones (like Telltale games) provide you with different ways to reach the final point, the very best games (like Witcher 3) create several endings, but it\u2019s not about the freedom of choice at all. When I start to play a VN I expect an interesting story so I don\u2019t mind that I won\u2019t be able to make Lucette an evil queen.\n\n- Some players note that true route\u2019s guy was too flawless. Indeed he\u2019s a bit too perfect, but it\u2019s doesn't seem like a serious problem. His route reveals all the mysteries of the plot and contains strong family scenes so an ideal boyfriend doesn\u2019t ruin it at all. Withal, he\u2019s really great.\n\n***\nAs for me, I enjoyed all the routes, but my favorite is probably Karma due to his complexity. [spoiler]His faults earned him a curse he deserved and he changes significantly during the game. The romance also felt very natural because of the characters\u2019 similarities.[/spoiler] Fritz route is also very tense. I won\u2019t make spoilers, but this route contains one of the strongest twists of the game and a really adorable character.", "timestamp_created": 1514924411, "timestamp_updated": 1514924411, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.679300", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38970883": {"recommendationid": "38970883", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081461464", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3769, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2428, "last_played": 1515271896}, "language": "english", "review": "Choose your own adventure.

I was pleasantly surprised.  The story is much more developed compared to SiM, and I enjoyed exploring Anna's phone.  The concept of the game was much more interesting than SiM, though I feel like it could still be better developed and hope the devs continue with this idea.  While the text speak used by the main \"players\" of the game was perfectly realistic, I felt that the primary antagonist of the game [spoiler]Simulacra[/spoiler] would not have the spelling errors I encountered in that character's texting.  For instance, the character used \"lead\" instead of \"led\" and \"it's\" when \"its\" was intended.  I know, I know, others might not have noticed or been affected by this, but I felt that the character would not have made those errors.\n\nOverall, the characters were better developed than SiM, definitely.  Anna was three-dimensional, and so were the characters we encountered.  Omitting Iris [spoiler]though of course allusions can be found in the website, thanks to the phone number and Morse Code[/spoiler], was a good decision.  I don't know if the plan is for DLC or sequels, but I look forward to a continuation of the Simulacra and/or Iris story-line, in this world where technology has a mind of its own.\n\nFor the devs:\n[list]\n[*]The ambiance is brilliant.  I love the room behind the phone, the lights flickering and the sounds around me.  It definitely creates an aura of suspense.\n[*]As far as jump scares, I agree with Night Mind, unnecessary, kind of lame, and ineffective.\n[*]What did solving the puzzles accomplish?  I mean, I don't know if I had to unscramble the photos and texts to progress, I just always do it to get it out of the way, but they don't, in the story, progress anything, really, [spoiler]until the Spark conversation with James[/spoiler].  Also they were really easy.  When you present me with a four-word scramble...come on.\n[*]Where is this supposed to take place?  The accents were peculiar.  It seemed like you were aiming for American, but you were using British spellings, i.e. favourite.  Is it meant to take place in Canada?\n[*]I did love the multiple endings, and felt much more invested in them than I did in SiM.  In particular, [spoiler]I just achieved the happy ending, and afterward, stared at the screen and said, \"Did I just get possessed?  I think I just got possessed.\"[/spoiler]\n[*][spoiler]Even if you're interviewing through text (for reasons?), why would you consider hiring a person to be a copywriter who makes that many spelling and grammatical errors?  I kept looking at my response options, and they were painful.  Yes, I understand you're not really applying and just trying to get information about James, but still.[/spoiler]\n[/list]\nAll that being said, I do hope you continue and would love to play any other games set in this world.  If you appreciate nothing else from my review, let it be: less is more.  Subtle horror is better than overt horror.  The idea that somebody might be in the room with you, where you're holding that phone, or the idea that you might lower the phone and see, I don't know, a floating disembodied head, was so much more effective than momentary flashes of the screen turning into something scary.  And if [spoiler]the final image had been the player lowering the screen and something vague and shadowy, or even a representation of the Simulacra, being there, and then moving toward the screen if you simply must jump scare, it would have been better than the shift in Anna's picture.[/spoiler]  It's the suspense that gets you, not the actual scare.  You don't have the suspense before the jump scares on the phone, just an image shift.\n\nNevertheless, public who have reached this far (or TLDR), I do recommend this game.  It isn't a long game, but I've spent...7 hours in it so far?

For such a low price I don't think it is a very risky investment, and if you are interested in narration in video games it could be a shame to miss it.\n\nI wouldn't say it's a perfect game, there is still room for improvement, especialy in how the game handles the player doing things out of order. But I would lie if I didn't say that I was glued to my screen from start to finish. Video games are truly different from non-interactive art forms, but sometimes it takes a game like SIMULACRA to remind us of it. To remind us that video games can create experiences that have never been made possible before.\n\nDespite some flaws, this game is a truly unique experience that I would encourage you to experience.  And to maybe leave a review when you are done with it, even if you didn't like it. Because I firmly believe that this is one of those games that can push the medium forward.\n\n\n\n\nABOUT THE SCARY ASPECT : for people who are put off by the \"horror\" element of the game. THIS IS KINDA SPOILERIFIC, SO DON'T READ FURTHER IF YOU ALREADY WANT TO TRY THE GAME.\n\nI am a bitch when it comes to horror games, and it is actually kind of a miracle that I decide to play this game.  Honestly, aside from a few jumpscares every now and then, this game is pretty chill. All of these jumpscares happen when going back to the main screen, so just lower the volume when pressing the HOME button on the phone and you'll be fine. Moreover (SPOILER) there is no jumpscare after the second backup reset, so don't worry after that point ;). All in all, don't be put off by the scary aspect of this game.

I had two minor complaints but in the end they didn't really interfere with my gameplay.\n\n1. Grey sounds like a cartoon character. However his voice acting can actually be averted by just hanging up on all his calls since he doesn't say anything meaningful outside his texts LOL\n\n2. Some of the text messages you 'fix' have multiple orders that make sense but the game only accepts one. But I found it;s not necessary to solve all the photos/texts to advance in the game. Usually the characters not-so-subtly tell you the minimum ones you have to solve to actually get info. At times I did feel like the text completion was a mechanic just to add more 'gameplay' besides just 'choose the answer'. But overall the messages were pretty easy to solve and it didn't really bother me.\n\nEdit: oh the other thing is that here are a LOT of typos in the text messages.

The game is not difficult: picture puzzles, word arranging, and some light fact searching comprise the bulk of the challenges. The meat of the game is in the dialogue choices, and this is where the replayability come from. You don't really get locked out of most options when taking/talking different ways, so you can express your moral flexibility without fearing that you'll reach a dead-end. As for content, they did a decent job of fleshing out with stuff that makes it feel like a \"lived with\" phone. The game does a good job of simulating smartphone usage with the apps, pics and their poses, vids, and social media content. A nice touch, is that there is a checklist of tasks that would help the truly clueless and serve as a guide for those looking for certain keystone events to play around with on subsequent playthroughs. This checklist is out of the way though for those who don't want hints on what to do next.\n\n\nOn the negative side, some of the voice acting, for me, was off if not \"unsuitable\". The delivery of the voice only lines truly felt and sounded \"rehearsed\". The VOs not sounding natural kind of sticks out like a sore thumb amid the aptness of the pictures and videos to a phone setting. The worst offender of this, sorry to say to the voice actor, is the Greg character. Truly, to me, it sounded like he was voicing a cartoon character instead of making a call, and it kind of took me out of the general mood of the game.\n\nI think, the ending, will be pretty hit or miss for some people as well. I want to liken how the ending progresses to one of the scenes in a movie, but that would probably spoil it a bit. It's just that most people that saw it back then went \"Wait what was that again?\" Don't get me wrong, I'm fine with the endings I got (two bad endings), but the way to the climax was tedious, especially since I don't know if there is a message skip button for when you are doing a replay and you know what is going to be said. A note on the endings I got, it seems like you get locked to a set of outcomes after some threshold. I know my choices at the end didn't end up changing any of my final options. \n\nAll in all, a decent casual horror sim game with some replayability, a fleshed out setting, hit or miss voice acting, and an endgame sequence (not ending, the stuff leading up to the ending) that'll make you go \"excuse you? whowherewhenhowwhywhatnow?\". \n\nFor now, at full price, it would depend on your affinity for games like these to buy it for around a 5 hour single playthrough (worth it if you go with the $1 per hour of gameplay mindset).

this game is probably \nBecause of it's story \n\nI myself might be too stupid to really understand the ending \nBut it seemed as in the ending i got the first time seemed to try to suck you into the ending to make you feel something i sadly didn't experience this\n\nI really like this game because i have a lot of questions to it too \n\nSPOILERS (sort of) \n\nWhat is the thing that kills them? \nHow does it work? \nWhere does it come from? \nIs it a demon or our own fear? \nWho is James? \nWhat happens really to Anna and Taylor? \n\n\nI don't know what to say\nBut after the first patch this game did something \nIt sort of made me scared of technology \n\nThe game showed us how dangerous the Internet can be\nSpark aka rebrand tinder\nShowed how dangerous it could be to meet a stranger

Sometimes, you just want to come over to your place. make yourself a cup of tea and just relax on comfortable chair and just enjoy some kinda easy game. Preferably, with a mouse only controls.\n\nBut to be honest, you need to be ready that games will be strange, or better call them weird or maybe even creepy in some kinda way, cause variety of the titles, that can be played with mouse only is pretty limited and you should expect only chinese visual novels, or some nonsense clickers, or easy tower defense games, or some puzzle logic games.\n\nOr it can be a game like Simulacra. I am not even sure how to call this genre, but what I really do know for sure - this game is completely stupid :) But, in a good funny way. They call it a simulation game, which is kinda fair, but doesn't cover the whole idea of this game. \n\nSo, you start the game playing as not a man, not a woman, just whoever the hell you are, sex is not specified in this game. You found a smartphone and this is where the whole stupid part is about to start. I mean like, imagine you are that person who found a phone, okay? What you gonna do? For me it's completely obvious and easy - if phone is unlockable, you simply need to find someone with a name Mom, Dad, Sister, Boyfriend, Dog in a contact list, call one of them and let them know that you found this device and return it as soon as possible. In case phone is locked, you just need to go to the police station and give it to them for the further actions. Easy as that, don't you think so? But not for our protagonist! Instead all of this, he/she decides to play around with this phone and read messages/mail, check web history, tinder-alike app - I mean like literally everything what you don't have to do, when you find someone's phone, cause this is simply embarassing. For the whole game I had that feeling that I was playing as a retard, who had no job, no personal life, no entertainment sources, literally nothing, so that phone was a greatest relief ever. \n\nBut, on the other hand, if that person wouldn't be that miserable and pathetic and wouldn't check that messages and videos on the camera roll - he wouldn't realize that phones belonged to someone who was desperately crying for help, stucked in some kinda danger. The more you click on that stupid phone the more stranger and uglier everything becomes, and you have to solve some kinda puzzles. All these puzzle things are more like \"choose the right answer\" in dialogues with a random people, talking about phone's owner, which is also a random person for you lol, which you shouldn't care about at all and all these combinations of answers lead you to different endings. Plus you have to recreate some corrupted messages, by putting words in the right order and renew corrupted photos by clicking on image pieces at the right order. Time to time, you will see ugly screamers on the phone, whose aim is to scarry you and like, to be honest, this one of the most ridiculous things in this game, cause I was laughing all the time when that was appearing on the screen, so I can't say that this game is a horror experience, it's more \"wannabe horror game\" , trying to be mysterious and creepy all the way ends up with a pretty shallow and a bit boring idea.\n\nHowever, I can recommend this game. It brings you some fresh new experience and can be funny a little bit plus you can relax after a busy stressful day by just clicking on the dialogue options and solving pretty easy puzzles trying to figure out what the hell is going on there. \n\nSo, to sum everything up!\nYou should grab this game if you: \n\n+ Feel like playing some easy game, where is no need for high concentration\n+ Are a Black Mirror TV show fan and like all this paranoic idea about how it can be bad somewhere in the future for us with all these high-tech devices\n+ Don't agree with me, that carrying a phone to the police station would be the best idea in this situation :)\n+ Just looking for a new experience\n\nAvoid this game if you:\n\n- Don't like illogical games, with a stupid protagonist who has no idea what the hell is he doing \n- Have no desire to try something new and unusual\n\nEnjoy!", "timestamp_created": 1516637633, "timestamp_updated": 1516637633, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.600323", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39536551": {"recommendationid": "39536551", "author": {"steamid": "76561198302543888", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1090, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1090, "last_played": 1516818797}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game, very fascinating how they did it!", "timestamp_created": 1516633540, "timestamp_updated": 1516633540, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39535793": {"recommendationid": "39535793", "author": {"steamid": "76561198355087980", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 332, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 332, "last_played": 1516632747}, "language": "english", "review": "I enjoyed the mystery and the actual mystery-solving in this game.

Also, the spelling and grammar errors went a bit too far, beyond what one might consider realistic.

I also think they did a great job with the interface and laid out relatively natural methods for you to do your investigating. The journey was definitely better than the destination for me.\n\nI am a fan of interactive storytelling, but the only thing you really feel invested in is finding out what happened to Anna, and if you're sympathetic, wanting to save her, since she is the only character you really get to know through all your interactions and discoveries. The biggest con for me is that the acting and voice acting was okay at best - at times a little too animated/forced - and I felt if there were more development for the characters, the attachment would truly tear us apart as we are forced to make more choices. Also, the creep factor disappeared for me personally once I got through to the ending.\n\nOverall, I do recommend the game, but not very enthusiastically.

Talk about checking all my boxes at once!  I'm in!!!\n\nOkay, so this is a little game about you having someone elses cellphone.  I beat it in a few hours, four maybe, and enjoyed the trip.  Everything you have to do in this game, you do with this cell phone.  You get to break into email accounts, search online registries for sex offenders, and catfish people, all in an attempt to find the ultimate truth.  It's like someone finally based a game off my hobbies.\n\nSo, the story is kind of linear, in that you work to unlock new areas of the mystery, piece by piece.  First, you get to play with texts and pictures, then you get enough information to open the email, then you can gather what you need to beat security questions...  I'd say the gameplay is about sifting through information to find what you need to move on.  You also get to talk to the phone owner's friends, and they help to move the plot along, or you can ask them for help if you get stuck.\n\nI say it's linear, but there are actually several branching paths that probably all end up in the same place.  Do you know Telltale games?  Kind of like that...  We might make a different turn here and there, but we're all on the same road with a beginning, middle and end.  Example?  Okay, here's an example...  You need to find out some information from this person through text.  Do you own up, tell them you're a creepo reading through someone elses phone because they might be in trouble, or do you try to bluff your way through, pretending to be who you're not?  Make your choice and either way, life will go on.  I don't think you can get stuck.  Then at the end they have a nice little screen that says things like \"You and 68% of players looked at the porn stash,\" just like a Telltale game.  (there was no porn stash...)\n\nIt's pretty creative storywise, and I'm not going to give anything away, but it looked like there were about 4 different endings, and I wouldn't be adverse to trying again sometime to see how things can change.  I only had two of them available to me, so I must have needed to do something else to unlock the others, and I'm not entirely sure what that is, which is good to me.  Means the game still has more meat to it.  It reminded me of another game I played called Her Story, and I didn't recommend that one because one play is all it's good for, but this one was more than double the length and I'd be happy to go again some day.\n\nScariness, it wasn't scary, but I'm pretty tough to phase.  It likes to make creepy noises in your headphones.  There's some image distortion, but I wouldn't call anything a jump scare, which is good, because those turn people off.\n\nTL:DR I had fun.

I really REALLY enjoyed playing this game.\n\nWhen I first saw the tag 'Horror', I was a little scared to play this. I'm not a fan of things that scare me, but I managed to get through this and had a blast. *There are a couple jumpscares obviously because why not XD* (I legit flip out at them and tell them to screw off haha)\n\nSo in short, Simulacra is about a girl named Anna who has gone missing, and you have to dig through information through her apps, photos, friends, and even people outside of her circle, in order to find out what the hell happened to her.\n\nAnd I mean you have to dig through a lot of information sometimes.\n\nHowever, it's not to say that it wasn't fun doing a treasure hunt. Whenever I figured out how to solve one of the tasks based on the information found in different apps, I felt overjoyed. This game makes you really look for the clues where it makes sense.\n\nAlso, by the end of the game, I almost felt like I knew the characters. They were very believable, and that's what really connected with me.\n\nOverall, I just love the idea of using solely a phone. It creates a constraint, allowing for so many possibilities and new ways to create and solve puzzles.\n\nI can say that I have only a couple complaints though.\n\n1) When you look through Anna's message history, you come upon these special messages that are in complete disarray. In order to understand what it said, you had to rearrange the words to fix the message. Sometimes, it was just really difficult for me to figure out what that sentence was. I sometimes maybe spent a little too much time and couldn't progress until I figured it out. Most of the messages weren't important enough to do this, except for one. To be honest, I'm probably just not very good at it.\n\nI only really decrypted those messages for my own curiosity, but because they weren't extremely important except for the story-important ones, there was no huge incentive to decode them.\n\n2) While I do like treasure hunting for those sweet juicy clues in the phone data, sometimes the hints are a little too subtle. I'm not extremely great at puzzle games, so I'll miss details, whether they are obvious or not. I think I took a break because I spent so much time trying to figure out something that was so obvious because I simply missed the detail in a sea of texts. Not a big issue, but I just wanted to point that out for the average gamer playing this. I mean I had to look up something once, so it's not bad on my end.\n\nAll in all, this game was just amazing, and I look forward to see what's next :D\n\n(Seriously though. I recommend playing this without any spoilers.

Wie viel bist du bereit zu geben, um das zu bekommen, was du glaubst zu brauchen ?\n\nMan kann viel rumspinnen, w\u00e4hrend man spielt.\nZwischenzeitlich dacht ich....spielt das Spiel mit mir? Handys k\u00f6nnen ganz sch\u00f6n creepy werden... Ich denke, den n\u00e4chsten Werksreset lass ich noch ne Weile auf sich warten *hust*\n\nDie Gruseleffekte waren f\u00fcr mich gut gesetzt, hier und da kam mal ein Schocker (aber bitte erwartet nicht zuviel, es war angemessen f\u00fcr dieses Spiel). Der Sound tr\u00e4gt auch dazu bei, man sollte unbedingt Kopfh\u00f6rer tragen und auf die Umgebung achten. Jumpscares? Hmmm ja es kann was aus dem nichts auf dem Bildschirm auftauchen, aber das sollte auch f\u00fcr sehr schreckhafte Leute machbar sein. Anna hat einen schrecklichen Klingelton, der hat mir im Endeffekt mehr zu schaffen gemacht.\n\nIch bin mir jedoch bei einer Sache unsicher: Es gab eine Szene, da bekam ich den Gedanken, ob dies Menschen mit Verfolungswahn oder \u00c4hnlichem Probleme/Unbehagen bereiten k\u00f6nnte. Der Entwickler h\u00e4tte sicher eine Warnung eingebaut, hmm... maybe I am overthinking this.\n[spoiler] Es werden - f\u00fcr mein Empfinden - dem echten Spieler zwei Fragen gestellt, die auf eine Pr\u00e4senz im eigenen realen Raum andeuten k\u00f6nnten.

Good scares and creepy atmosphere. Interesting puzzles, though I wish there'd been more of them. The acting is fairly distracting and spotty. There's quite a few wording and spelling errors in the text messages. Its great sound design, rich story, and surprising amount of content make it well worth its price.\n\nNow for the full review. I expected this to be more like a very polished version of Sara is Missing, but it's actually an entirely different story and manages to stand on its own quite well. In some ways, it's better than Sara is Missing, though in others it fails to live up to its spiritual predecessor.\n\nHere's one area where I feel like Sara is Missing did better: the acting in this game can be [I]really[/I] cringeworthy, particularly in the case of Anna's ex-boyfriend. It's grating how nasally and whiney Greg is, he's so annoying to listen to, especially since his voice actor seemed to think it'd be best if he shouted pretty much all of his dialogue. (Yes, I do realize that Greg is obviously meant to be an annoying character, but the actor's over-the-top line delivery makes for a lot of unintentional irritation being manufactured as well.) Everyone else, excluding Anna who gives easily the best performance, is mostly just stiff and awkward. Fortunately there's not a lot of acting in this game as it's all mostly text-based, but what acting there is really undermines the fear. I actually feel like the horror would have been more effective without any character interaction outside of the messages, instead having only old video clips and audio logs to listen to. It would have upped the isolated atmosphere a lot.\n\nAside from the phone calls, however, the interactions with the other characters are definitely one of the more positive aspects to this game. They all feel surprisingly realistic, and certainly help to enrich the story and world and get you invested.\n\nOn a downside, though, there's quite a number of writing errors in the messages, particularly in the areas of word choice and spelling. They don't render the texts incomprehensible by any means, but they are nonetheless distracting, which is the last thing you want when trying to deliver fear.\n\nThe sound design is really well executed. The music is very unsettling, and the sounds that play in the world behind the phone's screen are quite creepy. I actually thought several times while playing this that someone had breathed in my ear or that I'd heard knocking on my bedroom door. (10/10, y'all made my family yell at me for repeatedly shouting \"Come in!\" when there was nobody there.)\n\nI really like the puzzles in this game. The decoding of glitched messages and reconstruction of broken photos was especially fun and made me feel more engaged in solving the mystery. [spoiler]Finding Cassie's hidden phone number was particularly clever, mad props for how subtle that was.[/spoiler] I actually wish there had been more puzzles, I wasn't quite satisfied with just the handful given. It's not a big deal by any means though, and I guess it's better to have too few than too many, which would irritate the puzzle-haters.\n\nThe jumpscares in this game were pretty good. I normally hate jumpscares, usually due to the fact that there's too much buildup which completely blows the surprise thus begging the question of why it even exists, but here they came right out of nowhere the way jumpscares are meant to, thus making them really effective. The creepy distorted photo jumpscares in particular were well-executed.\n\nI'm going to be getting into spoiler territory from here on out, so if you haven't played the game yet and are considering doing so, avoid mousing over any of the following black bars.\n\nAside from the acting, I feel like there's just one other thing Sara is Missing did better: the story itself. More specifically, the end reveal. While this game executed its buildup a bit more realistically, the ending threw a lot of that realism out the window, which ended up hijacking most of the fear, in my opinion. [spoiler]The Simulacra is an undeniably creative villain, but it feels like it'd be more at home in a sci-fi fantasy narrative. It's not realistic enough, and in a game that relies heavily on its \"found footage\" style to elicit fear, that doesn't mesh. This is also not helped by its voice, which is not especially spooky. I didn't feel like it was inhuman enough, it actually reminded me a lot of the villains you saw in older Disney films: revelling in its own evil, in spite of the fact that it claims in one dialogue segment that it can't feel enjoyment. Its voice was much scarier when it was blurred and distorted in the two recordings, making it impossible to hear humanity in it, or to even understand what it was saying.\n\nThe villains in Sara is Missing were much better because they were people; not only that, but people who were the kind of crazy cultists you could see existing in the real world, making them feel all the more threatening and monstrous. You also couldn't interact with them outside of voiceless messages, which lent them an air of the unknown, amping up our fear due to our lack of fully understanding them.[/spoiler]\n\nIf I had to nitpick further, then I guess I'd say that I'm really, [I]really[/I] sick of the whole \"technology is bad\" moral. It's so overused and is already one of the most hammered-in commentaries out there, and this game contributes to it in a very \"beat you over the head\" sort of way. More than that, something about it makes me feel like the game thought this message was \"vital\" and \"needed to be said.\" No, it isn't vital, nor is it something that you need to say. Everyone has already said that dependence on technology can negatively influence your life and that the internet can be a very dangerous place. Please find something else to preach about.\n\nSo overall, yeah, this game isn't a perfect piece by any means, but it's still really fun and legitimately creeped me out.

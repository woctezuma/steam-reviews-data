The game follows Boston Low, a military specialist sent on a mission with a journalist named Maggie Robins, and Archaeologist Ludger Brink, to land on an incoming asteroid to investigate where it came from and to safely destroy it.\n\nThe plan winds up failing and the three astronauts are flown to an ancient alien planet, now a wasteland/ruin. Their main mission upon arrival is survival and to find a way home. This plan has many complications throughout and through puzzle solving and exploration more of the planet\u2019s history and the alien life that once inhabited it is revealed.\n\nThe planet is filled with beautifully drawn scenery and there are even some alien life forms scattered throughout. Even at the game\u2019s age, the pixel art remains gorgeous to look at and it\u2019s only enhanced by the game\u2019s amazing soundtrack. The music is not only enjoyable to listen to but it\u2019s also quite relaxing. It also holds up incredibly well in terms of quality, it sounds amazing throughout the game.\n\nI will admit that the puzzles in the game were often quite challenging to figure out. They aren\u2019t readily obvious and some of them require a lot of trial and error to figure out. The plus side to playing the game today is that there are quite a few guides out there to walk you through some of the more difficult puzzles. I also created a video walkthrough for the game which you\u2019ll be able to watch below.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed The Dig a great deal and I feel that if you\u2019re as into Sci-Fi as I am, you\u2019ll enjoy it just as much as I did. While I do admit that the graphics could be crisper and a bit more detailed, they still looked quite gorgeous given the game\u2019s age. I also felt that the music was easily one of the best parts of the game and it really added to the overall experience. The voice acting was pretty good but I will say that it felt a bit cliched to each of the characters professions/race. I enjoyed the game though and I definitely recommend giving it a shot if you\u2019re a fan of sci-fi like myself.\n\nIf you'd like to check out my full review or to see my final score, you can find the review here: http://www.endworldgaming.com/adventure/the-dig-review\n\nThanks for taking the time to check it out folks and happy gaming!", "timestamp_created": 1513393510, "timestamp_updated": 1513393510, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454545", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38333366": {"recommendationid": "38333366", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964641301", "num_games_owned": 850, "num_reviews": 155, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513369555}, "language": "english", "review": "This was the first adventure game that I've ever played. It came as a bonus when I've purchased my first CD + Soundblaster combo, along with some other demos from Lucas Arts. To tell you the truth, I didn't really enjoy playing it for the first time, but I guess it was because there wasn't much action involved. Either way, for some reason my mom became interested in this game, and after she advanced a little, I became more interested, that until we've got stuck. My cousin had played before, so he provided some assistance to us during our playthrough. Then some time later, my other cousin also had this PC magazine where you could find some hints to finish the game. Ok, so a lot was said, but what about the game itself?\n\nIt's one of the classic point-and-click adventures of Lucas Arts, where the game was based on a novel that was written by Alan Dean Foster (which I had the chance to read it recently, I surely recommend it to any fan of this). There's this unknown object in space, which has a risk of crashing into Earth, so this team of astronauts is sent to put a nuke inside of it and blast it into pieces. That's the basic premise that can be given, because everything that happens later can be considered spoilers.\n\nOk, so for an overall analysis: The story is great, it was a really nice adaptation of the novel. As for the graphics, you can't demand much, but I would really love to see a remastered version nowadays, especially because so many have been released recently. The music and sound effects are simply awesome, they definitely make you feel immersed in the environment around you. The characters are really well-built. The gameplay is quite simple, you don't need to rely on a complex menu of options to interact with stuff around you. As for the puzzles, they can drive you insane in some parts, so  there's no shame to browse any walkthrough to give you a hand.\n\nWell, that's pretty much it. What it started as a boring game for me, eventually became one of my favourite adventure titles of all time. I hope that you've enjoyed reading this review, and if you never had the chance of playing it before, I seriously recommend you to do it.\n\nPS.

Dieser Planet hat eine atembare Atmosph\u00e4re und scheint bis auf die Insel, auf der man landet, komplett mit Wasser bedeckt zu sein (vermutlich damit man eine \u00fcberschaubare Anzahl an Locations hat; bei einem ganzen Kontinent w\u00e4re statt einem Adventure nur ein Rollenspiel in Frage gekommen).\n\nDie Aufgabe des Spielers ist es nun, die Insel zu erkunden, mehr \u00fcber die Alien-Technologie zu erfahren und einen Weg zur\u00fcck zur Erde zu finden. Auf der Insel findet man zwar viele Maschinen, die von einer \u00fcberragenden Technologie zeugen, aber da der Planet anscheinend unbewohnt ist, wird man neugierig, was mit den Erschaffern dieser technologischen Wunder geschehen ist. Gew\u00fcrzt wird die Handlung durch die unterschiedlichen Ansichten der drei Charaktere, wodurch es mehrmals zu Streitigkeiten kommt. Unter anderem sind sie sich uneinig, ob die Menschheit f\u00fcr so fortgeschrittene Technologie schon bereit ist und wer die Expedition leiten soll. Man findet bei \"The Dig\" viele Parallelen zu \"Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis\", denn bei beiden Stories entdecken Arch\u00e4ologen phantastische Maschinen einer vergangenen Kultur, die durch einen mysteri\u00f6sen Universal-Treibstoff angetrieben werden. Weiterhin sieht man bei beiden Geschichten, was diese \u00fcberlegene Technologie in den H\u00e4nden der falschen Leute anrichten kann.\n\nDie Steuerung von \"The Dig\" ist (gegen\u00fcber anderen klassischen Adventures) sehr vereinfacht. Klickt man mit der linken Maustaste ein Objekt an, so probiert die Spielfigur, was ihr am sinnvollsten erscheint (\"Nehmen\", \"Angucken\", \"\u00d6ffnen\", \"Benutzen\"). Klickt man eine andere Stelle auf dem Bildschirm an, bewegt sich die Spielfigur in die entsprechende Richtung. Wenn man die rechte Maustaste dr\u00fcckt, erscheint das Inventar, in dem man Gegenst\u00e4nde anschauen und benutzen kann. Klickt man diese an, ver\u00e4ndert sich der Mauscursor in den entsprechenden Gegenstand, so dass man diesen auf andere Objekte anwenden kann. Wer nun denkt, da\u00df bei dieser einfachen Steuerung die R\u00e4tsel zu einfach sind, der irrt. LucasArts ist es gelungen, einige knackige (aber logische) R\u00e4tsel in diese einfache Steuerung einzubauen.\n\nDie Videosequenzen sind trotz VGA-Aufl\u00f6sung wieder erstklassig geworden; sowohl Szenen im Zeichentrick-Stil als auch die von ILM (Industrial Light & Magic) gerenderten Kamerafahrten. Die orchestrale Musik ist eines Kinofilmes w\u00fcrdig, und die Sprachausgabe ist gelungen.\n\n\"The Dig\" ist das ernsteste Adventure in der gesamten Firmengeschichte. Abgesehen von einigen zynischen Spr\u00fcchen hat man kaum Gelegenheit zum Schmunzeln, aber wahrscheinlich h\u00e4tten st\u00e4ndige Kalauer die Atmosph\u00e4re dieser spannenden Science-Fiction-Geschichte zerst\u00f6rt.", "timestamp_created": 1512994352, "timestamp_updated": 1512994352, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583333", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37860777": {"recommendationid": "37860777", "author": {"steamid": "76561198393821040", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1296, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511501981}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Clasico de toda la vida, en la infancia recuerdo haber jugado un demo y qued\u00e9 con las ganas de jugarlo desde entonces", "timestamp_created": 1511856354, "timestamp_updated": 1511856354, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37838069": {"recommendationid": "37838069", "author": {"steamid": "76561198383963167", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1618, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511654441}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es un buen juego cuentas con par de debilidades en su gui\u00f3n, ya hablando de su game play, se agradeces uno de los aventuras gr\u00e1ficas donde te dan oportunidad revisita zonas pasadas, esto el problemas puede ser muy tediosa exploraci\u00f3n es muy f\u00e1cil perderse en juegos por lo mismo.

But with so many other great adventure games out there, I simply can't recommend it.\n\n[h1]The Good[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Setting : Most of the game takes place on a far-away alien world. I have this as a positilve and a negative because, while it seems like the landscapes should be beautiful, the game is so low-rez and pixelated that it is difficult to really appreciate it. Needs a remastered-edition badly.\n[*] Musical Score - Wonderful\n[/list]\n\n[h1]The Bad[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Puzzles : The single largest problem with the game are the puzzles. I love puzzles, but you need to be able to understand the rules to solve them. Alien-world puzzles tend mostly to be \"try a bunch of inventory stuff with this blinky light and see if anything works.\" There isn't a lot of logic and reason exercised in the puzzles. And some of the puzzles are solved by, for example, saying a particular thing, to a particular character, in a particular place and time. That is: something almost entirely random that one would not try unless they had given up and wanted to simply try _everything_ (or found a walkthrough to get past being stuck). In any case: adventure games are made or broken on their puzzles, and aside from a few really great puzzles (maybe 10-20%), the rest simply aren't engaging.\n[*] Visual Cues : This sort-of ties in with the puzzles, but it can be difficult to tell what objects in the game-world are supposed to be. Is that a button or just some glint on the background texture? Can I interact with that glob of unidentifiable pixel-mash? (etc) It can be difficult (and not in a good way) to try to solve problems when you can't really see what something is, or the exact shape, or if it is part of the background or interactable.\n[*] Dialog : Cheesey and terrible.\n[*] Voice Acting : While the voice actors have incredible voices, a lot of the time it sounds like they are simply reading off of a script\n[*] Animation : Pretty bad. Characters move fairly mechanically. There are cut-sequences which might have been cutting-edge back in the day. Today I wouldn't even consider them for Saturday Morning cartoons, let alone a LucasArts title.\n[*] Visuals  : Pretty bad. It seems like the world should be beautiful. They have really good notions of color-theory, and a lot of the camera shots are well-chosen. But one simply can't appreciate it when the resolution is this low.\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1511437391, "timestamp_updated": 1513977593, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479440", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36973687": {"recommendationid": "36973687", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997193420", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 316, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511423558}, "language": "english", "review": "just love it", "timestamp_created": 1511423630, "timestamp_updated": 1511423630, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36885041": {"recommendationid": "36885041", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038101374", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 915, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509237718}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Um Cl\u00e1ssico do Point and Click, alem de uma trilha sonora de Grande produ\u00e7\u00e3o de George Lucas, s\u00f3 podia ser...", "timestamp_created": 1511400138, "timestamp_updated": 1511400138, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36866605": {"recommendationid": "36866605", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991419040", "num_games_owned": 1247, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511395735}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ucd94\uc5b5\ubcf4\uc815\uc73c\ub85c \ub9cc\uc810 \uc90d\ub2c8\ub2e4", "timestamp_created": 1511395783, "timestamp_updated": 1511395783, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36481797": {"recommendationid": "36481797", "author": {"steamid": "76561198256001928", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 386, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510529547}, "language": "english", "review": "It's good!

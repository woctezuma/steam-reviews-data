bundle\n\nOnce I read that whoever created Lakeview Cabin Collection must be a genius of the macabre ... and hell, he was right.\nA clear homage to horror films of the 80s, this puzzle game gives you for each episode (there are several, with very different themes and mechanics among them) a very clear objective to fulfill but with a great freedom on HOW to fulfill it. The result? As you explore each chapter you will experience terror, WTF, laughter, death, frustration, surprise, disbelief, more WTF, more frustration and in the end (after many many deaths) a great feeling of victory. His style of pixel art is incredible and very consistent with the theme of the game, granting freedom to the developer (and therefore the players) of trespassing limits with a boldness that I had not seen before.\n\nWill everyone like it? HELL NO, I love the game in its entirety but many characteristics that are part of its charm can provoke a deep rejection. The difficulty is very high, requiring not only a great planning of what to do but also an almost perfect timing and sometimes only blind luck. Careful planning can be transformed into a gore fest in a matter of seconds. You can start a chapter (or the whole game) without knowing what to do, who or what killed all your characters in the last seconds or what is happening in general and after several attempts ... continue completely lost.\n\nIf you manage to pass all that bitter taste and get to the moment when the sweet understanding comes, good for you, I congratulate you. This liquor is not for everyone, but for the people who will like it, it is an unforgettable experience.\n\nIn short, this is a game that you will love or hate, if you have interest in horror games, do not mind pixel art, grotesque humor and play blind a game where you need to die many times to uncover how to advance (and sometimes to move forward) I recommend it completely. For my part, this game has been one of the best things I have discovered in a bundle, I send my congratulations to the developer and I assure you that I will buy his next game at full price.", "timestamp_created": 1516137702, "timestamp_updated": 1516137702, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39337090": {"recommendationid": "39337090", "author": {"steamid": "76561198805647009", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 537, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4, "last_played": 1520769729}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u770b\u4e86\u5c0f\u718a\u7684\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u975e\u5e38\u559c\u6b22\u6e56\u8fb9\u5c0f\u5c4b\u3002\u6211\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f88\u5bb3\u6015\u6050\u6016\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u4eba\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u88ab\u4f5c\u8005\u7684\u5de7\u601d\u6253\u52a8\u3002\u6211\u5e94\u8be5\u6ca1\u6709\u52c7\u6c14\u6765\u73a9\u5427\uff0c\u53ef\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u4f5c\u8005\u7684\u9f13\u52b1\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u9a6c\u4e0a\u5230steam\u4e0b\u9762\u4e70\u4e86\u6b63\u7248\u3002\u671f\u5f85\u4f5c\u8005\u540e\u9762\u7684\u7eed\u4f5c\uff0c\u5728\u4e2d\u56fd\u4f60\u4e5f\u6709\u5f88\u591a\u7684\u7c89\u4e1d\uff0c\u52a0\u6cb9\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1515933303, "timestamp_updated": 1515933303, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.777778", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39321670": {"recommendationid": "39321670", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047554465", "num_games_owned": 211, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514752218}, "language": "french", "review": "Petit test en vid\u00e9o : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5xS7K5fOrQ&feature=youtu.be\n", "timestamp_created": 1515880885, "timestamp_updated": 1515880885, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39217883": {"recommendationid": "39217883", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020375036", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 256, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517089421}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ube0c\uae08\uc774 \uc808\ubc18\uc778 \uac8c\uc784.", "timestamp_created": 1515535456, "timestamp_updated": 1517164595, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39213613": {"recommendationid": "39213613", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054663623", "num_games_owned": 226, "num_reviews": 175, "playtime_forever": 810, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511044153}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't want to explain much out of fear of spoiling the game, but Lakeview Cabin Collection can be summed up as an homage to classic horror films while still retaining a strong sense of uniqueness and originality, and also managing to be surprisingly terrifying.\nAlbeit hard and sometimes even frustrating, Lakeview Cabin still manages to be charming and fun to play.

It most certainly doesn't hold your hand, and completing a level by surviving is greatly rewarding. In one, you have to kill three serial killers; in another you have to avoid a cultist family while collecting gas, and so on. There's a lot of variation and the game most certainly never grows stale.\n\nIn some ways, I really enjoyed this game and I want to give it a thumbs up. However, the boss fights are absolutely unforgiving. So much so, that a very tiny mistake can force you to restart the entire game.

The music is fantastic & the sound effects are great. Unfortunately the first Lakeview Cabin game was a flash game, so it wasn't included in this collection.

In order to defeat/run away from these guys you are given the task of setting up traps and collecting weapons in a not-so-linear little world.\n\nAnd it's hard... Like really hard, you will die, and you will die a lot, which really you know... When you are playing a glorified flash game which is all almost cutesy pixel arty... its a little patronising. And I don't mean to sound patronising, Lakeview cabin collection nails a retro pixel art world, it even start with a pixelly VHS going into a machine! Its spot on, really cool stuff.

and throw the dead bodies of your former friends towards Rednecks to defend yourself? Then this may be a game you should take a closer look.\n\n[b]Lakeview Cabin Collection[/b] is a collection of four plus one short games (plus another very short drug induced fever dream game) centering around well known horror movies. You start the game in front of the cinema which is at the same time the main hub to choose which episode from Lakeview Cabin III to VI you want to watch/play and also a mini-level itself. All movies have in common that there is absolutely no hand-holding. It is a sandbox experience where you have to figure out everything yourself compirsing with what an object does, where you can/have to use it and actually starting with what object you are holding since it is not always clear (due to the simplified graphic). This is often fun and interesting, mostly refreshing and sometimes really, really frustrating. Also in common is the fact that in every episode you can switch between four playable characters. But let's look at each episode separately.\n\nLakeview Cabin III is the \"first\" movie you can choose and also the simplest one. You and your friends are counselors in a camp and everything is fun until something murderous will start hunting you. The goal here is simply surviving and killing what is hunting you. Every item is always in the same place so you can slowly refine your strategy. Find the shotgun, try to chop it down with the axe or just burn it with fire. Or feel the despair losing one character after another.\n\nLakeview Cabin IV is the second movie. You and your friends ran out of fuel in front of a mansion somewhere in nowhere. You have to explore the surroundings and find four canisters and bring them back to the car. In contrast to the previous episode there is some randomization including the order of rooms and where what items/enemies are placed. Sounds easy, right? Did I mention the bloodthirsty Rednecks? Well, still easy. Did I mention the rat mutants?\n\nLakeview Cabin V is both fascinating and frustrating. Like episode III everything is always in the same place. Goal is to put an undieable killer to its final rest with the help of some demons. In contrast to all other episodes you can't really die here. It is more of a puzzle episode. But here the sandboxing gets really frustrating because the puzzles are really hard to figure out. Episode V appeared some time after the initial release. As such there was a community waiting for it and figuring everything out themselves. Brilliant idea on the paper but frustrating in reality since you have nearly no chance to get everything alone.\n\nLakeview Cabin VI is more action orientated again. It is more difficult in the puzzle aspect then episode III and IV but a lot easier than V. Problem is that you may be burnt out after episode V and not paying much attention to the obvious hints. In this episode you play a group of janitors, cleaning the space station after a party. Places are always same but item placement is randomized. This would be an easy job but someone might not have read the memo about not getting infected by alien parasites. And if you don't find it fast enough hell might break loose on the station in no time. And even if you find it ...... there is still good chance to die.\n\nAll in all there is much diversity in the episodes but you need to have a small experimentor gene in you (because using guides from the beginning would be boring as .....). In every episode there is also a small mini-game which can occupy you for some minutes. You can unlock those by completing the episode the first time.\nThe complete package is in total very enjoyable but you may find yourself burnt out slightly by episode V. Also do not be fooled by the cute graphics. The game can be - at times - surprisingly suspenseful and violent.\n\nPS: If you have any question just write in the comments and I will try to get back to them as fast as possible.", "timestamp_created": 1489439561, "timestamp_updated": 1491339732, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504607", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30436744": {"recommendationid": "30436744", "author": {"steamid": "76561198257550305", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3986, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519369028}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6211\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u6700\u597d\u7684\u5c0f\u6e38\u620f\n\n\u975e\u5e38\u5bf9\u80c3\u53e3\uff0c\u6c14\u6c1b\u6e32\u67d3\u5f97\u975e\u5e38\u597d\uff0c\u50cf\u7d20\u98ce\u90fd\u80fd\u8fd9\u4e48\u8840\u8165\u6050\u6016\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e00\u7ae0\u90fd\u662f\u6709\u5404\u81ea\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u3002\n\n\u795e\u4f5c", "timestamp_created": 1489195382, "timestamp_updated": 1489195382, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.598540", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30390987": {"recommendationid": "30390987", "author": {"steamid": "76561198363746431", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 647, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518769317}, "language": "english", "review": "amusing", "timestamp_created": 1488980310, "timestamp_updated": 1488980310, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30383064": {"recommendationid": "30383064", "author": {"steamid": "76561198317337254", "num_games_owned": 384, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1178, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517043473}, "language": "english", "review": "very good\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1488937559, "timestamp_updated": 1511686895, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30330011": {"recommendationid": "30330011", "author": {"steamid": "76561198196569879", "num_games_owned": 417, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516363450}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8ddf\u968f\u718a\u54e5\u7684\u811a\u6b65", "timestamp_created": 1488691736, "timestamp_updated": 1488691736, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 41, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.818980", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30305249": {"recommendationid": "30305249", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202645294", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1460, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516431769}, "language": "english", "review": "lakevovcabe is good but ep 6 sot harr a way to call fo help", "timestamp_created": 1488590851, "timestamp_updated": 1488590851, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30258863": {"recommendationid": "30258863", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066543878", "num_games_owned": 362, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489283440}, "language": "english", "review": "I was surprised this game had >90% positive reviews.

That means that this game is for you. The game is divided into several chapters and select them in the cinema, like movies. Each of them takes us in a different location and our goal is to defeat monsters or psychopaths and escape. This production is a pixel graphics game, which is pretty cool. Sound system is good, typical for horror films. As for me, I had a lot of fun and the game requires from us patience because it does not belong to the easiest games and every defeat is a lesson for us.

You play as multiple young people trying to survive against various baddies or monsters.  There is no apparent goal other than to survive, hence the sandbox.  You can pickup and use various things around the area.  Little is explained, not even the controls - they're meant to be contextual, as there is a button prompt when you are near interactable items.  \n\nHowever, I found the simplistic nature of all this combined with the cryptic nature to be a major turnoff.  I was basically walking around bored waiting for the bad guys to show up (takes a long time on the first area), then when they do I did not find myself engaged enough to even really desire to fight them - not helped by very short reach attacks.  \n\nI pretty quickly realized there are ways to spring traps on the bad guys, and that's probably the real way to survive, but the very difficulty in even understanding what does what, coupled with how quickly you can kill yourself (throw a lantern by accident in a room, you're dead).  I just lost interest really fast, as I realized it'd take a ton of retries and trial and error.  This reminded me a bit of a rogue-lite, in a sense, only without the scaling skill set you usually have to acquire in those games.  Of course, I have mixed experiences with rogue-lites personally - if you like them a lot, your mileage may vary.\n\nI get there's clearly meant to be some humor involved as well, and that just didn't quite work for me either.  Watching somebody else play would probably have been funnier actually, and I may give that a try one day.\n\nIf you really enjoy tinkering around in sandboxes, you may get more out of it though.

For starters this game is based off horror movie cliches and popular slasher flicks while at the same time presenting a unique approach at the horror genre. For a 2D pixelated game this one actually proved to be nerve racking at times. I can not describe how absolutly terrifyed I was the first time the killer showed up in LVC3. Moving onward the games soundtrack compliments the 80's/90's vibe the game gives off. The use of keyboard synths and dark ambient instrumentals proves to make the experiance all the more chilling. The game also has elements of dark and often crude humor such as going to the bathroom in order to drop a item from the ceiling or commiting incest in order to summon a monster.\n\nTo break down each episode and how it makes itself stand out from the others: \nLVC3 puts in the place of a group of camp conselours as they are stalked by a murderous duo on the island.\nLVC4 has you play as a band whose tour bus has broken down at a mansion inhabitated by cultists and a slaughterhouse where the Leatherface-esque \"Pigman\" lurks awaiting its next victim. This installment introduces a sanity effect in which as you kill people the screen reddens and various hallucinations occur.\nLVC5 has you playing as the standard 80's teenagers as they try to fend off a mysterious killer. This chapter has a unique \"underworld\" effect in which dead charecters can be \"resurrected\" which plays a key role in the episode. This chapter also had multiple endings one of which requires beating LVC3 without any charecters dying at any point.\nLV6 takes place persumably in the future on a space station where a virius has broken out infecting members of the crew and presenting you with the mission of gathering survivors off the ship and into escape pods while fighting against the alien virius. This finale to the series has a item transportation system eliminating the need to travel everywhere to get one particular item.\n\nThere are however a few things that I would like to see changed or atleast fixed. For starters the gamepad reccomended sequence at the start of the game seems unnessacary as I made large progress in the game using a standard QWERTY keyboard. Therefore I feel that this sequence is not important and should be removed. My second problem is that in LVC5 the killer seems to have a very odd spawn rate as at the start of the chapter the killer will spawn constantly often interfering with trying to preform the deathmarks ritual while later on near the end of the chapter he will almost cease to spawn causing long waiting periods in order to finish the chapter. \n\nBefore rating this game I should also point out that this game is equal parts skill and luck as you must have good reflexes and thorough understanding of the controls while at the same time it is possible to breeze through some areas purely off of random events or lucky item spawns. This all being said I would highly reccomend this game to any slasher horror fan or someone just looking for something fun and original. Personally I would rate this game at a 9/10. I hope my review sways your opinion of this amazing game and convinces you to buy it.", "timestamp_created": 1485483566, "timestamp_updated": 1485483566, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29351128": {"recommendationid": "29351128", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002252866", "num_games_owned": 515, "num_reviews": 206, "playtime_forever": 181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484661806}, "language": "japanese", "review": "[h1] B\u7d1a\u30db\u30e9\u30fc\u30e0\u30fc\u30d3\u30fc\u306e\u767b\u5834\u4eba\u7269\u306b\u306a\u308a\u3001\u751f\u304d\u6b8b\u308a\u3092\u304b\u3051\u3066\u30b5\u30a4\u30b3\u30d1\u30b9\u9054\u3068\u6226\u3046 [/h1]\n\n\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba4\u90e8\u4f5c\uff0b\u30aa\u30de\u30b1\u8981\u7d20\u304c\u307e\u3068\u307e\u3063\u305f\u30b3\u30ec\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u7248\u3002\n\u300c\u6e56\u306e\u7554\u306b\u3042\u308b\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\u5834\u306e\u30b3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u306b\u3001\u7537\u5973\u306e\u30b0\u30eb\u30fc\u30d7\u3067\u6cca\u307e\u308b\u300d\u306a\u3069\u3001\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u30f3\u30db\u30e9\u30fc\u306e\u738b\u9053\u30b7\u30c1\u30e5\u30a8\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306b\u304a\u3044\u3066\u3001\u8972\u3044\u6765\u308b\u6bba\u4eba\u9b3c\u3092\u5012\u3057\u3001\u751f\u304d\u6b8b\u3063\u3066\u8131\u51fa\u3059\u308b\u306e\u304c\u76ee\u7684\u3068\u306a\u308b\u3002\n\n\u5f3e\u304c\u306a\u3044\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30c8\u30ac\u30f3\u3001\u30ac\u30bd\u30ea\u30f3\u7f36\u3001\u30ab\u30ca\u30c5\u30c1\u3001\u30d3\u30fc\u30eb\u3001\u61d0\u4e2d\u96fb\u706f\u3001\u30c8\u30a4\u30ec\u6383\u9664\u7528\u306e\u5438\u76e4\u306a\u3069\u3001\u3055\u307e\u3056\u307e\u306a\u30aa\u30d6\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3066\u30de\u30c3\u30d7\uff08\u6bd4\u8f03\u7684\u72ed\u3044\uff09\u3092\u63a2\u7d22\u3057\u3001\u6575\u3092\u6392\u9664\u3057\u3066\u3044\u304f\u306e\u304c\u57fa\u672c\u3002\u30dd\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8\uff06\u30af\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u7cfb\u30a2\u30c9\u30d9\u30f3\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u306b\u6226\u95d8\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u305f\u3088\u3046\u306a\u4f5c\u54c1\u3060\u304c\u3001\u3055\u307e\u3056\u307e\u306a\u89e3\u6cd5\u304c\u7528\u610f\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3068\u3044\u3046\u30b5\u30f3\u30c9\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u8981\u7d20\u3082\u3002\n\n\u30af\u30ea\u30a2\u3059\u308b\u3060\u3051\u306a\u3089\u30701\u30a8\u30d4\u30bd\u30fc\u30c920\u5206\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3067\u306a\u3093\u3068\u304b\u306a\u308a\u305d\u3046\u306a\u96e3\u6613\u5ea6\u3060\u304c\u3001\u3044\u308f\u3086\u308b\u96a0\u3057\u30a8\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\uff08good\u30a8\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\uff09\u306b\u5230\u9054\u3057\u3088\u3046\u3068\u3059\u308b\u3068\u3001\u300e\u305f\u3051\u3057\u306e\u6311\u6226\u72b6\u300f\u4e26\u307f\u306b\u7406\u4e0d\u5c3d\u306a\u96e3\u6613\u5ea6\u306b\u8df3\u306d\u4e0a\u304c\u308b\u3088\u3046\u3060\u3002\n\u898b\u304b\u3051\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u30ab\u30b8\u30e5\u30a2\u30eb\u306a\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3060\u3068\u601d\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3068\u3001\u6bba\u4eba\u9b3c\u306b\u4f55\u5341\u56de\u3068\u306a\u304f\u523a\u3055\u308c\u308b\u30cf\u30e1\u306b\u306a\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3060\u308d\u3046\u3002\n\n8\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u98a8\u306a\u304c\u3089\u30c4\u30dc\u3092\u7a81\u3044\u305f\u6050\u6016\u6f14\u51fa\u306b\u306f\u30c9\u30ad\u30c9\u30ad\u3055\u305b\u3089\u308c\u308b\u304c\u3001\u300e\u30ad\u30e3\u30d3\u30f3\u300f\uff082012\u5e74\uff09\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u304a\u7d04\u675f\u7cfb\u30db\u30e9\u30fc\u6620\u753b\u304c\u597d\u304d\u306a\u3089\u3070\u975e\u5e38\u306b\u30aa\u30b9\u30b9\u30e1\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1484809086, "timestamp_updated": 1484809086, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.662651", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29278125": {"recommendationid": "29278125", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031953263", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 642, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496693546}, "language": "german", "review": "Wunderbar\nK\u00f6stlich\nAm\u00fcsant\nGrausam\nL\u00fcstern\nBezaubernd\nHerrlich\nHimmlich\nafsdgfhhhhhhhh", "timestamp_created": 1484499506, "timestamp_updated": 1484499506, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.451306", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29029094": {"recommendationid": "29029094", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114860788", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 595, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459530173}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a lot of fun and very creepy.

1484789251}, "language": "english", "review": "Lakeview Cabin collection is a continuation to the freeware game, Lakeview Cabin and it's just like it's predecessor.\nLakeview Cabin Collection theme is set around classic cult horror movies in the sandbox genre, that asks the question: What would YOU do if you were set in one of this movies?\nYou have 4 stages to choose, each of them is based on a different cult horror movie.\n\nLet's define what is a sandbox:\n\nSandbox comes from a literal sandbox where the children play and [b]do whatever they want[/b]...\n\n[b]THEY DO WHATEVER THEY WANT[/b]\n\nIn a sandbox game you have minimal restrictions and you can do [b]whatever you want[/b], of course there are tasks you can do, but they [b]are optional[/b] and you can [b]choose to do them whenever you want[/b]\n\nThe problem here is that those tasks aren\u00b4t optional at all and they come in whenever THEY want.\nLet's say you are playing the first stage LVC III (Based in Friday the 13th) and you are playing around the stage and experimenting with stuff randomly and suddenly... The killers appear and since they are impossible to kill unless you have a predefined strategy you die.\n\nThanks to it's sandbox nature the game is esentially a trial-and-error game, the cheapest of all games, you can't see the incoming danger [b]unless you already experiencied it or you readed a guide[/b]. This happens through all the game, since LVC III to LVC V.\nExamples:\nLVC III: You don't know when will the danger strike and when it does you are not prepared for it, since the first killer will take the first weapon he finds and will proceed to kill you, the only weapon he finds and cant do anything is the teddy bear which is found by taking a dump (I don't know how would anybody figure out that)\nThe second killer has a default weapon and is the fastest character, you need a strategy to kill him.\nThe third killer appears at a fixed location and [b]you can't attack her by the front, you need to attack her from behind and with a specific weapon, the only way of killing her is to be with the right weapon at the right location at the right time, thing that you won't know until you played the same level constantly [/b]\n\nOn top of the trial-and-error nature the game is also incredibly cryptic and it \"complements\" the trial and error.\nExample: In order to get a key you need to bang a woman in LVC III\n\nThe game on counted situations wants you to do puzzles in a very specific order, which is completly stupid since the game is non-linear and the puzzles are incredibly cryptic too, rarely they will give you a clue and when they do you won't understand it because the thing that it wants you to do doesn't make sense.\n\nThe worse chapter by far is LVC V, why? Because it's full of puzzles! Lots of cryptic puzzles in a very specific order!\nIn fact, let me pass you an image that \"explains\" you how to get the best ending.\n\nhttp://staycalmcursory.deviantart.com/art/Lakeview-Cabin-V-Best-Ending-A-Guide-638647616\n\nDid you understood anything? \nExactly.\nBasically the game wants you to die in 4 different way with each character\nsummon 3 monsters, 1 by building up a doll whose parts are hidden in the Limbo, summoning another by playing a videogame in a specific way and other by placing the characters that were killed in 4 specific ways in a summoning ritual.\nThe game needs that you go to 6 different doors in Limbo and that you 6 different things in a specific order, you also need to call 3 different number on a specific order, you need to know a combination show in a secret room of the previous stage, you need to get a strange box, you need to replay LVC III and throw the box to the third killer and I think you got the point.\n\nLVC V is all that is wrong in the game at it''s finest.\n\nThe game is not hard is [b]cheap[/b] with a lot of cheap traps and cryptic puzzles\n\nIt's a cheap game based around the horrible trial-and-error principle, with a bunch of cryptic puzzles that are almost impossible to resolve without resorting to a guide all thanks to it's sandbox nature, lack of logical clues and cryptic nature. \n\nThe devs had a very [b]very[/b] specific idea of how you had to do stuff\n\nThe game also has a combat system and it\u00b4s atrocious, the controls are incredible wonky and the main reason you can't properly defend yourself against the killers is due to this jaggy combat system that thinks that you must overlap the killer's sprite in order to damage it, the controls while are simple the problem is that they can be used for multiple things and they feel really wonky.\n\nOn it\u00b4s favor I can say that since the game is fractured in 4 stages it allows different gameplay and objectives, LVC III doesn't look anything like LVC IV and all the stages have different missions and gameplay strategies, for example, LVC IV has a sanity meter (it\u00b4s not like the meter matters there but meh)\nThe game also has cheap jumpscares but they can be counted with fingers of one hand\n\nAnd as a sandbox it also fails, the main point in the sandbox is to give you \"total\" freedom, here in sandboxes, the plot is optional, is a side story that you can choose to take while you do everything you want. Here, you \"can\" do everything you want but the plot still gets forced into your mouth, if you don't do what the game wants you to do you will lose, if you don't do anything in LVC VI, you will be a victim of the outbreak, if you don't do anything on LVC III the killers will get you as they will always appear, if you want to do stuff in LVC IV you can't because the people inside the house will kill you if you dont proceed how the game wants you, if you wanna do anything in LVC V, Good luck! You will never get anywhere. The threat gets forced in your mouth either way. Wouldn't it be awesome if we truly got total freedom? Like controlling the killers so we can recreate the way we want our cheap horror B movie? Like the game advertises as?\n\nWhile this game has an unusual pixelart aesthetic (Even then, it's not really THAT good) and good creepy tunes that can make the game genuinely creepy on counted situations but even the music lacks in a lot of moments and overall it's technic aspect can't compensate it's horrible game design and poor programming.", "timestamp_created": 1483325937, "timestamp_updated": 1486179079, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.358101", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28920400": {"recommendationid": "28920400", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967229781", "num_games_owned": 453, "num_reviews": 310, "playtime_forever": 776, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483311340}, "language": "english", "review": "Lakeview Cabin Collection features a romp of 80s style horror parody platformer-puzzle hybrids in which the goal is for your group of friends to survive the onslaught of a mysterious and clich\u00e9 killer. The 4 chapters start at 3 for some reason and each has their own team and theme. In Lakeview Chapter 3, it\u2019s a bunch of spring break types vacationing at a cabin haunted by a murderous duo.  Chapter 4 seems like a page pulled right out of The Hills Have Eyes with a little Texas Chainsaw massacre mixed in. Chapter 5 is a Jason-Freddy combination and Chapter 6 practically screams Alien. The content is all episodic and can be entered in any order you choose from the movie theater hub level.\n\nStages in LCC can be a bit cryptic as you start each one in somewhat peaceful conditions and it may seem as if there is nothing to do except wander around. This is an easy mistake to make as just about every stage has some sort of timer before various events are thrown into motion, potentially sealing your doom if you are not prepared enough. Each stage has a variety of weapons for you to fight back against the killers with, and careful use of combined forces is absolutely necessary if you want to be able to take them down. \n\nIf you plan on playing this game without a guide, expect to spend a lot of time doing trial and error before you finally figure things out. Some chapters are pretty obscure so don\u2019t feel bad if you have to pull up a guide for help as there are plenty in the steam community. Either way, I managed to put in around 13 hours in Lakeview Cabin Collection which is a great deal for the price. Worth picking up if you\u2019re into cheesy 80s horror movies and enjoy a good puzzle-mystery. \n", "timestamp_created": 1483312620, "timestamp_updated": 1483312620, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6,

School Game **\n\nThe Lakeview Cabin Colleciton began with a flash game on Newgrounds and since has evolved into a game with mechanics of the early days of the PC gaming industry but with some modern twists.  This will either make or break the game for you because you're given nearly nothing in terms of instructions and the puzzles and planning quickly ramp up to extreme difficulty.\n\nYet this is part of the game's charm; nothing is really explained and the best learning is through experimentation.  There's little you can rely on from other games to help you -- there will be no prompts, the clues will be subtle and the combination of pixelated graphics and a complete lack of any examination functionality means you have to learn by playing and trying different, sometimes ridiculous things.\n\nWhile this might seem like a negative -- and for some players it really will be -- there's the other factor that experimentation is a lot of fun, especially in the first episode.  Your failures and successes have the potential to be spectacular.  You're free to make the characters do anything you want, and a great deal of the hazards that apply to you also apply to most everyone else.  There's a great amount of darkly humourous value to be had in managing to kill someone with popcorn or exploding something with more force than what was expected.  You're free to smash your own allies with anything you can lay your hands on (including whole/parts of bodies) or engage in various kinds of lewd behaviour.\n\nEach episode has its own drastically different style and game play all while using the same engine.  Episode 1 (LCIII) allows for a lot of juvenile humour and is the most open ended.  Episode II (LCIV) is suddenly a lot more serious, which is surprisingly effective as it still retains some of the goofier elements like very make-shift weapons (candles, flares, bodies).  Episode III (LCV) is suddenly a full-on hardcore puzzle game (including retaining the modern design of being unable to actually lose).  Episode IV (LCVI) suddenly throws things in an entirely new-yet-old direction, and this doesn't even cover the Hub world with its hidden surprises.\n\nIncluding solving a puzzle using vomit in the Underworld.  It wasn't meant to be solved that way, but it worked.\n\nThe Lakeview Cabin Collection is a rare comedy-horror combination in the gaming world -- it's very darkly funny, and yet also manages to rank up the tension, suspense and horror (it's not scary, but it is unsettling and purposely becomes moreso if you analyze it).  \n\nPlus every time someone gets a rake in the face it makes me laugh.  Moreso when it's a menacing killer.  Who's on fire.  While psycho strings are playing.\n\nPROS:\n- Extremely imaginative and creative engine.  Almost everything has multiple uses.  Many things have hidden uses or amusing mis-uses.\n- Well done pixel graphics; starts out simple and then gets surprising.  The pixel graphics also match the budget-restricted feel of old horror movies.\n- The game FEELS like a series of horror cult classics with appropriate musical stings and over-the-top, pixelated gore.\n- Ridiculous combat.\n- Extremely clever puzzles.\n\nCONS:\n- Hit detection and consistency is off; it was designed so certain enemies really do need to be hit from the back but in a game where characters react to just about anything the no-sell comes off more like poor hit detection rather than being ineffective.  Thrown item hit detection is also a bit wonk, and some items can only be used once for no reason and with a lack of universal consistency it feels more 'off' than it should.\n- The complete lack of real guidance may turn off some players.\n- Some mechanics take a leap in logic; to fuel a minibus for example one must hurl the can towards the 'right spot' on the bus as opposed to putting in an object use button or automatically using it (like shells are automatically placed in the shotgun).  This stands out more when most objects are fairly intuitive.\n\n\nOverall, if you are a fan of horror, a fan of ludicrous game mechanics that lets you do things just because you wanted to, and enjoy some truly old-school game play from a time before established practices, this is probably the game for you.\n\nIf you prefer games that plainly explain things -- including mechanics and story -- you might find the Lakeview Cabin Collection more frustrating than fun.\n\nI received this game as a gift.

it (except for Lego Star Wars in a roundabout way). It provides you with no direction whatsoever as you're plopped into a horror movie scenario (Friday the 13th, Halloween, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Aliens) and forced to find your own way of survival. Despite the retro graphics (which are overdone in indie games at this point, but oh well) the survival challenge is extremely realistic. Things that you wouldn't expect to be able to kill you in a video game will kill you and things that look like useful items only end up being useful if used in a realistic way. It's definitely worth experiencing, but I recommend buying it on sale due to a few major omissions from the developer that damage the overall experience. Lakeview Cabin would be a perfect fit for local multiplayer, it would be seamless, but instead you're forced to play single player and awkwardly cycle through four playable characters at a time. The other omission is allowing the player to distinguish between throwing, dropping, and \"using\" items.

As the spook-time approaches us, it\u2019s times like these where it is a golden opportunity to get comfy, and enjoy the season for all it\u2019s worth. This game is prime for that. Done in the style of the retro days this game pays homage to the horror greats, in only what can be described as a horror-comedy-puzzle game. On the surface it\u2019s 4 levels. But it is so much deeper than that, with 2 secret levels, an epilogue and a plethora of references, possibilities and combinations, this game is not dull for a moment. Surprisingly enough it keeps you on your toes despite the pixel-ness. It\u2019s great fun to have everything fall to pieces in the blink of an eye. No matter how prepared you are, one wrong move, mistake, innocent oversight causes everything to come tumbling down and you, your dog and your friends are dead. It\u2019s a golden game with great atmosphere, fun times and enjoyability to be had. Regardless of the scenarios you find yourselves in, this game is suitable for both fans and newcomers to the genre alike. If you\u2019re interested in everything going haywire, confusion, spooks, and a fair amount of laughs, this game is for you.

This game is amazing for it's price. It's a complex puzzle box from the depths of hell! It's filled with all kinds of secrets, changing gameplay, gratuitous violence, sex, human sacrafice and amazing atmosphere for something that just uses the pixel graphics!\n\nThe game consists of four levels based on horror movies: Lakeview Cabin III, Lakeview Cabin IV, Lakeview Cabin V, and \"Cabin 6.\" I'm torn between whether I like V or IV more.\n\nIII is quite simple: Kill the killers before they murder each and every one of you in your drunk, naked sleep. There's a lot of ways, the zipline, burning them to a crisp, getting really ballsy and going toe to toe with them with a weapon (hasn't worked for me yet) or ramming a highly explosive motor scooter into them, and more! [spoiler]Hide the body, don't let him see it![/spoiler]\n\nIV is a loving sort of parody of Texas Chainsaw Massacre. You control a band who's van has chosen to break down in the worst possible place - an old mansion full of cannibals... and giant rats. The rooms change, the weapons change, even the secret rooms change with each playthrough! It's especially satisfying to beat the crap out of the cannibals and listen to that rocking tune when your sanity gets low.\n\nV is a more puzzle oriented. I've never seen the movie it's based on, but I think it's supposed to be based on Halloween. In this one, you will have fun killing your own characters to go in and out of the netherworld. This level is very complex. To get the best ending, you have to do things in the previous games. But the A ending is worth it if you want to see an ending where everyone is happy (as opposed to III and the unfortunate cannibals whom you will have no doubt wiped out to the last man)\n\nCabin 6 takes the story into space. One of the crew is infected with an alien thingy. You have to find them and quarentine them before they mutate. It's argueably easiest when you know the proceedure. Additionally, you have to evacuate the rest of the crew (if there's any left.) The aliens look pretty neat too.\n\n[spoiler]Cabin II is... an epilogue. Yes, you heard me. You go through all the other levels, and then you go to the dark door in the theatre and go inside. You get to see all the story elements strung together nicely. [/spoiler]\n\nThe only thing I lament about it is that the series is finished and that we will not get anymore lakeview cabin. But all good things must come to an end.\n\n...and that there's no soundtrack. I could listen to [spoiler]her song[/spoiler] all day long.\n\nBuy the damn game. Then go out and see some horror movies.\n\n\n\n\n[spoiler] Beware the sewers!

It has the puzzle-solving feel of old Sierra On-Line adventure games (e.g. King's Quest and Quest for Glory), in that there are several well-defined obstacles, which can be overcome in a variety of ways, limited mostly--but not entirely--by the player's creativity.  \n\nThe \"collection\" features four full games, each one a tribute to a set of horror films from the '80s.  Respectively, the games pay tribute to the Friday the 13th series; The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Hills Have Eyes; Halloween and A Nightmare on Elm Street; and finally Alien and The Thing.  The game's own lore recapitulates some major themes from these films as well, besides that of masked, blade-wielding serial killers: there are twisted family relations, backwoods satanic cults, revenge from beyond the grave, haunted video games, plus references to an in-game \"true story\" on which the Lakeview Cabin \"movies\" are based.  It's tempting to say more, but I don't want to spoil anything!\n\nIn each game, you control four protagonists--usually teenagers, the likes of which get butchered by slasher-movie antagonists.  In each game, you have a limited amount of time, and a specific set of resources--some hidden, some out in the open--to prepare for a confrontation with at least one serial killer.  It's your job to switch back and forth between your protagonists in real time, find whatever you can use as a weapon, set traps, and manipulate your tiny environment to your advantage, so that your whole team can survive a horror movie.  The creator obviously loves '80s slasher films, and the multitudinous references, alongside a compelling lore, will captivate anyone who's hosted a marathon of scary movies during Halloween.\n\nIt's best played with a controller.  I have a Mac, so I just grabbed a generic PS-type controller with a USB port from Best Buy, and it works like a charm.  The controls are incredibly responsive, and the interface is reminiscent of old NES games like Super Mario Bros 2, or Chip and Dale Rescue Rangers, where you can pick things up from your environment and throw them.  (The game's creater--just one dude--mentioned the latter NES game as inspiration, and it shows.)  Additionally, the game bears an inescapable similarity to Maniac Mansion--i.e. shifting control between characters to deal with antagonists, who move in a real-time environment.\n\nThe score, appropriately, is reminiscent of John Carpenter.  Most of it is triggered by events: stacatto strings punctuate every stab wound; plodding, low-register, single-note piano hits accompany the killers' approach; it's scored like the horror films to which it pays tribute.  As such, it's nothing you'll want to play in your car on the way to work--no more than any other horror soundtrack.  But it fits the game wonderfully.  You'll jump in your seat more than once, when masked antagonists suddenly appear from the shadows.\n\nThe detail in the game's environment is incredible; the author obviously thought of hundreds of things the player might try to do, with just as many hilarious ways to die as there are ingenious ways to win.  At times, the gameplay can be frustrating--BE PREPARED TO DIE A LOT, A WHOLE LOT.  DYING A LOT IS REQUIRED TO FIGURE OUT YOUR ENVIRONMENT, AND IT IS IMPORTANT NOT TO GET FRUSTRATED WITH THAT FACT ABOUT THE GAME.  (In part V, it becomes a downright game mechanic!)  \n\nWhen you get to part V, you may feel tempted to use a walkthrough, although I would suggest looking up as little as possible.  Just look up the Bible reference and the morse code parts (it was a dick move to include puzzles, which required such solutions... I say this, even though I think this is one of the best and most creative puzzle games I've played in decades).  \n\nThe art and graphics are pixelated, reminiscent of VGA Sierra games, like King's Quest I-IV.  There are a varety of sprites to accompany the variety of things you might try as a player; in all, the characters' interactions are hilarious, which compliments the horrific setting.\n\nSeriously, you get four interesting, creative, independently-made games for just ten bucks.  I would advise getting them, and NOT USING A WALKTHROUGH.  Trust me: when you figure out how to survive the killers, all on your own, in any one of these games, you cannot help but leap up and cheer.", "timestamp_created": 1469600977, "timestamp_updated": 1469692126, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.603779", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24471940": {"recommendationid": "24471940", "author": {"steamid": "76561198226675600", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514387461}, "language": "schinese", "review": "Great game\uff08\uffe3\u25bd\uffe3\uff09 \u597d\u6e38\u620f(\uff40\u30fb\u03c9\u30fb\u00b4) \u3044\u3044\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0(=\u30fb\u03c9\u30fb=)", "timestamp_created": 1469244399, "timestamp_updated": 1469244399, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24455771": {"recommendationid": "24455771", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157882327", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1079, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514375909}, "language": "english", "review": "i played this game ALOT and it is rlly fun i kept laying and playing for hours\n\ngreat\n-2d indie game \n-really smooth use of pixels\n-scary even in 2D :P \n-levels are fun are there are so much things to do\n-gore and the crazy killers\nshit\n-the story is strange and complicated \n-some of the endings are really hard\n\n\nWHERE ARE YOU WAITING FOR BUY IT NOW!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1469175899, "timestamp_updated": 1469175899, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511473", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24366190": {"recommendationid": "24366190", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127126999", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 388, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495504351}, "language": "english", "review": "This Game is so fun i love scary horror games and this game is the BEST", "timestamp_created": 1468732219, "timestamp_updated": 1468732219, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504587", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24361966": {"recommendationid": "24361966", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118421288", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 375, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468825170}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game but two things.

The episodes are connected by a hub world in the form of a movie theatre. \n      \n    You have four characters that you can switch between, but only one of them has to survive to win. Occassionally, you'll need two or more survivors to solve puzzles such as opening doors, triggering traps, or procuring items- but these are usually optional tasks. There are various items and interactable objects scattered throughout the levels, some of which are merely \"toys\" to mess around with, and some which have a practical application. Each chapter is completely open to the player to do as they please, save for a few locked doors and hidden items that require a brief task first. You will have time to explore a little before the killer spawns, but sometimes you can speed this process up by \"summoning\" it via common horror movie tropes such as having premarital sex. While the game is completely open, there is usually a series of steps that need to be taken to get the good endings.\n\n    As a gamer from the SNES generation, I absolutely loved this game for its Pick-Up-And-Play attitude.

Even then I'd say it's a matter of personal preference.\n\nNot particularly lengthy, but it doesn't have to be. It was still very engaging, fun, and still a bit creepy now and again. There are a few minor bugs, but they generally do not get in the way of gameplay and the dev has been fairly good at ironing them out as he hears of them so I have faith they'll eventually be worked out. \n\nI definitely recommend this.

Something.\n\nBasically, the premise is that you play through rip offs of classic horror movies. LVC 3 apes Friday the 13th, LVC4 apes Texas Chainsaw Massacre, LVC 5 apes Halloween, and the 6th is a combination of Alien and The Thing.\n\nEach level is an open ended adventure puzzle game, essentially, with each one having distinct objectives. For instance, in 3 you are simply trying to ward off the killers without all four of your teenagers (that you control one at a time) dying. In 4, you are searching a truly demented mansion and slaughterhouse for gas so the band you play as can make their next gig. In 5, you try to avoid a Michael Meyers esque killer while summoning monsters that can bring him down.\n\nThere's a lot to like with this game. For one, each level is very distinct from the others. The first is probably the most open ended and trial and error one, because it's a very small, confined setting. It's the one that is quite tough to figure out, but once you do, it's pretty rewarding. Plus, there are lots of things you can do in the environment, so it's fun to experiment. While 3 is relatively tame despite the gore, 4 and 5 ramp up the creep factor. Yes, believe it or not, this game actually manages to be pretty disturbing and creepy thanks to its sound design and creative use of visuals. Both 4 and 5 have an extremely macabre and dark feeling to them that 3 simply does not, and it's pretty welcome. \n\nI will say that certain elements stand out as flawed. For one, the layout of the buildings in 4 is entirely RNG, and it can glitch so that, without giving too much away, you can't continue. This is really annoying, as I've died more than once in that level simply because of the rng. Additionally, 5 is one I simply needed a guide for. Originally, I felt bad, but after actually seeing the solution, I don't, because it's very obtuse. Fun and macabre, but very, very obtuse.\n\nStill, this is worth checking out for people who love old horror films and are in the mood for something different. It's definitely not a game that holds your hand, and you may need a guide every now and then, but the wonderful mixture of humor and truly disturbing content as well as the open ended gameplay make this stand out as a real gem. I'm looking forward to the sequel, and hope that the creator refines it even more to make an even better game than this one.", "timestamp_created": 1464410089, "timestamp_updated": 1480218180,

My last one only told of my experience and nothing about the game mechanics. First off, you control 1 of 4 teenagers at any given time that can be cycled through at will. There are different ones in the 4 episodes that come with Lakeview Cabin Collection, although Cabin 6 is in beta currently, you can still play it. Each \"movie\" is set in a different setting with (obviously) different characters and maniacal serial killers. Some of them even have multiple killers... I'm looking at you Cabin 4...\n\nThe game really builds a sense of dread as you take down the killer with one blast and you approach him to see if he's dead he'll inevitably pop up, bash you, take your weapon and murder you. From that, you'll be so shook up, while you may have 3 more characters to formulate a plan, they will likely all perish in a rather gory fashion until you wise up and search for more supplies hidden and use them to your advantage with your surroundings. \n\nThe game does not shy away from dark and gory subject matter either as a lot of my screenshots can attest. All in all, it keeps the surprises coming. It consistently will make you jump. You know the little pixellated killer may pop out or is just on the other side of the door, your heart rate won't care, it will climb. You will get panicked. Then you'll die and try again. It's a very fun game that has basic puzzles you uncover through exploration and using the tools at hand rather logically. \n\nSound also plays a major role. You may find certain items by listening when you throw something... is that a sock that sounds metallic when thrown? Must be something inside... Is the music ratcheting up when nearing a door? That psychopath may be ready to pounce out... just maybe... \n\nIt's impressive what a one-man team was able to produce on this. The level of detail for pixel graphics and the sound is impressive. Wind chimes blow in the breeze. There's a day/night cycle with some light weather effects.

However, once you get the hang of it, it's like 2nd nature. Trying not to fall and break your characters legs is another challenge if your not so careful, like me. \nIt is quite difficult to survive the experience with all characters still alive but not impossible.\n\nThe ultimate aim of the game is to spend 2 days searching through the area, obtaining items and setting up traps and hiding your dogge to survive against the murderers that attack on your second night. I dont want to give away too much of the rest of the chapters, it really is worth checking out yourself.\n\nComing out in this episodic fashion, which is great because by the time it takes for them to release a new chapter you should hopefully have gotten through the previous one. \n\nIn conclusion its a great game, and definitely woth the cost. (Much better than the actual Friday the 13th Games, hopefully the new game redeems all of that).", "timestamp_created": 1460706691, "timestamp_updated": 1460706733, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22420858": {"recommendationid": "22420858", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091076616", "num_games_owned": 283, "num_reviews": 150, "playtime_forever": 644, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511612952}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0420\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f  \u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f\u043c \u0440\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e \u0445\u043e\u0440\u0440\u043e\u0440\u0430. \u041c\u043d\u0435 \u0435\u0449\u0435 \u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0431\u044b\u043b\u043e \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0448\u043d\u043e, \u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043f\u0438\u043a\u0441\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u0430\u043d\u044c\u044f\u043a \u0434\u043e\u0433\u043e\u043d\u044f\u0435\u0442 \u0442\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u044f. \u0412 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435 3 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0438 (\u043f\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043c  \u041f\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0438\u0446\u044b 13 \u043f\u0440\u043e \u043b\u0430\u0433\u0435\u0440\u044c, \u0422\u0435\u0445\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0440\u0435\u0437\u043d\u044f \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u043a\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0439-\u043d\u0438\u0431\u0443\u0434\u044c \u041f\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442 \u043d\u0435 \u0442\u0443\u0434\u0430 \u0438 \u0447\u0442\u043e-\u0442\u043e \u0432\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435 \u0412\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0448\u0438\u0439 \u0438\u0437 \u0410\u0434\u0430 \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0424\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0434\u0438 \u041a\u0440\u044e\u0433\u0435\u0440) \u0438 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433 - \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043c \u0442\u043e\u0436\u0435 \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0443\u0431\u0438\u0439\u0446\u0430 - \u0441\u0430\u043c\u044b\u0439 \u0431\u0435\u0437\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0438\u0437 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0445. \u0412\u0441\u0435 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u043e\u0431\u044a\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043d\u044b \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u043c \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0438 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043a\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f, \u043a\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0435 \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044f \u0432 \u044d\u0442\u0438\u0445 \u044d\u043f\u0438\u0437\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0445 \u0432\u043b\u0438\u044f\u044e\u0442 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433 \u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0430, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0442\u043e\u0436\u0435 \u0432\u0435\u0441\u044c\u043c\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e.\n\n\u0423\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0443\u0434\u043e\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0435, \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0435 - \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0443\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0435, \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442 -\u043d\u0435\u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0437\u0433\u043e\u0432\u044b\u043d\u043e\u0441\u044f\u0449\u0438\u0439.\n\u0418 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0443\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435: \u0442\u044b, \u0442\u0432\u043e\u0438 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0437\u044c\u044f \u0438 \u0442\u0432\u043e\u044f \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u0443\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442\u044c 100000000000000 \u0440\u0430\u0437 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0435,\u0447\u0435\u043c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443. \u0423\u0434\u0430\u0447\u0438)", "timestamp_created": 1460690564, "timestamp_updated": 1460690564, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515152", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22348723": {"recommendationid": "22348723", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059597848", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 450, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470073492}, "language": "english", "review": "A Splendid Horror Homage \n\nLakeview Cabin makes me jump, but not in the cheap way so many other horror games seem to.  It does it In the proper way, using atmosphere, timing and many of the tricks from the well-thumbed slasher film rulebook. The game uses sound and score superbly in this regard, the sudden cries of the crows seem filled with portent, the creak of a rafter, a door opening somewhere off screen. It all helps build the tension beautifully.  The charm of the chunky sprites and backgrounds lend extra heft to the stabs of panic inducing action, too. The cute pixel characters offset nicely against the horrific situations. \n\nFor me, each episode of Lakeview gets better with every attempt. While the challenge of getting one character to the end of an episode without significant blood loss would probably not be enough to keep me playing, it is the detail in the design of each distinct episode and the individual stories that have me returning for more. All the episodes are challenging and amusing in their own macabre ways, each having more emphasis on certain of Lakeview's gameplay elements. If I had to pick a favourite it'd be the puzzle heavy Episode 5. The supernatural elements are clevery used and the suburban setting is perfect, right down to the kid brother's toy laser gun.\n\nMy only criticism is one that could possibly be chalked up to my own inferior grey matter. I simply cannot fathom what to do in episode 4. It's great fun to play but invariably I end up with every character reduced to a fine pixel paste within ten minutes and not the foggiest glimmer of a clue about how to progress on the next attempt. As far as I can tell the aim is simply to be suddenly butchered in the most amusing way possible. \n\nAs an homage to 70's and 80's horror and slasher films as well as classic adventure/puzzle games they don't come much better than this one.

I see the bloody puddles under my chair.  Next to a dirty pair of socks.  Arrgh, my *last* good dirty pair of socks too.  Time to fire up some jump scares and spoopy spoops.\n\nI skinny dipped into the game that night -  a blind playthrough.  Okay,  *truthfully* I would likely leave my underwear on ( modesty be damned ), but you get the idea.  What do you think I discovered?  Why, nothing less than a schizo-spasmic pixelated horror-fest of episodic blood-spattered evil!   And there were pugs too -little ones, running around the screen. Oh, the humanity!\n\nYou start outside of a movie theatre in the dead of night, with the disturbing sounds of a dangerous city all around.  Move forward, pick up a few items, search around a bit, and you\u2019ll find the movie theatre dead ahead with three feature films on hand.  These are the episodes you\u2019ll be playing. You can pick any one of them in any order.  I started out with the first door I saw, episode III,  which featured a summer camp terrorized by some rather quick footed serial killers a la \"Friday the 13th\". Looking at my surroundings I realized I am playing as a group of people, clicking back and forth between them as I would a hand of cards.  So, I can be a teen dude-stud or the cute girl next door.  I searched around and looked inside a building to find a...bedroom.\n\nRight away, I was able to make myself naked on a bed in a cabin having sex with a girl with the sole intention of seeing if I could.  Boom-shocka-locka, it worked!  And that was actually part of the game!  I swear those dudes were digitally man-scaped too.  That's the kind of game Lakeview Cabin Collection is: an ode to teen slasher movies with all the intrinsically nasty bits included.\n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY & STORY[/h1]\n\nWhat is this ode to cinema-du-slash all about?  A survival horror zombie-fest with robo-dinosaurs, perhaps? Pfft.  Puh-lease.  This game is about surviving the nights of murdering crazies and killing them off while unlocking the secrets of the episode.  I think.  In any case: kill or die, that much is apparent.  I began to hunt for clues, take things apart, and solve some puzzles without much idea of what was going on or why.  Oddly, it's a bit like an adventure game in this way with using combinations of items, unlocking hidden things in the background, trying out items on the killers, etc.  And also, there is a significant strategy in attacking the baddies at night.  Yet, it's quite open in design.  Unlike many games, you don't need to perform an action in an *exact* way in order to progress...and for that I am incredibly happy.  Your option list is extremely varied.  A little too varied, even.  Sort of like trying to choose what to eat at a buffet with lots of goodies at the bar.  There are a ton of different ways to approach those killers: motorcycle of death, beer can, gas container, oven fire, lamp oil, hammer, musical instrument, teddy bear, etc.  Granted, some of those items won't do a single thing.  You'll find quite a bit of trial and error in the gameplay.  Which again, may or may not irritate the player into a game rage.  To complete an episode you must kill all the killers. So, best not to goof off *too* much before you end up a pixelated stain on the floor.\n\nWhat becomes immediately apparent is that you are going to die. Repeatedly.  Over and over and over and over and...well, over.  I can see how that can turn some folks off.  There is only so much you can take of planning a stage, setting up all the right parts, doing all the correct actions, trying your best, and seeing it all fall apart when a slasher is too resilient and kills every last one of your group. For that, I do chalk this game up as - NOT EASY.  Prepare to sink some hours in.\n\nAfter finishing episode III, I popped into episode IV.  And by that, I mean I died non-stop for a very long time.  This episode is about an all-girl rock band stuck in a compound with a family of serial killers that are simply waiting to be discovered.  Unlike before, you are running to the killers instead of running away as they sneak up.  You're going to be exploring what seems like an endless series of rooms filled to the brim with bloody, twisted murdering nightmare scenes.  It's harrowing to say the least and you get slashed at every few seconds.  But you *do* get to fight back.  One time I ended up soaking my whole screen in red.  Honestly, even after an hour of playing this level I felt like I barely scratched the surface.  It was amazing fun, and a challenge I thoroughly enjoyed, but I was pretty damned horrible at even trying to win this level.  I had to stop and try out episode V.  I knew when I was out of my league.\n\nNow, episode V is much slower.  More along the lines of episode III and I felt like I could tackle it better. Well, at least in the beginning I thought I could.  This episode was hiding more from me than the others.  It's set in - let's say 1987 - you once again are a group of teens and there is a ethereal serial killer involved along with a sort of purgatory of spirits where your soul goes to when you die. You have to figure out what needs to happen when your soul arrives there both before and after you are resurrected - with very cryptic hints.  The puzzles involved are more elusive than in episode III, and the order in which you complete them is slightly more important to finish the episode.  Not that it's linear in that way, I solved several of the puzzles completely out of order, but there is a set of actions that has to be figured out in order to complete the grand puzzle involved.  It's not easy.  Not at all.  And I hate to admit it, but I had to look up a guide just to move on  after getting stuck for hours.   There were secret numbers and codes involved, some hidden in a way that I honestly would NEVER have guessed.  Even looking at someone's guide for hints when I got stuck, I *still* think it was quite hard.  And the cartridge video game...OMG the video game...that took me ages to figure out on my own until I accidentally got it with a naked girl ending. Too bad that wasn't the end!  It was just a small part of a grander series of puzzles to complete.  I'd be spoiling it to tell you any more, but once you attack the killer with all the evil at hand, you will get that euphoric \"I BEAT IT!\" feeling we all know and love.  Now, I want to go back to episode IV.  And I have.  Still trying as a matter of fact.  The chainsaw dude is just insanely hard to kill for me and I have a feeling there are a lot more people hidden in that house.\n\n[h1]FINAL THOUGHTS[/h1]\n\nCome into this game with an open mind about surviving in a horror movie, *lots* of patience, and knowing full well you will die repeatedly.  Perhaps even killed by stepping on farm tools!  It's not an easy game to complete and you will likely get stumped - maybe a lot.  Be careful you don't get chipped away in a wood chipper when you are not looking!

The attention to detail in this game exceeds my expectation.

Compare the Friday 13th chapter to the Texas chainsaw massacre dizyingly sickening, washed out color scheme, for example.

It covers several genres of horror that I grew up with, from the killers, to the scenes and settings. The nostalgila factor alone already makes this game pretty good. \n\nI like the art, it's retro, while still having it's own style and being able to separate itself from all the games that use the entire concept of retro art it's whole selling point. \n\nThe game also manages to be able to tell a story in a very basic manner without needing to have any sort of text. And I respect that. They did it in a much better way then Scott could ever hope to do with Five Nights At Freddies. \n\nNow for the bad. To begin with, the controls are kind of wonky, it's going to take you awhile to get used to the very minimalistic controls they use. The game uses 'context senestive' icons to let you know when you can perform an action, but it isn't always clear what it is or what it's used for. \n\nThe hit detection in this game is terrible. 9 out of 10 times, an enemy will hit me before I even get remotely close to it, but the game, for whatever reason, seems to think I need to be right on top of an enemy to attack it. There's hard and then there's poor programming and this game could use a better combat system. At least give players the same attack reach the enemies do, that's only fair.\n\nWhile the game advertises itself as a 'sandbox' game, the reality is, each \"feature\" feels like the developers had a very specific idea on how the features should be solved. There's a lot of junk laying around, but a large majority of it simply doesn't feel useful in any sense. \n\nIt's kind of like Lemmings. The developers had a very specific idea on how every puzzle should be solved and while some people managed to avoid it, luck out and still win a stage, many others were left scratching their heads.\n\nFinally, the puzzles in the game are simply atrocious. Many of them, you won't understand what's going on unless you watch or read some sort of guide. It suffers from the same 90's adventure point and click game issues, where nonsensical actions result in a reaction that helps you. From banging a lady on a bed to find a key, to pooping in a toilet to drop a stuffed bear, the end result is, what were they thinking?\n\nHere's the thing, I appreciate the game and the concept of it. There's a lot of it I actually do like, but so much of it has made me so frustrated that I had to stop playing. The developers clearly workd hard on this product, but a lot of times the direction and mechanics feel really off. \n\nAt the time of writing this, I could have gotten a refund, but I decided not to. But unless you have a great mind of super obscure puzzles, unfair mechanics and bad hit detection, most of you would be better left off not buying this game.

Here, you get a band of typical horror protagonists at your hands, and your goal is to make them survive against various maniacs and hazards.\n\nThe biggest hazard will actually be you. Have you always wondered why all these slasher movie heroes are so dumb? Why do they always split up? Why do they never watch where they go? Why don't they just bash the maniac with that handy candlestick right next to them? Why don't they stuff him into the grinder so he never rises up again?\n\nWell, you're going to make all the stupid decisions a slasher movie protagonist ever made, and lead your characters to their bloody but hilarious demise. After a few bad endings, you will manage to get at least some of the heroes to survive the attack and put the monsters to rest...\n\nOnly to fail spectaculary in the next chapter! I won't spoil it for you, but the gameplay changes drastically, even though all the mechanics are the same. And then the third chapter is going to surprise you even more, going from slashers to mystery thriller territory.\n\nThe graphics may look simplistic, but there are a lot of nice touches like the sun flickering in the lake or an oscillating weather vane. Overall cartoony art style plays greatly for the whole parody thing, sometimes you just can't help but laugh (maybe with some hysteria notes) watching a chibi-proportioned maniac with an axe closing in on your poor hero. Even more hilarious when overly dramatical high-pitched cello music starts playing and scare chords empathize his blows.\n\nAll in all, Lakeview Cabin Collection is a great game, which manages not only to capture the feel of the old horrors, but does it in just right proportions and, most of all, has a solid, interesting and challenging gameplay.\n\nAs of today, this game has roughly 12k owners according to Steamspy.

Esperaba encontrar un juego de partidas r\u00e1pidas, para ratos muertos, y lo he encontrado. Mis protagonistas acaban igual de muertos que los ratos pero \u00bfno es acaso una simulaci\u00f3n de pel\u00edculas de terror ochenteras? \u00bfY qu\u00e9 pasaba con los protagonistas de esas pelis? Que mor\u00edan... pues eso.\n\nSe trata de un juego con gr\u00e1ficos pixelados y vista lateral donde cada cap\u00edtulo replica una pel\u00edcula 'slasher' distinta. El cap\u00edtulo III es la cl\u00e1sica historia de la pandilla que va a una caba\u00f1a del bosque al estilo Viernes 13. El IV es la historia de unas chicas que se quedan sin gasolina a las puertas de un matadero como en la Matanza de Texas. Y el V, que se estren\u00f3 ahora por Halloween, es de est\u00e9tica urbana y con una historia de fantasmas. Los cap\u00edtulos se escogen entrando en la sala de cine donde los proyectan.\n\nCada cap\u00edtulo se compone de un escenario relativamente peque\u00f1o con un mont\u00f3n de objetos. Es sorprendente, para lo b\u00e1sico que es el control, la de movidas que se pueden hacer. Porque realmente usas el mando para moverte y luego dos botones: uno para coger/soltar cosas y otro para lanzarlas o usarlas, dependiendo el objeto. Ese mismo bot\u00f3n de lanzar sirve para actuar con cosas del escenario (camas, arcones, puertas). \n\nPero con un planteamiento tan simple puedes hacer de todo, incluyendo cosas tan cafres y divertidas como una org\u00eda pixelada (en serio, desnuda a varios personajes y m\u00e9telos en la misma cama \u00a1es un logro!) o convertirte t\u00fa mismo en el psic\u00f3pata y acabar a machetazos con tus compa\u00f1eros de reparto. El plan oficial, claro, es matar al asesino antes de que acabe contigo. Dependiendo el cap\u00edtulo habr\u00e1 que hacer unas cosas u otras. La verdad es que sin una gu\u00eda me parece muy dif\u00edcil, sobre todo el cap\u00edtulo V (es el m\u00e1s extra\u00f1o para mi gusto). A\u00fan as\u00ed es divertido intentar completar el juego usando cosas y viendo que pasa. A veces te llevas sorpresas.\n\nEn cada partida el malo aparece cuando le da la gana y donde quiere. Tambi\u00e9n cambian algunas cosas de sitio, con lo que se favorece la aleatoriedad. \n\nComo digo se trata de un juego para ratos muertos. Divertido, bien hecho, f\u00e1cil de manejar pero dif\u00edcil de superar. \n\nAparte de los tres cap\u00edtulos que ya trae disponibles al parecer el autor ha prometido un cuarto que se a\u00f1adir\u00e1 de forma gratuita, as\u00ed que nos queda sangre para rato.\n\n\u00bfPuntos negativos? Por culpa de la est\u00e9tica pixelada a veces cuesta saber que es cada objeto hasta que lo usas. La primera vez que pill\u00e9 un mechero le prend\u00ed fuego a una cama y todo lo que hab\u00eda en ella sin querer. Y hasta que me di cuenta de que un recuadro en la pared era una pistola de bengalas en una vitrina pasaron varias partidas... Otra cosa es lo que he comentado: sin un gu\u00eda a m\u00ed hay cosas que ni se me ocurrir\u00eda hacer en el cap\u00edtulo V, porque no acabo de verle la l\u00f3gica.\n\nPor lo dem\u00e1s se trata de un juego entetenido que demuestra que una buena idea, bien llevada, no requiere grandes recursos t\u00e9cnicos para funcionar.", "timestamp_created": 1446254642, "timestamp_updated": 1446388585, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.739963", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18774042": {"recommendationid": "18774042", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027662123", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 743, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501762313}, "language": "english", "review": "Seen a lot of gameplay of it on YT, this game is awesome ignore the pixel style, love the thrill.

It's strange, too, because they constitute such a major part of horror in cinema, and have all the components of a worthwhile game. Lakeview Cabin Collection puts those components on display in the best way possible, by letting you combine them as you like. And the result is surprisingly addictive.\n\n\"Lakeview Cabin\" is the title of an in-universe series of horror movies, centered around the titular cursed lake. The game chucks you right onto the street outside the theater, which you can enter to select a movie to enjoy. You can also huck boxes, beat up hobos, plunge toilets, eat popcorn, and harass the cinema staff. It's a great introduction to the ridiculous sandbox nature of the game. On a controller, A lifts and drops things, X throws, shoots, eats, or uses, B enters doorways, and Y lets you switch between controllable characters (4 to a scene). And yes, those commands work on almost every single thing in the game, including people. And their parts.\n\nAt this time, LCC contains two episodes, III and IV. V and VI are promised for the future, but I will say up front that the current two are worth the price of admission alone. Episode III is a perfect send-up of Friday the 13th, giving you control of four teens partying on an island. There are beers to drink, bongs to hit, clothes to strip, and fully-functional beds. When night falls, a strange and relentless killer may show up, which you need to puzzle out a way to defeat. It's harder than it sounds because (A) the killer can take a LOT of punishment, and (B) certain elements of the episode are randomized. Your shotgun may not be loaded, or the tools might be hidden in another cabin. The killer also approaches from where you'll least expect him. I'm not kidding, either. If you camp out with weapons, he'll lay low, so you actually have to do idiot horror movie things to draw him out. Which you're going to do anyway, because interacting with the chaotic, bloody world is irresistably fun.\n\nIf episode III is an homage to Friday the 13th, episode IV is an amazing recreation of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Your band is stuck on the grounds of the Lakeview Slaughterhouse, and you'll have to do plenty of slaughtering to escape. The creator of LCC listened to feedback about episode III being to puzzley, so IV is far more focused on action. There are tons of freaks and killers to fight and trick as you find your way through their house of horrors, the layout of which is randomized every time you play. However, what really got me about IV was how perfectly it apes the look of TCM, even in pixel form. The whole episode looks fucking gross, with clashing colors, washed-out exteriors, equal helpings of gore and disturbing imagery, and some truly messed-up foes.\n\nDespite how entertaining getting your characters high and knocking them into a wood chipper is, Lakeview Cabin Collection still manages to be genuinely scary. Waiting for the killer at the lake or getting spotted by a psycho in the slaughterhouse comes with a perfect audio stinger and a rush of adrenaline as you scramble to respond. The enemies are appropriately deadly and require careful planning to overcome, so there's always an air of dread to encounters. Admittedly, there's not much depth to the antagonists, and that's one place the game could really stand to improve. They just beat on you, or grab weapons and beat on you.

The real issue with this game is that it is presented as a \"sandbox\" experience...but there's just not all that much to do. Think Scribblenauts, but without any kind of creative canvas at your disposal. You're basically just running around as long as you can, picking up rakes and turning wood chippers off and on...and throwing that red-headed, open-shirted manwhore into it for sleeping with your girlfriend....until the maniac comes to kill you. \n\nAnd don't even bother with Lakeview Cabin IV. It is beyond monotenous. It's just a \"mouse-in-a-maze\" type of situation.

[/h1]\n\nLakeview Cabin Collection ist eines der interessantesten (Horror-)Survivalgames die ich seit langem gespielt habe. \nNicht nur das, das Spiel einige Klassische Horrorfilme Parodiert, sondern auch das Men\u00fc des Spiels ist gut umgesetzt.\n\nBeim Starten des Spiels finden wir uns in einem Kino wieder, in dem wir die einzelen Level(Episode/Filme) starten k\u00f6nnen.\n\nAls ich diese Bewertung geschrieben habe, gab es bisher nur Level(Episode/Filme) 3 und 4.\n\nWir k\u00f6nnen jederzeit, bzw. solange unsere Charaktere alle noch Leben, zwischen ihnen hin und her wechseln. Es gibt 4 Charaktere zur Auswahl, die sich nur vom Aussehen unterscheiden.\nIn Sachen interaktion hat das Spiel auch einiges zu bieten, man kann mit allem m\u00f6glichen interagieren, zb kann man eine Fliegenklatsche aufheben und Fliegen damit schlagen oder man nimmt eine Axt und hackt T\u00fcren ein, wie Jack aus Stanley Kubricks Shinning. \n\nWas interessant wirkt, kann aber auch etwa abflachen, vor allem dadurch, das unter anderem in Episode 3 wirklich vorbereitung von n\u00f6ten ist. Man sollte davon ausgehen das man das Spiel einige male spielen muss, um zu wissen wie man die Episoden schafft.\n\nNun zu den Episoden:\n\n[b] Episode 3 - Lakeview Cabin[/b]\n\n4 Freunde sind auf einer kleinen Insel um Urlaub zu machen (oder was man dort sonst so macht)\nNach einiger Zeit kommt ein Killer der sich der Freunde annimmt. Wenn man nicht aufpasst stibrt einer nach dem anderen weg.  Das Ziel ist es den Killer aufzuhalten, in dem Fall, vorher zu t\u00f6ten, bevor er einen t\u00f6ten kann.\n\nWie schon erw\u00e4hnt erfordert diese Episode einige vorbereitungszeit, da sie praktisch immer nach dem gleichen Schema abl\u00e4uft, daher m\u00f6chte ich auch nicht zu viel schreiben, da man auch noch etwas zum entdecken hat, das macht dieses Spiel n\u00e4mlich auch sehr aus.\n\n[b] Episode 4 - Curse of the Lake [/b]\n\nEiner 4 K\u00f6pfigen Band ist das Benzin auf dem Weg zu einem Konzert oder auf dem Weg von einem Konzert nach Hause, ausgegangen. Nun geht es darum 4 Benzinkanister zu finden. Zu doof nur, wenn der Ort wo man liegen bleibt zwar eine Tankstelle hat, diese aber verlassen und heruntergekommen, die Villa etwas weiter, von Irren bewohnt und die Schlachterrei daneben auch nicht gerade einladend ist. \n\nDiese Episode ist etwas anders. W\u00e4hrend Episode 3 immer nach dem selben Schema abl\u00e4uft und Vorbereitung braucht, ist Episode 4 immer anders. Bei jedem durchspielen, \u00e4ndert sich die Anordnung der R\u00e4ume, sowie die der Benzinkanister (diese allerdings nur leicht)\n\nNach dem durchspielen einer Episode schaltet man einen Gegenstand frei der im Level steht, wenn man diesen aktiviert, \u00e4ndert sich etwas im Spiel. Bei Episode 3 wird das Spiel zu einer Art \"Night of the Living Dead\" und bei Episode 4 werden aus den Irren Bewohnern \"Vampire\"\n\n\nAlles in allem muss ich sagen, das ich viel Spa\u00df mit dem Spiel hatte und mich schon auf die 2 letzten Episoden freue. F\u00fcr Fans von Horrorfilmen eine nette Hommage an einige alte und vielleicht auch einige neue Filme.\n\nAlllerdings wird laut dem Spiel ein Controller empfholen, ob es wirklich verpflichtend ist einen zu haben kann ich leider nicht genau sagen.\n\n\n\n[i]Eins wei\u00df ich aber jetzt mit sicherheit. Wenn ich das n\u00e4chste mal Urlaub in einem Ferienhaus mache, suche ich direkt nach der Schrotflinte und der passenden Munition, nur um sicher zu gehen.

This is a work in progress review, I will update this review when the other episodes are released. \n\nLakeview Cabin 3- Review\n\nLakeview Cabin Collection took me by surprise once it was released. I played the original flash game and thought the idea was very interesting and had a lot of potential and then I saw that the original developer made a new game, on a bigger scale. \n\nTo begin with the game doesn't hold your hand when you start playing, you have to figure out everything by yourself otherwise you won't get anywhere. \n\nThe gameplay is simple. You take control of four campers who get attacked by serial killers and it's up to you to survive. You can set up traps or you can try and take down the killers with brute force, but it's best to take the cautious approach otherwise you won't survive. \n\nThe audio is really well done and is one of the games best features. The sound effects are awesome and sound a lot like the effects in those very cheesy slasher movies that the game is based of. \n\nThe game is overall really well made apart from a few minor bugs like characters not picking up the thing you want them to pick up. \n\nLakeview Cabin 3 is a really great episode and a good start to what seems to be a very promising game. I give Lakeview Cabin 3 a 8.5/10\n\nLakeview Cabin 4- Review\n\nLakeview Cabin is the second episode in the Collection.  The first episode took us to a camp site like Friday the 13th, but this time we go to a mansion and try not to get killed by a crazy cannibal family.\n\nLakeview Cabin 4 changes a lot of gameplay aspects from the first episode. This time you need to find 4 gas canisters to fuel up your car and escape a mansion full of crazy cannibals, but to get them you need to kill a lot of people.  Killing increases your crazy meter which makes the screen go crazy and makes more jump scares appear. Enemies are easier to kill but there's more of them and now there's stealth to avoid an even bigger threat which you can't kill so you will have to be more careful.\n\nThis episode is very interesting and it feels fresh which I like a lot. Now for the good. The audio is still really good. The gameplay is very fun and challenging which is a lot of fun. Funny like always and the graphics are awesome. \n\nBut there are a few problems. This episode was really buggy. An enemy hit me through a door which was closed, and of course the same problem where my character wouldn't pick up what I wanted to pick up. The random aspect of the episode is a great way to add replay value, but for people who have a hard time with the game might have more trouble since they can't learn from they're mistakes. \n\nOverall it's still a very fun game and I can't wait to play Episode 3 or Lakeview Cabin 5 whatever you want to call it. It's worth the full price without a doubt. I give Lakeview Cabin 4 a 7.5/10\n\nLakeview Cabin 5 - Review\n\nTaking  a detour from the previous play style of the other episodes the third episode of Lakeview Cabin takes more of a puzzle game approach. Lakeview Cabin 5 makes you play as four teenagers again in a place that is taken straight out of Halloween the movie. \n\nThe goal in this episode is quite different. You can't die this time, but you have one goal to figure out how to kill a murderer who is immortal. \n\nAs stated before this takes a more slow paced approach than the other two episodes. This time it's more about puzzle solving than anything. I liked the puzzle solving in this episode and some of the puzzles are incredibly crazy not to mention some of the solutions are absurd, but it's incredibly fun non the less. \n\nWhen I began this episode, I loved the retro feel. It felt like Halloween the movie with Nightmare on Elm Street characters. This for me the best looking Lakeview Cabin Episode by far.\n\nNow for the bad and there is a lot this time. The episode is the buggiest episode by far. I had to relaunch the episode several times after finishing one of the puzzles due to the audio cutting out after I finish it. Not to mention the very weird movement of the killer. Sometimes he doesn't attack you at all and just jitters and place. \n\nIn the end I loved Lakeview Cabin Episode 3, because of the puzzle solving aspect. In the end if the bugs weren't there I would say it's the best episode right now. \n\nIf you don't own Lakeview Cabin Collection right now, you just simply need to get it. It's one of the most fun you can have with a horror title. \n\nLakeview Cabin 5 gets a 8/10\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/snortsreviews#curation]here[/url] - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!", "timestamp_created": 1439246754, "timestamp_updated": 1454103232, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.577681", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17460615": {"recommendationid": "17460615", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104636019", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1074, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513868067}, "language": "finnish", "review": "Suomalaisuus simulaattori.\n-Juo k\u00e4nnit\n-Kuksi muijjaa\n-Ammu koira haulikolla\n-Heit\u00e4 akka puusilppuriin", "timestamp_created": 1439142041, "timestamp_updated": 1445601537, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.588997", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17432987": {"recommendationid": "17432987", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104760030", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1853, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515726131}, "language": "english", "review": "The Lakeview Cabin Collection is hands down the perfect homage to 70's and 80's horror movies.\n\nThe game has the perfect blend of horror, humour and puzzle solving to keep you entertained for hours on end.

The fact that this game was created by a single person shocks me, for it is so detailed and so perfectly displays all of the horror movie tropes we have come to know and love through the years. To thoroughly enjoy this game you must have an imagination to craft a story for these characters, who are basically blank canvases meant to have a personality crafted for them by the player. There also is a briliantly crafted yet oddloy convoluted story that at this point has not been fully revealed due to the fact that only two episodes have been released thus far, yet if you are a person who is fit and able to search out a hidden backstory within a game will be pleasantly suprised. The gameplay is simple due to the fact that it completely revolves around a pick up and throw mechanic I have not seen in any other two dimensional pixelated indie games, yet it feels like this mechanic should have been used from the start in the horror game genre. The second episode feels like an entirely different game, due to the fact that the creator chose to go with a Texas Chainsaw Massacre approach instead of his usual Friday The 13th feel, but still proves to be as incredibly, if not even more, replayable. What the creator has accomplished thus far is incredible, being that he is a single developer who is somehow able to create a game that I, and many others would consider better than most triple a titles released this year. Few other games had me constantly checking the developers twitter for updates on the games progress, and I dont even have an account on that site. This game is so criminaly underplayed that it makes me sick.

Movies like Tucker and Dale vs Evil or Shaun of the Dead aren't so much scary as they are kind of gross or gory sometimes, but the comedy is solid and the movies themselves are excellent.\n\nLakeview Cabin is a unique example of the genre.  When someone says Lakeview Cabin is Horror Comedy, what they mean is that it epitomizes both separate genres equally.  Lakeview Cabin is tense and freaky and, in general, simply excellent at that Horror trick of making you do something while every part of your body tells you not to, especially considering its crude, pixelly style (or, perhaps, partially because of it).  Your heart will race as you try to execute that last, desperate plan to save your own skin as an immortal serial murderer bares down on you in the dark.  At the same time, the freedom it allows the player in its little sandbox levels, combined with the game's swift, incredibly violent consequences of poor decision making, almost immediately opens up a world of hugely bloody, absurd comedy.  In few other games can you run to pick up a shotgun and blast a monster in the face only to discover it is empty, and the only other nearby object is a small pug which has been wandering the island carefree for days now, and in no other games can you desperately pick up that pug and try to hurl it at your killer's face, only for it to soar into a nearby running woodchipper instead, spraying blood and bits of bone at a hapless friend standing nearby.\n\nThe game has a sick and hilarious sense of humor, and, at the same time, is thrilling, tense, and off-puttingly weird.  Is that pregnant redneck trapped in the attic the source of all these slimy, bloodthirsty creatures slithering and snuffling through the walls?  Is that a man-sized, deformed infant careening around the island with a knife?  What are they doing with all these chickens?  What is that thing in the lake, and what did it do to our dog?  What are those two naked twins doing in the bathroom with that dessicated corpse?  These are but a tiny fraction of the worrying questions you'll pose to yourself while playing Lakeview Cabin Collection. \n\n If you're at all a fan of weird sandbox titles, 70s grindhouse horror flicks, horror in general, comedy, combinations of the two, solving puzzles, playing games, or being a cool person, you should strongly consider giving this a shot.", "timestamp_created": 1437069768, "timestamp_updated": 1437069768, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501180", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17077563": {"recommendationid": "17077563", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068504705", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 176, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1446422576}, "language": "english", "review": "Got killed by a bunch of red necks, tried releasing Piggy to kill the rednecks, succeeded, then Piggy killed me.\n10/10, would get pigged again.", "timestamp_created": 1437061480, "timestamp_updated": 1437061480, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501180", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17072629": {"recommendationid": "17072629", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038216390", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1689, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500348277}, "language": "english", "review": "love it but there is a weird glitch where the colors are off..

Do I sacrifice one member of my party to try killing a monster? Do I hide them all and try to figure out some elaborate trap? It's all up to you.\n\nThe second chapter is as good as the first, with a huge homage to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre cannibal style films. The creator even used a lovely kind of washed out look for the colors, to give it that 70's camera vibe. \n\nThe value of this game is great, and, with even more episodes coming, I can promise if you love horror, twisted comedy, or are bored of the constant Zombie/Survival games, give this one a try. \n\n10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1436984408, "timestamp_updated": 1436984408, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550031", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17063735": {"recommendationid": "17063735", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062763979", "num_games_owned": 389, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 78, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1437246092}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "muito epico adorei!!", "timestamp_created": 1436983455, "timestamp_updated": 1436983455, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17060178": {"recommendationid": "17060178", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153068570", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 60, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468056012}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041d\u0430\u0442\u043a\u043d\u0443\u043b\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0443 \u0411\u0414\u0421\u041c\u0449\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432, \u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d \u0438\u0437 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0445 \u0437\u0430\u0431\u0438\u043b \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u043d\u0430\u0441\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0442\u044c \u0444\u0430\u043b\u043b\u043e\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043c. \n10 \u0440\u0435\u0437\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u0444\u0430\u043b\u043b\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0432 \u0438\u0437 10", "timestamp_created": 1436967223, "timestamp_updated": 1436967223, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17058535": {"recommendationid": "17058535", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988653852", "num_games_owned": 142, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 760, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518119327}, "language": "french", "review": "Un jeu d\u00e9couvert par hasard sur Internet, il avait l'air assez original en regardant les personnes y jouer.

I was the lucky winner of this game on one of the steam groups I belong to, and I was pleasantly surprised with the creepy pixelated experience. \n\nReally, the game page says it all:\n\n\u201dRelive the horror movies of the 70's and 80's by answering the question: What would you do if you found yourself in a slasher film?\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what the game is: A perfect, pixelated representation of your typical horror movie of the 80\u2019s. There you have the girls with their lovely hair, and the boys with their handsome beards, and the creepy lake, and the cabins, and the creepy nude stalker\u2026\n\n\nWait, what? o.O\n\nThe game is a horror/comedy/parody/adventure type of game. Your goal? To prepare yourself to survive the creepy, murdering monster as long as possible. Or, you know, you could just hide forever.\n\nThere are several characters for you to deal with, and switching between them is super easy. \nYou get to explore the cabins, find items to aid you with surviving, places to hide, and weapons to use against the horrors of the night. Whenever you get hurt, you actually\u2026 get hurt. As in, you miss a leg and you\u2019ll be hopping down that pixelated grass on one leg while bleeding off. the game spares no expenses in the pixelated gore.\n\nYou can also kill yourself, kill others, and promptly die when you\u2019re the only one left to face the evil from the lake. There\u2019s more than one way to kill or be killed, and exploring them all is as fun as playing the game as you should be. :) \nAnd you know what\u2019s more satisfactory than surviving? Not giving the monster the chance to kill you all off, by doing it yourself first. :P\n\nThe game is mostly funny to play, but it also, despite being just pixels, manages to be sufficiently creepy as to unnerve you.  The replayability is fairly decent, as you can just replay it to see how many different ways you find to survive, whether you can kill the monster at all, and how long you can last. \n\nIf you\u2019re into a bit of pixelated parody horror, give this one a try!

Lakeview Cabin is a sidescrolling game with pretty simple graphics, and a rather interesting concept. While it may look simple, the gameplay is actually pretty complex and requires planning, tactics, and timing. This is technically an episodic series, and as of this writing, there is only one episode out (Other than the secret one). The first episide's plot is simple: you're playing as a bunch of teenagers in a summer camp on an island, which gets invaded by various killers, and your goal is to kill them, or be killed yourself. The main draw of this game is that there's no single path to take as you dispatch the killers. There's a [b]TON[/b] of options and variety - but at the same time, you'll have to do a TON of experimenting and planning to see what does and does not work. It's... pretty trial and error, honestly. While I don't like that brand of gameplay, it's pretty rewarding once you succeed. However, if your plan fails even slightly, most of the time you're better off just starting from scratch. Alternatively, you can do whatever the hell you want - the game doesn't [i]punish[/i] you until the killers come. So, for shits and giggles, you can play out your very own 80's horror movie scenario! Once you figure out how things work, now comes the fun part! A thing I love about this game is that you can't take the killers on up front: you have to either trap them, or put them in a vulnerable state, before you attack. Meaning planning, planning, planning. You're going have to prepare and set things up before they arrive or you're screwed. Seriously. Don't even try it if you're not prepared. You won't win.\n\nTo say something negative about the game... it's pretty difficult, to the point of being unfair. You're probably better off looking up a walkthrough. And like pretty much every horror game, the fright factor dissipates... pretty quickly. After a few run ins with the monster, it becomes predictable as you [i]know[/i] when it's going to show up. Fortunately, the game doesn't bombard you with jump scares (I don't recall a single jumpscare!), most of the horror comes from the \"oh shit, is it here yet!?\" suspense... which wears off the second you realize the [i]obvious[/i] cues. Honestly, I don't regard this as too much of a horror game, because of the aforementioned reasons. Oh yeah, there's also the simplistic graphics - but that shouldn't be too much of a problem if you can handle \"retro\" graphics. Which is honestly better than attempts at shitty dreamcast era 3D.\n\nAll in all, Lakeview is a pretty fun game that has a surprising amount of depth and gameplay, albeit with it lacking in graphics and being incredibly difficult. But hey, it's worth the five dollars you'll spend on this. \n\n... Writing this was probably a waste of time. It'll just get buried under all the attempts to be [i]funny[/i]. >_>", "timestamp_created": 1429761011, "timestamp_updated": 1429761011, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 41, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.812203", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15486253": {"recommendationid": "15486253", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018403751", "num_games_owned": 213, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 569, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520062045}, "language": "english", "review": "So...\nStart it up\nGot Naked\nHad a 4 way\nGot High\nRang a Bell\nHeard a Giant Crack\nSaw that the crate was Destroyed\nNotice I couldn't switch to one of my guys\nFound him cut up\nMasked killer kills the women\nRun bike into killer\nHe gets back up\n10/10\nWould, and have been, go to Cabin Again\n:D", "timestamp_created": 1429676002, "timestamp_updated": 1429676002, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474510", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15483964": {"recommendationid": "15483964", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037078901", "num_games_owned": 472, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 28, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1438023148}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Nada como uma linda tarde em uma cabana na floresta.

LVC5, is a fresh new look still funny stillscary everything i loved about part one in a brand new setting with 3 endings. whats not to love.\nPART 1:Okay so this game is legit one fun sandbox horror, its funny and scary at the same time ive found myself more scared of this game than five nights at fuckfaces could have and. the only problem i have with this game is that i just finished all of the game thats here so far and... there isnt any more i really wanna keep playing but replay value is kind of killed when you play it over and over exploring just trying to find a way to kill th efucking monsters. sure there is tons to do, like have sex with someone get drunk get naked kill your firends bring them back to life and kill them again throw there bodys in the wood chipper, get high have sex while high attempt to kill the monsters... over... and over.... and over... untill you finally find out how to do it then when you win you feel that acomplishment however... by the time you actually win... its kinda hard to find mmore to play. yeah there is the lake of the dead however after you kill 85 zombies by hiding behind a tree with an ax it kinda gets slower. so i think that more pieces need to be reliesed so that the replay value can return. so while there is no more to do with not alot of replay value\nPART 2: For Lake View Cabin 4, i was pleasently surprised when the game felt fully fledged and brand new, there are more weapns more things to find, and its gruesomly harder, and very unforgiving of mistakes, but i guess one of the major flaws for this chapter is that it lacks that funny charm that made the firt episode so much fun, it was funny and charming while bing scary and brutal at teh same time, while i love more content, its still a brand new game all together and its absolutly brutal. honestly. im not sure the random generation helps this game. becasuse, sometimes you dont get a good spawn and it makes the run nearly impossible. so its not perfect but its a hell of a ride and its great\nPART 3: for the 5th installment of the game, i just love how different each chapter is from each other, its the same place, but the story is so vastly differnt and the way the game plays is so much crazyer, and its still one of the scaryest games ive encounteres mixing with random pop up dad with scary atmosphere and spooky minigames and, just to mix things up you can still have sex, while you cant have an orgy you can still do it, the point is its still funny and still charming whle maintaining a fresh new look yet still scary as shit. honetly. this game has done alot to impress me.\nPART 4: okay so i have yet to beat lake view cabin 6 but what ive played of it. its hard. not as convolutedly hard as LVC5 but it brings back some of the fun but intense gameplay that we have come to love as a community, theis time you have 4~ ;) playable characters again but this time there are roughly 25-30 NPC's that are both a hinderance and a blessing. we havent had alot of non enemy NPC's befre especially not on this scale its fun to go on a slaughter and kill everyone even when you might end oup attacking the monster on accident and killing your chances to murder the whole crew. you can still screw other members and with the amount of weapons and variety that you can explore in this new chapter its amazing to see how this whole game ties together. the aliens vibe really kicks off. and when you beat the monsters. damn are you in for a surpirse XD\n i love this game. 9.8/10", "timestamp_created": 1429162991, "timestamp_updated": 1495248139, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15393763": {"recommendationid": "15393763", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080624775", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 332, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1447599141}, "language": "english", "review": "I can't wait to see three more episodes of this!\nIt's basically a problem solving game.

Le deuxi\u00e8me depuis la sortie du jeu sur Steam. Massacre \u00e0 la Tron\u00e7onneuse, vous ne pouvez pas imaginer la joie que j'ai eu... un de mes films pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9s!... hop je lance le jeu, impatient...\nPuis 20 minutes plus tard, je me demande... qu'est-ce qu'il s'est pass\u00e9, au juste, dans la t\u00eate du dev ?\nDans le \"premier\" \u00e9pisode, l'univers \u00e9tait simple, autant niveau compr\u00e9hension des m\u00e9canismes que visuellement, les d\u00e9lires \u00e9taient accessibles (se bourrer la gueule, partouzer, puis se faire d\u00e9foncer la rondelle \u00e0 coup de hache par deux tueurs) et dr\u00f4les, c'\u00e9tait un peu \u00e7a le piment du jeu... l'univers loufoque avec une ambiance malsaine !\nBon. Rapidement. Ici, comme \u00e9voqu\u00e9 plus haut, c'est Leatherface et sa ferme qui est \u00e0 l'honneur. Donc forc\u00e9ment, vous vous dites famille cannibale, etc, \u00e7a va \u00eatre marrant !\nNon, pas vraiment... On d\u00e9marre avec 4 persos, tous des filles, et hop, un screamer qui vous fera des d\u00e9gats. Donc, vous allez devoir changer de persos assez rapidement pour vous cacher dans le van derri\u00e8re vous pour ne prendre aucun d\u00e9gat, vu que le truc va vous foncer dessus et bousculer vos characters (pour un die and retry c'est assez lourd cette manip : pas \u00e0 droite, touche haut, espace, 4 fois d'affil\u00e9e pour se planquer). Donc bon, niveau immersion c'est d\u00e9j\u00e0 pas terrible terrible... Puis dans le premier, on voyait que les persos en vacances \u00e9taient clich\u00e9s et bien 80's, l\u00e0 on a aucune id\u00e9e de ce qu'on fout ici, on d\u00e9marre devant un van, enferm\u00e9 dans une zone de jeu ridiculement petite, avec 4 persos souriants. (???)\n\nBon allez, on acc\u00e9l\u00e8re. Vous avez trois batiments : l'abattoir, un bordel pas possible avec des pi\u00e8ges sans queue ni t\u00eate (des lance-flammes \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 des scies pour d\u00e9couper les porcs, et un esp\u00e8ce de truc difforme qui balance un liquide (qui vous one shot?...) tout \u00e7a pour arriver \u00e0 une salle avec LE gros m\u00e9chant. Et l\u00e0 c'est encore plus sympa parce qu'il faut faire marche arri\u00e8re forc\u00e9ment, avec des salles qui apparaissent comme par magie \u00e0 la place des portes dans lesquelles vous \u00eates pass\u00e9, etc. Faudra regarder les trous de la serrure, mais vous inqui\u00e9tez pas, le m\u00e9chant est tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s lent, vous pouvez vous faire un caf\u00e9 en attendant...\nEnsuite, vous avez la maison familiale. Bon... apr\u00e8s l'abattoir, vous vous dites qu'enfin vous allez rencontrer la famille cannibale!... \nnon.\nEncore moins de logique que ce que j'ai pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment \u00e9voqu\u00e9... :/ J'entends par l\u00e0 : vous verrez \u00e9norm\u00e9ment d'ennemis tous aussi d\u00e9biles les uns que les autres (vous entrez dans une salle, vous vous prenez un coup, vous ressortez, m\u00eame si le mec a un pied de biche, il ne vous pourchassera pas, il pr\u00e9f\u00e8rera faire les 100 pas dans sa salle de 10M carr\u00e9s. Heureusement, ils sont pas r\u00e9sistants, m'enfin... il doit y avoir une dizaine de salles, avec des sado-masos, des vieux papys qui vous d\u00e9montent \u00e0 mains nues, vous la jeunette de 20 piges, un rat difforme de 1M de haut, un clown, deux gars en combi jaunes etc, des items sans aucune logique (une spirale qui hypnotise en faisant de la musique, s\u00e9rieux?... on est loin des 2 tueurs du premier qui supportaient pas les crissements de la radio...) et des ennemis chiants, mous, tous aussi diff\u00e9rents les uns que les autres. Aucune indication sur ce qu'il faut faire, on tourne en rond, avec ces 200 barils d'essence qui butent TOUT LE MONDE - m\u00eame vous - dans la salle, des endroits qui se ferment \u00e0 cl\u00e9 comme par magie, et surtout... cette alarme insupportable. vous la d\u00e9sactivez, elle revient deux secondes apr\u00e8s, et \u00e7a n'attire aucun ennemi. Aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat...\n\nEn conclusion, et j'ai oubli\u00e9 un tas de trucs, le premier \u00e9pisode est juste g\u00e9nial et dr\u00f4le : le deuxi\u00e8me n'est absolument pas dr\u00f4le, (\u00e0 part si prendre un bain dans de l'eau sale vous fait rire, perso j'ai trouv\u00e9 plus amusant de jeter un moustachu \u00e0 poil d\u00e9fonc\u00e9 \u00e0 l'herbe dans une machine pour couper du bois) illogique, et surtout, vraiment... Ce level design totalement foir\u00e9, on comprend rien, il y a trop de d\u00e9tails, la cam\u00e9ra s'affole toute seule en penchant de droite \u00e0 gauche alors que vous n'avez rien pris, ces ennemis qui regardent la t\u00e9l\u00e9 puis qui disparaissent tout seuls, ou encore le fait que vous prendrez des d\u00e9gats dans le vent, vous ne saurez m\u00eame pas si le jeu est bugg\u00e9 ou si le level design trop charg\u00e9 vous a niqu\u00e9.

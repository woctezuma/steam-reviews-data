You do this by platforming around however, this can also be done by walking on the afterimages of light. According to the steam page these are afterimages you see after you rapidly blink or shut your eyes and it is indeed a very interesting concept which is executed very well. \n\n[b] Introduction [/b]\n\nIn blink you are searching for your father and to do this you must conquer the landscape and solve the many puzzles that it has to offer, And these puzzles have been excellently designed. Together with this also the art style and many of the other features like interactions with characters and world design have been done very nicely. The story goes deeper than just trying to find your father with precursor races and more which I will elaborate on later. \n\n[b] Story [/b]\n\nYou the player watch through the eye of an ancient precursor race known as eolians to the humans. You watch through its eye as the boy that you control as a player puzzles his way through various scenes. The boy is trying to find his father while the eolian is trying to find if there are any of his kind left. His species have almost been wiped out because of something called \u201cshadows\u201d you encounter these many times and they are a part of puzzles which is extraordinary!  The way these shadows are designed is incredibly scary, they\u2019re not made to look scary but they certainly are with their menacing slow walk and almost non-existent face.\n\nThe way the story is constructed makes you as the player understand a story that the character you are seeing through already knows which is quite hard to do in most games but here it\u2019s done excellently. Even though it\u2019s technically a puzzle game you could almost call it exploration as the story drives you forward in a quest to find out what\u2019s going on and seeking answers. \n\n[b] Gameplay, movement and mechanics [/b] \n\nThe most innovating mechanic in blink is the ability to walk over the afterimages left by light, in many games the aspect of time travel has been brought as an interesting mechanic however this mechanic that is also interwoven with the story and the enemies is besides from more interesting and original also better implemented.\n \nLight that turns into afterimages after you \u201cblink\u201d will be a walkable surface for a certain amount of time before you die because you were \u201cblinking\u201d too long. The best part is that you can interact with the light in many different ways; if you were to jump in front of it then at that place there would be no walkable surface. If you would turn a lamp only at that spot would there be light etc. it\u2019s that devotion to not just slack off a feature like that which makes this game better than your average new grounds platformer. \nWith the amount of exploration you can do and how many things you can see just using a relatively simple mechanic as walking on light the game becomes a lot more enjoyable and that is what makes it stand apart so much from all the other hand drawn adventure platformers with a nice narrative. \n\n[b] Art and Soundtrack [/b]\n\nThe art in blink is quite phenomenal, wonderfully crafted backgrounds with fluid animations all made by hand. The art style helps convey the twisted dark atmosphere of some of the scenes while rejoicing in the happier parts which is quite impressive for the same art style. \n\nThe shadows look scary and menacing but this is not completely because of the looks in fact this is also largely due to the soundtrack of the game which varies a lot, it can go from happy to eerie to absolutely terrifying. The last one is used for the shadows when \u201cblinking\u201d as that is the time when they will chase you, depending on the monsters that is, which for a single soundtrack is impressive as well. \n\n[b] Conclusion [/b] \n\nAll in All Blink is an incredible work of art with an interesting narrative, likeable characters and great puzzles and platforming. You can see that the developers really care about the game and even though 7 euros may feel like a bit much for \u201cjust another platforming game\u201d it\u2019s definitely worth those 7 euros.

In real life, it\u2019s used to hydrate our eyes and protect them from debris. In nextReality Game\u2019s \u201cBlink\u201d, it\u2019s a fundamental game mechanic. Light interacts with certain elements of the environment. If you hold down the \u201cBlink\u201d button, all platforms and terrain become invisible and intangible, and all that is left is what was illuminated. It\u2019s a cute and intuitive mechanic, with a wide range of potential. Does it live up to it?\n\n(This review was done in partnership with [url=http://www.saveorquit.com/] Save Or Quit.) [/url]\n\nBlink\u2019s story is about as run of the mill as it gets: you\u2019re a child who is looking for their father who hasn\u2019t come home for unknown reasons, and you interact with an ancient civilization that helps you on your path. It goes exactly where you\u2019d expect it; there are no surprises here. There\u2019s a few cute chunks of writing in the town setting, but the story is really not the focus here.\n\nBlink uses a pixel art aesthetic, which is fine, though it is evidently unprofessional in quality. Your scarf clad hero has a nice sense of motion in his animation. It will occasionally zoom out for a larger frame of camera, and the resolution will not scale in the way it should. The music and general sound design is over the same caliber. The music is forgettable; I couldn\u2019t hum you a tune from the soundtrack, but it is mostly innocuous and non-irritating. Mixing was funky at times. There was the poor design choice of having the music cut out every time you blinked, as a synthetic hum replaces it, rising in volume. The purpose of this hum is to indicate to you that you should unblink soon (it has a time limit), but this could have been done in a way that doesn\u2019t create a jerky audio experience. Because you blink a lot in this game. It\u2019s the primary function of this game.\n\nAs I\u2019ve said, Blink\u2019s primary mechanic, that of playing with light, is something that has a wide range of potential. It\u2019s done in a slightly funky way: light is manifested by circles one can hop on, but it works. Blink does enough with it to come out on the positive side there. Using gameplay dualities (i.e. creating two (or more!) modes of play that one switches in between) is not something new to video games. I would give you a list, but it would be a waste of time, because you are probably already thinking of several titles that play around with this. I\u2019m not saying this to be disparaging. It\u2019s a great mechanic, and I am always interested in games that mess around with it. It works fine here. What is a far less common mechanic is light-play. While it appears in many games on occasion, I can only think of a few games that use this as a fundamental mechanic. By blending the two, Blink creates an interesting possibility space for puzzles. And for the most part, it uses that space to good effect. Puzzles were enjoyable, though a bit rote at times, and I never felt truly challenged. New puzzle elements were introduced at a consistent enough rate to keep me interested and engaged in the experience. It has a few tricks up its sleeve. For a puzzle platformer with only two action buttons, Blink gets a lot out of it\u2019s system. \n\nI hate to do this, but it\u2019s hard not to compare this game to another. Eyebrow Interactive\u2019s Closure was a game that also played with light, to an extreme and complex extent. If you couldn\u2019t see it, it really wasn\u2019t there. Blink takes the fundamental principle of Closure, but layers on the mechanic of duality. This is great, but I never felt like I was playing a game that was breaking new ground. It\u2019s mechanic of duality is fine, and it\u2019s mechanic of light play is fine, but the whole is not much greater than the sum of it\u2019s parts. It is nothing more, and nothing less. I do not think one should judge the quality of an experience based on what it is not, of course, so I do think this may be personal projection. Playtime clocked at about two hours, so I may be hesitant to purchase at full asking price.\n\nBlink has a fun mechanic, and uses it. The puzzle design is engaging and uses its core mechanic to a healthy degree, if perhaps a little easy-going. It\u2019s a fun game, but you likely won\u2019t feel much of a need to return to it. As a whole, it is inoffensive and average. It is a good game, but not a great one.", "timestamp_created": 1493587251, "timestamp_updated": 1493587368, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.607779", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31387434": {"recommendationid": "31387434", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059561891", "num_games_owned": 859, "num_reviews": 416, "playtime_forever": 156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491013608}, "language": "english", "review": "Blink is a smooth, relaxing, and extremely enjoyable experience.\n\nI have been talking, writing, reviewing Indie games for a long time. After a while you begin to see patterns or formulas form when it comes to Indie games. It\u2019s not that they become predictable or boring, on the contrary. So when I say that Blink is a Limbo-like title, I mean that in a good way completely. It doesn\u2019t change the fact though, that this is a Puzzle/Platformer starring a child with a strange power that helps him overcome gaps, and shadowy death monsters with an awesome art style. If Walking Simulator/Roguelike can be a genre, can\u2019t Limbo-like be one?\n\nI am aware that Puzzle/platformers have long existed before Braid and Limbo came to be but they are the bar these days. Games such as BOOR, Inside and Never Alone continue to prove the passion and demand for these types of games. It\u2019s a crowded genre to say the least but one I hold in high esteem and love. One the developers seems to as well. Which is why I\u2019m more than happy then to start by saying I highly recommend Blink. \n\nBlink is about a small child whose father goes missing. No, not at the bar type missing but really missing. Without much explanation you wake up inside a mysterious temple and an invisible voice reaches out to you. It gifts you with a power to slip into, \u201cThe Eye.\u201d In the Eye, the laws of physics are different. This begins your quest to find your father and unravel the mystery of the voice and shadow monsters that have begun to plague your village. It\u2019s simple, neat and well told. It\u2019s no Stephen King story mind you, but it gets the major points across without unnecessary complexities.\n\nThe story does evolve and even culminates in a pretty awesome boss battle. For most of the game though its a rather monotone mood but in a good way. While the puzzles are challenging and even had me scratching my head at times. I never felt frustrated or angry at my mistakes, certainly not cheated. Blink has fantastic controls and responds remarkably well. The entire experience is very fluid and enjoyable from beginning to end. When I started playing it, I didn\u2019t stop until I had beat the game. It\u2019s that just smooth and enjoyable.\n\nTo be fair Blink is a rather short experience, topping out for me at 2 hours of total game time. I am fairly experienced at these titles though and it may take longer for others. This is still a rather short experience but I don\u2019t find the pricing unfair at \u00a34.99/$6.99. Especially when others have charged way more for the same amount of game time. (coughINSIDEcough)\n\nLet\u2019s talk about how puzzles work in this game.\n\nWith a press of a button the kid can transport himself into the Eye, a realm where an after image can be used to traverse the terrain. The most basic way to explain it is, you\u2019re using light to create a shadow that acts a platform once you slip into this realm. One important thing to note though is that in the absence of light there is nothing. Which means you will fall into nothing, which happened frequently to me. Also you can\u2019t stay very long in The Eye realm, as it will consume you.\n\nWhat is very impressive is how well this entire system works. You can use light to trap your enemies inside of barriers, create stairwells for yourself, and use the absence of light to slip through walls. It\u2019s all very strange, but it when you get the hang of it, its awesome. The game does begin throwing in more obstacles as you progress. The Shadow monsters are slow and somewhat stupid but become faster and more feral in the Eye. Some shadow creatures can only see you once you slip into the Eye. This leads to it becoming terrifying as they run you down while you try to move through an area. Later areas throw in lanterns, fog, and platforms that shift into The Eye with you. I cannot stress enough that this is a very smooth and wonderfully done progression. It kept things fun but not stressful. I loved that.\n\nOne thing I feel that will perhaps make a person think twice is the art style of this game. Beauty is in the Eye of the beholder in this case. (pun intended.) I will be frank in saying that the sprites for the Humans in this game are weird, and they\u2019re my least favorite part. I felt like I was controlling a hot dog child wrapped in a coat. On the other hand, everything else looks spectacular. The rigid nature of the sprites works well for the shadow monsters and makes them feel alien. The backgrounds and the environments are gorgeous and feel like a painting. I couldn\u2019t stop hitting my screen cap button while playing.\n\nDetails are abundant and there was plenty of times I stopped and spoke to some sheep. The final area of the game is, by far, the most memorable and really just tops things off so very well. Of course none of this really works without a good soundtrack. Thankfully, Blink has an orchestral soundtrack and it\u2019s exactly what you would expect for this type of game. It elevates the game and I never got tired of it. Sound effects while minimal, are sufficient but nothing inspiring.\n\nAs to the odds and ends, Blink does feature Steam achievements but currently no Steam cards. The game features full controller support. No rebindable keys sadly. Replay value is something that will be lacking for this type of game. You might pick it up again in six months and have fun though. This is standard for most games of this nature. The game runs on flash and has zero options menus, those with higher resolutions will have an experience that may vary. Keep that in mind.\n\nDoes Blink bring anything new to the table/innovate? Not necessarily but it does what it set out to do perfectly. If you have played games like Limbo/Braid you know what to expect. If you have never played any of them then this is a great place to start. I never found a bug nor crashed while playing. The nature of the puzzles and mechanics of your powers is executed perfectly. It\u2019s what I took most away from this game. It was just a joy to play. Hopefully more people play Blink and spread the love of Indie Games.", "timestamp_created": 1493267438, "timestamp_updated": 1493267438, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533257", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31384387": {"recommendationid": "31384387", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021012599", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 360, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492568788}, "language": "english", "review": "This is an amazing game with a touching story and intricate puzzle solving levels.

And I have to say its a very solid, fun indie game.  \n\nStory: You're a young kid that is looking for his father.  While looking, you run into this being called the Eye where everything it sees is a reality for you but when it closes its eye, the world disappears around you and anything brightly lit up leaves an afterimage burned into the vision of the Eye.  Using the eye's powers, you will explore the world, solve puzzles, find out what happened to the eye's kind and find your father.  The story is nothing to get excited about but it provides a good setting for how the game plays and for the most part provides reasons for everything that is happening.  It would be nice to see more of the world and learn more about the characters, but remember this is an indie game made by a small group of developers.  Frankly its interesting and serves its purpose.  You don't finish the game with questions.  \n\nGraphics: The game is colorful and I like the art design.  The shadows and light effects are well done, creating a great puzzle platformer game.  I set the graphics to fancy and I played on a 2K monitor for the entire game and I didn't really see any graphical issues while playing.  But my graphics card has more than enough power to play this game. Kudos to the artists!\n\nSound: The music in the game is very calming and soothing until you run into the enemies which makes the music tense but not too tense.  The music does not overwhelm the gameplay.  In fact I sometimes didn't even notice there was music playing.  In my opinion the music and sound effects work well with the game.  Its not in your face and its not too soft.  Though I would not get the soundtrack.  \n\nGameplay: I played this game with an Xbox One controller and I recommend playing with a controller.  The controls are simple and its easy to understand how to play the game.  The game does a good job giving you the instructions and what to do in order to solve puzzles. I never felt like the controls made it hard to solve puzzles.  Its a puzzle platformer that has you manipulate light to solve puzzles, avoid enemies and jump on to platforms to move on to the next puzzle.  Its a very ingenious game that will test your brain a little.  There were times for me where I had to think about how to solve the puzzle (different from my usual fare of shooters and strategy games).  There are not hard but sometimes there is no clear answer unless you stop and think.  Puzzles are well done and clever.  There will be some puzzles that frustrate you at first but you will figure it out.  Note: I didn't run into any issues where I messed up the puzzle and I had to restart but there was one puzzle where I messed up and I almost couldn't restart.  If you run into that issue just quit the game and start it again.  Would be nice to have a restart checkpoint option in the menu.  \n\nOverall: I like this game.  Its different from my usual fare of shooters and strategy games.  For the price you will get a 2-3 hour game on your first playthrough.  After that you may become a pro and get the other achievements.  I would recommend trying this game out.  Its unique, its fun and its short.  It will definitely test your brain a little bit but in a clever way.  Definitely worth a buy and I would buy this for some of my friends.  \n\n10/10\n\nSuggestions for improvement (or sequel):\n-More content about the lore\n-More puzzles\n\nBugs:\nDidn't run into any but when I was at the endgame and I tried to talk to the archaelogy character, my game froze for a little bit.", "timestamp_created": 1492110004, "timestamp_updated": 1492110004, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30952606": {"recommendationid": "30952606", "author": {"steamid": "76561198297539113", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497819548}, "language": "english", "review": "Hey there! just to let you know this game is an AWSOME puzzle game.

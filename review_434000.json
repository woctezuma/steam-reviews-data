However there are some frustrating bugs. For example I was on the mountain high up, I fell off a cliff and into an unescapable area and had to reload. It was kind of hard to find my way again but I didn't any less enjoy this beautiful game. Another bug is, when being chased by a fox, I fell into the ice, or whatever that stuff was, and the fox went inside me. It was hard to jump, but it was ok. I was kind of sad I didn't get to know what the fox actually did because I thought it was cool you suddenly got chased. The log controlling (this is not a bug) was kind of hard, although it did not make the game less enjoyable, yet again. Turning is a bit slow and can be frustrating when attempting to hunt a butterfly, if you are easily angered by simple things like that. The end game was lots of fun and very enjoyable, with the slow scenes and the blinking to sleep. Another thing I think would have been cool, if instead of the camera being off and you can look at yourself when blinking, would be if it was actually in the lynx cub's eye view. I think that would have been interesting. I definitely recommend this game if you like an interactive story game where you can get lifted and thrown by swans, chased by a fox, meet a bear cub, drive a log boat, and use said bear to ride everywhere, this is the game for you!

It enticed me to buy the original Shelter, Paws, The Lonesome Fog and Meadow. As an experienced, hardcore gamer I couldn't anticipate how this series would grab hold of me and dig itself into my heart. Sometimes excruciatingly so.\n\nPaws: A Shelter 2 Game is, as the title might suggest, a standalone spin off of the original Shelter 2 game. Here you play a Lynx cub that became separated from it's mother and siblings. A familiar scenario for anyone who has played Shelter 2, where losing cubs to natural disasters or predators was a very real threat. Players of Shelter 2 might also recognise Paws as a prequel to this game, as the standard name of the Lynx cub is... [spoiler] Inna. That's right, the original Mother Lynx you start Shelter 2 with![/spoiler] \n\nThe main goal is to survive and find your way back to your familiy while looking through the cub's eyes and braving the dangers of the wilds, encountering a number of other animal species and discovering the mysteries of the world you live in. Paws breaths mystery. It is never apparent or obvious, but there seems to be some kind of vibe that speaks to you on an almost primitive, subconcious level. \n\nThe game is best described as an impressionistic image of the wilds and the place the Lynx family has in it. Although graphically far from photorealistic, the \"painted fairytale storybook\" style is the best looking installment of the series yet, accompanied by stunningly beautiful and sensitive music that fits the setting prefectly and amplifies the experience. On the surface Paws seems simple, but it appeals strongly to your perception and emotions, sometimes up to the level of actual tears and heartache.

User input options and controls need work.\n\nI try to be fair in any review that isn't a joke, so I'll endeavor to do the same here.\n\nWe'll start with what most people notice about the game, which is the visuals. The models are cute and the textures quilt-like, which is very pleasing to the eye, and the animal sounds are pretty good. For Shelter 1 & 2, this definitely made it pop. Now that we are on at least 4 different games (or interactive media) that all have the same visual style, their visual unity is all the more apparent. It's also for this reason that it's not breath-taking in its own right anymore; birds fly, fish swim, Might and Delight make cute, nice-looking animal games. Like all of their titles, the soundtrack is quite pleasing when it wants to be and makes some nice use of simple instrumentals. It's nothing ground-breaking, but I think it does the job reasonably well for the communication of tense or calm moments.\n\nThe biggest issue you'll likely have playing this game is the controls and camera. The controls are slippery, temperamental, and can get you killed if you are in any part of the game that requires precision or timing, like when a fox comes by. It's extremely difficult to get the lynx to jump where it's supposed to, and there are points where you will find yourself unable to jump up a ledge because the bear suddenly stops being registered as something to jump on by the game. There isn't much to tell you what the buttons do, either, which wasn't a huge issue for my own playthrough but seems to have lead to a number of new players getting confused. All of this is exacerbated by being unable to zoom and move the camera very well; it's always quite close-up and tends to get stuck in things. All of this is enough to make it difficult for me to play it for very long stretches, and losing out on a collectible simply because the bear stopped dancing and won't let you land on its back anymore for some reason gets wearying.\n\nAs I consider the gameplay and usability of a game to be the most important aspects before building anything on top of that, and that Paws is not really trying to be a piece of art wherein every aspect plays a pivotal role, we can try stripping away the purely visual aspects and see what we're left with. A simple story with endearing little animals that gets let down by janky controls and an annoying camera. It's more solid than a lot of other titles and digital toys out there and it has a well-defined beginning and end(s), but the gameplay just isn't as enjoyable as it could be and most of the challenge comes from the controls of the game rather than the game itself or any conscious gameplay design choices. If you're a diehard fan of the Shelter series, you may enjoy it or you may be let down by how different this one pilots. If you're new to Shelter, this game's tone fits well but may give you a somewhat-inaccurate view of the series.

That isn't a bad story idea, but you know what else isn't a bad idea?\n\nPros: \n- [b] this game is extremely cute [/b]\n- It was fun, short lived entertainment.\n- The graphic design was fairly decent.\n- The story is a basic formula, but hey! No dying cats this time!... unless you count the missing cub at the end. \n- I like the easter eggs.\n\nCons:\n- The camera and controls are downright AWFUL. I'm supposed to be looking for my bear buddy but my lynx is doing 9,000 backflips and the camera is having a seziure! \n- The game is too short. If I don't count the times I got stuck this game could be completed within 1.2 hours. \n- The graphics are also very hard to look at sometimes. I remember I got stuck for a while because I thought a bush was apart of the ground. \n\nOverall, should you play this? It's pretty much matter of opinion. If you liked the original Shelter games, you might enjoy this Shelter 2 spinoff. Or if you like nature games or lynxes it's also a possibility you might like this. I personally enjoyed this, but what about you?", "timestamp_created": 1503197460, "timestamp_updated": 1503197460, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.651483", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34183231": {"recommendationid": "34183231", "author": {"steamid": "76561198206668504", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1097, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503268468}, "language": "english", "review": "I had loved the first and second games, and I also decided to get this game. From the trailers, I decided it was a game where you played as a lynx cub, stayed with your family, escaped danger, and grow up and leave your mother. Then you would survive on your own, find a mate, and leave them to raise your family. Then you would have to play Shelter 2. I was so wrong. Below is the story, which I recommend not reading for the game is best going in blind.\n\n[spoiler] In Paws you play as a lynx cub, with you lynx family. Any new player would immediatly get attached with their family, for you play around with your siblings and follow your mother. After sleeping on the second day, you wake up near dawn to see your mother walking away from the den. You follow your mother  up a hill and see a star. After looking at the star for a while, it floats into the sky. Then you and your mother go to sleep.\nWhen you wake up its all cloudy. You follow your mother out of the den, over a log, and then the story progresses. Then its raining. You and your siblings are most likely either scared, tired, or hungry, for when you meow, you sound more depressed. \nThen you come across a river. Your mother picks you up and walks across it, your siblings swimming along. Then a wave washes you out of your mother's grasp. You get stunned in the water for a second when you start to swim along. Your mother picks up one of your siblings and the other two make it onto shore. But then another wave comes. Your mother puts the other cub on the shore and runs after you. The wave then washes you away before your mother can grab you.\nYou then wake up and proceed to search for your family. After traveling, following your family's footprints, and resting, you wake up due to a pack of hunting wolves. You run along, and meet a bear cub. After feeding it three birds or berries, it will become strong again and follow you around, helping you. \nAt some point of your search, you'll come to a foggy area. If you sniff around, you can find a hidden 'ghost' of your family.  But a fox is also among the ghost, and in it the fox seems to be hunting your other three siblings. Then you go through a tunnel and need to find a way for your bear friend to follow you. You then will enter a foggy bit, and music will start playing. There are platforms that you can jump onto, which is important to do because the fox will attempt to attack you.\nIf you get attacked, then the screen will go black and you can hear the fox biting into the cub when the bear suddenly attacks it and chases the fox off. You will then wake up in a den that the bear brought you two. It will leave and come back with a fish. The bear then drops the fish and covers the den with branches to camoflauge it.\nWhen you wake up you will walk along as normal but then your friend will run off. If you follow the bear, then you will come across a river.\nAcross the river is your mother and two of your siblings. Here you have the choice. Swim across the river to your family or stay with your bear friend. If you go with your mother, then everytime you try to go back your mother will pick you up. If you go with your bear friend, your friend will eat one berry bushes and you go through them to go to a den. It also is possible to go with your mother and when she goes to sleep with your siblings, you can go across the river to your bear and go with the bear ending, but only if you had your friend eat the bushes first.\nAt the ending, you climb up a hill and see a star come down. You will see who you left behind, which I found heartbreaking. [/spoiler]\n\nStrangly, the other Shelter games didn't make me cry when a cub died or when I got to the ending. But when I got to the ending of Paws for the first time, I cried. Even when I see the ending now, I still feel sad. Its pretty rare for a game to make me cry, and even more rare for me to feel the same feeling at the same part over and over again.", "timestamp_created": 1502512043, "timestamp_updated": 1502512043, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.683239", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34113948": {"recommendationid": "34113948", "author": {"steamid": "76561198367714992", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 24, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498682900}, "language": "english", "review": "It's so beautifully made, paws is relaxing and mindful.

Just from the beginning, you can tell that Might and Delight put lots of work into the designs and patterns in the forest. I say that this game is adorable and takes you on a little lynx's journey throughout her first steps. \nGet ready for a rollarcoaster:\n\nSPOILERS: TURN BACK NOW IF YOU WANT TO!\n\nYou start out as a little lynx, snuggled up with her siblings at her mother's lap. Then, the mother takes them out for the first time. You get to play games, tackle your brothers and sisters, and eat your first prey. Then, your mother takes you to the river, where you play and run. Then, it overflows. Squealing at the top of your lungs, you are carried across the river by your mother. But then, another kitten squeaks for help. The mother trips and loses you. You yowl for help, and the mother turns around and sees you being carried away. She yowls back, racing desprately to reach you. But a huge wave crashes on top of both you and your mother, and you are carried away as your mother continues to yowl and run after you.\nYou wash up on a creek bed. You open your eyes and explore. Mean swans thrust you about and you get scared from all the big birds. You are trampled from a deer herd, and you try hard to sniff out the trail to your mother. You sniff, following the scent. Sometimes you can see the outlines of you mother, her and your littermates calling your name. They are searching for you, like you are for them. Soon, weary and tired, you come to a clearing in the forest. There, sleeping in the middle, is a lost, little bear cub.\nYou hunt for the bear. The bear cub eats three finches before it walks around with you. Maybe he could help you find your mother...\n\nThis game is adorable, I've said that already but I can't say it enough. It's heartbreakingly lovingly. If you want to see a fan-fiction version of this, go to my screenshots and start from the beginning. This game is fun, but there are TWO IMPORTANT THINGS that YOU and MIGHT AND DELIGHT need to know:\n\n1. This game is super quick. I finished it in three hours. Not worth $15, despite the amazing graphics and attention put into it. More like $10. But I still 100% recommend it.\n2. To make the lynx look up, you have to right click, hold it, and scroll DOWN. I mean, I got used to it, but it still threw me off. Maybe you could fix this?\n\nSo, to come to a conculsion, this game is fun, safe, singleplayer, and has beautiful graphics and designs.", "timestamp_created": 1496514509, "timestamp_updated": 1496514509, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 53, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.844735", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32158160": {"recommendationid": "32158160", "author": {"steamid": "76561198291737246", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 86, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496513359}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Gostei da experiencia, um jogo com dire\u00e7\u00e3o de arte linda, a trilha sonora combina perfeitamente com o ambiente on\u00edrico do game.

FOR ANYONE WHO LOVES NATURE SURVIVAL ESPECIALLY WITH ANIMALS, then this game along with the two other games of the shelter series are beautiful and amazingly made games that really show you the harsh reality of nature in an awesome way. 1000/10", "timestamp_created": 1495494184, "timestamp_updated": 1495494184, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532909", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31896852": {"recommendationid": "31896852", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043330224", "num_games_owned": 275, "num_reviews": 243, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495436644}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041b\u044e\u0431\u043b\u044e \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0443\u044e \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c. \u041f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0448\u0435, \u043d\u043e \u043b\u044e\u0431\u043b\u044e \u0438 \u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0443\u044e. \u041d\u043e \u044d\u0442\u0430 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0448\u0442\u0430\u043c\u043f\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0443 \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u043e\u0440\u0438\u0433\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0434\u0435\u0438. \u0422\u0435\u043c \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 \u0437\u0430 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0433\u0438. \u0423\u0436 \u0438\u0437\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435.", "timestamp_created": 1495436648, "timestamp_updated": 1495436648, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.311087", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31502870": {"recommendationid": "31502870", "author": {"steamid": "76561198274406786", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 204, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480162943}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0447\u0430\u0441, \u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u043f\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044e. \n\u0411\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043f\u043e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435 \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u043e...\n\u041e\u0442\u043c\u0435\u0447\u0443, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0435\u0441\u044c\u043c\u0430 \u0430\u0442\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0444\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0430, \u043d\u043e \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0442\u044b \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0448\u044c \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442\u0430, \u043f\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0443\u0437\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443 \u0441 \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e! \n\u0414\u0420\u0423\u0413, \u0442\u043e \u0431\u0443\u0434\u044c \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f!", "timestamp_created": 1493717365, "timestamp_updated": 1493717365, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.436855", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31455679": {"recommendationid": "31455679", "author": {"steamid": "76561198168495398", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 680, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515641636}, "language": "english", "review": "I give this lovely game an 11/10.

Well if you read this devolpers, can you consider it?\n\n1 downside is that when you pick your mother at the end your bear friend sounds really sad as you leave and appears as a spirit it made me cry at both occurances", "timestamp_created": 1489713519, "timestamp_updated": 1489713519, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30520378": {"recommendationid": "30520378", "author": {"steamid": "76561198274279277", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494499339}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e24\u5468\u76ee\uff0c\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7ed3\u5c40\uff0c\u4e00\u6837\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u4e00\u6837\u7684\u611f\u52a8\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1489559088, "timestamp_updated": 1489559088, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30509182": {"recommendationid": "30509182", "author": {"steamid": "76561198365944255", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 98, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504013458}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0428\u0415\u0414\u0415\u0412\u0420!!! \u0421\u0430\u043c\u0430\u044f \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0432 \u043c\u0438\u0440\u0435 ! \u041e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0443\u044e!", "timestamp_created": 1489505451, "timestamp_updated": 1489505451, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523996", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30482847": {"recommendationid": "30482847", "author": {"steamid": "76561198347411786", "num_games_owned": 407, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 549, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494391262}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5267\u60c5\u5185\u5bb9\u5f88\u63ea\u5fc3\uff0cbug\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8bdd\u8fd8\u597d\uff0c\u53cd\u6b63\u6211\u6ca1\u9047\u5230\u8fc7\u2026(-_-)\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u5c0f\u4f19\u4f34\u8df3\u4e0d\u4e0a\u718a\u7684\u8bdd\uff0c\u957f\u6441\u7a7a\u683c\u952e\u5373\u53ef\uff0c\u627e\u4e0d\u5230\u811a\u5370\u65f6\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u7ed5\u5708\uff0c\u5267\u60c5\u504f\u77ed\uff0c\u6709\u4e24\u5904\u5267\u60c5\u8d3c\u63ea\u5fc3\u4e86", "timestamp_created": 1489367696, "timestamp_updated": 1489367696, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30456128": {"recommendationid": "30456128", "author": {"steamid": "76561198275302285", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504455132}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "chorei, q final lindo", "timestamp_created": 1489265508, "timestamp_updated": 1489265508, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30452609": {"recommendationid": "30452609", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106541228", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490033671}, "language": "english", "review": "I can't remember the last time when a game made me cry.

After an hour, the lag usually sets in and I can't play at all. This game is frustrating. It tries to be all atmospheric but with it literally being the most frustrating game I've ever played, it's just getting more frustrating.

It dishes out a delightful story that sticks true to nature and really puts you in the 'paws' of your lynx cub character. \n\nThe game is perfectly made in every way. I mean, cute little mewling sounds are just so darn adorable. But there are a couple of cons to this that in no way made me think bad or even get annoyed at it. Just slight inconveniences really.\n\nThe controls are a tad oversensitive when controlling the camera. This can take a little time getting used to but every game has its unique feel and Paws certainly gives you plenty of breathing room to master the controls.\n\nIf you, like me, love going for achievements too, just be aware the game will only reward you the ones you've earned once you've shut down the game. This makes it hard, especially for the puff ball achievement, to keep track of how many you've knocked off. \n\nI found this game to have no real challenge, just simple fun. The previous Shelter games did have more challenges to them. This doesn't change my love for this game, however I do wish there were points in it that enacted serious danger to both characters to put across how deadly the real world is to young cubs alone in the wild. \n\nOverall a delightful game, beautiful storyline, and certainly pulls on the emotional strings to your heart. I highly recommend this game if you love playing as animals. You don't have to worry about playing the other Shelter games as they all have separate stories. This game is very short but the enjoyment goes on forever. Give it a try!\n\nAlso, beware the swans.

Through evocative use of symbolism, animal sounds, visual interactions, the occasional line of poetic verse, tonally spot-on music (Retro Family never disappoints!), and its signature abstract storybook art direction, Might and Delight manages to tell a powerful, bittersweet tale about the bonds that tie nature together--the unbreakable bond that connects Inna with her family even from afar, as well as the unlikely bond that builds between Inna and the bear cub, and fosters a will to survive within them both. Paws is off the charts cute and tugs hard on the heartstrings in all the right ways. \n\nRead my full review at: http://www.vgblogger.com/review-paws/37132/\n\nDisclosure: I reviewed the game from a free code provided by Might and Delight.", "timestamp_created": 1480407493, "timestamp_updated": 1511412443, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532710", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28005575": {"recommendationid": "28005575", "author": {"steamid": "76561198335092017", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 92, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480371543}, "language": "polish", "review": "Bardzo wzruszaj\u0105ca gra z cudna grafik\u0105!

Now, I try not to judge the game for it length, but being so short it shows another problem - no time to grow fond of the characters. Out of my 1.7 hours only 30 minutes I got to spent with that bear. When it was over I could not care less about him, because I hardly spent any time with him to begin with.

But there were too many drawbacks keeping me from actually enjoying it.\n\nThis game might be more aptly titled \"Lost in the Woods Simulator 2016\". The dizzying watercolors of the environment mixed with similar-themed areas make it very difficult to find your way. There is a 'sense' mode where you can sniff to try and find your mother, and sometimes her paw prints will appear in a trail, showing you the way. My issue with this was that 1) these hints didn't appear often enough for me and 2) when they did appear, it was extremely difficult to tell which way they were leading. I spent way too much time just walking around in circles, trying to find my way.\n\nThe controls are not explained very well, not even if you explicitly go into the keybindings menu. When I found the baby bear and it was clear he was hungry and I had to feed him in order to wake him up, I had SUCH a difficult time figuring out how to pick up food and bring it to him without eating it myself.\n\nIf it wasn't for the confusion completely jarring me out of the experience, both through the environment and the keybindings (I was playing with an Xbox controller btw), it would be a really cute game.

Perhaps they are your favourite animal or you\u2019re just interested in the species or animal kingdom. Whatever the case, [i][b]Paws: A Shelter 2 Game[/b][/i] acts as both an educational game and also an immersion into the lynx life. Play as one of four cubs and begin a journey of love, triumph, friendship, loss, survival, and motherhood. Understand the complex relationship between life and nature - the very force that compels the choices we make.\n\nIf you are already familiar with the franchise and enjoyed it, in particular [i][b]Shelter 2[/b][/i], then you will be pleased to know that this game is very similar. It follows the same story line as its predecessor, but differs in that it now allows gamers to experience life through the lens of a young cub. As you control this particular cub you will experience a mother\u2019s love and patience, a family\u2019s warmth, and then almost suddenly, desperation and separation. Ultimately, this is a game that will pull at your heartstrings as fast as it will mend them. This is the game that introduces us to Inna.\n\n[h1]---------------------------------------------------------[/h1]\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n+ This is a game that you can definitely play with your family\n+ New characters to meet and explore! The Goose is not a welcomed character though... \n+ It's a [i]Might and Delight[/i] game, and unfortunately I will always be biased and say they're great\n+ Adorable sound effects and music. Very appropriate for the kind of game that this is and helps set the mood\n+ You get to play as a lynx cub and piggy back on a bear cub: what more could you want?! Be aware, the bear cub can be quite tempermental\n+ As always, [i][b]Paws: A Shelter 2 Game[/b][/i] is set within an artistically pleasing world; the graphics are unique to this franchise and offers real familiarity to those who know and love it\n \n[h1] Neutral[/h1]\n\u00b1 Like all the other games in this franchise, the achievements take time and dedication to get; they are definitely no walk in the park. Prepare to spend a couple of days toiling over the locations of the rares, etc.\n\u00b1 Controls are both easy yet sometimes a hinderance. What I mean is controls are clunky  at times, like when you're trying to catch prey, but easy when you're doing small stuff (like basic maneuvering, running, and jumping)\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n- To those who have played through the whole game: the ending - what?\n- I suggest waiting for this game to go on sale before purchasing it. It's not worth the $14,99 price tag when you'll probably complete it in about 3 hours tops\n- You will get lost from time to time. The lack of directions can be annoying and you will be backtracking a lot due to the lack of instructions. In the end, it's not fun at all and does detract from the overall quality of the game\n- If you stray far off the path, then be prepared to glitch like hell... I managed to leave the path completely and ended up stuck between 3 tree's. I attempted to jump, crawl, and walk my way out, but to no avail. Out of frustration I ended up just closing the game only to lose all the progress I had made in that session. To say the least, I was [i]furious[/i]\n- Do you suffer from motion sickness? If yes, then please be aware of your tolerance and take breaks accordingly. I\u2019m easily affected by motion sickness, sadly, and the camera angles in this makes me feel like I'm aboard a ship. This is the number one flaw of the game, but I can understand the difficulties the developers have in trying to get it just right for every gamer. Mess around a bit with the settings - it may or may not help. As for me, I can only play about 20 minutes of this game before I have to exit it (reason behind my low play time)\n\n[h1]---------------------------------------------------------[/h1]\n\nExperience the raw power of nature and form a valuable bond along your journey. This is a riveting tale of friendship that withstands all odds. It will force you out of your comfort zone at times, and you will think considerably about every tough decision presented before you. While this game does have its issues that it can't seem to iron out, I still highly recommend it if you're a [i]Might and Delight[/i] fan. This is a great game to add to your [i]Shelter[/i] collection. \n\nAll in all, brace yourself for heartbreak and other mood swings, for [i][b]Paws: A Shelter 2 Game[/b][/i] will tug at every ounce of your being.\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\n\n6.5/10\n\n[h1]---------------------------------------------------------[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1465181403, "timestamp_updated": 1501214032, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.702027", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23411064": {"recommendationid": "23411064", "author": {"steamid": "76561198219770308", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497392298}, "language": "english", "review": "I cant even play the game!!!

I will not actually get into Shelter 2 a lot. It is pretty confusing in some parts, in other parts, it completely tells you what to do. I'd say it would be worth 10 instead of 15 but, since I love it so much, its fine. It basically heart-wrenches you. From a happy start, to already a treacherous part, transitions kind of fast. I also love the art style, I have not seen another game with its style (May be one) meaning, its is unique, and does not copy off of others. It also has a great soundtrack (As many games with good soundtracks, sell them) too. Also, a little easter egg, that is also a SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER. READ THIS ONLY IF YOU HAVE PLAYED THE FIRST MOMENTS OF IT! Inna, is the name of the cub you play as. In Shelter 2, your name as a mother is Inna too. Even though the title says \"....A Shelter 2 Game\" I still think it would be one. So this basically tells the story of the mother in Shelter 2. SPOILER OVER. I'd say buy it if you love great story lines, as it is confusing at times, like a puzzle. You need good common sense,  for the objects around you. And I especially love the feature (SMALL SPOILER) where you can sniff out your mother's foot steps to find her, as this is a great way to tell players where to go. Its really confusing, but has a great storyline. It really is nothing else, but you could get Shelter 2 if you'd like an actual game similar to this. And yes I did cry in Shelter 2 where one of my cubs, almost grown :( died. It is a pretty hard game, indeed, but if one cub dies, it affects (SMALL SPOILER, again) the family tree in the game. As I said, Paws, is more for a story, where you will certainly cry (If you won't, you have a demonic heart) and even though Shelter 2 doesn't have a story, it can still make you cry, as you work so hard for your cubs, just to see the perish. A little off-topic warning: Games with a 'juicy' story like this, can have people who are recommending, say spoilers. Thats why I don't really read any of them, just look at what percentage. I'd say for a game like this, 80 percent and above is fine. 90 percent, is an extremely good game. In other games, like something you play with, not enfold a story, 75 and above is perfect.

Bir yavru olarak annemiz ve karde\u015flerimizden ayr\u0131 d\u00fc\u015f\u00fcyoruz. Bundan sonra ise ailemizin izlerini takip edip onlara kavu\u015fmaya \u00e7al\u0131\u015f\u0131yoruz. Bu s\u00fcre\u00e7te bir de ay\u0131 yavrusuna rastl\u0131yoruz ve kendisi bizim yolda\u015f\u0131m\u0131z oluyor. Yolundan ayr\u0131 d\u00fc\u015fm\u00fc\u015f iki yavru olarak maceram\u0131za devam ediyoruz.\n\n\u0130lk iki oyundaki gibi hayatta kalma elementlerinin bu oyunda sadece hikaye odakl\u0131 oldu\u011funu s\u00f6ylemek gerek. Herhangi bir \u015fey yemesek de oyunda hayatta kalabiliyor, d\u00fc\u015fmanlardan darbe yedi\u011fimizde herhangi k\u00f6t\u00fc bir sonu\u00e7la kar\u015f\u0131la\u015fm\u0131yoruz. Tek yapmam\u0131z gereken e\u011fer bir durum i\u00e7in yiyecek bulmam\u0131z gerekti\u011fi s\u00f6ylenirse yiyecek bulmak. Bu durum da zaten bir ka\u00e7 kez ger\u00e7ekle\u015fiyor. Onun haricinde oyuna herhangi bir etkisi yok.\n\nGrafik se\u00e7imi olarak Shelter serisi kendine g\u00fczel bir yer edinmi\u015f durumda. Ayn\u0131 sanat dizayn\u0131n\u0131 Paws: A Shelter 2 Game\u2019da da g\u00f6rebiliyoruz. \u00c7izimler sanki birer resim gibi duruyor. Her karesi g\u00f6ze \u00e7ekici g\u00f6z\u00fck\u00fcyor. Ancak ufak bir \u00e7eki\u015ftirme yapmam gerekirse, baz\u0131 doku detaylar\u0131n\u0131n, yak\u0131nla\u015f\u0131ld\u0131\u011f\u0131nda \u00e7ok d\u00fc\u015f\u00fck kalitede g\u00f6z\u00fckt\u00fc\u011f\u00fcn\u00fc s\u00f6yleyebilirim. Fakat bu tabi ki sadece bir de\u011ferlendirme. Oyuna herhangi bir eksisi yok \u00e7\u00fcnk\u00fc grafikler, oyunun temas\u0131yla genel manada \u00e7ok iyi uyu\u015fuyor. Oyundaki m\u00fczikleri yine serideki di\u011fer oyunlardan da tan\u0131d\u0131\u011f\u0131m\u0131z \u0130svi\u00e7re as\u0131ll\u0131 Retro Family yap\u0131yor. Bu gitar, bas ve piyanodan olu\u015fan m\u00fczikler atmosferi tam anlam\u0131yla yakal\u0131yor. Kimi zaman ise oyun m\u00fczikten ar\u0131n\u0131yor ve yaln\u0131zl\u0131k hislerimiz kabar\u0131yor. Bu dengeyi \u00e7ok iyi yakalad\u0131klar\u0131n\u0131 rahatl\u0131kla s\u00f6yleyebilirim.\n\nSon s\u00f6z olarak, Paws: A Shelter 2 Game oynan\u0131\u015f s\u00fcresi bak\u0131m\u0131ndan \u00e7ok k\u0131sa ancak \u00f6z bir \u015fekilde bir hikaye anlatan ve sonucunda hislerimizi t\u0131rmalayan bir oyun.

But be aware that it is short and also has a terrible camera and clunky controls. Also if you often get motion sickness from games, this might cause problems for you. \n\nLonger version: \n\nThis game is cute. I really really wanted to really enjoy it, even knowing that it was just going to be a short romp. \n\nUnfortunately trying to play with mouse and keyboard was an absolute nightmare. I spent a while just trying to make the camera not a wildly swinging around pain in the ass, and eventually just gave up and settled on the static camera so I could actually start playing. And even once I did start playing, I had to keep stopping to close my eyes and deep breathe because I was getting incredibly motion sick.\n\nThe controls are.. meh. I don't know. It felt like even with the sensitivity turned down trying to move around would often result in me having to zig zag around, making my motion sickness worse. It's weirdly difficult to get back to moving in a straight line.\n\nI'm sure, with a lot of fiddling around, I could have the controls and camera be actually manageable, but who even knows about the motion sickness.

Von der Grafik nahezu identisch. Nur dass ihr die\u00dfmal nicht die Mutter spielt sondern ein Luchsbaby! Shelter 2 war ein Open World Game und dies hier ist wesentlich linearer. Dies empfand ich hier aber nicht schlimm, obwohl ich eig. eher ein Fan von Open World bin. Aber hier passt es einfach alles gut. \n\nIch pers\u00f6nlich fand das Spiel sehr sehr s\u00fc\u00df gemacht und mich hats emotional auch nicht kalt gelassen, vor allem nicht das Ende. (keine Sorge, gespoilert wird nicht). \nGro\u00dfer Nachteil: Das Spiel ist seeehr kurz. Wenn ihr schnell seid k\u00f6nnt ihr das in einer halben Stunde locker beenden. Wenn ihr euch Zeit lasst und alles mitnehmen wollt, sowohl jeden EIndruck als auch Secrets (ja da gibts hier einiges) seid ihr gut 2 Stunden besch\u00e4ftigt. \nAufgrund der L\u00e4nge des Spiels empfinde ich 15 \u20ac als absolut unangemessen, also entweder auf einen Sale warten oder woanders kaufen. Ich pers\u00f6nlich habs f\u00fcr 7\u20ac bekommen und das war f\u00fcr mich ok, weil es ein echt sch\u00f6nes wenn auch kurzes Spiel ist. \nAber die Entwickler h\u00e4tten viel mehr aus der Story machen k\u00f6nnen und das ist schade.\n\n\nTrotzdem, alles in allem ein sch\u00f6nes Spiel welches mir sehr viel Spa\u00df gemacht hat und ich f\u00fchlte mich in jeder Sekunde des spielens wohl! :)\n\nAlso: Kaufempfehlung!", "timestamp_created": 1460161598, "timestamp_updated": 1460161598, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530875", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22263055": {"recommendationid": "22263055", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093555198", "num_games_owned": 279, "num_reviews": 97, "playtime_forever": 119, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495628861}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc794\uc794\ud55c \ube0c\uae08\uacfc \ub2e8\uc21c\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uadc0\uc5ec\uc6b4 \ud14d\uc2a4\uccd0\n\n\uc5b4\ubbf8\uac00 \uc0ac\ub0e5\ubc95\uc744 \uc54c\ub824\uc8fc\uace0 \ud615\uc81c\ub4e4\uacfc \uac19\uc774 \ub0ae\uc7a0\uc744 \uc7a4\uc5c8\ub358\n\ud3c9\ud654\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5b4\ub290\ub0a0.. \ud3ed\uc6b0\uac00 \uc3df\uc544\uc838 \uadf8\ub4e4\uacfc \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9c0\uac8c \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4\n\n\uc5b4\ubbf8\uc758 \ubc1c\uc790\ucde8\ub97c \ucc3e\uc544..\uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ud615\uc81c\uc640 \ud589\ubcf5\ud558\uac8c \uc9c0\ub0c8\ub358 \ub0a0\ub4e4\uc744 \uc0c1\uc0c1\ud558\uba70\n\uc232\uc18d\uc744 \uc5ec\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uc774\uc57c\uae30 \uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4 \n\n\uc601\uc5b4\uac00 \ub098\uc640\ub3c4 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \uc601\uc5b4\ubfd0\uc774\uc5ec \uadf8\ub807\uac8c \ub9ce\uc774 \ub098\uc624\uc9c0\ub3c4 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4\n\n- \uc800\ub294 \uacf0 \ubc84\uadf8\uac00 \uac78\ub824\uc11c \uc9c4\ud589\uc774 \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc0c1\ud669\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4\n\uc9c4\uc9dc \uc138\uc774\ube0c \ud30c\uc77c \ub2e4\ubc84\ub9ac\uace0 \ucc98\uc74c\ubd80\ud130 \ub2e4\uc2dc \ud574\ubd24\ub294\ub370\ub3c4 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \ud574\uacb0\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub124\uc694\n\n- \uc870\uc791\uc774 \uc5b4\ub835\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc77c\ub2e8 \uc774\ub3d9\uacfc \uc2dc\uc57c \ub9e4\ub044\ub7fd\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0 \n\uc704\uc544\ub798\uac00 \ubc18\uc804\uc0c1\ud0dc (\uc704\ub97c \ubcf4\ub824\uba74 \ub9c8\uc6b0\uc2a4\ub97c \uc544\ub798\ub85c) \ub77c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \uc2a4\ud2b8\ub808\uc2a4\uac00 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4\n\ub098\ube44 \uc7a1\uc744\ub54c \uc880 \ud654\uac00 \ub098\ub124\uc694", "timestamp_created": 1459913036, "timestamp_updated": 1459913036, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514349", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22241579": {"recommendationid": "22241579", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148759727", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 330, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491027942}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game's atmosphere and everything so far, though I'm finding a lot of bugs as I go along.

I liked how the hints didn't lead me through the whole game, just handy enough to show me what to do the first time 'round but subtle enough to ignore on other plays. I also appreciated that it isn't just a play-through and you've now seen it all, you need to play it more than once, to build the puzzle pieces. One thing I found difficult though, was camera response, different from shelter 2.

I used a keyboard & mouse, and had to fiddle with the settings quite a bit to make it playable.  Even with tweaked settings, the camera is hard to work with, and the mouse movements are not precise.  The log bit was probably the worst, as the log would never turn in the direction I wanted.  Who knows, maybe a controller is the only way to go.\n\n3. Game time.  In my eyes, you should be able to have at LEAST as many hours of fun as the game costs.  This game costs $14.99 and my first main playthrough (the fun bit) didn't even last an hour.

It's a very sad and yet a very happy story.\n\n[b]GRAPHICS[/b]\nPaws has a very interresting artstyle, very similar to N64 graphics. The game is created out of polygons, yet even through that it's a beautiful game. It gets you immersed in the game instantly, the textures on such simple shapes draw you in and make you want to stay. Paws is an admirable game for this reason; I have never found a game that provides this feeling.\n\n[b]GAMEPLAY[/b]\nThis game runs perfectly; at even the highest settings, it runs perfectly for many people. As the graphics are mere polygons, it's not too hard for any PC to handle. The controls are smooth as well, acting like they should properly. The subtlest buttons can do great things however. The LMB has you meow, this is your way on communication. You can talk to other animals this way, and it's too cute for words. One flaw with the gameplay is that when you rotate, you don't go right into facing that direction, the cat has to do an actual turn, which can cause some problems if you're being chased. Though overall, it's perfect. \n\n[b]OVERALL[/b]\nOverall, this game is amazing. It has a deep story that drags you in from the second it starts to the second it ends. The graphics are simple shapes, yet beautiful and really set the mood for an adventure story. The game runs smoothly as well, reacting as you'd probably want it to. I recommend this game for sure, this game is revolutionary in my opinion, showing something that seems so basic can be an amazing work of art.\n\n[b]RATING[/b]\nThe game gets: [i]4.5/5[/i]\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1459347871, "timestamp_updated": 1459347871, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.461994", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22128601": {"recommendationid": "22128601", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138089243", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 75, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479709351}, "language": "english", "review": "Really great game, the art style is brilliant and simplistic.

Do read this before making a choice!!!\n\n\nWhere to begin... I guess firstly we take a look at price tag and content. It took me 3 hours for this game because I wanted both endings, the second playthrough finished faster because I knew what I was going for. So is $15 worth for a game of 3 hours? Well I'm here to explain the game and you decide.\n\nNow in Paws unlike the previous titles, you actually play as a cub! A lynx cub. You're separated from family and you're off to an adventure to find them. Along the way you meet a companion and later in the game you will find yourself at a crossroad on which side to pick.\n\nThe world did get expanded... a little I guess. There are the same old collectibles as in Shelter 1 and 2 that doesn't really do anything aside from achievements. If anything though, I feel like the world is even more vivid than the previous titles and the atmosphere along with the background music playing during specific parts really set the atmosphere really well.\n\nOne part I was at a swamp-like area and the background music really set the mood that this place isn't very welcoming which was fantastic.\n\nThe AI is simple and works fine. Although the game still retains the 'feeding' mechanic from the previous titles, it does nothing. You don't get hungry or tired; you can sprint all day and get to the end w/o eating (or at least it seems that way. I didn't try as I ate along the way for immersion). There isn't a hunger/stamina indication so dunno why this is a thing.\n\nThe rest of the game's pretty linear as usual but you can explore each section of the game to find collectibles and just indulge yourself in the world. Speaking of indulging yourself, since you're playing as a little cub, you can left click to meow! It's so... ADORABLE. I almost fainted out of cuteness. \n\nAnyways back to the game. The narrative is quite different in this game. Some areas it's okay, there's a clear direction on where to go, other times it can get confusing. I was stuck at one part of the game for roughly 10-15 minutes because I didn't know where to go.\n\nThere's also a lack of real danger in the game as dying just resets to last saved point unlike in the previous titles where danger eats your family. Although this could be a feature as it allows you to fully experience the life of a lynx lost in the wilderness trying to return to her family. I know I enjoyed it.\n\nSo in conclusion, this game is more lively than its predecessors. Much more beautiful and the endings are both fantastic although I'm in favor for one over the other but that's just me. There are two endings so let that be a thing for you to think about as you play this game; a Friend ending and a Family ending.\n\n**Minor Spoiler** \nIf you're aiming for the friend ending, when you see foxes, let them attack you.\n**Minor Spoiler ended**\n\nSo now back to the question for those who has never played this title series before. Is it worth $15 for a 2-3 hour game? It can even be longer if you're the kind of person who likes to achieve everything in a game. However, I was talking about it being a 2-3 hour game so I'll ask another question. How much does it take you to go watch a movie?\n\nBecause this is pretty much what it is. It's roughly more or less 1 hour and 40 minutes for the first playthrough as you explore the game and about an hour for the 2nd to reach the 2nd ending.

Hellishly short. And it saddens me, because I feel like there could have been so much more dangers happening and more bonding between the Lynx cub and her new found friend, the Bear cub.\nDespite it being claimed as a puzzle-platformer, there was not very much of either. You do jump a lot and there are some areas that are freakishly well hidden, but it all sums up to not really being in that genre in the long run. If I had to put it anywhere, it's a lot like an explorable storybook, which would be okay if it was longer.\n\nAll in All: I am a hardcore (as hardcore as it gets) fan of Shelter 2. But even I can not really recommend this game entirely. It's beautiful, it's stunning and has a lot of exploration to offer, but it falls short on its length and on the platforming, as well as the connection between Lynx and Bear.

A fact echoed by a vocal majority of our fans and supporters, who had made it clear they really wanted the chance to assume control of one of the younglings in a Shelter game. They told us what they wanted, we listened and et voila.\n\n[b]GameReviewsAU:[/b]\nThe Shelter series is very much focused on motherhood. Is there a particular reason for you shining the spotlight on mothers?\n\n[b]Might & Delight:[/b]\nThe theme is largely underrepresented in games. Not just motherhood, but parenthood as a whole and the wave of emotions that comes with the responsibility of taking care of young ones. Also, when trying to come up with the original Shelter concept, members of the team were either parents or making their first inroads into parenthood. That played a big part in the games theme.\n\n[b]GameReviewsAU:[/b]\nWhere did you initially get the inspiration for the patchwork graphics seen in each Shelter game?\n\n[b]Might & Delight:[/b]\nIt\u2019s easy to assume both Shelter 1 and Shelter 2 have the same visual style, but they are born from two separate sources of inspiration. The first games visual style was heavily inspired by Japanese Kamon, which is a form of emblems used to uniquely identify a family or person - not unlike a coat of arms. Whilst the second Shelter was inspired by Russian embroidery ornament patterns.\n\n[b]GameReviewsAU:[/b]\nWhy did you decide to release Paws as a standalone game rather than as DLC for Shelter 2?\n\n[b]Might & Delight:[/b]\nWe felt since the gameplay and story explored different themes to the Shelter series, it warranted a spin-off. If it proves popular we would be open to developing the Paws concept further.\n\n[b]GameReviewsAU:[/b]\nA lot of people seem to be interested in co-op being implemented in Paws. Do you have plans to make this a reality?\n\n[b]Might & Delight:[/b]\nWe try to listen to feedback from our fans and if there is genuine interest in another Shelter game or co-op then we would be silly to completely ignore it.\n\n[b]GameReviewsAU:[/b]\nSeeing as Shelter 2 has you playing as the mother lynx, and Paws has you controlling one of the babies, will you ever make a standalone game based on Shelter 1 where you play as a baby badger?\n\n[b]Might & Delight:[/b]\nNever say never.\n\n[b]GameReviewsAU:[/b]\nWhat can gamers expect to see from Might and Delight in the future?\n\n[b]Might & Delight:[/b]\nWe also released what we call a living book along with Paws called The Lonesome Fog. It\u2019s an opportunity to explore other ways of conveying narrative we\u2019re excited about.

All 3 games have similar visual and musical styles, but each is mechanically pretty different. Shelter was a very linear narrative with survival gameplay. Shelter 2 is an open exploration game. Paws is more similar to the first Shelter, but with hidden collectables to seek out. Thematically they're all about family and motherhood, but this one is also the most different from the others.

These days it is all about guns. But this game tells a magnificent story of friendship. Also family. This by far is one of the best games I have played. I might get the DLC soon, but for now, I`ll stick with the main game. Might and Delight; You are amazing, in every way possible.\n\n     Here is a quick summary of the game: (spoilers)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     So you start out as a baby lynx, the story starts when your mom just gave birth to you. It is like the shelter 2 opening, but in first person in baby Inna's eyes. After a day or two (I think?) you, your siblings and your mom go outside to hunt. After you are done hunting you go back into the den. At night you and your mom go to a star  Once your are done looking at it, you go back to the den. Next morning, it seems that you are moving out. sadly you get stuck in the lake and you are tooken miles away from your family.\n\n     You explore a creepy forest (rainforest?) and you have to smell your mom's foot steps. Then you meet some swans, but not in the best way. they throw you around if you get too close. Once you get passed them you go up the mountain(I don't belive it was a mountain, actually). At the top of this mountain(or ledge) you find a bear, ineed of food. before you saw the bear, wasn't there berries before you saw him? go get them! or if you are feeling evil you can feed him a bird.  Feed him three of the berries.\n\n      Once you have him following you, you go on an adventure with him. you'll bump into a misty area. There is a small hole only you can fit into. try to find a way in for the bear. which means leave him behind for now. Once you find a wayy in- wait, there is a fox after you! run! Bam. You got caught. But the bear rushes in and kills the fox. he brings you to a safe place, and gives you a fish to eat.\n\n     Now you are awake. Finally. You keep on going on your adventure. Wait- your bear ran away somewhere. Follow him. What is he looking at? Is that another bear? No... to small. It is your mom! But that means you have to leave your friend behind. Once you get back to your mom, keep on meowing, you can still hear him, but now you can't. The en- wait! You wake up in the middle of the night, go to the star, and you can see him. You can even meow, he roars back happily.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit: I did leave out a alot of things, and also I found out that you can escape the fox.\n\nEdit 2: Also, sorry if I made a few spelling mistakes, I just type fast, I guess.

It has a more concrete story and levels like in Shelter 1, but follows a familiar Lynx cub from Shelter 2.

On the bright side, there is no chance of getting lost.

A huge Rollercoaster of emotions with all good and sad emotions in it. As always a beautiful artstyle and a very atmospheric soundtrack.\n\nHowever, as much as I love the game and the Shelter Games in generell, this one left me a bit dissappointed. I knew the game was going to be short, but being able to complete it in an hour was a bit too short. I could barely get into the experience, get known to my companion, as the adventure was already over again. I was basically just getting really into it, when it ended. I wished they would have made it just a tiny bit longer. \n\nIf you are thinking about getting this game, don't do the same mistake that I did. Explore every Corner of the game and take as much time as you can for every part. I am going to complete the games another couple times, get really into it, collect all the rewards, so complete it carefully, because nonthenless, it's a stunning experient! Don't rush the game!\n\nThat said there is not much else I could say about it. The plattformer part in this game works smooth and fits within the entire game, everything is simple and easily understood. \n\nIt's overall just Beautiful, short and emotional.

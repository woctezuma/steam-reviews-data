I came close to not reccomending this game, but I cant do that. This game is not bad, its just not good either. Its the most mediocre game I have played. For only 3 dollars you get  uninspired level design, very weak gameplay mechanics, and only a total of 24 levels, 8 of those being only \"kind of\" levles. \n\nNothing about this game was memorable. The music lasts only 40 seconds or so before a very obvious loop. Levels are easily forgettable, sometimes only lasting 30 seconds. If theres only going to be 16 real levels in the game, you would hope that these levels would be fleshed out and intersting, but no, instead you get super small levels with very shallow gameplay mechanics that rarly get more in depth then just run and jump. The game is just disappointing overall.\n\nThis review may come off as very negative, and its not because I disliked the game, but because I see so much potential that wasnt realized in this game. For 3 dollars it can be a fun distraction for a little bit, but dont expect anything all too great here.

remix con meno livelli, presi da quelli della modalit\u00e0 base e leggermente rivisti.\nIn pratica nel gioco siete un omino che deve raggiungere la fine del livello solo saltando e correndo, evitando gli ostacoli che si incontrano lungo il percorso: gocce di acido che cadono dal soffitto, spuntoni, pozzanghere mortali, proiettili, piattaforme che si muovono sull'abisso ecc...\nSi usano due soli tasti: quello del salto ed un altro che permette di sistemare il check point in modo dinamico mentre si prosegue nel livello (utile perch\u00e8 ad ogni morte si riparte da quest'ultimo.

It's a very basic platformer with minimal aesthetics, but rather than building off of that it's more of just no aesthetic. And the one gimmick it does have, setting check points, it's more of a crutch to aid it's dull/tedious level design. \n\nIt's not even that difficult, but for something so simple it makes a few dumb mistakes. A couple of leaps of faith, having a pit right at the start of a stage (when you're already holding right from the previous one), stages where elements are just barely off screen, the fact that white is used to both denote objects that kill you instantly AND ones that are bouncey. It's things that would be more frustrating if the game wasn't so bland that it dulled all emotion.\n\nI want to say that sometimes the levels do feel like they might have something going for them, they employ enough different obstacles/animated visuals that I feel like someone could use some environmental storytelling here if they wanted (it doesn't). Speaking of, not having any map or sense of progression really makes every thing blend together more, and by the time I reach the last stage I was more just \"oh, that's it?\"\n\nThe one real good thing is that some of the tracks sound nice. They aren't out of place I guess, but it's hard not to be fitting when nothing is really going on.\n\nI feel bad for coming off so negative, but this is so basic and minimal, and it doesn't even do that perfectly well. tl;dr this is the tofu to VVVVV's meat, lacking in any and all taste and probably not that filling.

Begging for the day to die, or you could buy a cheap game you dramatic spazz.\n\nIn this pool of games within another smaller pool of games theres 'LOVE' although I don't know how the title fits the game. Probably a self aware joke when you attempt yolo mode where you will love the game [spoiler] after installing the one game on a crappy computer, put it in a field and work for enough money to hire an orbital missle strike [/spoiler]. I wanted something good for a normal afternoon on a 5am while trying to postpone my sleep deprivation and to stop the voices in my head saying that I have a problem, so I blissfuly ignore them to continue my rampaging nihilistic ways. \n\n[u]gameplay[/u]\nYou just move, jump and get your way over to the end of the level, avoiding the hazards with what looks like a thing with maths for a head. So what do you want me to say, but lets not get too deep into this review like a poorly implimented sex joke. The level design is not too bad, and it's even better that its properly designed for the controls, albeit sonic 06 ('shruders').\n\nthe game does have a 'make your own checkpoint' which is 'so original'. [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMef2ELINDw]and definetly not made by anyone else[/url] but in summary, the gameplay is adequete and more importantly 'FUN' to play, its nothing new and it knows that so it brings somthing more interesting to gouge your eyes out in a way you like, you creep.\n\n[u]atmosphere[/u]\nThe games artstye looks like a 40 year old dos user playing mario world on acid. Its actually looks kinda pretty with its basic artstyle and its limited use of pixel art, without using it for the obviouse lazynes. Some of the levels are made to look like a portrait like the part where you go through the bowels of a deformed monster.\n\nThe level design always brings something new that differentiates itself. Even the hazards and platforms act differently to help violently stuff the tiny bag of simple controls and gameplay. So the level design is as pretty as its controls well in platforming. Theres even different kinds of music for each platform section you will force the small thing to run through for your sadistic pleasures. Nothing to make you sing until you bash your head against a wall to stop the awesomeness, but nice all together.\n\n[u]conclusion[/u]\nThe level design and gameplay is good as it needs to be to grab our attention 180 degrees in a violent neck snap. the price is a little steep so you should probably buy it on a 50% sale to starve of your crippling depression for games. \n\nI have seen better gameplay with simple controls as well and it's called [url=http://www.bornegames.com/games/fpa-world-1/remix/]'fancy pants'[/url]. I'll sum the game up in fifteen words 'it's a free platformer and moving in this game is as good as an orgasim'. Im not saying its a bad game, you should definetly get it on sale if your into platformers.

El personaje recuerda a un mu\u00f1eco de palotes. Los caminos y obst\u00e1culos son minimalistas. Si bien, el ladrillo de este apartado visual es el pixel, pocos colores y poco realismo, nos encontramos ante un aspecto visual de una belleza innegable. Usando pocos elementos presenciamos un mundo completo capaz de evocar distintas emociones.\nEn algunos niveles se muestran lugares muy precisos, por ejemplo en el nivel 5 se dibuja una f\u00e1brica abandonada y en el nivel 11 se introduce lo que parece un gran animal. En su mayor\u00eda los niveles son caminos abstractos de representaci\u00f3n simple pero contundente. La magia de las gr\u00e1ficas en Love es que con pocos colores y formas precisas se construyen recorridos con personalidad.\n\n[b] M\u00fasica:  [/b] \n\nEste mundo no estar\u00eda completo sin la m\u00fasica que se ha seleccionado para ambientar cada nivel pues este es uno de los aspectos donde es m\u00e1s contundente la mezcla retro-nuevo. Las melod\u00edas y sus instrumentos refuerzan la construcci\u00f3n de cada uno de estos espacios, llevan a sentir en el jugador incertidumbre, misterio, melancol\u00eda o perplejidad. Son canciones vertiginosas, lentas, r\u00edtmicas o cadentes capaces de proporcionar no solo fuerza a cada espacio sino variedad y frescura.\n\n[b] Mec\u00e1nicas y Contenido: [/b] \n\nUno de los aspectos m\u00e1s interesantes del juego son las mec\u00e1nicas que propone. Aunque es un juego de plataformas en toda usanza. Est\u00e1 condimentada con elementos que hacen que el juego sea m\u00e1s flexible y divertido en comparaci\u00f3n con cl\u00e1sicos del g\u00e9nero.\nEl contenido principal del juego son 16 niveles. Los diferentes modos hacen que el juego sea amigable para jugadores novatos; y retador para aquellos que gusten de una dificultad alta.\nModo Arcade tenemos las reglas b\u00e1sicas: jugar por los 16 niveles con 100 vidas. Modo F\u00e1cil podemos hacer el recorrido con una cantidad ilimitada de vidas. \u201cYolo Mode\u201d, que podr\u00eda considerarse el ultra dif\u00edcil, solo con una vida. \u201cRunner\u201d en el cual el reto ser\u00e1  lograr el menor tiempo posible y por \u00faltimo el \u201cMix\u201d donde nos encontramos con 8 pantallas nuevas en donde se usan los mismos elementos usados previamente m\u00e1s unos pocos aspectos nuevos.\nLa mec\u00e1nica que hace a este recorrido flexible y fresco es la forma en c\u00f3mo se pueden establecer los \u201cpuntos de chequeo\u201d (checkpoint). A diferencia de la mayor\u00eda de los juegos de plataformas cl\u00e1sicos en donde nos encontramos en un punto de chequeo a mitad de cada nivel, en Love es posible establecer un punto de chequeo en casi cualquier parte del juego. Cada vez que mueres revives en el punto que has elegido y no est\u00e1s obligado a empezar desde el principio del nivel, aunque en el modo \u201cYolo\u201d no es posible usar los puntos de chequeo pues ac\u00e1 estamos \u201csolos contra el mundo\u201d esta opci\u00f3n est\u00e1 disponible en todos los dem\u00e1s modos.  \nEsta posibilidad est\u00e1 matizada por otro aspecto del juego, una \u201ccalificaci\u00f3n\u201d que medir\u00e1 tu desempe\u00f1o tomando diferentes variables: tiempo, n\u00famero de vidas, o puntos de chequeo usados. Un consejo \u00fatil para obtener m\u00e1s puntos: entre menos uses puntos de chequeo, m\u00e1s puntaje recibir\u00e1s.\nLa mec\u00e1nica antes nombrada tambi\u00e9n ve complementada por la opci\u00f3n de suicidarse para volver al punto de chequeo. Aunque parece extra\u00f1o, la cuesti\u00f3n es que en ocasiones uno puede caer y retroceder en el recorrido, se puede elegir morir y volver al punto de chequeo de manera instant\u00e1nea en lugar de repetir lo ya recorrido, se sacrifica una vida para ahorrar tiempo o evadir la tarea de volver a hacer lo ya hecho. Como cuando sacrificas tus brazos para llevar todas las bolsas en un solo viaje al regresar del supermercado.\n\n[b] Consideraciones Finales: [/b] \n\nPor \u00faltimo es importante resaltar el hecho de que el juego est\u00e1 lleno de peque\u00f1os detalles que suman en toda su experiencia. Cuando el personaje muere la animaci\u00f3n de la muerte y el sonido cambian, por ejemplo puede ser una explosi\u00f3n, o el dibujo de un \u201c\u00e1ngel que se desvanece\u201d.

I bought the game because I heard a great song in the trailer. I now have the song in an online playlist of music. I don't have the game anymore. \n\nThe game is locked at 30 fps and it honestly makes me sick during some sections. VVVVVV did fine since the screen never scrolls and the only thing that moves is the character, but the whole screen moves in LOVE and it looks and feels terrible.\n\nAlso, the reason I bought the game was mainly to listen to music like the one in the trailer. Turns out the rest of the music is nothing like the one in the trailer. Every time you beat a level, the music abruptly stops and switches to another song instead of fading into the next one. \n\nOne irksome thing that this game makes you do is set your own checkpoints. In VVVVVV there were checkpoints everywhere. Every time you did a jump or challenge, there was a checkpoint standing there waiting for you to save your progress. In this game, you \"get\" to set it yourself. This could make the game easier in some cases. However, it was mainly a bother to me. At some points I'd make tremendous progress throughout the level. Then I'd die, feel a slow sinking in my stomach as I remember that I hadn't saved my progress at all and am promptly respawned at my last checkpoint way, way back in the level. Leaving the checkpoints to be set by the player and not designing them around the levels seems like lazy development to me.\n\nIt wouldn't be a huge problem if you could set the checkpoints [i]in addition to[/i] the checkpoints that are already there, but it's a mechanic that just sucks.\n\nI had to refund the game because the reasons above made the game incredibly unenjoyable for me. I played it and beat it twice as well as playing all the extra levels in search of the fun I so wanted to have in the game, but I just couldn't enjoy it because the music was bad, the fps was too low, the checkpoint system was a pain. Controlling the character also felt less responsive than VVVVVV, but that could be a combination of the 30 fps and the whole screen moving at the same time.\n\nI don't recommend buying this game, but you should definitely check out the song from the trailer. https://youtu.be/_kh42huPe78", "timestamp_created": 1471317353, "timestamp_updated": 1471317404, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479053", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24900727": {"recommendationid": "24900727", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049362156", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471137321}, "language": "english", "review": "The biggest flaw I hit in this game: it's possible to make the game unwinnable by placing a respawn point on one of the moving platforms on that \"snow\" level such that the vehicle then respawns in its default position and the respawn point is left floating in mid-air, and you are repeatedly dropped in the instant-kill snow.

It's an amazing time killer and + it's not overall expensive and I'd say buy it if it goes on sale. Also gamepad support is for this game.\n\nPros -\n\nGood 8-bit Graphics.\n\nIncredible Soundtrack.\n\nHas several modes to choose.\n\nControls aren't hard.\n\nGood stage design.\n\nGamepad/Console Controller can also be used\n\nCons -\n\nNot really any. But this is just me failing but the only thing that I hated was me dieing over and over again, but that was just my experience, as I am not that overall the best at platformer games.\n\n\nAnyways try it out if you like platformers, 8-bit games, or just want a time killer game for a cheap price or so.", "timestamp_created": 1465995862, "timestamp_updated": 1465995862, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23554635": {"recommendationid": "23554635", "author": {"steamid": "76561198294658269", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 73, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515349733}, "language": "english", "review": "BEST", "timestamp_created": 1465922284, "timestamp_updated": 1465922284, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23533927": {"recommendationid": "23533927", "author": {"steamid": "76561198255499356", "num_games_owned": 299, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487589007}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u96c5\u8fbe\u5229\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684\u590d\u53e4\u753b\u9762\uff0c\n\u5728\u96be\u5ea6\u548c\u6e38\u620f\u6027\u4e0a\u6beb\u4e0d\u542b\u7cca\n8bit\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u97f3\u4e50\u4e5f\u5f88\u5e26\u611f\n\n\u7528\u4e00\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u8ba9\u4f60\u660e\u767dS/L\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1465810137, "timestamp_updated": 1465810137, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23508832": {"recommendationid": "23508832", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062001132", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 64, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465679003}, "language": "english", "review": "Okay, first off I very much enjoyed this game.

Thank you.\n\nHowever, there isn't a whole lot to recommend beyond the save-anywhere feature. You run and jump. You avoid obstacles in well-designed levels. And that's it. Granted, there are changes to gameplay and obstacles but they're so short that you don't get a feeling of actually mastering them, like in Mario or Metroid.\n\nThat and the fact that the game has 16 levels (well, technically a lot more with the remix mode), despite the changes in speedrun mode and hard mode... there isn't much to LOVE to really find anything special in. Similar to \"You Have to Win the Game\", LOVE does has smooth controls, a nice graphical aesthetic, and a great difficulty and save feature, but it's so samey and safe that it's just not something you'll want to go back and play in a while. Or at least I don't.\n\nIf you like a fun 2D Platformer, LOVE certainly is that. But beyond the simple mechanics, it's not a particularly memorable experience.

Tight controls (I can only blame mistakes on myself or having a hard time with an analogue controller sometimes).

The concept is fine, but it's very flawed when it comes to it's execution.\n\nThe look of the game follows this simple aesthetic, and looks a bit like something that would have come out on the Intellivision. However, they don't take the aesthetic far enough so the graphics manage to look more boring and cheaply made instead of retro.\n\nThe soundtrack is good, and is likely the best part of the game. However, it's not super mindblowing or anything, just well done.\n\nThe part where this game really breaks apart for me is in the level design and the controls. The levels are all really simply designed, with the paths you take through them being really basic without much of anything interesting going on, sometimes simply having them be an excuse to shove some poorly drawn pixel art in your face. All of the levels essentially feel very uninspired.\nThe controls are really imprecise and don't feel as tight and resonsive as something like a Super Meat Boy or even a VVVVVV. Your jump doesn't really have any weight to it, either. Your character doesn't feel weighty or floaty, there's essentially just no inertia to any of the movement. It just feels like it's moving your character up as you hold the jump button and immediately moving them down as you let go. The controls just feel [b]BAD[/b] and are probably the worst part of the game.\n\nOverall, it's a simple game, and while it's inexpensive, it's also not a great experience.

There definitely aren't enough levels to keep me coming back for too long.\n\nWell, for all that I have to gripe about it, it's still only $3, and I bought it at $1 in a sale, so frankly for the price tag there's very little to complain about.

All of which are short, but moderately challenging. There are a lot of indie platformers out there that are ridiculously hard. This one offers a challenge, but doesn't feel impossible to beat. Unless of course, you're playing on YOLO mode. That really does feel impossible at times. As I said, the game is short. There's even an achievement for completing the speedrun in under 12 minutes. That should give you an idea of the length of this game. Still, it took me a little over 5 hours to get 18/19 achievements. It's also worth noting that the soundtrack is fantastic.\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\nIf you're a fan of platformers, I'd definitely recommend this. It's a short game, but it's well worth the price it's listed. If you're looking for a story, this doesn't have one.

Good music, nice retro graphics, few gamemodes (including some challenging ones for hardcore gamers)... Sounds like a great game. Unfortunately two things hinder the gameplay for me to the point where I'm really not interested in playing anymore.\n\n1) jumping control - there's no momentum attached to your jumps. The moment you stop pressing your dpad, character just stops dead in it's tracks. Even Mario for NES had this momentum feature implemented. You know why?

Actually kind of enjoy the aesthetic of it, as its cute watching the guy run. The platforming is definitely tough. The jump could be better, as it falls into the camp of unresponsive, when you run off a platform and jump you just fall straight down. Also gravity seems a little too strong and unrealistic, as when you jump to something you go back down super fast, making you miss jumps because you should go further. All of the levels are quite varied and interesting, with different mechanics. Unfortunately the game is super short, like 20-30 min, and I found myself wanting more. The ability to set custom checkpoints is a fun inventive new mechanic, although one 1 level it was actually gamebreaking, and because there is no saving progress, I had to restart from the beginning, so points against it for that. I played on the mode with infinite lives, because I wanted to enjoy the game. You can play arcade mode, with a set lives, and if you die you have to redo it all. I think that is how it is intended to be played but since the game is tough and you die all the time, I don't want to be punished and have to replay levels I beat because the developer is artificially inflating game length because the game is short. If you make a good platformer, I don't need lives, because I should start the level or part over, and if parts are tough I just replay them, not start a new game. Even though some idiots like replaying old levels they beat all over again, I am not one of them, so I reccomend playing with infinite lives, you'll thank me later.

Love infatti mi aveva da un po' di tempo incuriosito per lo stile grafico minimalista (ma \u00e8 dir poco) e per l'atmosfera trasognata che il trailer trasmetteva. In questo senso va detto subito che mi sono trovato abbastanza sorpreso avanzando per i 16 livelli dell'avventura principale: Love infatti \u00e8 s\u00ec spesso sognatore e \"leggero\", ma il pi\u00f9 delle volte risulta crudo e brutale. Con ordine. Love \u00e8 un gioco di piattaforme basato sul principio del \"prova e ripeti\": addirittura ci sar\u00e0 concesso di fissare in qualsiasi parte del livello i checkpoint, e anche se l'impressione generale del gioco \u00e8 quella di un prodotto destinato a un nocciolo di giocatori \"duri\", il livello di difficolt\u00e0 finale \u00e8 abbastanza clemente. Le 100 vite che vi saranno fornite saranno presto abbondantemente sufficienti per arrivare alla fine (per me 3 mandate sono state bastevoli): a quel punto Love cerca di crearsi i suoi affezionati con una modalit\u00e0 speedrun con classifiche online e una snervante modalit\u00e0 \"Yolo\", che concede solo una vita per arrivare fino in fondo. In che senso dunque la brutalit\u00e0? La particolarit\u00e0 di Love \u00e8, neanche a dirlo, il concept di fondo insito nel nome stesso. Il vero motivo trainante per cui mi sono trovato incollato al gioco nel tentativo di completarlo \u00e8 la curiosit\u00e0 di vedere i vari modi in cui l'autore ha svolto la sua metafora visiva sull'amore. Ed \u00e8 qui che la natura del gioco acquista tutto un nuovo spessore: l'amore \u00e8 innanzitutto un \"prova e ripeti\". Interessante \u00e8 notare che il primo livello \u00e8 uno dei pochi a finire in un'incerta ascesa. Per il resto del gioco l'amore sar\u00e0 sempre rappresentato come una caduta, che anche quando prende le sembianze di una discesa levitata sar\u00e0 sempre minacciata da inquietanti chiodi. Altre ambientazioni sono ancora pi\u00f9 esplicite nella drammaticit\u00e0 della rappresentazione: una segheria piena di pericoli alla fine della quale si trover\u00e0 un albero troncato con un segno d'amore inciso sopra; uno scheletro di qualche mostro all'imboccatura del quale spuntano inquietanti denti (non voglio essere l'unico a aver fatto qui l'equazione: nel livello remix c'\u00e8 una rappresentazione pi\u00f9 esplicita); una fabbrica piena di rifiuti tossici con tanto di cartello che avverte della possibilit\u00e0 di contagio; una serie di porte aperte che il pi\u00f9 delle volte conducono alla disfatta... e cos\u00ec via, solo per menzionare le immagini pi\u00f9 potenti e univocamente interpretabili. Per il resto sono sicuro che ognuno trover\u00e0 dei riferimenti personali nella simbologia di Love: il risultato finale \u00e8 cos\u00ec d'impatto che le lodi allo sviluppatore non potrebbero essere abbastanza. Grande delusione \u00e8 stato invece il comparto sonoro. Il theme del trailer \u00e8 stato scelto per quella funzione non a caso: rimane il brano pi\u00f9 ispirato e \"intonato\" di tutto il gioco. Per il resto non ci sono tracce che riescono a rendere abbastanza il senso di inquietudine che ho sopra cercato di descrivere: inoltre tutta la colonna sonora \u00e8 impostata per ciclarsi in loop che si interrompono e ripartono con una fastidiosa soluzione di continuit\u00e0. Ho accennato ai livelli remix: lo sviluppatore \u00e8 ancora intento alla creazione di contenuti gratuiti per questo titolo, e non \u00e8 escluso che in futuro agli otto gi\u00e0 presenti non se ne aggiungano altri (per adesso sono tutti abbastanza \"fuori metafora\", tranne l'eccezione gi\u00e0 citata). In conclusione, anche considerata l'estrema brevit\u00e0 per i non fanatici delle classifiche, Love \u00e8 un titolo che riesce a \"lasciare qualcosa\": sar\u00f2 felice di riscaricare questa preziosa manciata di mega se in futuro usciranno nuovi contenuti.\n----\nEdit 3/4/16\nAggiunto un livello extra ispirato esplicitamente al nostro idraulico preferito, assolutamente innecessario nel suo livello di sfida praticamente nullo e per essere ancor pi\u00f9 lontano dal concept originale del titolo.", "timestamp_created": 1425081335, "timestamp_updated": 1459716853, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14678963": {"recommendationid": "14678963", "author": {"steamid": "76561198172459118", "num_games_owned": 966, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 163, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1427861678}, "language": "english", "review": "I LOVE this one.

A pesar de que parece ser un n\u00famero importante, morir en Love es m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil de lo que parece, y aun peor cuando nos topamos con situaciones desprevenidas.\n\nHabr\u00e1 otros modos d\u00f3nde por ejemplo nos sacan la limitaci\u00f3n de vidas (Modo F\u00e1cil) para practicar un poco, el Speedrun (vidas infinitas) para realizar el mejor tiempo posible y el Modo YOLO aka \u201cS\u00f3lo Vives Una Vez\u201d, donde es autoexplicativo siendo uno de esos desaf\u00edos que podr\u00edan completarse para los AGDQ.\n\nDesde el apartado gr\u00e1fico, muy poco se puede decir ya que parece m\u00e1s a un juego de la segunda generaci\u00f3n de consolas aunque lo compensa con una jugabilidad s\u00f3lida cuyo resultado es optimo para hacer saltos casi milimetrados pero en ocasiones los inputs (sobre todo cuando jugamos con un gamepad) tienen que ser muy delicados, por lo que hay que tener cuidados especiales en ese asunto.\n\nFuera de ello es un entretenido plataformero s\u00e1dico (poco) para pasar el rato o perfeccionar todos sus niveles... cosa que... bueno, no soy muy bueno.\n \n\n[b]7/10[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1422062205, "timestamp_updated": 1422062205, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562044", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14125135": {"recommendationid": "14125135", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130652449", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 345, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512707022}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u68d2\u4eba\u9593\u3092\u64cd\u3063\u3066\u30b4\u30fc\u30eb\u307e\u3067\u5c0e\u304f\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u3059\u3002\n\u5024\u6bb5\u76f8\u5fdc\u306e\u30dc\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u306f\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u304c\u3001\u305d\u308c\u306a\u308a\u306b\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9\u3082\u7528\u610f\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u3066\u306a\u304b\u306a\u304b\u697d\u3057\u3081\u307e\u3059\u3002\nBGM\u3082\u3068\u3066\u3082\u826f\u304f\u30af\u30bb\u306b\u306a\u308b\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u3059\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1422016607, "timestamp_updated": 1422016607, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14115680": {"recommendationid": "14115680", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996457595", "num_games_owned": 3150, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1422828740}, "language": "english", "review": "Love is a jump and run platformer at it's simplest.\nYour objective is to maneuver through 12 levels with various hazards as quickly, and with as few lives as possible.\n\nThe levels are well planned, challenging but not too stressful.\nThe music is rather catchy and the controls are pretty solid (I'm using a 360 controller for this game).\n\nBut be aware.

Baby don't hurt me. Love is a simple, 2D platformer full of spikes and trampolines. You'll have 100 lives to make it through 12 'levels' of Love (easy mode has unlimited lives). When you die, you'll instantly respawn at the last checkpoint. The twist to this Love is that you'll make your own checkpoints on solid surfaces. The only controls are simple: left, right, jump and set a respawn. Its simple, but difficult all at the same time. When moving the screen left or right, I felt like the framerate would drop. Even on my 3.4 gHz Dual Core would drop from time to time, causing inaccuracies and death.\n\nWhen you go into a game, are you looking for a challenge? Are you a 'speedrunner' that wants to shave seconds off your play time? Then Love might just be the game for you! For the challenge, there is a lot of precision jumping off of moving trampolines. You'll also be landing between two spikes without dying and running between drops of acid. There are a few blind jumps, but you'll quickly remember them. A lot of the time the levels have many heights. So you can fall down to a lower area and either you'll have to climb back up or die to respawn at the last checkpoint if it was above you.\n\nThe downside to the game is that it is over within 15 minutes or so. It seems like Love is less than its contemporaries like VVVVV and You Have to Beat the Game. When you complete the game, it gives you a grade a time and a score. So for score runners and speed runners, there is a reason to replay and try one of the different difficulties. While the challenge of Love is still definitely there, its all just one clear cut path with only a few moments of deviation. There is no sense of exploration. Its all just clear cut. The level designs are a mixed bag. It goes from clean levels to areas that look like line art and spiked floor deathtraps. Some levels offer sloping paths, but there's no slide mechanic. Other levels detailed with circled indents and jagged spikes.\n\nLove will rarely switch up gameplay. There is a glimpse of a different play mechanic with a slow descent fall. But for the most part it is just moving trampoline platforms, shooting bullets in wave patterns and not much else. It feels like Love only offers spikes, bouncing and death pits. Once you are through the main game, the bonus levels offer much needed diversity to levels. Such as platforms the player can control, portals and giant static rings. So I see the developer is still trying to add more content. All the bonus levels play out pretty quickly.\n\nIt just seems like too quick of a game without enough diversity until the bonus levels.

This is fairly straightforward, and probably won't give you endless hours of gameplay unless you're a completionist, but I had an unsuccessful go at Standard difficulty, then played Easy (unlimited lives), then straight back to Standard, and am now eyeing up the achievements to see which are within my capability. It's a fun game, of about the perfect length for its price and gameplay style. It does have to be played in one sitting, but if even I can manage that in under half an hour (and I am not good at computer games) then that should be fine for most players, and it has that engagingly moreish level of frustration which keeps you playing without ever crossing the line into painful.\n\nAnother strength of the game is the way it introduces concepts and approaches to you, in particular the bouncing platforms, and then increases the difficulty over subsequent levels. It is also well ramped up difficulty-wise, so that while I can get through the first level without dying, the penultimate one will easily eat a quarter of my total lives.\n\nFor the hardcore there are other modes - both Speedrun and YOLO (which both kind of do what they say on the tin) - as well as scores at the end of the run to attempt to improve, and achievements corresponding to each of these; probably beyond what I personally will aim for due to sheer difficulty, but a good addition for those who want to get more playtime out of this game or just those masochists who like a bit more of a challenge.\n\nI can't comment on the music, as I haven't been able to have my volume on for unrelated reasons, but the art style also lends itself to the game with its simplicity and retro aesthetic.

But that'll only be judged by how high you set the difficulty, which you can expect what this game will throw at you.\n\nThe levels themselves, are fairly challenging in their own right. But what really makes this game challenging, is the timing and pixel-perfect jumping you'll have to perform to accomplish the task at hand. One little pixel off, you get spiked or you fall. That's the mechanics this game works under and you've got a 100 lives in which to complete the game under. That is, if you're under easy difficulty.\n\nGraphically, this game has lots of pixels, so you'd know what to expect.\n\nMusic, probably the only thing I've found pleasing about this game. Some nice chiptune tracks thrown in there with a few soothing ambience tunes in between. I liked it so much that I actually bought the sound track.\n\nNow as far as this game's concern is to you on whether it's worth it to be in your library. It's a take it or leave it decision, to be honest. It's got nothing else more to offer beyond the speed run challenges and seeing how many deaths you can avoid as you play through.

The platforming is easy, and very standard. This game brings *nothing* new to the genre. I just wish it weren't so flippin' similiar to VVVVVV (which is pure art). \n\nI also question the odd developement decision to make the suicide one button, and the respawn set two. Did anyone really need a suicide button? I never used it, but I certain reset my spawn every 10 feet which was made laborious by having to push two buttons instead of one. \n\nI also wonder if this game could benefit from not giving the player a set number of lives, but a set number of times they can reset their spawn.\n\nI would stay away from this one for all of the reasons above, plus its under an hour of gameplay from start to finish.", "timestamp_created": 1413402599, "timestamp_updated": 1413402599, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486842", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12501517": {"recommendationid": "12501517", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016437391", "num_games_owned": 235, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 111, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1430346452}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Love\" is a fine platformer with flashes of real greatness.\n\nMy biggest complaint is with the level design.

In particular, the level \"Belly of the Beast\" (pictured on one of the trading cards) is fantastic, and shows how rewarding platforming can be when exploring the level is its own reward.

O incluso intentando completar los logros que Steam ofrece con este juego.\nSin duda, totalmente recomendable.\n\n[ANALISIS TRAS LA \u00daLTIMA ACTUALIZACI\u00d3N]\nA ver, sobre esto habr\u00e1 diversas opiniones ya que el hecho de que incluyan mas niveles en el juego siempre es algo interesante y que suele llevar a mas y mas horas de entretenimiento, Sin embargo, en mi mas sincera opini\u00f3n, pienso que esto es demasiado. \nCuando juegas a LOVE te acabas acostumbrando a un nivel de dificultad alto, pero sin excederse (no estamos hablando de La Mulana ni nada por el estilo). Sin embargo, estos 4 nuevos niveles me parecen muy inadecuados no por su dificultad, (sin duda mayor al resto del juego) sin\u00f3 porque el cambio que se produce entre el nivel 12 y el 13 me parece demasiado atroz refiriendonos a la dificultad de los mismos, por lo tanto no puedo aceptar facilmente estos niveles. Igualmente, sigue siendo cuesti\u00f3n de jugar y jugar hasta dominarlos, pero igualmente mantengo mi opini\u00f3n.\nRespecto a los nuevos niveles del \"remix\" no tengo nada que decir ya que me han gustado mucho, Buena dificultad y bastante sorprendentes (aun siendo muchos de ellos muy parecidos a los del LOVE original)\nNOTA: Seg\u00fan pasa el tiempo obviamente te acostumbras pero el cambio brusco se nota.", "timestamp_created": 1407082827, "timestamp_updated": 1440679613, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.960396", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11517472": {"recommendationid": "11517472", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067154001", "num_games_owned": 232, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1419821642}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u82f1\u8a9e\u975e\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3067\u3059\u304c\u300c\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\u300d\u300c\u81ea\u6bba\u300d\u300c\u30ea\u30b9\u30dd\u30fc\u30f3\u5730\u70b9\u8a2d\u7f6e\u300d\n\u306e3\u30a2\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3055\u3048\u5206\u304b\u308c\u3070\u554f\u984c\u30ca\u30b7\u3067\u3059\u3002\n\n\n\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\u3067\u30de\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u9032\u3093\u3060\u308a\u8df3\u306d\u308b\u5e8a\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3066\u9032\u3093\u3060\u308a\u3068\u3044\u305f\u3063\u3066\u666e\u901a\u306e\u6a2a\u30b9\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u30a2\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u3059\u3002\n\n\u81ea\u5206\u3067\u597d\u304d\u306a\u5834\u6240\u306b\u30ea\u30b9\u30dd\u30fc\u30f3\u5730\u70b9\u3092\u8a2d\u7f6e\u51fa\u6765\u3066\u3001\u306a\u304a\u304b\u3064\u81ea\u6bba\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u304c\u3064\u3044\u3066\u3044\u308b\u306e\u3067\u5feb\u9069\u306b\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u51fa\u6765\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\uff08\u81ea\u6bba\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u306f\u4e0b\u306e\u5730\u5f62\u306b\u843d\u3061\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3063\u305f\u6642\u306a\u3069\u306b\u5927\u5909\u5b09\u3057\u3044\uff09\n\n\u5e8a\u306e\u72ed\u3055\u3001\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\u306e\u9ad8\u3055\u3001\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u5f53\u305f\u308a\u5224\u5b9a\u306a\u3069\u304c\u5224\u5b9a\u7d50\u69cb\u30b7\u30d3\u30a2\u306a\u306e\u3067\u7d50\u69cb\u6b7b\u306b\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\n\n\u30ea\u30b9\u30dd\u30fc\u30f3\u5730\u70b9\u304c\u81ea\u7531\u306b\u8a2d\u5b9a\u51fa\u6765\u308b\u3001\u9006\u623b\u308a\u306e\u6642\u306b\u81ea\u6bba\u51fa\u6765\u308b\u3001BGM\u3084\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u304c\u53ef\u611b\u3044\u3001\u30c8\u30ec\u30ab\u304c\u3042\u308b\n\u3053\u306e\u5024\u6bb5\u306a\u3089\u3044\u3044\u304b\u306a\u3063\u3066\u611f\u3058\n\n\n\u5168\u7136\u3069\u3046\u3067\u3082\u3044\u3044\u3051\u3069\u30ad\u30fc\u9593\u9055\u3048\u3066\u9023\u6253\u3057\u3066\u305f\u3089\u30ea\u30b9\u30dd\u30fc\u30f3\u5730\u70b9\u3092\u5909\u306a\u6240\u306b\u4f5c\u3063\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3044\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3059\u308b\u5ea6\u6b7b\u306c\u3068\u3044\u3046\u611f\u3058\u3067\u8a70\u307f\u307e\u3057\u305f\uff57", "timestamp_created": 1406966579, "timestamp_updated": 1406966579, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "4.940886", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11508237": {"recommendationid": "11508237", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102275691", "num_games_owned": 542, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 159, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1428865842}, "language": "italian", "review": "Love \u00e8 un videogame sviluppato e pubblicato da Fred Wood nel 2014 di genere avventura-indie.\nHo apprezzato tantissimo questo titolo per la sua semplicit\u00e0.\nCi sono quattro modalit\u00e0 di gioco:\n- Easy mode:completare tutti i livelli avendo vite infinite;\n- Standard mode:completare tutti i livelli avendo a disposizione 100 vite;\n- Yolo mode:completare tutti i livelli con una sola vita;\n- Speedrun mode: completare tutti i livelli,avendo vite infinite,nel minor tempo possibile.\nLa musica psichedelica \u00e8 molto bella,la grafica \u00e8 simile a quella dell' \"Atari2600\" e il gameplay \u00e8 molto semplice.\nDiverte tanto e costa poco.\n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1406909635, "timestamp_updated": 1406909635, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.616504", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11507460": {"recommendationid": "11507460", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993255188", "num_games_owned": 514, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1413600197}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is platforming at its most basic.

In the game theres no story you bassicly go through stages and thats it but is that bad ? Love is probably one of the best platformers on steam without a doubt. The game is kinda on the short side but thats not bad and this game is actually quite fun and i would suggest you to play through it at least once. Now for the good things. The game is pretty fun but at the same time challenging. The game has an amazing soundtrack which is great to hear once you jump throught the game. Graphics looks amazing for a pixel like game. Now for the bad. The game is incredibly short you can pretty much finish the game in half an hour. Some minor bugs like getting stuck in the enviroments. But thats pretty much it.

Aside from Easy Mode, each mode gives you something that makes you want to do better. You try to get through the game losing fewer and fewer lives, or seeing how far 1 life can get you, or how quickly you can beat the whole thing. I also liked how the game allows you to make your own checkpoints. There is no checkpoint to reach in the game, you can put one down in almost any place.

Calm, smooth and complimenting the 8bit art style.\n\nAlthough unnecessary, I'd still love the see the ability to rebind keys and steam workshop support for custom levels would really be the icing on the cake. As it stands, you can get bored of the initial 12 levels pretty quickly.\n\nIf you're looking to try a simple obstacle course platformer, not too difficult but certainly not easy, give it a try.

En mi caso me ha encantado. Me recuerda al VVVVVV pero un poco menos fren\u00e9tico. Uno de esos juegos que te ense\u00f1an que el apartado gr\u00e1fico no lo es todo y lo jugable puede hacer que un juego sea una tremenda basura o un gran titulo. En este caso, triunfa.\n\nSimple, r\u00e1pido y directo. Inicias, tienes 100 vidas y hasta donde llegues. Ya esta. A partir de ah\u00ed es mejorar, pasarte los niveles sin morir, sacar los logros, encontrar los secretos, hacer algunas haza\u00f1as complicadas y luego, si tienes valor, completar el juego con tan solo una vida (Misi\u00f3n imposible xD).\n\nEl aspecto gr\u00e1fico le queda genial, no esta sobrecargado y los niveles tiene cierto trasfondo, algunas partes son un poco confusas pero se disfruta.\nAdemas, el titulo tiene una m\u00fasica muy buena que le pega genial.\n Adictivo, en cuanto terminas de jugarlo ya sea por que se te agotan las 100 vidas o por que llegas al final quieres volver a intentarlo para sacar mejor puntuaci\u00f3n y logros.\n\nPor 3 euros lo comprar\u00eda sin dudar. Si lo ves por menos, es una compra casi obligada si te gustan este tipo de juegos.\n\nLo bueno:\n-Es un juego directo, sin intros que no pegan nada o tutoriales liosos.\n-Simple a la vez que complejo, puedes pasarte el juego a la segunda pero no podr\u00e1s conseguir pas\u00e1rtelo sin morir... nunca xD\n-La m\u00fasica le queda perfecta.\n-Rejugable.\n-Editor de niveles, en este tipo de juegos siempre es de agradecer.\n-Control con mando bastante pulido.\n-Aun que esta en ingles se entiende todo a la perfecci\u00f3n.\n\nLo malo:\n-La duraci\u00f3n, para variar. Si no te gusta sacar logros y eres de los que se pasa el juego una sola vez te va a durar, como mucho, mucho, una hora. Si por el contrario vas a sacarte todo, puede durar 2-3 horas como mucho.\n-Se echa un poco en falta algo de mas contenido. Pantallas oficiales o mas logros para extender la vida del juego.\n-La accesibilidad a las tablas de clasificaci\u00f3n y el editor de mapas, ambas cosas un poco escondidas.\n\nConclusi\u00f3n:\nSi no lo tuviese ya, por 3 euros me lo comprar\u00eda otra vez. Si te gustan juegos de plataformas y algo desafiantes (VVVVVV, Bloody Trapland etc..) este te gustara, es igual que los anteriores mencionados pero un poco mas relajado.\nPerfecto para echar una tarde muerta y volver a rejugarlo pasado un tiempo.", "timestamp_created": 1398112096, "timestamp_updated": 1398112096, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530642", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9892825": {"recommendationid": "9892825", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078324923", "num_games_owned": 708, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 51, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1398101862}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0443 \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043f\u043e \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0435 \"\u0421\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0438\" \u0412\u0441\u0435 !!! \u0411\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u0432\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442. \u041c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u044f \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u044e \u0432 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0445, \u043d\u043e \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0443\u0434\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0435, \u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0436\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0440\u043e\u0441***\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0443 ...", "timestamp_created": 1398099399, "timestamp_updated": 1398099543, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476323", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9892585": {"recommendationid": "9892585", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020125851", "num_games_owned": 9552, "num_reviews": 726, "playtime_forever": 93, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456782110}, "language": "english", "review": "+ Calming / Atmostpheric Music\n+ Nice Retro style graphics\n+ Custom checkpoits so you don't have to constantly redo parts when you die.\n\n- TOO SHORT (~10-30minutes to beat the game)\n- Lacking Story \n- Lacking Variety (No abilities, no real variation between levels, no puzzles)\n- Too Simplistic for a Buyable Game (doesn't look like much effort was put into making this...)\n- No Replayability (No collectables, secrets, or anything to make you want to play again)\n- No Theme (why is it called Love?

It certainly wouldn't hurt.\n\nIf you're a fan of challenging platformers like Super Meat Boy or VVVVVV, there's no excuse for not owning this, cause it'll be perfect for you.

The controls are very tight, and the manually placed respawn points are a neat mechanic that adds a bit of depth to the gameplay. Love's level design is very appealing and flows nicely, despite a couple of difficulty spikes here and there, and the retro theme is brilliantly complimented by the game's soundtrack.\n\nThe only real gripe I have is how a couple of levels require an ounce of memorization, leaving you with no way of knowing if you're leaping to your death if it's your first or second run. Other than that and the difficulty spikes I briefly mentioned earlier, it's hard for me to give Love any more serious criticism.\n\nFor $3, fans of platformers or challenging games in general will not be disappointed.", "timestamp_created": 1394677328, "timestamp_updated": 1394677770, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467980", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9440773": {"recommendationid": "9440773", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058884675", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486625935}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0437\u0432\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435, \u0432\u044b\u0431\u043e\u0440 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u043f\u043e \u0432\u043a\u0443\u0441\u0443, \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043a\u043e\u0435. \u041d\u043e \u0436\u0430\u043b\u044c \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u043d\u0435\u0439 \u0432\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435 \u043e\u0442\u0441\u0443\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u0435\u0442 ) :", "timestamp_created": 1394649990, "timestamp_updated": 1394649990, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9423568": {"recommendationid": "9423568", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057864018", "num_games_owned": 470, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471801689}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a good game.

This is intentional however as you aren't meant to playthrough the game once and be done with it, but return again and again to aim for higher scores, faster times, and a better ranking. This is the focus of Love and why the short levels work so well; it makes it extremely easy to jump back in for a quick run every now and then to better your time, without having to commit hours to what could potentially be no better than the last time you played. I'm not typically a fan of speedrunning, but I've already gone through Love four times and definitely see myself coming back for more.\n\nNone of this would matter though if it wasn't for how well constructed the different aspects of Love are. Each level is unique in both structure and visual design, and yet they fit together perfectly and compliment each other with their diverse layouts. Similarly the graphics are very basic, but there's a subtle elegance to the way the character moves; how the different environment colors contrast to outline traps and the path forward and how the excellent soundtrack perfectly matches the mood of them, from melancholy ambiance to hyperactive electronica. The controls are sharp, whether using a controller or keyboard (the latter of which I rarely will even attempt to use), and something about the way you move just \"feels right\".\n\nI'll come out and say I, ahem, Love [i]Love[/i]. It surprised me with its addictive and refined design, and has me eager to see what developer Fred Wood has planned for future updates. There is a ton of potential here for such a seemingly simple game and I have no doubt he is going to tap into it, already showing an admiral dedication to patching out bugs and adding in features that didn't make it right at launch. Love might not be a long game, or a very deep one, but it is certainly a very enjoyable little slice of platforming that is well worth the very low cost of admission.", "timestamp_created": 1393253212, "timestamp_updated": 1393253212, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.686500", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9230990": {"recommendationid": "9230990", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097079219", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478013302}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0435\u0440. \u041a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0435 (\u043d\u0435 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u043d \u0438 \u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0439) \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435. \u0412\u044b \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u0441\u043e \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u043e\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b.", "timestamp_created": 1393150043, "timestamp_updated": 1393150043, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9226901": {"recommendationid": "9226901", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037900375", "num_games_owned": 818, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442843931}, "language": "english", "review": "Fans of Quick-Play or Speedrun games and traditional Platformers shouldn't shy away from this game. Sure, it looks like it belongs to the Pre-Commodre 64 era (Pre-8 bit for you youngins), but that doesn't hurt it one bit; the dangers and other elements are painfully clear due to the simple contrasts of the restricted colour scheme and well, if you need your 2D platformers to be pretty all the time then you should turn away now.\n\nLove, by Fred Wood & Co., is built to challenge your classic platforming co-ordination and that's mostly what the game consists of, careful timing and just enough foresight and momentum carries the day... or your avatar into death. Rather than use a checkpoint system at set flagged locations like many classics, Love differs in that you can set your respawn points to conserve progress, and even goes so far as to include a suicide option that allows you return to your respawn. It's not necessary but it's handy if you're too bothered to retrace your studious steps; this mode is unavailable in YOLO mode because well, YOLO, but becomes useful to cover mistakes during Speedrun mode.\n\nHowever, if you like your games longer, you should maybe look elsewhere; once you get better at this game, you'll only find yourself clocking it at faster times. If you take into account how long that might take you, well, then thats where this game really sells itself on replayability in the way that many old games with timers would, daring you not to die before it runs out...

At full price, it's still cheaper than most games even with a big discount. The reason for this is that the game is very small. If you've watched the trailer, you've pretty much seen the entire game.\n\nAs is the way with most platformers, you simply jump through each level and make your way to the end. You can place checkpoints whenever and wherever you wish, but each time you do so will drop your score significantly. The main appeal of the game is to try and get the highest score (and lowest time) possible, fitting Atari gameplay with the overall look.\n\nThe whole game can be completed in well under 10 minutes. I was personally able to finish it in 9 and there was plenty of room for improvement there too. If you are looking for a lot of content, you won't find it here. This game is specifically designed to appeal to speedrunners and platformer purists.\n\nThe graphics are extremely basic. Each level consists of a single colour, plus black and white. This highly pixelled look is not just for show, it is to help with the precision platforming element where the edges of platforms are absolute. This makes unfair deaths by missing platforms because you didn't quite land on the edge practically non-existent.\n\nThe audio is similarly basic. There are a few chiptune-type tracks playing on each level but none of them are particularly good. Sound effects are sparse, mainly because nothing happens. Dying and bouncing on \"bouncers\" are the only times you'll hear anything. The few existing sound effects fit the theme well enough.\n\nIt's hard to give a recommendation for this game because there is a limited audience for it. If you love platformer games and want a game to properly test your skills, this is the perfect game to do so. It throws enough variety in level design to keep you on your feet and encourages you to keep trying to get that perfect score.\n\nIf there were ever a graduation exam for platformer gamers, this would be it. A gauntlet of differently laid out levels that must be conquered in a single sitting, with a no-nonsense audio/visual theme and some simple, yet tight controls to boot.", "timestamp_created": 1392886170, "timestamp_updated": 1392886170, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 33, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.772274", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9186748": {"recommendationid": "9186748", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963247737", "num_games_owned": 556, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1392857241}, "language": "english", "review": "It's hard to recommend love.

Unlike the open-world levels of VVVVVV, Love's are completely \"Point A to Point B\" from one to the next. There's also a helpful respawn mechanic that allows you to manually place respawn points as you progress, making death less frustrating than in other similar titles. The game is fairly short although I consider that a positive (ideal for short bursts) and totally acceptable given the low pricepoint. Many people should have no problem finishing all 12 levels in under 30 minutes and more experienced players can finish in under 10.

W Love sterujemy bezimiennym bohaterem, kt\u00f3ry sk\u0142ada si\u0119 z kilku bia\u0142ych pikseli, generalnie jego wygl\u0105d doskonale wsp\u00f3\u0142gra ze stylem graficznym otoczenia. W grze brakuje fabu\u0142y i celu, ot mamy przed sob\u0105 dwana\u015bcie plansz, kt\u00f3re mo\u017cemy pokona\u0107 w jednym z czterech tryb\u00f3w: easy (brak limitu \u017cy\u0107), standard (limit \u017cy\u0107 wynosi 100), YOLO (jedno \u017cycie) oraz speedrun (w tym trybie liczba \u017cy\u0107 nie jest limitowana, a nasz wynik po uko\u0144czeniu wszystkich plansz mo\u017cemy przes\u0142a\u0107 i por\u00f3wna\u0107 z wynikami innych graczy w dost\u0119pnej tabeli wynik\u00f3w). Ruch bohatera jest idealn\u0105 kopi\u0105 tego, kt\u00f3ry zosta\u0142 zastosowany w leciwym Super Mario Bros. dzi\u0119ki czemu \u201eczucie\u201d skok\u00f3w jest idealnie wywa\u017cone. Ciekawym elementem wprowadzonym w Love jest system r\u0119cznego rozstawiania respawn\u00f3w. Gracz za pomoc\u0105 jednego guzika na padzie mo\u017ce \u201epostawi\u0107\u201d spawn point w dowolnym miejscu planszy. Moim zdaniem jest to ciekawe rozwi\u0105zanie i na pewno u\u0142atwia rozgrywk\u0119, niemniej jednak w trybie Speedrun ka\u017cdy jeden rozstawiony spawn point obni\u017ca wynik.  \n\nLove to kr\u00f3tka, ale bardzo intensywna platform\u00f3wka. Jedno podej\u015bcie mo\u017ce zaj\u0105\u0107 nam od 40 do 7 minut co czyni j\u0105 idealn\u0105 gr\u0105 dla mi\u0142o\u015bnik\u00f3w rywalizacji o najwy\u017cszy wynik. S\u0105dz\u0119 jednak, \u017ce ka\u017cdy fan platform\u00f3wek powinien jak najszybciej zagra\u0107 w Love, bo to naprawd\u0119 znakomita pozycja.\n", "timestamp_created": 1392229321, "timestamp_updated": 1392229321, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.641404", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9063219": {"recommendationid": "9063219", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122557037", "num_games_owned": 283, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 562, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515554334}, "language": "german", "review": "++ Sehr Sch\u00f6ne detaillierte Bit-Grafik mit guter Steuerung\n++ Motivierende Modi die verschiedene Spielerarten und F\u00e4higkeiten anspricht\n+ Tolle Eastereggs (Im Men\u00fc F,L,P Dr\u00fccken :)\n+ Interessante Bonus Maps\n+ sehr guter Preis\n\n+- Grafik manchmal extreme einfach gehalten\n\n- Beim Laufen reagiert die Sprungtaste manchmal nicht (Tastatur)\n- Score und Achievements leicht verbugt\n\n(Stand: 12.02.2014)", "timestamp_created": 1392207586, "timestamp_updated": 1392207586, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9059932": {"recommendationid": "9059932", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071378925", "num_games_owned": 176, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 212, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1392573272}, "language": "english", "review": "Spoilers!: Theres no Love if you know what I mean", "timestamp_created": 1392171194, "timestamp_updated": 1392171194, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.463768", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9059916": {"recommendationid": "9059916", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084958398", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 444, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460766790}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun retro indie game, full of action, a cool set your own checkpoint (spawn) point system and FUN!

Maybe there is a little replay value, and essentially it is a cheap game, but you might be better off with one of the other meatboy like games, or even meatboy itself.\n\nSaying that though it is early access and could be shaped, but they claim all of the content that will be there is there, so adding length and more difficult later stages to the game would not do anything to aswade this.  Maybe with some user created levels in steam workshop this could have more longevity, but the whole point of a challenge game like this is to beat it, and I've done that easily, Im not one of these 1 life run people, but I expect the normal mode to offer more challenge than this in a game of this style. \n\nThe game is also fairly linear so you have a single path through the game, whereas something like I wanna be the guy there are a number of other paths you can take as well as hidden secret items which extend longevity, things the developer can think of adding, and if these increase the game cost, I always say its better to make a good game that will be played over and over than a quick cheap one someone will play for 22 minutes and no more.\n\nSo at the current state, with 12 levels, which lets face it some of them weren't as difficult later as they perhaps should've been I cannot recommend this game unless its on sale and you fancy a cheap quick thrill.

You may notice that both are hardcore platformers!\n\nAnyway, Love is pretty difficult, but it has one redeeming feature - you can place respawn points along levels and whenever you die you restart from there. \n\nThe 12 levels can be completed in around 20-25 minutes on your first playthrough. But there's quite a bit of replay value here as you attempt to then complete the whole game in 100 deaths or less, and then complete it in under 10 minutes. Finally, there's the objective to complete it without dying, but I'm not sure if I wanna put myself through that torture!\n\nGraphics are just ok. Nothing to swoon over, but it does it job alright. I am personally not a fan of this visual style, but can live with it. Soundtrack is good. Some of the tracks are indeed memorable, but nothing ultimately out of this world.\n\nCurrently, there is an issue with the controls for me personally. Jumping while moving doesn't feel consistent.

Well, when two people have certain feelings towards each other, they...what, that isn't the topic either?...\n\n...oh, the GAME! Right...\n\nLove is excellent. Fun, hard and forgiving at the same time. A retro-graphics platformer. (retro being pixels. HARD pixels. The bottom soil of the old era.) A playthrough is shorter than the love-kind-relationship that your dog and your guinea pig used to have, but it sounds better and is more fun, and doesn't destroy your furniture.\n\nIt has several game modes, one being the easy (e.g. cheap and no one plays it anyway) mode that gives you unlimited lives (yay, games!) but also a smaller score upon completion. Normal gives you 100 lives and you will get the normal (duh) scoring, depending on how many lives you have, how many spawnpoints you have set (YES YOU CAN SET THEM YOURSELF OMGSLJDESFS) and how fast you were - tons of replay potential.\n\nFor the upcoming sadists, there is a YOLO Mode. Yes, it is called like that. Die once and it is over. Pure madness.\n\nAnd a speedrun mode, which arguably is the most fun mode because you can just get faster and faster and the game is visibly designed around improving your times and erasing mistakes and getting faster. Sonic would be proud, right before the spikes would bury themselves in his soft little fur. Just like your dogs teeth in your guinea pig.\n\nBut anyway, I am in love with love. It is a lovely loveable game. And you will love it too if you like tough as nails but fair platformers and highscores, and if you like to work on your mistakes.\n\nI am out.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1391877004, "timestamp_updated": 1391877004, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489433", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9018727": {"recommendationid": "9018727", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058608602", "num_games_owned": 167, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 78, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1406288121}, "language": "russian", "review": "39 \u0440\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0439, \u0431\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0440\u044e \u0435\u0449\u0451 \u0437\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0448\u044c.", "timestamp_created": 1391873019, "timestamp_updated": 1391873019, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9015521": {"recommendationid": "9015521", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090995941", "num_games_owned": 249, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 817, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1393165293}, "language": "english", "review": "While this game may hold a title that is very Cheesy.

There is a bit to say about this game. Many may be turned off by its simplistic graphics, but don't let this turn you away. \n\nWhile, yes, it is a simple game with even simpler controls. But, it's fun, and easy, to play, and with its gamemodes and gradescale it's a damn hard one to master. \n\nThe game itself; if you'd rather just get through it without worrying about losing all your lives or going as fast as you can, is rather forgiving. I mean, whenever you're standing still you can set your respawn point. This is helpful, but there still are areas where you cannot save, and you'll have to make long stretches and rely on your timing and wit to survive them. Sometimes they aren't so bad, and sometimes...yeesh.\n\nAlso, I like the fact that it's a PvE game. Rather than fighting off hordes of enemies that wish nothing more than to blow up your little, pixelated stick figure, it is instead spikes, pitfalls, projectiles, and a rather...mysterious, volatile white ooze. This helps hone a mindset that won't let you blame bad enemy AI because, well, there are no enemies! Instead, you must very, *very* carefully. One slip or miscalculation, and you will fall to your death--either by spikes or by pitfall.\n\nThe game will also appeal very greatly to the speedrunning community. With its own mode with a timer, you can try to run through the levels as fast as you can and upload a score. Also, those who like achievements, this game has a decent 19 for you to strive to collect.\n\nAnd the music.\n\nMan, don't even get me started on the music. It goes so well with the game, it's just fun to listen to the beat. The songs are incredibly basic, and short, but they go to compensate with the rather short levels, so it's not so bad. \n\nMy only *major* problem is that the game lacks a pause feature. I often try to leave an accidentally selected gamemode and I accidentally end up quitting the game, which can be a bit annoying. However, seeing how this game is in the \"Early Access\" category, and that it just came out today, I'm certain it will be put in soon.\n\nOverall, Love is a great game. It's not a particularly long game, and it's not very hard to beat, but when you try to head for the top or to gather all the achievments, then prepare to be in a world of hurt. I'm talking Mega-Contravania kind of hard, with an Atari 2600-esque look and a kickass soundtrack to boot.\n\nSo, in my opinion, yes, it's worth the $2-3 you pay for it.", "timestamp_created": 1391830745, "timestamp_updated": 1391830745, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.466795", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9012880": {"recommendationid": "9012880", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981047937", "num_games_owned": 5600, "num_reviews": 409, "playtime_forever": 125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1392498025}, "language": "english", "review": "Simple gimmick retro-platformer.

So now that that is out the way, allow me to review this game-\n\nStory: There is no story. You are just a guy going through levels. Why? Well... who knows?\n\nGameplay: You are given 4 modes to play in- Easy, Standard YOLO, and Speed Run (keep in mind, there are 12, short levels in this game). In easy mode, you have unlimited lives. In standard mode, you have 100 lives. In YOLO, you have 1 life. In Speed Run mode, you have unlimited lives again, and a timer that times you throughout the entire game, giving you your total time when you finish. There are not many buttons in this game at all. You move left and right (Arrow Keys), jump (A), and set respawn points, where you will respawn when you die (S). On the Xbox 360 controller, you move left and right (analogue stick or D-Pad), jump (A button), set respawn points (X or B Button), and intentionally lose 1 life to respawn at a respawn point (which I don't know how to do on the PC contols) (Y button). As you have probably guessed, respawn points are critical if you are in easy, standard, or speed run mode. If you make 1 respawn point, the previous one you made disappears, and when you die, you will respawn at your most recent respawn point. From what I've played, it seems there was never a point where I respawned in a place where I will always die (I think since most things that hurt you move, this will probably never happen to you). Also, you cannot make a respawn point anywhere other than the ground. Moving away from that topic, once you beat the game, you are given a letter grade (A-F, like in school), depending on how well you did based on your time, and other factors (+ and - are used in thje score too. For example: A++). It's a bummer that you can't change the PC controls (keep in mind, I'm playing this on the day it came out), and to be honest, the PC controls are bit off compared to the controller controls. Seriously, this game was meant to be played on a controller (you can't change the controls for the controller either, but they feel perfect so it's absolutely unnecesary). If you haven't already gotten the memo, this game is simple (including the controls, level design, just... everything), and that is what this game holds as it's charming factor. Also, each level is completely different from the last, but I think there could have been different colors used, as I do remember 2 blue levels, 2 yellow levels (really, what's with the repetition?).\n\nGraphics: Don't worry, you won't be needing a GTX Titan for this one. Simply put, if you have a modern, working computer, YOU CAN PLAY THIS GAME WITHOUT A PROBLEM. The graphics have a simplistic, retro, kind of look, and I love it. With so many games today that look so realistic, this is a good break. Honestly, I don't play video games to simulate a 'realistic' world I already live in. When I play a video game, I want an escape. I want a game that plays different, feels different, and just looks different. That's what I love about these Atari-esc graphics- it's just art to me. I feel like I'm really transported into another world in this game. You really do have to admire the blank, black bacgrounds, solid color obsacles, square pixel-like objects, a stick character with a funny looking head...\n\nMusic: Fantastic variety of tracks that are memorable. You have your techno, hip-hop and rap instrumentals, and many others relaxing and engrossing tunes that are just incredible. My favorite track is \"Kid.\" \n\nMemorable Aspects: I love the simple and amusing menu sequence. Who can froget the animation where the character has his arms behind him as he races forward. The death animations are very creative too.    \n\nOverall: The game has a charm that makes you remember the \"Love\" you had for older games (with the beautiful music, simple gameplay, and \"different\" graphics). Even though you have the ability to speed run the game, and there is a YOLO mode to keep you interested, the amount of content is minimal (there are only 12 very short levels!). And yes, I'm well aware the game is only $3.00 when not on sale, but c-mon, I would much rather have worthwhile content with HOURS of potential fun, instead of minutes. Really, I don't want to have to wait for \"Love 2\" to get more of this game after only playing for less than an hour. Still, I feel the really short amount of content can leave some questioning the price of $3.00, but when it's on sale, it is definitely worth it. I'm afraid I'll have to give it an 8.5/10 mostly beacause of the EXTREMELY, EXTREMELY, EXTREMELY small content.

This is just my first experience playing it and what my thoughts are about it so far. First of all, I must admit I am a bit disappointed because it was so short. My first playthrough took 40 minutes, but I'm assuming they did that because it was designed to be played in Speedrun Mode. Simple controls - A to jump, S to save checkpoint, arrow keys to move. It's not a very complicated idea and there aren't really any special mechanics; it's player vs. environment. Not to say that they need to add more things to spice it up, it was made like that and it's supposed to be like that. Its simplicity is one of the things I like most about the game.\n\nAnother thing I liked was that I was really starting to groove and dig the music since I entered the fourth level (yellow walls). They definitely need to get a soundtrack up. Really set the vibe, and got me to enjoy it and just chill. Great job on that.\n\nWhat's interesting is that the more times I replay it, the more I love it.

If it's addicting to play now, without a public leaderboard, I can only imagine how much time I'd spend when it does come out. You can also play it in YOLO mode where you only have 1 life for all 12 levels.\n\nFirst impression was that the difficulty levels were too low but like most games, they introduce new knowledge slowly or how to approach a certain situation then build the difficulty up as you go along. But it's still a mildly challenging game, so I'm hoping the level designers might tweak a few things to make it slightly more difficult. Not Super-Meat-Boy-difficult of course, just something that might make people put more effort into trying to finish it. But until then, YOLO mode ought to do for now. Also, they should really make it so that ESC doesn't completely exit you out of the game. I was trying to go to the menu in the middle of a game and exited instead.\n\nGive it a chance. I wasn't very impressed the first time I played it but after spending a bit more time with it, I'm looking forward to where they're taking Love and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who'd enjoy a simple and cute little indie game.", "timestamp_created": 1391811376, "timestamp_updated": 1391849312, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 175, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.869662", "comment_count": "10", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9010185": {"recommendationid": "9010185", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054785956", "num_games_owned": 267, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 230, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463079099}, "language": "english", "review": "Great rage game, Mak me cri evry tim/10 LOVE it.", "timestamp_created": 1391809030, "timestamp_updated": 1391809030, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.420383", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9008695": {"recommendationid": "9008695", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995132001", "num_games_owned": 373, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1439601487}, "language": "english", "review": "Went in expecting the 2009 DS dating sim by Konami, got a gorgeous better platformer instead.

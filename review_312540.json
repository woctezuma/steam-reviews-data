Each enemy is vulnerable to particular types of attacks and if you're playing on Hard, you will want to learn the special attacks. Particularly the lunge attack. It seems easy on paper but it's difficult to master but if you do master it it will lead to high damaging combos.

Until very recently I have never played nor seen anyone play any of the Ys games. Around Sept/20 2017 I started with Ys I, then Ys II, followed by Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim, Ys: The Oath in Felghana, Ys Orgin then I just beat Ys Seven.  Finally Ys VIII Lacrimosa of Dana is all that is left. With a early 2018 expected release date for PC. Below is how I rank the games I have played and beat so far from best to worst. I will edit this review as I play and beat more Ys games. \n\n<Best>\nYs Seven\nYs: The Oath in Felghana\nYs: Origin\nYs II \nYs VI: The Ark of Napishtim \nYs I\n<Worst>\n\nStill Left to Play...\nYs VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana\n\nWhat I thought of \"Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim \"\nThis game is a great Ys Game. While this was the first Ys game I have played to feature combat were you actually press a button to attack. The combat feels a little stiff. However it suits the game well enough. I find the games regular normal enemies to be amonst the most challening out of most Ys games I have played. Bosses while still challening are  not as hard as some other Ys game bosses. I was not a major fan of the bosses in general however I was not disapointed overall. This game is a little longer then most other Ys games I have played including Ys: The Oath in Falghana which is shorter. You need to grind a fair bit but not to the point were it's very painful. I have some major issues with performing such actions as Dash Jumps. The game has places were you MUST or should perform Dash Jumps and they take a lot of skill to learn.

Being the first-made of the 3d Ys games, it's a bit rough around the edges and doesn't quite match up with Felghana or Origin, but is still a great game overall, and I highly recommend it.  As with other Ys games, the music is amazing, the story is quite good and builds upon the lore from previous entries, and the gameplay is top notch.  That said, there are a few annoyances with this game that set it below the other titles.  First off, as the first 3d game, Falcom decided to include critical hits and status effects like a traditional RPG, which is something I don't feel works out too well for Ys.  Crits add an extra luck element that can either make bosses easier if you're lucky, or destroy you if you take a crit yourself.  Enemies with status effects also just feel like more of an annoyance than anything.  Another mechanic that exists in this game, which many people find to be a nuisance due to the control scheme, is the dash attack (where you tap and release in the direction you're facing and then attack) and dash-jump attack (where jump is pressed just after attack on a dash-attack).  Personally I really enjoyed this mechanic, using dash-jump as a means to travel more quickly or evade attacks, though it does take a little getting used to.  Overall, I'd say if you like Ys games or action RPGs, then this is a fantastic game and definitely worth getting, but if you're limited on money, then grab Oath in Felghana or Origin first.", "timestamp_created": 1500223948, "timestamp_updated": 1500223948, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33352470": {"recommendationid": "33352470", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092047106", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498936137}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome oldschool game. part dungeon crawler part rpg.", "timestamp_created": 1499457023, "timestamp_updated": 1499457023, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520958", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33351289": {"recommendationid": "33351289", "author": {"steamid": "76561198356141989", "num_games_owned": 785, "num_reviews": 270, "playtime_forever": 3073, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501618908}, "language": "english", "review": "Graphics and controls are great, even if I liked more the gameplay of the first games of the Ys series.\nAnyways, a good story and the trademark one-hero Ys are here, you can't bump anymore into enemies and NPCs but you have to mash the attack button and (this of course is a new feature if you played only the first games of the series) since you can jump you can use both buttons to create various attacks.

This is a great action RPG. Awesome music, fast paced, and good hack and slash excitement.  The game is a great grinding RPG with a pretty simple story, and really incredible boss fights.  There wasn't a time I really felt bored playing this, right up to the end of the game. It's from 2003, but aged very well, and worth the time! I guess if any negatives, I can say, it can be challenging unless you grind. You wil die enough if you rush to far ahead, so you might feel at a slight stand stil, but it's fun nonetheless. No voice acting to talk about. Art work is very nice, an the animated cinematics look good for the time. \n\nFor those who don't know much about this series, or the Dev. Nihon Falcom has been doing RPG's for a long time, and many only came out in Japan. They are pros at making quality JRPG's, and hold a good reputation over in Japan.

Wie so oft sind es doch die etwas simpleren Spiele, die den meisten Spielspa\u00df einbringen. Wer den alten Action-RPG's der 90er hinterher trauert, die mehr Wert auf Spielspa\u00df als auf eine hochgez\u00fcchtete Grafik gelegt haben, der ist bei Ys genau richtig aufgehoben. F\u00fcr mich war der Titel seinerzeit auf der PS2 ein ganz dicker Geheimtipp und weckte in mir den Wunsch weitere Ableger der Serie kennenzulernen. Dank Steam ist dieser Wunsch dann ja auch Jahre sp\u00e4ter in Erf\u00fcllung gegangen. Ironischerweise kommt die PC-Download-Version aufgrund fehlenden Inhalts jedoch nicht an Konamis PS2-Version heran. Falcom konnte oder wollte es sich wohl nicht leisten die zus\u00e4tzlichen Inhalte von Konami abzukaufen. Dementsprechend w\u00fcrde ich auch eher zur PS2-Version raten. Sollte dies jedoch keine Option darstellen, kann man sich auch gerne die schw\u00e4chere PC-Download-Version zulegen, denn Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim wird f\u00fcr mich wohl immer einer der besten Teile der Serie bleiben.\n\n\nPC-Download-Version vs. PS2-Version:\n\nWie gesagt: Im Direktvergleich zwischen PS2 und PC-Download-Version w\u00fcrde ich eindeutig zur PS2-Version raten. Zur Begr\u00fcndung hier nun die stichpunktartigen Vorz\u00fcge der jeweiligen Version im Vergleich:\n\nPS2-Version:\n- bietet einen zus\u00e4tzlichen Bonus-Dungeon, der in drei Abschnitte unterteilt ist\n- das Intro und einige andere Zwischensequenzen wurden in 3D-Rendervideos umgewandelt. Diese passen zwar nicht zum sonstigen Anime/Manga-Flair, sind daf\u00fcr aber dennoch schick anzuschauen und erf\u00fcllen, im Gegensatz zum originalen Intro, den narrativen Zweck\n- das originale Intro ist dennoch in der PS2-Version enthalten und kann via Cheat-Men\u00fc angesehen werden\n- apropos Cheat-Men\u00fc: In der PS2-Version kann man hiermit allerlei tolle Sachen anstellen, solange man sich die Codes aus dem Internet heraussucht. Die PC-Version bietet keine Cheats.\n- es gibt ne englische Sprachausgabe. Diese ist zwar kitschig aber immer noch besser als gar keine (Tipp: Per Cheat soll sich auch die japanische Sprachausgabe aktivieren lassen)\n- es gibt deutsche Bildschirmtexte\n\nPC-Download-Version:\n- gibt einen neuen \u201eCatastrophe Mode\u201c, der den Gebrauch der Heilitems auf den Standard von Ys: The Oath in Felghana und Ys Origin umwandelt\n- es gibt ein umfangreiches Teleportations-System in dieser Version (kann aber auch missbraucht werden, um aus brenzligen Situationen zu entkommen)\n- Achievements und Trading Cards\n- Leaderboards f\u00fcr den Time Attack-Modus\n\nNeutral:\n- die Charaktermodelle in der PS2-Version sind in 3D und aufw\u00e4ndiger animiert, hierdurch f\u00fcgen sie sich besser in die sonstige 3D-Grafik des Spiels ein. Allerdings lassen die 3D-Charaktermodelle jedoch etwas den altbekannten SD-Charme der 2D-Charaktermodelle der PC-Version vermissen. Au\u00dferdem passen die 2D-Modelle besser zum allgemeinen Grafikstil der anderen Ys-Spiele", "timestamp_created": 1497738646, "timestamp_updated": 1497738646, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32470604": {"recommendationid": "32470604", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113504920", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 828, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489926395}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc815\ub9d0 \uc624\ub79c\ub9cc\uc5d0 \uc774\uc2a4 \uc2dc\ub9ac\uc988\ub97c \ud50c\ub808\uc774\ud558\ub2c8 \ucd94\uc5b5\uc774 \uc0c8\ub85d\uc0c8\ub85d \uae30\uc5b5\ub098\ub124\uc694...\n\ud2b9\uc815 \uc544\uc774\ud15c\uc744 \uba39\uc73c\ub824\uba74 \ucee8\ud2b8\ub864\uc774 \uc880 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\ud328\uc2dc \ub2e4\ub978\uc9c0\uc5ed\uc73c\ub85c \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9c0\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00\ub9ce\uc544 \uc880 \uc9dc\uc99d\ub0ac\uc9c0\ub9cc \uac8c\uc784\uc758 \uc7ac\ubbf8\ub294 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \ub4ef...", "timestamp_created": 1497609854, "timestamp_updated": 1497609854, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32127670": {"recommendationid": "32127670", "author": {"steamid": "76561198196378813", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 783, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497612539}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6211\u4e0d\u8981\u8d70\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01\n\u6211\u8981\u5728\u5c9b\u4e0a\u751f\u6d3b\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01\n\u6211\u8981\u5a36\u4e24\u4e2a\u8001\u5a46\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1496405531, "timestamp_updated": 1496405559, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 39, "weighted_vote_score": "0.785645", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32051928": {"recommendationid": "32051928", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131141802", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1453, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505515981}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "MELHOR JOGO EVER!!!!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1496099850, "timestamp_updated": 1496099850, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32011717": {"recommendationid": "32011717", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024989587", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 849, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494963476}, "language": "english", "review": "Not as polished as Oath and Origins but still a fun Ys game, even if it's one of the weaker ones.

But in the end, the red one is the most effective, so that's going to be your main. That's my first gripe, because while some bosses (boss fights are great) really forces you to use different blades, a lot of normal enemies are just fine with red sword--to be more precise, the down stab with red sword. My second gripe is the lack of fire magic, or any kind of distance attack, but it does make some enemy encounters much more interesting, so I'm willing to let it pass. Overall, the enemies are varied enough and your attacks are varied enough; it's just that the most effective attacks never ceases to be effective.\n\nDash jumps. Dash jumps are actually not that bad. It takes a while to get used to the specific timing to trigger it, but once you do, you can pull it off relatively easily. The problem is the platforms, especially that fvcking pillar in the Ruins of Lost Time. Unless you have a platforming mechanic that is as good as Mario, don't do something like this fvcking pillar. Especially when you have a fixed perspective camera like in this game.\n\nI'd say this game is really fun, minus the fvcking pillars.

It\u2019s an amazing game, but it has many flaws. It\u2019s filled with great ideas, but it doesn\u2019t always take advantage of them. It\u2019s forgiving, but can be brutally unfair. The ideas of Napishtim don\u2019t always mesh, and the resulting contradictions in balance are the result. But the ideas that do work do so extremely well.\n\nPositives:\n- Epic in Scope\n- Phenomenal Soundtrack\n- Solid Gameplay\n- Ys Boss Battles\n- Tons of Secrets\n- Catastrophe Mode\n\nNegatives:\n- Fundamental Design Flaws\n- Treatment of Minor Bosses\n- Poor Tutorial\n- Catastrophe Mode Implementation Issues\n\nThe Ark of Napishtim is an awesome game with an epic presentation. Everything about Napishtim feels huge, vast and mysterious, be it the story or the Islands of Canaan. In fact, Napishtim doesn\u2019t just feel huge, it feels like it was meant to be bigger than it already is! For instance, there\u2019s a talisman that lets Adol breathe underwater, but it\u2019s barely used (far from the epic underwater coral dungeon I was expecting). Nonetheless, the world of Napishtim is beautifully crafted, and filled with a diverse variety of characters and monsters alike.\n\nThe secrets in Napishtim are amazing! Not only are the secrets numerous, many are deviously hidden. I love it! Admittedly, some things shouldn\u2019t be secrets since they can significantly affect the game\u2019s balance.\n\nNapishtim\u2019s main story, though not the strongest, is actually really good. However, the depth and weight of the history implied by the Ark itself opens new possibilities for the series. Napishtim is such a powerful cornerstone of Ys lore that it changes the nature of Ys!\n\nThe main story is an exploration of greed. That said, greed is not portrayed as a fundamentally bad thing, and is in fact shown to help bring two neighboring societies, both at odds with each other, together for mutual benefit. However, greed cannot be fully explored without demonstrating its use as a means of manipulation; both innocuous and malicious. And Napishtim does this exquisitely.\n\nLike all Ys games, the soundtrack does an excellent job supporting and defining the atmosphere of game, but at the same time, the music easily stands on its own. One track in particular stands out to me personally; the theme for the Ruins of Lost Time. This is not because the track is necessarily Napishtim\u2019s best (arguably). But rather because this track, more than any other, expresses the weight of Napishtim\u2019s deep and rich history.\n\nOf the three games based on the Napishtim engine, it\u2019s the gameplay of Napishtim that is the most ambitious and unique. Napishtim\u2019s gameplay is based around 3 spiritual swords, each with their own unique properties and attributes. Each sword also has two unique skills; one elemental attack, and one magic attack. I love the fact that Napishtim includes 6 abilities, especially since some of these feel very outlandish compared to future entries.\n\nThe greatest downfall of Napishtim\u2019s gameplay is that some of the mechanics are very non-intuitive. Since the gameplay is very refined, the non-intuitive aspects would be a non-issue if they were supported by a solid tutorial. Unfortunately, the tutorial is less than stellar. Everything is crammed onto 2 pages, and most of it is self-explanatory. While non-intuitive points are described in the tutorial, the descriptions tend to be confined to 1 line of text. This critical information is so obscured by everything around it that, even if you\u2019re careful, it\u2019s easy to miss.\n\nThe Bosses in Napishtim are primitive compared to Felghana or Origin, but they\u2019re not as simple as one might think. The boss designs hold a surprising amount of nuance and depth that take all aspects of Napishtim\u2019s gameplay into account. In Catastrophe Time Attack, the bosses really shine; all major design issues that ultimately hurt Story Mode are gone, resulting in the bosses in their purest, most refined form. This, consequently, exposes their raw points; the hit detection for some attacks is a bit unfair, and the random-luck factor is unusually high. It\u2019s worth mentioning that two of the bosses are just borderline beatable on Nightmare Catastrophe Time Attack, and only if you really know how to beat them. Napishtim\u2019s Bosses, for what they are, are frustrating but fun, and very satisfying to beat.\n\nI do have a nit-pick with the final boss; it\u2019s way too easy to beat. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s a fun and challenging boss. It\u2019s just not challenging enough for a final boss.\n\nA huge number of Napishtim\u2019s issues revolve around how bosses are handled in Story Mode. One of the biggest issues is Healing Items. If you have them, you can beat the boss by spamming them. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019re effectively playing Catastrophe Mode. As far as balance is concerned, it\u2019s impossible to account for this chasm of variability. In addition, since Magic Gauges don\u2019t reset when a boss fight starts, Magic can also be spammed. The Magic in Napishtim is literally three powerful boost-like abilities, and being able to spam them is a huge balance-changing advantage.\n\nIt probably wouldn\u2019t be too difficult to make Magic Gauges reset for major bosses. But this is impossible for minor bosses due to two design decisions. First, none of the minor bosses have a savepoint immediately preceding them. Second, you can flee from nearly all minor boss fights. Both of these points add severe limitations to how these bosses can be balanced, and unfortunately prevents them from being pushed to their full potential.\n\nThe optional bosses also suffer from a further issue. Optional bosses should be extra challenges that have near-zero impact on the overall balance of the game. However, most of Napishtim\u2019s optional bosses have a significant impact on the game\u2019s balance. One of the biggest issues in the entire game is that three of the optional bosses guard game-changing accessories, around which the end-game bosses are balanced, and the game provides no hint that these bosses even exist\u2026 Why?\n\nThere\u2019s also a late-game sidequest that earns a single-use auto-revive accessory. It\u2019s not part of the game\u2019s balance at all.\n\nThe optional superboss Majunun also doesn\u2019t quite work. As a superboss, Majunun is spectacular. But in order to properly fight Majunun, you have to grind and grind and grind... Mandatory grinding is not what Ys is about. In addition to this, the Level 11 swords only exist for Majunun, but a player might think they\u2019re necessary in order to fight the last main bosses. The Level 11 Swords and Majunun would probably be better off as a post-game event. This way, grinding isn\u2019t necessary to beat Majunun, and it\u2019s clear that the final bosses only require Level 10 Swords.\n\nI love Catastrophe Mode; I have nothing but praise for the idea. With that said, its implementation does have issues. In Catastrophe Mode, healing items in treasure chests are replaced with Capla Water, which can be sold for gold in order to buy items way earlier than intended, thus allowing two tiers of armor to be completely bypassed. This makes the early game significantly easier, but it leaves the late game open to a very steep difficulty spike. The primary function of Catastrophe Mode Capla Water, curing status ailments, is almost effectively useless due to Napishtim\u2019s overall design.

rather than by their original release dates. Prior to playing Ys VI, I had played Ys I & II Chronicles+ (PC), Ys: Books I & II (TurboGrafx-CD), Ys III: Wanderers from Ys (TGCD), Ys IV: Mask of the Sun (Super Famicom), Ys IV: The Dawn of Ys (PC Engine CD) and Ys V: Kefin, Lost City of Sand (SFC).]\n\nYs VI: The Ark of Napishtim was the first new game released in the series since 1995's Ys V. Napishtim follows the same design decisions that its predecessor did: keeping the classic overhead perspective that the majority of classic Ys games had (with the exception of Wanderers from Ys - which was more of a side-scroller) but ditching the \"run-and-bump\" battle system for a more traditional hack-and-slash system (akin to games like Crystalis or The Legend of Zelda), along with little platforming elements (not unlike Link's Awakening). But while Ys V was clunky even for its time, VI manages to refine these gameplay elements into something both functional and more evocative of the Ys games of yore.\n\nYs VI starts with our hero Adol the Red shipwrecked on the Canaan Islands and found by Olha, the priestess of the Rehda Clan, a tribe of natives with elfin features. The Rehda clan are currently embroiled in a conflict with a colony of humans, cast away to these islands by the same storn that brought Adol here. Of course, as typical of the Ys games, there are many ancient relics to find, the most important of which being the titular Ark of Napishtim.\n\nThe graphics are dated (even by 2003's standards), but functional. The Ys series is well-known for their killer soundtracks and Ark of Napishtim lives up to those standards. My personal favorite tracks are \"Mighty Obstacle\" (the common boss theme), \"Mountain Zone\" (Grana-Vallis Mountain), \"Windslash Steps\" (one of the overworld themes) and what is probably my favorite song in the game, \"The Ruined City \"Kishgal\"\".\n\nIf you're not familiar with the Ys series, I'd probably say to start with Ys I & II Chronicles+ and then pick this one up. If you've only played that game, then this is a perfect choice to continue on. If, however, you've already played Oath in Felghana and Origin, I'm not sure if I could recommend this one to you. I think it's a fun game regardless, but I'd only suggest playing Ark of Napishtim if you keep in mind that it was originally released BEFORE those two games (2003 vs. 2005/2006)  -- and by extension, is a bit more primitive by comparison.", "timestamp_created": 1475708588, "timestamp_updated": 1475708588, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25856749": {"recommendationid": "25856749", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995865042", "num_games_owned": 477, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 636, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476589651}, "language": "english", "review": "I wish I could give this game a limp thumbs up because if you play it you're gonna have a good time, but if you get Oath in Felghana or Origins you'll have a better time.", "timestamp_created": 1475599630, "timestamp_updated": 1475599630, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25853581": {"recommendationid": "25853581", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125719175", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 1214, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470176656}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice classic game!

While I loved those two games, I'll have to recommend you not purchase Ark of Napishtim, as it being the first modern game means it has a lot of imperfections. As its own thing it would still be decent, but with the reputation those two games set it doesn't really live up to them.\n\nThe level curve in those two games was pretty good. If you fought most enemies you'd be where you needed to be to fight bosses, and if one was tricky you could go up a couple more to tilt things in your favor. Enemies that were dangerous gave you enough experience to compensate, and levels meant enough that getting one off them usually dispelled that danger a lot. \n\nNot so much in Napishtim. I had to grind for a while so that the first boss (who had two attacks - the game's bosses aren't quite as well-made) didn't kill me in a few hits, and I could deal decent damage to him. Even if you're leveled up, though, the game seems to enjoy getting around that when it can: the first dungeon for example, has tiny bugs for enemies which aren't much of a threat. In the last room a bigger one drops down, and if you try to fight it you'll probably get one shot. What does that prove? A later dungeon has two enemies you can't damage at all without equipping two specific accessories, assuming you find them. \n\nAnother minor quibble are the sword mechanic - in this game Adol has three swords he can use, for Wind, Fire and Thunder. They all attack differently and have unique magic attacks, which is cool. But as soon as you get one, enemies start appearing that glow their colors, and if you don't have that sword yet, you can't properly damage them. That's just a bit annoying most of the time, but the third boss has a move where he tries to spawn in minions. At that point you only have the wind sword, so if one happens to be glowing another color, that's a permanent nuisance you have to deal with for the rest of the fight.\n\nThen there's Catastrophe mode. Ark is a black sheep of the series in that you can collect healing items to use in battle, and this is a modifier that turns that off. Any chests or events that contained them will have another usable item, but one you'll need to open the menu to. I never used them, but they sell for quite a bit, and actually let me skip an equipment tier by doing that. \n\nHaving played most of the game I think Catastrophe mode goes beyond just being a difficulty modifier and sort of breaks the game if you use it. Since many bosses deal massive damage even if you've grinded up levels and stat items, it seems like they're designed around you having a stock of items to heal up after taking a big hit. With Catastrophe mode on though, none of the bosses are changed at all, meaning they become \"do it perfectly, or die\", whereas Oath and Origin are both more forgiving. It only became apparent this was the case with Catastrophe a while into the game, and there's no warning it will affect the game's balance like this. It feels like a trap option rather than a neat challenge.\n\nI noticed these flaws early on, but kept playing as I didn't want to drop an Ys game. But they only became more pronounced as I went on. If you're playing through all the Ys games, or have totally finished the others on Steam and don't have access to the newer ones, then I'd say to give Ark a try - on sale.

I wish i could give a neutral review.\n\nThis is a VERY good game. It just has some pretty annoying issues along the road.\n\nFirst. The game has pretty bad balancing issues. I think this persisted in Y's Origin and maybe Oath of Felghana as well. But you have a situation where your enemies can take off half of your health in one attack, and then when you level twice, they wont be capable of killing you at all. The attack/defense calculation per level is ridiculously imbalanced. (This actually leads into the final issue i have).\n\nNext, the game has some poor control schematics. I know the game gives you the ability to rebind your keys, but this shouldn't be a thing you need to do BY DEFAULT. The pause menu (for an Xbox 360 controller) is on the right stick button, and your weapon hotswap is placed on the left bumper and on tha start button.\n\nThe game features a very poor jumping mechanic ive NEVER been able to use due to the inability to just dash jump at will. There are videos of players being able to actually use this IMPORTANT JUMPING MECHANIC. Its like a dark souls mechanics. You either get really good at it or miss half of the good items in the game because of it. Why not just make a double jump mechanic on the steam release.\n\nFinally. At the VERY END OF THE GAME. You can break your save and be unable to complete the game (or it becomes extremely frustrating to) due to a ridiculous mechanic. You get the wings of alma, a new item modernizing transportation so that you DONT have to walk everywhere, yet the game wont let you use it in the final area, where you HAVE TO HAD FARMED PREVIOUSLY to beat the bosses. You cannot leave that area at all, and if you save there, then you are screwed. It happened to me. I faced the 2nd to final boss, beat him with trial and error, and then was greeted to a NEW BOSS with NO enemies to farm on before the boss. Im saying this as a game developer in the making. The game itself didnt make it ABSOLUTELY clear that you could not return. It said \"returning will not be easy\". Well with the wings of alma and 2 seocnds i should be able to fly to any save point i want to, INCLUDING those in the final area.\n\nThe first issue persists in the final issue because balancing a game isnt entirely hard. There is no reason whatsoever though, should you design a game where you are level locked to be capable of beating the game. If you make it to the final boss at level 1, good job. Its not recommended but it should entirely be possible. But this game makes enemies capable of one shotting you for no real reason. So when you DO get to the final boss and if you broke your save. You HAVE to cheat. There's no other way.\n\n\nI wish i could give this game a better rating than a yay or nay. If i could i'd give it a 9/10. Its a good game. it really is.

I was just absolutely blown away at how great the gameplay was! The characters were interesting, and I put a huge number of hours into it. I am also playing it through again, which goes to show how great a game it is.\n\nThen my brother told me that it was one from a series -- a long series. I immediately picked up Ys: The Oath in Felghana, and was slightly disappointed. The difficulty was way off, I thought. Super difficult, as there are no healing items. EDIT: I've been playing Felghana again. Play Ys: Origin first if you have trouble with it, then come back and it'll be a lot easier!\n\nSo, I decided to pick up Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim. This game is *every bit as good as Memories of Celceta*! I cannot stress this enough. This game is just fabulous. I'm not quite finished it, but I can almost guarantee I will be playing it again. Playing this game made me also pick up Ys: Origin and Ys Chronicles: I & II. Origin is amazing as well, though I haven't had a chance to play the first two games yet.\n\nHaving played Celceta first, the plot items that link all the games together had me excited. I absolutely love when a series like this reference each other, and actually reveal the answers to questions you had about the other games in the series.\n\nThe gameplay in this game is somewhat similar to Celceta, though you only control Adol. Like Celceta, Dogi doesn't make an appearance, which is apparently disappointing to fans of the series, but because I've yet to play one of the games where he is featured prominently, it doesn't bother me much.

Not counting EVEN MORE re-releases of Ys I & II fans had to wait almost a decade for the next proper Ys game. And thankfully Ys VI put the franchise back on track.\n\n[h1] STORY [/h1]\n\nThree years after the events of Ys V Adol Christin is on his way to explore the mysterious Vortex of Canaan, a massive, eternally spinning vortex located far to the west of Eresia in the Atlas ocean. Along for the ride are his best friend and fan favorite Dogi The Wall-Crusher, Terra from Ys V, who got promoted from annoying brat to jailbait, as well as Captain One-Eyed Ladoc (Terra's dad) and his pirate crew. Just as they are about to enter the vortex they are ambushed by the Romun imperial fleet under the command of General Agares. A cannon blast knocks Adol overboard and he falls into the Great Vortex. After somehow surviving the raging waters he washes ashore on Quatera Island where he is found by this game's main heroines, Olha and her little sister Isha, of the native Rehda tribe. They bring our unconcious hero back to their village and nurse him back to full health. After that the game begins.\n\nThe story in Ys VI is pretty good overall. It's nothing groundbreaking but it will keep you interested from start to finish. The autistic levels of worldbuilding that started with Ys Eternal are once again present here. Every single NPC in the game has something interesting to say and all of them get new lines of dialogue to reflect current events as the story progresses. The main antagonist incidentally happens to be the biggest laughing stock in the entire franchise (those who played Celceta know exactly why) and the final boss is not what most people expected back then.\n\nThis game is also a cornerstone for Ys lore, so if you're one of the five guys out there (like me) who give a hoot about it there's quite a lot to learn here.\n\n[h1] GRAPHICS [/h1]\n\nThis is a game from 2003, so obviously the graphics will be dated. That doesn't mean they are bad though. Aesthetically the game is quite pleasing. The environments are well designed, the character and enemy sprites are nice and varied. The bosses themselves use 3D models and I still think they look good even today.\n\nSince this is an original Falcom game that was made for PC (the PS2 version is a port) it will pretty much run perfectly even on a potato. XSEED were nice enough to add widescreen support for this release, HOWEVER be advised that the game was not made with widescreen in mind so you will see some oddities in a few places if you play it like that. None of them are gamebreaking though and they are few and far between so if you have a widescreen monitor go nuts.\n\n[h1] MUSIC [/h1]\n\nThe music in this game... oh dear sweet Jesus the music... After the disaster that was Ys V's soundtrack (just why?) Sound Team J.D.K. got their shit together and went all out with this one.\n\nYs VI's soundtrack is absolutely stellar. The opening theme alone literally explodes in your face and I still think it's one of the best openings Falcom has ever made. The rest of the music is nice and varied. You have magical overwold themes, energetic dungeon themes, soothing town themes, mad guitar shredding boss themes as well as some pretty damn good electronic themes for the locations and encounters that are of a more \"technological\" nature.\n\nI have no real complaints about the soundtrack aside from a few tiny nitpicks that are more of a personal preference than actual problems. Some instruments in a couple of tracks tend to sound a bit too high pitched for my tastes but all those tracks have already been re-arranged in later albums, so it's not really an issue.\n\n[h1] GAMEPLAY [/h1]\n\nUp until this point Ys had a very interesting reception when it came to its gameplay. Ys I & II ware overhead RPGs and had a love-it or hate-it bumper cars battle system, but they were well regarded and are still praised to this day. Ys III went the Zelda II route and became an action platformer. It flopped as a result (No, children, it wasn't a good game. Before Ys V came along it was regarded as the black sheep of the series. Its only saving grace was the soundtrack and that only applied to the PC-Engine version). Ys IV went back to the style of I & II and was praised to high heaven. Ys V became an overhead hack 'n' slash and it once again flopped. \n\nSo what does Ys VI do? It takes the platforming from Ys III, mixes it up with the combat of Ys V and the result is... pretty damn good... shocking isn't it?\n\nThe game took the gimmicks from the above-mentioned titles and refined them quite well. Adol runs around hacking at monsters as they explode in blood and guts while doing the occasional platforming here and there. During your adventure you'll get to wield three different swords: the Wind Blade Lyvart, the Fire Blade Blirante and the Lightning Blade Ericcil. Each of them can be upgraded using an ore called Emel that drops from monsters and can be found in some chests. Upgrading them not only improves their damage output, but also unlocks unique moves and special attacks. You have several different stores where you can buy armor, shields, accessories and supplies. The best bits however are all found in treasure chests so exploring everywhere is highly recommended.\n\nThe platforming is pretty standard and there isn't much I can say about it. There are a few bits in the game that require you to use a really gimmicky move called the dash jump, but they are all optional and are not required if you just want to finish the game.\n\nThe original PC version was plagued with some backtracking but XSEED revamped the Wing of Alma so now you can use it to teleport to any save point you've visited before. Another new feature that comes with this release is Catastrophe Mode. What it does is make all recovery items behave like they do in Oath in Felghana and Origin so you can no longer store them and spam them even during bosses. I recommend playing the game in this mode since it fixes the one real issue I have with it.\n\n[u] The game is easy. [/u]\n\nOkay it's not Ys V levels of easy (that game was so easy they had to re-release a more difficult version because the fans went ballistic) but it still isn't very hard. Normal difficulty is a joke. Hard and Nightmare are much better but if you have decent reflexes even they won't give you much trouble (inb4 someone goes \"b-but you d-don't h-have t-the ach-ch-chievement\" I've already done it once on PS2 and once when this got a fan translation and Geis was constantly buttmad. I just can't be arsed to do it yet again at the moment, but I'll get to it. Nightmare Catastrophe sounds really fun).\n\nEven if it's not that difficult the game is still very fun. It has some flaws here and there but this is also Falcom's first 3D Ys game, so they were still trying to figure things out. The next game vastly improved upon the formula and also compensated for the low difficulty (AND BOY DID IT COMPENSATE but I'll save that story for when I finally get around to writing a review about it).\n\n[h1] TL;DR [/h1]\n\nThis is the definitive version of Ys VI, the PSP port is garbage and while the PS2 port has a few extra things in it's not really worth it (I'd say more on the topic but word limit). Even though it's the first 3D Ys game and as a result is a little rough around the edges it's still a very good game. If you're an Ys fan you already have this. If you like action RPGs I highly recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1461776207, "timestamp_updated": 1462043866, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.599670", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22611811": {"recommendationid": "22611811", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104484288", "num_games_owned": 493, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 607, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455597691}, "language": "english", "review": "YS VI: The Ark of Napishtim\n\nThis game is, by far, one of the coolest NAMED games I've ever played.\nNapishtim sounds cool as hell and if I'm to have any say in the matter, my firstborn son will be named Napishtim.\nBefore you continue on, I want you to know that I LOVE this game and I cherish it from my early teenage years.\n\nThat said.\n\nYs is not a long game.\nIt will FEEL like a long game.\nI've noticed this more and more recently, how doing something, usually something tedious like watching a youtube ad, can make 30 seconds feel like 10-15 minutes of your life wasted.\nThe devs over at Falcom have officially mastered this concept while somehow making you feel like you're actively accomplishing something.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the game play starts out for the average player.\nWake up In/Discover A new area > Explore > Grind >  Fight Boss > Rinse and Repeat.\n\nThis is how your game play will end up being, or at least SHOULD.\nWake up in/Discover a new area > Grind > Grind > Grind > Grind > Grind > Grind > Grind > Grinnd > Grind > Explore > Grind > Fight Boss.\n\n85% of this game is GRINDING.\nYou need to grind to level up.\nYou need to grind to enhance your swords.\nYou need to grind to get money.\n\nBack when this came out on PS2 I was NEVER able to beat it, and I could never figure out why, its not like I was bad, its like right around the final dungeon I'd hit two walls.\nI just suddenly stopped doing meaningful damage the monsters AND it would cost an UNHOLY amount of emelas to improve my weapons.\nWell Early 2000-something me HATED repetition.\nI never ground out levels, and I had a hard time in a lot of games.\nSomewhere between starting my new channel and grinding in mmo's to catch up to my friends, I beat repetition into myself as a positive force.\nSo this time around, I ground out the pointlessly expensive emelas for all three swords.\nI say its pointlessly expensive because you basically NEED them to complete the game.\nUnless you LIKE hitting enemies for upwards of 10 damage out of their 500 point lifebar.\n\nRemember though, I DO love this game.\nWith all my cold, emelas splattered, blood drained heart, I love this game.\n\nEverything about it breaths and pulsates with a strange Ys heartbeat.\nFrom the explanation of MULTIPLE lore plotpoints, with explanations of who the winged people are, what emelas is, what brought down the kingdom of YS and So much more, if you enjoy the YS lore, this is a game you NEED to grind through.\n\nAnd when you're grinding, you'll have wicked music to smash your head to while you fight the most disturbing fingery spiders in any game I've ever seen.\nThese spiders are this games way of easing you into the YOU NEED TO GRIND difficulty curve.\nA combination of weapon type and lack of weapon damage will have you tap dancing through the underground tunnel after the first boss because after grinding to the point of absolutely annihiliating the monsters in the first area you will then go underground and do....ZERO damage to them.\nBut, hey, everyone loves finger spiders that can't be killed and can easily overwhelm you due to sheer numbers right?\n\nBut other than lore, music, grinding, this game also has Charm and Wit, everything from Adol's slowly growing harem of women who would gladly abandon everything to be with him....it was the early 2000's, this kind of thing was in basically every game that came out of Japan at the time.  The charm also however includes the two main stories in the game, basically this:\n\nSpoiler Alert:\n[spoiler] A Race War that gets put on hold by Monsters\nAdol trying to get stuff done and being constantly delayed by aforementioned Race War.\n[/spoiler]\n\nAs for the wit...well...there's an achievement in the game called \"Just because its there\".\nNot gonna lie...that's the first time I've seen something in a game to that effect and I give the game extra points for including something that's 1. DAMNED hard to find, even knowing where the hell it is, I still could barely get to it, 2. ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE.  Unless you ground out more levels.  Hypotheeeetically, I could get into it and be careful, but ultimately between the difficulty GETTING there and the then added difficulty finishing it, just didn't seem worth the effort really.  \n\nOverall?\nIf you're from an age that's slowly being forgotten, where you had to fight and earn your feeling of being a badass warrior, You'll LOVE this game.\nAre you young?  Want to feel like a master of a game that's tough as nails, if a little short AND get the idea of what it feels like to be a teenager in the EARLY 2ks? \nThis is the game for you .\nI give this an 8/10\nIt'd score higher, but take out the grinding and this is REALLY like a 5 hour game, and that's being generous.\nFrom what I've read, the games that came out after this are longer, but i'm not reviewing those games.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1461510193, "timestamp_updated": 1461510193, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22580287": {"recommendationid": "22580287", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971072907", "num_games_owned": 289, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 662, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459491336}, "language": "english", "review": "Great if you like RPGs, Zelda etc!

The consistently excellent game play, music, and charm inherent to the Ys series are once again top notch and wrapped up in a tight little package that will scratch your Action RPG itch with refined precision.  \n\nThis was the first of the Ys games to use this game engine (along with Oath in Felghana and Origins), but it was the last to be released on Steam by XSEED.  It's therefore interesting approaching this game after having already played through the other two in the trilogy.  Where I can definitely notice some differences in the pacing and mechanics that were improved upon in subsequent releases, this game more than makes up for its shortcomings in inspiration and drive.  This, after all, was the first Ys game to have been produced in eight years by the time of its release, and passion and effort put into this game is palpable.  It's fun, inspired, light-hearted, and runs smooth as silk.  It's also interesting to note the subtle connections between games story-wise after having played all of the Steam releases. XSEED also implemented some minor game play changes exclusively for this release that I can't imagine having gone without, being able to warp around the map being chief among them.\n\nI become more of a Falcom fan every day, and I am saddened in that this is the last PC release left available on Steam as of yet.  Here's hoping we can get some adaptations of the Chinese PC releases of Memories of Celceta and Ys Seven (however unlikely).  Great job Falcom.  Great job XSEED.

If you're a veteran to the series, you'll probably find it to be the easiest of the bunch (at least on normal). It's not nearly the grindfest that Oath in Felghana was, either, and there are a few higher-level areas where a low level Adol can level up very quickly by repeatedly defeating a few enemies. However, I found the bosses pretty subpar and not as exciting or satsifying as the ones in the other Ys games (especially Oath and Origin).\n\nThe story was interesting, and not as predictable as the others, either (except the end, which wasn't a surprise). For veterans, I highly recommend Catastrophe mode, which disallows saving up on healing items (like Origin and Oath) and instead, uses them instantly.\n\nFor newcomers, SAVE EARLY AND SAVE OFTEN! Like the other Ys games, if you die, you have to load a previous save or start over, except with bosses, where you can 'try again', except you cannot leave the area. \n\nAlso I recommend consulting a FAQ before you agree to go to face the final bosses (you'll know it)...because there are several well-hidden and wouldn't-bother-to-recheck-that-area again places where the most powerful powerups can be obtained and earned.\n\nThe game also comes with about 2.5gb of art, including psd files.\n\nAs other reviewers have noted, the dash-jump ability is a PITA.

I liked this one better than Oath in Felghana despite multple rage moments on 3 of the many bosses and 2 hours of learning how to dash jump to a undersized platform for a single item that wasn't a necessity... [spoiler]Yay for more tower climbing![/spoiler] But go for Ys I&II or Origins to start off the series.\n\n[Difficulty - good]: All of the Ys games have a pretty good balance of doable, takes a few tries and OMG WHY?!? fights. BUT, learning to dash jump is the hardest thing you will likely have to deal with. The final boss was a bit anticlimactic  compared to fights and areas in the rest of the game.\n\n[Story - average]: So Ark of Napishtim didn't answer my question from Oath in Felghana about what's up with Adol and Dogi traveling together... maybe I just forgot a passing remark made by Dogi in I&II that he wants to tag along... As for Ark of Napishtim's story, there might be even less to tell about it than Oath in Felghana's except that it manages to tie into the previous games at the end.\n\n[Characters - average]: It felt like there was less going on in the lives of the NPC's other than what was happening in the main plot but at least the jerkface causing the trouble in this one wasn't as grating on the nerves as the jerkface in Oath in Felghana. Also Adol is finally acknowledged as a force to be reckoned with when it comes to climbing ancient towers to stop all-powerful beings bent on destroying the world.\n\n[Graphics - average]: This rating is pretty much the same for the other Falcom games, I love the old graphics but some people don't.\n\n[Music - excellent]: I have yet to play a Falcom game with bad or boring music.\n\n[Combat - good]: It's pretty much the same system as Origins and Oath in Felghana. Although I noticed that the magic didn't feel all that helpful until you got 2-3 of the magic swords. I did find it a bit repetitive that most enemies were weakest to spamming jump+downward thrust combos... very rarely did I have to use some other combo.\n\n[Length - average]: It's only 10-12 hours long, about the same as Oath in Felghana... except for the time you may end up spending on learning to dash jump.\n\n[Replayability - bad]: Other than doing different difficulties, speedruns or getting all the achievements... there's not that much reason to replay it.\n\n[h1]Dash Jump Advice for mouse & keyboard users like myself:[/h1]Press a directional key but don't hold it, then press the jump and attack keys at the same time.

The same gameplay principles are here; you can run, jump and do a lot of moves with the various swords you collect. Unfortunately, in Napishtim, this is hampered by poor level design that results in constant backtracking, tedious grinding and generally poor conveyance of the player's forward path.

I don't know why I haven't give the series a shot ages ago. I'll try to keep my review short and spoiler-free as possible. Note that this is my first entry to the series so I can't say or compared it to the previous Ys games in terms of gameplay and mechanics.\n\nYs VI is an action RPG more like a Zelda-esque game rather than the classic turn-based JRPG. This also means that the gameplay feels faster and much simpler than the classic RPG. This can be either pro or cons depending on your preferences.\n\n[h1] Pros\t[/h1]\n\n[list]\n    [*]Interesting characters and engaging storyline\n    [*]Fun, fluid and satisfying combat mechanics, albeit a bit too simple.\n    [*]On-the-fly equipment swap so that you can keep the flow going (which is fortunate since you're gonna have to fight a lot)\n    [*]Satisfying boss battles, not to mention some of them are huge!\n    [*]Complete customization, catered to the PC community. Tons of graphical options are available via the launcher before the start of the game. On maxed out settings, the game looks gorgeous while still keeping the PS2 look intact (although the cutscene videos are horrible. Too much of a hassle to remake it in full HD, eh?)\n    [*]High replayability. Multiple modes (Normal, Hard, Nightmare), option to play in Catastrophe (hardcore) mode and Time Attack mode (unlocked after beating the game once), where you're clocked in beating each of the bosses available in game.\n    [*]Optional Mega-Boss for the most hardcore players. Seriously, not for the faint-hearted and casual gamers (like me T_T)\n    [*]Full controller support (highly recommended, I used the standard Xbox 360 controller), customization are available in the launcher alongside the graphical option.\n    [*]The story are tied in with the previous Ys series but it doesn't affect gameplay as much.\n[/list]\n\n\n[h1] Neutral\t[/h1]\n\nThis can be either a positive or negative based on each individual's preferences.\n\n[list]\n    [*]The game is surprisingly short (for a JRPG). You can basically finished the whole game in less than 8, maybe 6 hours even if not for the unnecessary grindfest.\n    [*]No stats management whatsoever. Aside from the usual stats upgrade from levelling up, the only way to increase your stats are by accessories and armors found throughout the game.\n    [*]Lack of items variety. Stores are pretty much useless after midgame and the selection of equipments are very limited.\n[/list]\n\n[h1] Cons\t[/h1]\n\n[list]\n    [*]This game is design as a GRINDFEST! If you're planning to play the game, be ready to grind, a lot. Some are just unnecessary too since most of the time your progression is blocked just because your level is not high enough or your swords are not leveled approriately. To make it worse, the game makes you deal 0 damage to the enemies that are stronger than you and you're forced to grind for a while before moving on with the story. On the plus side though, the combat is smooth and not much of a pain if you compared it to the traditional JRPG (I'm looking at you, Final Fantasy)\n    [*]FRUSTRATING and definitely UNNECESSARY Dash Jump mechanic. Basically it's a move where your character can jump a little bit further than the usual jump can get you. However to execute this, you need to press the jump button, followed immediately with an attack. It sounds easy here but trust me, it's EFFING HARD since you'll either successfully Dash Jump or failed and do a short Lunge Attack instead. It's impractical in actual combat and are just needed in certain dungeons to reach a chest. The controller-throwing moments comes when you tried to do a Dash Jump, but failed and you fall downwards and are forced to backtrack a long walk to reach that point again (and of course, failing again).\n    [*]Accessories and event items are MISSABLE if you're careless. I missed out on a few good accessories myself due to the story progression. If you're planning to get all of them, check out a guide beforehand.\n    [*]The map is really small and you'll see most of it in no time. The game also requires you to backtrack a lot for items and story progression. Fortunately, there's an accessory that let's you teleport to any save point in the game (super neat) although you do have to find it first.\n    [*]I experience minor stuttering at certain points of the game but nothing really game breaking. Just thought I'd mention it.\n    [*]HORRIBLE cutscene videos! C'mon, it's 2016 already. You can at least do it in 720p.\n    [*]Anti-climatic final boss.\n[/list]\n\nOverall, this is a really nice and enjoyable action RPG, suitable for casuals and hardcore gamers alike. I myself have not been playing JRPGs in a long while and Ys VI definitely is a good welcome back to the genre. Aside from the minor quirks and questionable game designs, I can safely recommend this to newcomers and veterans of the genre.\n\n[h1]Personally, I gave Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim a solid 4/5. Highly recommended! [/h1]\n\n\nP.S. I'm writing this at 3 a.m. in the morning so please kindly notify me if I made a mistake in grammar or spelling in my review.

And while most of the good stuff that people loved about Felghana and Origin is still there (as it originated there), it does feel like a first attempt.\n\nNapishtim, as Felghana and Origin, is an action jRPG with pretty simple controls but a lot of depth. Also a lot of grind. As always for the series the music is good/great, story is simple, but somehow charming anyway and visuals are nice, despite being quite outdated. There's lots of button mashing, good timing for special attacks, occasional jumping, new items allowing to do new things and see new areas and stuff like that. It's very simple to get into and enjoy.\n\nUnlike later games, Napishtim clearly didn't know how exactly to tackle the new perspective and controls. There are three weapons (as in other two games), yet they feel less varied and important. There are a lot of areas that feel like they are 3d versions of maps from Ys I and II, which is great in it's own way, but sometimes feels too open, too easy to lose track of where you are, hence Felghana and Origin have much tighter and streamlined maps. There are several (optional) horrible jumping puzzles that rely on a semi-hidden skill you can do, something that got refined in next two games. And there's way too much grinding at times with huge unexpected spikes in enemy damage mid area. Felghana and Origin not only did difficulty change better but also added a lot of things to make grind work, especially Origin, where you go into combo, grab healing off dead enemies (which heals you on spot) and things like that. Napishtim works in a more boring classic way and while there's no absolute bs moment like in Ys I, it still feels not as fun as it coul be.\n\nThat said, it's still a fun game to check out.

The original version was released only in Japan, but it got ports for PS2 and PSP which came to the West. I read bad things about the game's performance on the PSP. The PS2 version, on the other hand, has everything polygonal (in PC / PSP all but scenery and important bosses are sprites), which is nice, and voiceovers for the dialogues, which by the little I've heard is not at all nice... Now, over 10 years later, XSEED released a western localization of the PC version on Steam, with some improvements such as support for widescreen.\n\nCompared to the other two games of the series in this generation which I played on Steam, Ys: The Oath in Felghana and Ys: Origins, Napishtim is the one that adopts the most traditional style for a JRPG. Many NPCs, many dialogues, many events, much coming and going, a broader sense of exploration, relatively large inventory with manual item usage, etc.\n\nFelghana then simplified things. It was only one town that was pretty much just a hub between dungeons. Combat and exploration had systems that encouraged advancing quickly and not wasting time. Origins then completely focused on action and was practically a dungeon crawler interspersed with small cutscenes.\n\nReturning to Napishtim, graphically it is exactly equal to Felghana and Origins. featuring polygonal environments which are simple, but clean, having a nice visual style and very well animated sprites for the protagonist, NPCs and enemies. In the dialogues, nice anime-like portraits with a visual style that I really enjoyed. As one might expect from a 2003 game made natively for PC and only slightly improved and updated, it runs smoothly in 4K@60fps in a modern card. The game has a bug in that eventually the sprites will glitch and turn into a lot of geometric shapes flashing on the screen. Fortunately ALT + TAB solves this.\n\nThe sound follows the series' tradition: Excellent. There are two or three songs in the game that really stood out for me, but all of them are at least good and nothing gets irritating.\n\nThe game's story is simple, much along the lines of the series. It has its twists, but nothing that is very impressive or makes you care too much. The central plot is self-contained, but both minor and major events have some connections and references to Ys I and 2 (and therefore Origins, although this was released later), so playing those games before can be helpful to make the most out of it, although this is not necessary. This is not a long journey, but it's noticeable that the staff had a certain dedication and attention to detail, such as the fact that all the dialogues of all NPCs change after every event that advances the main story.\n\nThe way the situations and events elapse and how they fit in the exploration reminded me a bit the first Ys. Except that unlike it where basically half of the game is the final stretch, here when the really important events begin to occur you discover that you are practically at the last boss' door. It's something I've noticed in some other games and is not the kind of pace that suits me.\n\nIt reminded me of the first game also for the fact that some levels are the difference between you being unable to scratch an enemy and it being unable to scratch you. The game controls your progress by gradually reducing the XP enemies give as you level up, but this doesn't mean grinding isn't important: Some situations and bosses are somewhat difficult and both levels as equipment upgrades, which cost a time-consuming to get resource, are important. But the difficulty is somewhat balanced by the fact that you have an inventory with a variety of healing items that stack in groups of up to 9.\n\nI really liked the game and it is very high on my list of favorites in the series, I just don't know exaclty in what position.", "timestamp_created": 1449340935, "timestamp_updated": 1449340994, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19482227": {"recommendationid": "19482227", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042653824", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1578, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470957550}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Solo por su OST ese juego ya merece la pena, y eso no es lo \u00fanico bueno que tiene.\n\nDesarrollado por Falcom en 2003 (Un a\u00f1o antes que Trails in the Sky FC) Ys VI es el primer Ys que usa el gameplay m\u00e1s perfeccionado de la saga, y que fue usado posteriormente en Ys: Oath in Felghana e Ys Origin, hasta entonces el gameplay de esta saga era un poco cuestionable, en parte culpa a la tecnologia del momento.\n\nYs VI no obstante, es amor en estado puro. A pesar de ser un juego muy viejo (2003) ha envejecido maravillosamente, y es definitivamente mi recomendacion para todos aquellos que quieran probar una serie nueva y poco conocida en occidente. Con 3 niveles de dificultad y un modo de juego sin items (Lo que ya da para 6 combinaciones de dificultad distinta) y un Boss Rush con esas mismas condiciones (Lo que lo hace 6 versiones de distinta dificultad) Ys VI tiene una muy alta rejugabilidad y un muy bien punto de entrada a la saga. Y esta es una de esas sagas que quizas no sea muy conocida, pero que merece la pena, Adol es awesome.", "timestamp_created": 1449252531, "timestamp_updated": 1449252531, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19482052": {"recommendationid": "19482052", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134851025", "num_games_owned": 844, "num_reviews": 268, "playtime_forever": 266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515201417}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u633d\u6551\u6cd5\u8001\u7a7a\u7684\u6551\u793e\u5927\u4f5c\uff0c\u6211\u5fc3\u4e2d\u7684\u4f0a\u82cf\u7cfb\u5217\u6e38\u620f\u6027\u7684\u6700\u9ad8\u5cf0\uff08\u8d77\u6e90\u5916\u4f20\u53e6\u7b97\uff09\n\n\u8fd9\u662f\u6211\u73a9\u7684\u6700\u4e45\u7684\u4f0a\u82cf\uff08\u5f53\u7136ylt\u7684\u6563\u88c5\u7248\u2026\u2026\uff09\uff0c\u5f53\u65f6\u9ad8\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u5bb6\u91cc\u6ca1\u7535\u8111\uff0c\u6ca1\u4e8b\u5c31\u88c5\u8fdbU\u76d8\u53bb\u7f51\u5427\u5237Boss Rush\uff0c\u66fe\u7ecf23\u8fd8\u662f24\u79d2\u5e72\u6389\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6765\u7740\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u80af\u5b9a\u6253\u4e0d\u51fa\u4e86= =\n\n\u81ea\u4ece\u8fd1\u85e4\u4e0a\u53f0\u540e\u611f\u89c9\u4f0a\u82cf\u6c34\u51c6\u76f4\u7ebf\u4e0b\u964d\u2026\u2026\u8d77\u6e90\u540e\u7684\u4f0a\u82cf\u7b80\u76f4\u770b\u90fd\u4e0d\u80fd\u770b\u2026\u20267\u90a3\u7cfb\u7edf\u624b\u611f\u4e5f\u592a\u89c1\u4e0d\u5f97\u4eba\u4e86\u2026\u20266\u7cfb\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8fd9\u4e09\u4f5c\uff086\uff0cF \uff0cO\uff09\u7684\u8fd9\u79cd\u6613\u64cd\u4f5c\u96be\u7cbe\u901a\u57287\u8ddf\u6811\u6d77\u4ee5\u53ca\u672a\u6765\u76848\uff08\u524d\u5e74\u8fd8\u662f\u53bb\u5e74\u7684PV\u4e00\u770b\u5c31\u77e5\u9053\uff09\u91cc\u8361\u7136\u65e0\u5b58\n\n\u4e2a\u4eba\u8fd8\u662f\u559c\u6b22\u8fd9\u79cd\u8fd1\u4e4e\u52a8\u4f5c\u6e38\u620f\u7684ARPG\uff0c\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u597d\u4e0a\u624b\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u52a8\u4f5c\u5143\u7d20\u6ee1\u70b9\uff0c\u523a\u6fc0\uff0c\u770b\u770b7\u5f00\u59cb\u7684\u2026\u2026\u7b80\u76f4\u90fd\u5feb\u53d8\u6210RPG\u4e86\u2026\u2026\u867d\u7136\u6211\u8fd8\u633a\u559c\u6b227\u7684\u4eba\u8bbe\u5267\u60c5\u5565\u7684\n\n\u5410\u69fd\u5230\u6b64\u4e3a\u6b62\uff0c\u5965\u9732\u54c8\u6211\u5bb6\u7684\uff0c\u63d0\u96c5\u4e5f\u662f\u6211\u5bb6\u7684\uff0c\u5c0f\u4f0a\u548c\u739b\u96c5\u7ed9\u4f60\u4eec\u597d\u4e86~\u54e6\u5bf9\u4e86\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u4f0a\u82cf8\u4e5f\u53d1\u552e\u4e86\uff0c\u8fbe\u5a1c\u4e5f\u662f\u6211\u7684", "timestamp_created": 1449252069, "timestamp_updated": 1473618842, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.462432", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19404392": {"recommendationid": "19404392", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040168557", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 942, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449113693}, "language": "english", "review": "Good:\n- The 3 different swords are quite fun to play around with\n- Music is pretty good\n- The last level of the game is pretty awesome to play\n- Core mechanics are solid\n- Challenging gameplay - more or less fair\n- Warping between save points + nonexistent load times make it superior to the PSP port\n- Has a great cast of characters, comparable to Ys 7's cast\n\nBad:\n- Balancing issues\n- Limestone Cave\n- Poor enemy design - too many with the ability to stun lock you to death if they touch you\n- Limestone Cave\n- Dash jumping can be seriously annoying to do\n- Alma's Trials were removed\n- LIMESTONE CAVE\n- Game length is padded because you'll need to grind, but the actual game is fairly short\n- No real replayability aside from boss rush mode... but that's it\n- Catastrophe mode is kind of unnecessary\n\nIt's better than the PSP port, but inferior to the PS2 version.

But it could be worse, and the grinding is only -really- bad at the very end of the game, where you *need* to get one of your swords to max level to do anything more than chip damage to the final set of bosses, which requires 100,000 emel. You get that much, but you probably need to spend it on your armor first, so you still need to get 100,000 by grinding in the final screens.\n\nThat aside, it's still an enjoyable game and a good remake of another installment in the Ys franchise. A single run on Normal that missed only a few items but saw the majority of the content took me 10 hours - so you might want to wait for it to go on sale first unless you intend to replay it.

The first game was [i]Ys I: Ancient Ys Vanished[/i] in 1987, and since then numerous titles have been released, and some remade a few times for other consoles and handhelds. They are still being developed to this day, with a new title having been recently announced for the Playstation 4 and Vita.\n\nThe Ys series chronicles the adventures of Adol Christin, a young man with a zest for adventure and an uncanny knack for being in the right place at the right time. Currently we only have 4 Ys titles on Steam, with Ark of Napishtim being the 6th installment. First released for PC back in 2003, it was later ported to the Playstation 2 in 2005, and the PSP in 2006. Ark of Napishtim was the first English release of the series since Ys III: Wanderers of Ys. An English translation of the original PC version was released here on Steam on April 28th of 2015m with some enhancements and added features. The Steam release is hands-down the definitive version of Ark of Napishtim.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\n==========\nArk of Napishtim is a hack and slash action RPG with some light platforming elements. Controlling Adol Christin, players are able to freely move around the world, jump, and attack enemies. The game takes place on the Canaan Islands, after an attack on Adol's ship forced him to sail into an unknown region and into a large storm. This resulted in Adol being thrown off his ship and washing ashore in a new mysterious land.\n\nProgression is story and exploration driven. As you explore each new area, bits of story are revealed through dialogue and events. You will also find treasure hidden all over, some of them granting new abilities or allowing you to explore areas you were previously unable to. Pieces of equipment, as well as healing items and accessories, are also hidden in treasure chests. To save your game you need to find a Spirit Monument. Touching one will completely heal you and cure any status ailments. Typically great areas to grind EXP and gold are the areas near Spirit Monuments.\n\nAdol will eventually have access to three different swords with magical properties, each based on a particular element: Fire, Wind, or Thunder. These can be upgraded over the course of the game using Emelas Ore, which is dropped by enemies in small amounts. Upgrading your swords unlocks new traits for them, such as increasing their attack power, unlocking special elemental magic, or increasing magic regeneration. Upgrading your swords is the best way to strengthen Adol against the challenges he faces, so make it a point to collect as much Emelas Ore as you can.\n\nOne of the best things about Ys titles are the boss battles. Every boss is a screen-filling affair, requiring careful movement and precise strikes to bring down. The boss battles are easily the most exciting parts of the game.\n\nOne of the new features added to the Steam release of this title is Catastrophe Mode, which means you will not be able to stock up and use healing items freely. The game will play more like Ys Origin or Oath in Felghana, with healing items being used automatically when you pick them up! Couple this with Nightmare difficulty and you have one [i]hell[/i] of a challenge ahead of you.\n\nThe other new feature is the inclusion of a special item called the Wing of Alma. This enables you to warp between all found Spirit Monuments. This saves you SO much time it's unreal. In older releases you would literally had to backtrack through many areas, using the Wing of Alma you simply select the Spirit Monument and you're off! \n\n[b]Graphics[/b]\n==========\nArk of Napishtim got a slight upgrade in it's looks department. Utilizing DirectX8, the game looks much better than it's previously releases. Smooth animations all around, from Adol, enemies, and even bosses. Every sprite is very sharp, well designed, and highly detailed. Perhaps the best thing about the game are the environments. The land, water, the skies, dark caves, and ancient ruins all look fantastic.\n\n[b]Sound and Music[/b]\n==========\nYs is known for its musical scores, and Ark of Napishtim is no exception. Every track is amazing. From the boss theme to each different area's own theme, the music is really second to none. I wish there were soundtrack editions here on Steam for us to buy, as I would buy every single one. Physical collector's edition Ys releases usually come with a soundtrack disc, so I don't see a reason why Steam users can't have a similar option available.\n\nAs for sound effects, you have your usual Ys sounds. Attacks, footsteps, monsters...all have viable sound effects. They sound great, especially swinging the different swords and using the elemental magic.\n\n[b]Performance[/b]\n==========\nPerfect 60 FPS all across the board. No lag, stuttering, slowdown, framerate drops, or random crashes. The game literally ran without a single hitch. Flawless.\n\nArk of Napishtim has full controller support, and is the recommended way to play the game. My only gripe is with one of the 'hidden' abilities: Dash Jump. To do it, you have to move in a direction and press the jump and attack buttons at the exact same time. I am able to do it properly maybe 40% of the time, and never when I need to. There is a guide available that uses a script to make it a lot easier, but I have yet to try it as I prefer to try and master the technique myself.\n\n[b]Final Thoughts[/b]\n==========\nA fantastic re-release of a fantastic game, Ark of Napishtim is a fun and exciting action RPG that fans of the genre will love. If you have not played a Ys title before, you owe it to yourself to buy Ark and all the other titles on Steam. If nothing else it'll show Nihon Falcom and XSEED Games that we want more Ys on available here on Steam! \n\n[b]Gameplay Demo[/b]\n==========\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSNo-LVqbwE\n\n[b]Nerd House Verdict[/b]:\n==========\n[h1][b]Highly Recommended[/b][/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1440176849, "timestamp_updated": 1485058090, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 86, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.838902", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17511441": {"recommendationid": "17511441", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045736729", "num_games_owned": 275, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4546, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511421329}, "language": "english", "review": "It's okay, I guess.", "timestamp_created": 1439416673, "timestamp_updated": 1439416673, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17497130": {"recommendationid": "17497130", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001916591", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1074, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1516222698}, "language": "english", "review": "Having played the other Ys installments and this game being the foundation for Origin and The Oath in Felghana, The Ark of Napishtim came as a godsend. After the dark ages resulting from Kefin: The Lost City of Sand, Falcom went to make another installment to restore their reputation, and they came back in a fiery way.\n\nThe story is actually okay, but not really the main focus. The story mostly consists of a traveler, Adol Christin, finding himself washed up in an island surrounded by a Vortex, and having to solve the mystery of the island's ills. Along the way, he comes across legends, the history and mysteries of the island, and eventually becoming a sole hope against events manipulated behind the scenes...\n\nCombat consists of fast-paced sword fights, and the boss fights provide plenty of challenge. One consideration of difficulty however, is that most boss fights become more a war of attrition. For those who thought the game STILL was not difficult, the option exists to play Catastrophe Mode, which removes the stockpiling of recovery items. And like the other games, grinding is prevalent, which may be a turnoff, but is very necessary to advance through the game. Expect to spend a lot more minutes or hours just to get that one level or sword upgrade just to give you an edge in boss fights.\n\nThe music, as always, is the selling point of Ys, and it does not disappoint. \n\nFor those of you who like great video game music: [i]go get this game[/i].

Napishtim is not a bad game, but it's let down by flaws that the later two would fix.\n\nCombat in all 3 is fast and furious, almost like pinball in a way, as you plough into creatures and mow them down left and right; Unlike the original Ys, you manually control your own sword here, and a pad with autofire will be a blessing to cut down on repetitive strain as you hammer away. The speed of the game remains high throughout, even during some rudimentary but fun platforming, and the bosses as always are closer to a bullet hell shoot 'em up than a platformer.\n\nThe first problem though is that the plot is not tight enough to guide you from boss to boss, and you'll spend enormous amounts of time getting lost without resorting to a walkthrough; this is not the fault of the localisation, which Xseed have performed to a high quality as always, but simply because the game follows it's old 8 bit ancestors in having little room for text in game, and plot specific way points that could be anywhere within the dungeons you've already cleared.\n\nThis leads to the second problem in that items are scattered about in some quite obscure places, which on the higher difficulties (my first play through was on Hard) will prove vital; in particular it's possible to miss one extremely useful item by accidentally advancing the plot onwards, where as others are hidden in what you might take to be just background images.\n\nAnd then there is the spawn of the devil known as Dash Jump: To activate this you need to move in one direction, stop, then simultaneously move that direction again whilst pressing both attack and jump at the same time. Maybe it's my old man reactions now, but I never once managed to pull this off manually, and resorted to a Hotkey macro to automate it. And some of the items you desperately need require this to be done multiple times. Later games would drop this entirely and replace it's usefulness with other magical powers, but here you need it, and it's enfuriating.\n\nHaving said all of that, the game is still fun, and I would recommend it to anyone who loved the first or last Ys games.

It's here, it's finally here. Well, it's been here for a few months now, but still - WE GOT YS: THE ARK OF NAPISHTIM!\n\nSee, when I first found this game (and this was the one that got me into the series), I was immediately hooked on it. I played it on Ps2, loved it and kept playing it on newer saves, harder difficulties. It's such an awesomely fun game. Years later, when I first joined Steam, I came across a sale of Ys games. I was overjoyed... until I found out this game wasn't in the library. So I played some of the others, enjoyed them some, but nothing compared to this game. So when I saw I could finally buy it, I pre-purchased it. And the day it went live, I played the hell outta it. A few months later, I decided to write this review on it, because I'm kinda lazy like that.\n\nSo, in Ys: The Ark of Napishtim, you play as Adol the Red, a renown swordsman who saves his crew from a terrible seastorm, only to be thrown off and swept to the sea, washing ashore on a beach where he is found and rescued by 2 young women from the Rehdan clan. You learn about them and their turmoil with humans who live on the other side of the island, you do some adventuring, some exploring, lots of killing and even more dungeon-delving.\n\nYs is a platforming action-RPG, in the simplest terms. It's got a serviceable story (clearly dated, but still fun), the graphics here are dated as well, but it's ripe with nostalgia for Ys fans. And if you're new to the series or wondering what this game is about, my advice is to just buy the damn game, if you're into similar games (Legend of Zelda comes to mind, though it's nowhere near as expansive.)\n\nI got about 12 hours in my storyline, but I did a lot of backtracking, a lot of grinding and you will, too. Understand that, towards the end, you WILL want to grind up and get yourself ready for some epic boss fights. The game has some really good ones that will make you use all your skills and sweet moves, like Dash Jump and Magic Charge! \n\nMan, I can't get enough of this game. I think it's time I start another New Game and jump right back into this one! DEFINITELY RECOMMEND! (though, I'm not 100% sure what the hell the DLC is I have in this game).\n\nI'll be fair and say there are some cons to this game. Sometimes, enemies can be very cheap. Sometimes, what to do next isn't 100% clear. But those things don't detract from the core fun of the game. If you're never sure what to do, explore - you'll figure it out :)\n\nGET THIS GAME!", "timestamp_created": 1436968111, "timestamp_updated": 1436968111, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481928", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17012309": {"recommendationid": "17012309", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002007692", "num_games_owned": 2627, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 427, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1436991696}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \ud15c \uba39\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c \uae4a\uc740 \ube61\uce68\uc744 \uac01\uc624\ud558\uace0 \ub300\uc26c\uc810\ud504 \uc5f0\ub9c8\ub97c \uc774\uc545\ubb3c\uace0 \ud55c \uae30\uc5b5\uc774 \uc0c8\ub85d\uc0c8\ub85d \ub09c\ub2e4.\n\uc774\uc2a4\uc758 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801 \ud32c\uc774\ub77c\uba74 \ub9dd\uc124\uc77c \uc774\uc720\uac00 \uc5c6\ub2e4, \ud55c\ud328\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc788\ub294\ub514", "timestamp_created": 1436718413, "timestamp_updated": 1436718413, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476403", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17010517": {"recommendationid": "17010517", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135282170", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 929, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1436835946}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "", "timestamp_created": 1436711759, "timestamp_updated": 1436711759, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16982276": {"recommendationid": "16982276", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025980821", "num_games_owned": 392, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 1204, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1436688073}, "language": "english", "review": "Previously available on PS2(2005) and PSP(2006) in western shores, it is finally available for pc (Steam & GOG) for our enjoyment.

The music's entertaining, memorable, and motivational. What separates this one from the others on steam is that Adol has the ability to jump. It's mainly used for combat, with the downward thrust move being a very common requirement to kill certain enemies. Adol also gets a number of other moves, including a triple combo, sword-specific attacks, an upward whirlwind attack, and a somewhat difficult to execute lunge attack. Top it off with sword-specific magic spells and you have a huge upgrade from previous Ys titles.\n\nThe storyline is also pretty strong -- it's not as story rich as Nihon Falcom's The Legend of Heroes franchise, but there's a lot more going on as you unravel the mystery of the archipelago you're trapped on. As is common with Ys games, there are few towns and overall few people, but more emphasis on individual character. Even throwaway NPCs have unique avatars and behaviors, and regularly have something new to say. It's one of those RPGs you may find yourself running around talking to everyone (even twice) after completing a dungeon.\n\nLike other Nihon Falcom games, you get so many save slots that you probably won't need them all. So you're free to save before pretty much every gameplay or story moment and revisit it at any time. More games should be doing this.\n\nMy complaints about this game are really minor. Like a lot of these ports, there are occasional graphical glitches on the edges for widescreen users. (which is almost everyone as of 2015) The lunge attack is infamously hard to execute, which is only an issue since it's attached to a long jump which is used to get certain treasures. Finally, I twice got a glitch where the sprites and/or particle effects would just go crazy and had to restart...but haven't had any crashes yet. Both glitches happened when entering a new area and fortunately a save point was nearby and usable. Xseed has had a good track record with stability with all their ports, so this is only a minor blemish.\n\nGo ahead and pick up this one.

Ys VI was actually quite enjoyable. I'd say my only complaint is that it was actually pretty short. Admittedly it got even shorter due to an improved warp fuction included in this version.\n\n[b][u]Gameplay[/u][/b]\nIf you played Felghana, you'll be very used to this overall, including the pacing of the story. The combat is also pretty much the same idea; in this particular game though, you have different swords that you switch between. Don't be intimidated by the thought of some swords working where others don't. They're all effective (on Normal difficulty at least), but have different levels of strength. Where they're different is how you swing them, their innate ability (once unlocked), and their magic (the first upgrade for each sword).\n\nBosses aren't so bad (again, if on Normal).  If you're rushing through the game, you'll run into the problem of being underleveled. In other games this might only be a minor setback with some strategy. In Ys games, especially this one the game, even on Normal, is going to pretty much force you to grind. While I can't remember my exact level at the time, I can tell you that it was low to the point where I did zero damage to the second boss in the game. Only occasional criticals would even damage him, and those were for very little damage. Loaded the file again, went back and leveled up four or five times, upgraded my swords in the process, then challenged the second boss again. I could damage him for more than I was critting for previously when I did zero damage.\n\nTravelling is bearable now. In the original, there was a ton of backtracking by comparison. The map seems pretty big at first, but once you near the end of the game, you really notice just how tiny it is. Similar to Felghana, but I think even that was bigger than this.\n\nControls are okay. If you're using a controller, it might take some time to get used to. You can change the bindings, but only in the configuration outside of the game.\n\n[b][u]Characters[/u][/b]\nThey're okay. Just like in Felghana you have these do-nothing characters everywhere in towns you should ignore. There's always a few of these NPCs capable of rewarding you under certain conditions. As far as truly notable or important characters go, there are a couple you'll likely not recognize unless you're a fan or well informed. If you've been playing every Ys game that has been localized, you'll be fine. You'll only really end up wondering who the unfamiliar characters are that Adol seems to know, but you can figure out when they met, since it's just filling in the blank.\n\nThe truly important characters don't seem important enough in the big picture. Probably the most important character you'll meet early on and by the end you'll come to realize how little they even do. Meanwhile the other characters, even ones that could be considered minor, practically drive the plot. Yeah, it's a good thing when you think about it. But after taking in everything you notice how insignificant they were by comparison. Even a character I'm certain is the third or fourth most important character in the game is brushed off to the side. He only ever provides one important bit to the story and the rest of his appearances except maybe one other scene are literally unimportant. I could go on and on, but I'm sure you get it. For me personally, this was the weakest part of the game.\n\n[b][u]Music[/u][/b]\nPeople actually love these games for the music. Really most games made by Falcom anyway. I'll tell you right now that the music in this game is not the greatest. I'm sure people will disagree with me, but I feel there's only two themes in the game that're great. [i]Ultramarine Deep[/i], which is pretty short-lived and the one most everyone can agree on, [i]Ernst[/i]. The rest of the tracks are very underwhelming. Memorable, but most are underwhelming. I can compliment the fact that the tunes really match the environment they're played in. That's probably the greatest strength of the soundtrack in this game.\n\n[b][u]Overall[/u][/b]\nI feel this game is still pretty good considering when it was originally made. If it has any real shortcoming it's probably the short length of time needed to beat it. Hardcore players craving difficulty will probably like the harder difficulties you can play on, including a feature that makes the game feel closer to Ys Origin.

Ys VI grabbed the Zelda-esque gameplay from the Japan-exclusive Ys V, and made it 3D, and improved it in many ways. \n\nVisually, Ys VI uses a strange Donkey Kong Country-esque rendering style for the character sprites, which hasn't aged that well, in all honesty. Unlike the PS2 version, which used polygons for the characters, the PC version of Ys VI doesn't, nor does it reflect equipment changes on Adol's model, which is unfortunate, but easily ignored. \n\nThe music is the usual high quality, catchy, upbeat tracks that Falcom is known for, with a fair amount of stand out tracks. Sound effects are what you'd expect, sword swipes, monster growls. The PS2 version's voice acting is not in this version, for better or for worse.\n\nAs stated earlier, Ys VI uses the Zelda-like action style from Ys V, unlike Ys I, II, and IV. Much like 'regular' action games, you have buttons for attacking, with a combo depending on which of three swords you have equipped, a jump button, your 'magic' button, and an item use button. The item use button stands out here, as the ability to stockpile and use items wasn't in the other two Ys games of this style, Oath in Felghana or Origins. This, with the right amount of health items, makes Ys VI rather easy, if you choose to use the items. But you don't have to! XSeed added in a brand new 'catastrophe' mode, that removes the ability to stockpile or buy healing items, instead making them instant-use when you pick them up on the field. Instead of health items, a store will now sell permanent stat-growth seeds. This, obviously, radically changes the game. Also new to this PC version is the ability to fast travel between save points, which is very welcome.\n\nThe story is more or less what you'd expect from an Ys title.

I'd never imported anything like that before, but that's how exciting I considered this evolution of the franchise to be, and based on experience I knew that it would never see our shores in any official capacity.\n\nHowever, I was wrong, and was delighted to see eventual releases on both the PSP and the PS2. \n\nNeither of those versions were pure, though -- the PSP had dramatically down-sampled textures and really long load times between scenes, while the PS2 version swapped out all the in-game character sprites for 3D models that didn't convey the charm of the 2.5D original. I had an \"I'll take what I can get attitude,\" and was still grateful.\n\nBut to see a fully translated official port released on Steam is a real dream-come-true for me. I couldn't be more excited to play my old favorite, and this release does not let me down -- it's the perfect balance; all the original content is here, and none of the art is lost, but it sure does look cool on today's higher-resolution screens.\n\nAt the same time, the game is now considered \"low spec\" enough that it would run gorgeously even on a Windows netbook.

Its not bad looking, but it could look better.\n\n- Content: I would say it does not have as much as Oath or Origins, but it has enough to satisfy you and give you some hours worth of entertainment.\n\n- The story itself isn't too bad as it will pull you in and keep you interested, much like the other Ys titles. \n\nThe one thing I really wish this game was Alma's Trials as those dungeons were fun and it did help with the level grinding, especially after level 50. I am glad, however, we were spared the awful voice acting of the PS2 version, lol. \n\nAll in all, this game is a pretty good game. Ys 6 got me into the series when I played it on the PS2.

It doesn't have the Alma Trials from the PS2 release but the warpable save points go much further in making the game more enjoyable to play.\n\nThat said, Ys VI certainly shows its age as the first 3D Ys game, as Oath and Origins improve on basically everything that Ys VI tried to do; not that Ys VI is a bad game, but it has some clear flaws.  One of those was a lot of backtracking that is made moot in this version with the introduction of an item that you get about two hours into the game that lets you warp to all previously visited save points.  This removes a lot of unnecessary frustration and backtracking.\n\nSome other problems include really weird level/enemy scaling.  Ys games have always been level dependent, but Ys VI takes into another level, as most areas will have enemies that can easily wreck you at first, but after a couple of levels, you'll be wrecking them.  It's a super-fast turnaround with little subtlety. In my playthough of this, I reached the second boss on like level 14 or something with a level two sword and literally couldn't damage it.  The game's action is fast-paced and fluid, and you level up quickly if you're considered underleveled, but you fucked up the level scaling somewhere when this kind of thing can happen. Bosses are rather uninspired compared to the other Ark trilogy games, and Limewater Cave is probably the worst dungeon in a Ys game.  Dash-jumping also is a pain that was abandoned after this game.\n\nOnto the positives, even though the gameplay is a bit behind Oath and Origins, it's still fast-paced and has a good feel.  Most of the gameplay is just jumping around and hitting shit with your sword and is relatively simple but it's satisfying beyond the sum of its parts.  Adol moves fast, swings his sword fast and it just feels right.  \n\nIt's a Falcom Sound Team jdk soundtrack so you know it rules, though it's one of the more unmemorable ones.  The story and characters are generic, typical Ys fare.\n\nThis review comes off as sort of negative, but I mainly want to highlight Ys VI being the predecessor to Oath and Origins and that you should adjust your expectations accordingly.  If you have only played the Ys games on Steam, go into this knowing that it's the foundation the next two games improved on in every way.\n\nIn short, a fast-paced, flawed action game that XSeed did a great job handling and worth a look if you have any interest in action games or other Ys titles.", "timestamp_created": 1431573858, "timestamp_updated": 1468629590, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.698518", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15800359": {"recommendationid": "15800359", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010177568", "num_games_owned": 654, "num_reviews": 169, "playtime_forever": 809, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431395349}, "language": "english", "review": "Yet another shore to wash up on, yet another maiden to rescue, yet another dark god to kill, yet another Ys game.

Ys is known for its fast paced action and challenging battles, and while this game has those, it is hindered by some poor design choices that aren't found in the other entries in the series. \n\nOne of the biggest issues is the need to grind. In a fast paced action RPG, the quickest way to kill the pace of the game is to force the player to run through the same area repeatedly to gain levels, gold, or crafting material. Unfortunately on the higher difficulties you will have to grind before basically every boss if you wish to do any significant damage and not die in two to three hits. Despite the need to grind, the bosses are actually some of the easiest in the series and their only real challenge lies in the massive damage from grazed attacks if you are not properly leveled. The game also features a weapon leveling system that requires an insane amount of resources in order to max them out. To raise a weapon to level 10 it requires around 6,000 emel (the game's weapon-enhancing resource), and to raise it to 11 (the max level) the required amount jumps up to 500,000 per weapon. Grinding out that amount of resources literally takes more time than the entire rest of the game.\n\nThe other big problem with the game is the terrible requirements to get some of the side items. In Oath in Felghana and Ys Origin everything was fairly easy to get or forgiving enough for you to go back if you missed something. That is not the case in Napishtim. Many of the strongest accessories are either extremely easily missable without a walkthrough or require ridiculously precise trial-and-error \"dash-jumps\" in order to reach. I never imagined that I would spend more than 10 minutes in an Ys game just trying to make a single jump, but if that's what you're into, Napishtim is the game for you.\n\nDespite these major annoyances that no other game in the series suffers from, Napishtim is still a decent game. It has a lovable cast of characters, an interesting world with NPCs that do and say new things after every story event, and a good soundtrack. The gameplay that makes Felghana and Origin so great is mostly here, albeit in a more infantile state.

YAY! Thank you Xseed and Falcom. \n\nThis game is like Oath In Felghana only toned down due to it being released prior. It was a stepping stone to OIF. However I find the areas of exploration more appealing than OIF as well as the story. Although a very short game, its extremely fun and addictive just as all Ys games are. The only thing missing that would have improved the PC version would be Alma's trials which are found in the PS2 version and also the voice acting but Im sure Konami has all the rights to that so it is minor.\n\nAnd I must say the only gripe I have with Falcom is that they have made a fantastic series over the years, but on TOO MANY PLATFORMS. They are finally stepping in the right direction by putting ALL of their current and re-released games on one platform - Steam. All that is MISSING to complete our collection now is Ys 7 and Ys: Memories of Celceta. Ys 7 is on PC I believe in China. Xseed please release this on Steam. And who knows about Celceta?!?!?  I have a PSTV stricktly to play Ys Memories of Celceta but it is NOT compatible with PSTV. How VERY disappointing. And Im not going out and buying a PSVita just for this!\n\nListen to us Xseed and Falcom!

Keep reading.\n\nMost of what's written here in the reviews is on-point: Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim is a fast-paced action RPG that stars Adol Christin, an absolute spaz who leaps into dangerous situations with no regard for his safety - as if he knows he's in a video game - while going on adventures, not minding his own business, and killing everything in an excessively violent fashion...typically to guitar-driven up-tempo rock.\n\nThis is the basic formula of most Ys games, and it's the formula of Ark, although playing it in 2015 might feel a little dated (the game was originally released in 2003; we've had it on the PS2 for a long time, but this is the first PC version in English). The core gameplay is good, with difficult bosses (although not as difficult as other Ys games), and intense dungeons (which are much more difficult than other Ys games).\n\nBut, everything I could say about the game has been said here in the other user reviews (other than no one talking about how non-existent the plot is, even for the usually-threadbare stories of the Ys series). I wanted to write this review for one reason:\n\nI'm of the opinion that, if you already own the PS2 version, you can pretty much ignore this version. Buy this version if you really want a PC version, or if you're a huge fan of the series and want all the art materials that come with the game for free. If you're very, very into the Ys series, this art is super-cool. But, if what interests you is the game, the PS2 version is superior and has existed for years. If you're really looking for the best version, that's gonna be the one.\n\nOther than the expanded available resolutions and the additional art, the two main gameplay additions that make this version unique are:\n\n1. \"Warp Mode\" - An item in the game, the \"Wing of Alma\", which used to warp you out of a dungeon, now allows you to warp between save points. This is a great idea - Ark is a fun game, but it's a bit antiquated, and one of the ways that this shines through is in its insistence on having you backtrack across the entire map of the game, and then back again, and then back. Over, and over again. This change is a good idea, and makes the game less frustrating.\n\n...If you find it. The Wing of Alma is an item that can be missed. I should know; I missed it when playing through the game this time around. This is slightly peculiar, because when I reached the last dungeon of the game and looked up why I still couldn't warp anywhere, I recognized the item, and I knew I had gotten it the last time I played through the game. I specifically remember a time I was forced to use it once, because there are actually ways (albeit very few) to get Adol stuck in mid-air, with your only options being to restart the game from your last save, or use the Wing of Alma to escape.\n\nIn any case, what I'm getting at is, this new feature that's meant to help \"modernize\" the game can be missed entirely. This is peculiar to me, especially thanks to the new \"Catastrophe Mode\" (more on that in a minute), which demonstrates that the localization team is able to control which items appear in chests, and which items you recieve from NPCs at different parts of the story. It's baffling to me that getting this item in your inventory isn't somehow mandatory.\n\n2. \"Catastrophe Mode\" - After choosing the difficulty level of your game, players are asked to choose between \"Standard Mode\" and \"Catastrophe Mode\". Standard Mode mimicks the gameplay of the original Ark of Napishtim; treasure chests around the game contain a myriad of items - mostly healing items and items that cure status ailments - of which you can stock up to nine. \"Catastrophe Mode\" attempts to emulate the games that followed Ark of Napishtim - Oath in Felghana and Ys Origins - by giving players no stockable healing items, and making items that restore HP or cure status ailments drop randomly off enemies. If you touch the item, it's automatically used, and that's a wrap.\n\nThis sounds pretty cool, but what specifically was intriguing about Oath in Felghana and Ys Origins were the \"buff\" items that dropped off enemies: pick up a blue potion, and your defense is raised temporarily, either until the timer runs out, or until you grab another blue potions (or red for strength, and a few other colors for different stats). Every enemy you kill slightly raises the experience you gain from the next enemy, stackable up to double experience. This encourages players to continuously fight.\n\nI'm not saying that I can't understand or sympathize with why all of these features weren't added - that's likely a staggering amount of work to incorporate those things which weren't even in the game to begin with, and perhaps not even possible. But, the fact remains that these additions aren't in the new Catastrophe Mode. So, Catastrophe Mode essentially becomes \"no items\" mode, or maybe \"use any healing items you get immediately\" mode. You can emulate Catastrophe Mode in any version of Ark of Napishtim by simply doing exactly that: every time you come across a healing item, use it immediately. Or, just don't using any healing items during a boss fight. It's not a feature worth buying an entire game over, especially when you can DIY the concept...and, if you're the type of gamer that Ys appears to be branded towards (gamers who think of themselves are \"hardcore\" who want everything to be as hard as possible), then you probably already HAVE played Ark without using healing items, just to demonstrate to yourself that you could do it.\n\nThus, my verdict is: If you can't get this game on PS2, this is a great opportunity for you. If you CAN, or if you already do...stick to the version with the optional dungeon content. Stick to the version with has voice acting. Stick to the version with cool new cutscenes, especially the intro cutscene that makes the beginning of the game so much less confusing, since establishes the beginning plot of the game without you having to read it somewhere. Get the PS2 version.\n\nEDIT: I removed a statement which was shown to be incorrect - whoops.", "timestamp_created": 1430380387, "timestamp_updated": 1430586349, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.282682", "comment_count": "19", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15617849": {"recommendationid": "15617849", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998163088", "num_games_owned": 245, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1245, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432303153}, "language": "english", "review": "If you're new to the Ys franchise, Ys Ark of Napishtim is a beginner friendly title that will introduce you to mechanics later used in both Origin and Oath of Felghana, two other Ys games currently available on Steam. While the story is mostly standalone, a few characters from previous titles return, some playing major roles. If you a stickler for being in the know, it would be best to play the earlier titles first.\n\nFor returning fans from Origin and Oath of Felghana, there's a few differences you'll probably notice immediately. Adol is slower, no mobile techs beyond a lunge jump(which the game expects you to learn, and has precise platforming involving it), and magic is now tied to one of 3 weapons all separately upgradable. Most enemies, however, are also slower so you're not at a disadvantage. The game has two modes, one where you can buy and slot healing items to use, and a new mode that disables it altogether. Remember how in Oath or Origin, monsters would sometimes drop herbs you would immediately use? The new mode, catastrophe mode, works just like that.\n\nTo those of you who are challenge crazy, 6's Nightmare is probably the easiest currently available of Ys on steam. It certainly isn't EASY, but you won't make as much sweat as Oath of Felghana Produced. Platforming, however, is definitely the hardest. As mentioned before, some jumps you have to make are extremely precise. Game isn't the best at these sections, so you might have a headache trying to get certain items. Will, honestly.\n\nGreat Music. Same great gameplay. Runs like a dream. No bugs to report as of yet, and currently sitting on 18 hours of play. Delightfully straight forward story, that plays out exactly like you expect yet manages to engross you due to excellent world building. Keyboard and Mouse controls work great. So does controller support. Probably the definite version of 6 as it stands. For those wondering, this version of Ark of Napishtim does not include the PS2 version's content. So no hilariously bad \"I'm Dogi the wall crusher! Want your walls crushed?\" for you. The line is still in, actually, but not voiced.\n\nAll in all great game, highly recommend.

Thank you Xseed for releasing it post konami licensing!\n\nOne of the few great gems on the PSP originally ported from various other systems that still kept its charm as one of my most favorite action adventure, dungeon crawling, hack and slash games of all time! For those coming from the PSP/Vita era who missed out on this or Oath in Felghana, it retains a jump system that further expands combat past the simple slash-slash-dodge-special attack-swap party members-repeat system, given you take control of solely Adol himself.\n\nThis game's deep exploration makes it one for many secrets and vague linearity to plot progress. Yes, I still get lost sometimes taking that left fork instead. Each area contains various monsters of certain levels which are a challenge if not impossible for Adol in his level infancy. This is what shapes the game's level system. The combat is a fun grind for money and EXP to move up the ladder.\n\nCombat is developed with a 3D aspect in mind. Given, Adol wields a sword and shield, where damage is avoided if certain enemies attack on the shield side. Not only is there a good amount of items and equipment to procure throughout the journey, there are also combat mechanisms that more modern remakes of Ys games lack. The jump system. This deepens the exploration of the game with more platforming than guessing which tunnel is the wrong path and backtracking. It also welcomes a jump attack and dropping attack mechanism that helps in combat with a variety of damage dealing maneuvers. Combat aside, this game revolves Adol's journey of collecting magical swords, each with it's own element and moveset. This is the core combat mechanism of The Ark of Napishtim.\n\nFollowing Adol's journey in searching for these swords, he meets very memorable characters. Some of which people in the latter games on the PSP and Vita are simply left to accept that they exist. Have you ever wondered who Geis is and how he met Adol? He was never always allied with Adol. This is the game to play. (Another shout out to origin stories is for The Oath in Felghana, where it describes Adol's meeting of Dogi from Dogi's friends' perspectives as well as his iconic blue scarf).\n\nOther than a solid story of our amnesiac red head adventurer and his combat prowess this game features a memorable soundtrack and nostalgic pseudo-modern pixel art and beautiful portraits of characters to keep the game attractive.\n\nXseed has finally ported this to PC with much appreciated features like teleporting between Save Points (obviously to prevent people like me to still get lost in this vast world! LOL)\n\nFinal note to new player of this game, save before the last area on another slot! Once you've entered the Ark, theres literally no turning back and once the game ends they dont take you back, so you'd be stuck in that final area in that save state. Xseed probably fixed this with the save point warping, but just a heads up just in case you still want to mess around in the overworld. :)\n\nMost of all ENJOY THE GAME!\n\nRecommended others within the genre: Ys franchise (Felghana, Origins, I and II are on steam!), Gurumin a monstrous adventure is another great game by Falcom, and Legend of Heroes franchise for the JRPG enthusiasts (currently one one is ported to Steam that I've seen).\n\n-TNHu: Sylphrit D.", "timestamp_created": 1430253063, "timestamp_updated": 1430253063, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.715416", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15601822": {"recommendationid": "15601822", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994220793", "num_games_owned": 353, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 489, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1430615054}, "language": "english", "review": "An ancient evil computer awakens, and it's up to Adol to hit it until it dies with his trusty swords of plot magic. You join Adol on another exciting adventure as he washes ashore the Canaan Islands within a fictional equivalent of the Bermuda Triangle after his survives yet another shipwreck, as expected of Ys openings. \nYs VI the Ark of Napishtim is the first Ys game of this engine; Oath in Felghana and Origin are the sequels that came after it, despite Felghana taking place chronologically before VI and Origin taking place hundreds of years before Ys I&II. Because this is the first game of this engine, you might feel that the gameplay is less refined than its two sequels of the same battle system. Even if Ys VI is the first game of this engine, the combat is still satisfying with its three elemental swords having different attack style and may even require finesse to master. Wind sword Livart requires successful button press in certain frames to spin Adol right round like a record baby like Felghana and Origin's Wind magic (just referring to Yunica and Adol's Wind magic). Fire sword Blirante allows you to charge your swipes for powerful flame waves. Lightning sword Erricil has you mashing buttons for a thrusting attack that lets you penetrate even the sturdier foes like a certain frog boss you'll fight later. Fans of previous Ys games and fans of action games in general will love this game. \nCan't have a Falcom game without awesome soundtrack, and Ark of Napishtim delivers. Enjoy listening to the smooth Ultramarine Deep as you fight a certain disgruntled, butthurt, and jelly black-haired rival in Mythos Path, Mountain Zone as you trigger your PTSD flashback as you dash past exploding balls in Grana-Vallis Mountains, and Ruined City Kishgal as you explore a technologically advanced underground ruin. \nFor those who have never played a Ys game, this is a great start as you will appreciate the gameplay refinements in the sequel Ys the Oath in Felghana and Ys Origin. For veterans of the series you will love the game because it's more classic Falcom goodness before they joined the anime clich\u00e9-brigade with Sen no Kiseki. For those who play it already, buy this game anyways to convince Xseed we want more Falcom games localized for the West. Give this game a shot.

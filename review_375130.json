An all without graphics, or sound! That really says something. To tell the truth, i hadn't played an interactive novels before this one, and from now on, i'm comparing every one that i DO play to Tin Star, why? because of the narrative, that's why. In an interactive novel such as this one, especially without graphics or sound, you have to hold the players attention in some way. If you don't, than you've failed a designing the game. However, Tin Star had me hooked all the way from the begining to the end. The writer, Allen Gies has immense talent for writing, and i commend his work. The style in which he delivers each new situation is always engaging, though sometimes feels a bit forced. And with that, let's get into the very few flaws of the game. First of all, the characters. Now, don't get me wrong, I loved the characters in Tin Star. They were very well writen and had diversity, but, their character buildup is very steriotypical. For instance, you've got the stoic cowboy, the renegade gunslinger, the eccentric prospecter, etc. However, like i said before, the way in which they were written makes up for it. The spelling could use some correction, but that's just more nitpicking than anything. And lastly, the ending. The ending feels really forced, and afterwards, you are presented with a lengthey epilouge that tell you what your character did after the ending, instead of letting you play it yourself. I can understand this for the other characters, but for the protagonist, it doesn't make sense to me. One of the negatives to having a simple, white canvas to write a story on is that your eyes start to get annoyed if you look at it for too long. Tin Star has the same problem. When i'm playing a game, i want to be told an engaging and thrilling story. Not be blinded. People with sensetive eyes will not enjoy the experience. I suggest switching to a more eye-freindly backdrop like dark blue, or something. Unfortunatley, ther's no way to change this yourself. And those are really all the negatives. Most of them are really nit-picky things, but negatives nonetheless. Every game has them. All in all, I really reccomend that you try this game. Especially if you want to be told an engaging story with many branching paths.

You often get a bunch of options to choose from, but even so, you're still limited to whatever the author programmed. \n\nIn this sense, Tin Star resembles the Choose Your Own Adventure book series, which ran from 1979 to 1998. Anyone who grew up in the 1980s and early 1990s likely spent hours with different CYOA novels. I know I did. \n\nThe story of Tin Star follows a man or a woman (you can select your gender, name, and sexual orientation) who was saved from execution via hanging and made the sheriff of a small town. During the game, you get to meet all sorts of individuals, many of whom can be either friend or foe depending on how you interact with them. \n\nUnfortunately, I can't delve too much into the story without ruining it, but I can say that there were a number of plot twists. Unlike some AAA titles that advertise \"your choices will matter,\" Tin Star actually makes good on that promise.\n\nThere are no graphics, music or sound effects of any kind. This means you'll have to use your imagination to conjure up the imagery, but given that the author provides plenty of information, that's not too difficult. \n\nOne minor benefit to a total lack of audio is that you can easily play your own music in the background without it interrupting anything or being interrupted by the game's music/sound effects.\n\nThe system requirements are so low that even a PC that's over a decade old could run Tin Star. So if you have an older machine or an underpowered laptop, rest assured you won't have any problems here.\n\nI do have a few \"issues\" with the game, however.\n\n1. The visuals consist of black text on an off-white background. While that's a fine setup, it'd be nice if the player could choose their own text and background colors. I know some people prefer using a dark background and lighter text, especially if they're playing in a dimly-lit room. \n\n2. As far as I can tell, Tin Star only saves your game at the end of each chapter, and only then if you tell it to do so. This is because you can replay the chapter if you want to try something different, which is nice, but it also means you have to start that chapter over at the beginning. \n\n3. There's only one save file. If you start a new game, your old save will be written over. So if someone else in your household wants to play Tin Star, make sure you back up your save or that they have their own Steam account and use family sharing.\n\nBottom line: It won't win any awards for being flashy or technologically impressive, but what it does have is a good interactive story with meaningful choices and interesting characters.

I have been saving Choice of Robots for last, and I will be playing that shortly.

I'm sure subsequent playthroughs will be shorter, but only due to familiarity with the choices available\n[*]if you die you can replay the encounter (losing points), go back to the start of the chapter (possibly fewer points are lost? I never took this route), or restart the game. since the game is so long it is good that you are not forced to restart (as in other CYOA games I have played) but it still gives you an incentive to not die ;)\n[*]one complaint is that there is a little bit of a dearth of achievements compared to the scale of the game- other choice of games titles (notably Choice of Robots) have many more, and that one is significantly shorter. you also do not start earning achievements until generally the 3/4 pt of the game, as far as I can tell\n[*]warning that some of the characters say some racist stuff- if you play as a chinese character be aware that you will be constantly referred to as a 'celestial'. iirc there are some characters who either supported or fought for the confederacy during the civil war. also most white characters have a hatred for the various native american tribes in the area. it's not really a flaw of the game, but a flaw of history/society, and the game handles it much better than many others have. still, if you want to avoid racism, this is might not be the game for you.\n[*]in terms of stat building- don't expect any of your stats except for influence to get anywhere close to 100%. maybe if you picked one to totally focus on you could get it pretty high, but I do not thing that that is really an ideal strategy. my highest stat was ~40%. in terms of influence stats, expect at least one of those to go way over 100%! \n[*]some of the mechanics are a little weird, there are many times when you have a certain amount of time/'turns' to use (notably at the beginning of every chapter you can spend time building a stat or persuing other things) but you are not told how many you have, so it can be a little frustrating\n[*] the pacing of the game can be a little weird, especially after the climax of the story, but it's not a huge issue and the story is still very enjoyable\n[*] at the end of the story you get the chance to read a little epilogue about how all the major and minor characters faired, which was nice\n[*]if you don't like gunfights, most (but not all, as far as I can tell) situations can be talked out of. if you don't like talking, you can pretty much just shoot everyone\n[/list]\n", "timestamp_created": 1452058807, "timestamp_updated": 1452058807, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20222195": {"recommendationid": "20222195", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995588799", "num_games_owned": 249, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 678, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451747111}, "language": "english", "review": "This interactive novel had a story I really enjoyed!

Tin star really is a must buy for those interested in the western/mystery genre.

The 9 hours on my record consist of 3/4 first run, and several other speed run). Prolly the 'ever made' is a sales pitch though. I do know other Visual Novel that's bigger.\n- It is an interactive western mystery novel, albeit the 'mystery' part isn't throughoutly explored\n- Choices do matter. On several occasion, if not most, different choices means completely different story. In the long run, you'll see that most of your decision does matter\n\nThat's the pros\n\nCons:\n- The system is kinda complex. You'd find yourself getting killed when you think you can handle it. Good thing there's a save system\n- The equipment system was detailed and throughout, but in the end, it doesn't seems to affect that much, and it ends up as an aesthetic stuff only, most of the time, i think.\n- There's 4 romance choice, which, for me, is not enough. The things you need to do to get your love is quite unique however.\n- Some decision matters a little. While it sounds that i'm contradicting what i said above, it doesn't means that it's ignorable. The choices do changes the story, but it doesn't really feels like you made a giant change, like it should be. Ex. like the one when you choose a guy to be the (spoiler). You'd think the decision would impact the story by a lot, but all you get is a single paragraph, with extras down the line.\n- As the other stated, the ending is too bland and forced. I find myself enjoying the rest of the story, but not enjoying the ending at all. Too many question unanswered, too many stones skipped.\n\nSummary:\n\nYou should buy this if you like the Spaghetti Western setting, since it really draws the clear picture about the settings, and it's immersive. If you're getting it because of the mystery part however, don't get this one.

Now I'm pretty much stalking the company that makes this game.\n\nTin Star is an interactive novel that can go almost any avenue you can think of. You can name yourself, or choose from a set of names. You can be a man or a woman, and of either gay or straight sexuality. Doctor, lawyer, or I think something else. You can be a good marshal, bad marshal, decent marshal, questionable marshal. it all depends on how you play the game; what sides you take, who you shmooze and who you shoot. \n\nWhen I played the demo I ended up as a lawyer, froze to death on my way to my job, retried, then ended up friends with a Mormon cowboy who'd just had a calf shot by a prospector. I shmoozed to the head of the town and angered a woman in a saloon who almost shot a guy for touching her leg (though he was apprently after more). \n\nEach character has a story, and you can become close to almost all of them. Your influence and persuasion over them can fluctuate depending on your actions and your influence on them decides what happens in the future (they gonna save you from a shot, or loot your body when your dead?). You don't even have to follow through with the whole plotline; you can say f*ck it all  halfway through and just skip town and stop being a marshal. You can go to Mexico. You can be a womanizer, a sharpshooter, a friend of the Native Americans or a target of everyone who sees you. \n\nReally it's interesting. I will definately play this game through again. The dialoug and otherwise also shifts slightly depending on whether you are a woman marshal or a male marshal; it also shifts, though very slightly, if your relationship is not of the heterosexual sort.\n\nHow you act determines whether or not you are remembered. Whether or not you tell people your name or your title as marshal might effect whether or not your deeds have your name stuck on them; the events may be remembered, but will the marshal?\n\nOr you can be a total utter dick and be remembered because you shot at everyone and gave a middle finger to the Natives, the Sheriff, everyone in town and the damn mountains for all you care. F*ck those mountains. They can kiss your ass.\n\nYou can stand by and do nothing. You could practically not be there; just sit and watch and let the town fall to ruin or blow itself up, long as you get your coffee and your pay.\n\nSome consequences are unexpected, some are funny, some are fair.\n\nAll the writing in this is very good as well. Allen Gies put a good effort into presenting the scenes too you simply but thouroughly. You can get a real feel for the geography around you and the town - Preston Springs - that you reside in. He also did well with characters and the dialouge isn't too bad either (though cheesy in some parts, but not like painful cheesy at all). \n\nYou can also check your stats on your influence and skill in various areas (I reccomend viewing this in both 'graph' and 'story' mode). There's the occasional spelling/grammar mistake, but they aren't noticeable unless you re-read the scene a million times.\n\nPlease, please, please get this game. It really is fun and there is an interaction literally every page but a few interleude ones, and there not that long or frequent. I also personally think that you'll find out a bit about yourself if you just go ahead with your own choices, abide by your morals and what you might do. It's pretty interesting. \n\nNow start your adventure and find out whether your a legend or just a total, unrelenting, feather-dick.\n\n10/10 I'm starting a new game right now.", "timestamp_created": 1437786940, "timestamp_updated": 1437787189, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17148599": {"recommendationid": "17148599", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064889693", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 359, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1435853427}, "language": "english", "review": "In my opinion, this is the best Choice of Games, game, on steam.

What intrigued me about this title was it's epic length, and that it sounded interesting in that you take on the role of a US Marshall on the Old West frontier. There's not a lot specifically about the story that I can say that will not be full of spoilers, so I will refrain; however, this is one incredibly well-done story, full of far-reaching choices. You can be a dastardly, terribly corrupt lawman, or be a paragon of virtue. The ending Epilogue pretty much shines a light on everything you did during the game, and tells you of the far-reaching consequences as a result.\n\nThe only thing I didn't like is the numerous typos (\"their\" instead of \"they're,\" \"peaked\" instead of \"piqued,\" and several others); this was especially the case in the latter half of the game. Maybe it's not that big a deal, but if a game is going to be presented in a written medium, it really should be super-tight when it comes to editing and proofreading. Still, a commendable effort if several were caught in the making, as the author thanks numerous people for doing so. I would have loved to have helped proofread this to catch the dozens that I did see while going through it.\n\nStill, none of that is a big deal. I felt an emotional bond to the character, felt some stirrings in the legacy I left behind, and truly enjoyed every moment. I especially liked that it was a long one!

Very descriptive, and captures the imagination on an emboldened tale. The choices given are also pretty interesting. It's not so much as an A or B choice, but a great deal more. Minor spoilers here, about two chapters in, so skip the reminder of this paragraph if you don't want to spoil it. You encounter a cowboy, and a gold panner engaged in a shootout. You first choose how you want to arrive at the scene, and then engage with both characters. You can go in guns blazing, shooting before asking questions, or you can lend an ear to the two men and find out whats really going on. I got a chuckle out of this scene when I had the option to approach the men and, \"Tip your hat and say, afternoon gents\". You then find out whats going on, and effectively play detective. Listen to both sides of the story, figure out who is in the wrong or right, and then have one of the two pay reperations for what went wrong. Afterwards you can ask one, or both of the men to accompany you on your travels. Both characters are well written, and in the short time I've been with them, I actually feel like I'm friends with them(rather lame I know, but bare with me.)\n\nThe game also has a stat system, which is really interesting. Different options you select can have different effects on you. For example, in one section of the story I opted to travel with a ranchhand. He was on the frontier for a while, and offered up a good bit of knowledge on the wilds, and surviving harsh enviroments. As a result, my stats increased for those respective areas. In one section, im given a few days to launder about, and I can practice various things. I can take to target practice, read up on a variety of subjects, go gamble, etc. The stats effect different options, much like mass effect. You can upgrade persuasion, honor, and other traits. It's an interesting concept, and it makes your choice actually feel weighted. \n\nThis game, or novel, is hard to put down, and if you love westerns, and reading in general, you'll greatly enjoy it.

This is one of the two best interactive novels I've ever played (the other being Mecha Ace). the writing is solid, the characters are fun and endearing, and the choices have weight and consequence without feeling shoehorned in just to force you into having to make a weighty decision. Perhaps more importantly, a lot of choices are appropriately grey - it might be honorable to do something, but is it really best (for you or the community)? The only problem has been during a almost every violent encounter I died. There is usually very little hint as to which action is the best one (even if you'd think your character would know better, or could easily perform the feat). Luckily, if you die, you can just restart the encounter. It just costs you \"Legend\", which I guess is the games rating score. In spite of this, the game is just charming to play. \n\nSo why do I NOT recommend it? Because the ending doesn't make sense. This huge conspiracy is built up over the course of the game, only to lead to a sudden and unexpected confrontation (where you can cordially invite everyone and their parents [literally] as allies, even if you pist them off earlier in yoru adventure) with a learing plot hole. Namely, how does one family threaten the livelihood of America with a small band of outlaws? It's completely nonsensical, and when combined with the rushed ending, becomes disappointing. \n\nI would only recommend this game if you are willing to enjoy the journey and don't care (much) about the ending.

Wasn't sure what to expect, but was very pleasantly surprised.\n\nWhat you get is an entirely text based, 10 chapter story where you develop your character as a US Marshal in 19th century Nevada. After some introduction, you start each chapter in the hub of your town where you decide what to spend your limited time and very limited money on, and then something happens that needs a Marshal. The mission of each chapter has a nice variety, ranging from quiet investigations to big skirmishes, and the real selling point here is the choice it gives you on how to approach every thing in them. Generally after some investigating things get drastic and you have to make a series of choices based on your skills, knowledge, and character. With about 4 or 5 and sometimes 8 options for every bit, I never felt too pressured to do one thing or another. The amount of 'just shoot them' options make renegade Shepard look like a pacifist. \n\nBehind the all text is a very RPG like skill system measuring your abilities, alignment, and relationships. It never explicitly says that you fail or succeed at something due to these values as well as never explicitly says when they're checked like in Fallout, only when they increased. I liked this, it gave some immersion and made me think about what the Marshal could do, rather than what numbers said he could do. I rolled a Lawful Good persuasion gunslinger and when I did those types of things, they worked, but when I tried to build something or wrestling a bear, I was up a creek.\n\nThe story gradually built up, with the connections between the chapters being revealed more towards the end. The final ending I got was a little boring, I really just went up to someone, arrested him, and that was it. I probably could have gotten something more interesting if I decided to do more shooting and less talking, and it didn't help there was a weird period of nothing between big action finale and the actual ending of the story. However you do get a full rundown of how your choices made a difference and the ultimate fate of your town and the cast that does give closure.\n\nMechanistically, the text engine used is bare bones looking, but works fine. Conversations are in a layout that should be recognizable to anyone whose played Mass Effect but much more concise, and the 'asking for information' prompts differentiable from 'threaten and shoot them in the face'. I wish they gave it an interface little flavor though, sometimes it felt like I was just taking a really exciting customer service survey.  Some say there's some poor grammar, but unless your an English major this probably won't bother you alot, I never noticed. If, for example, you were just bothered by 'alot', it might be an issue.\n\nOne note: There is permadeath, but only if you 'accept' the fatal mistake. You lose a cosmetic point at the end of the game, but that's it. Additionally, you can save and reload at the end of chapters. Progess is save automatically.\n\nI got 6 hours out of one playthrough, asking every question possible and restarting a chapter a few times to get a better ending. I'd expect another run would be shorter with reading less background, and probably it would take about 4 playthroughs total to see the outcome of most things major. That's quite a bit of game for $5, if you don't mind reading it.\n\n\n\ntl;dr: A very intense customer service survey set in 19th century Nevada about making good choices.", "timestamp_created": 1433892490, "timestamp_updated": 1433892781, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "4.998219", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16281802": {"recommendationid": "16281802", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995115895", "num_games_owned": 294, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 675, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1434057043}, "language": "german", "review": "Gro\u00dfartiges Spiel. \nWenn man Fantasie hat.

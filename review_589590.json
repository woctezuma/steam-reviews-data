This is the main criteria as the player you have to fulfill in order to fully enjoy this game, and I really did love the experience. So much to the point where I played at least 8 hours straight to trying to finish the story.\n\nOne important thing to know before purchasing this game is dialogue decisions are very important and the game has to be picky in order for you to trigger new actions/dialogue. After a certain point, maybe even only a good 15 minutes of trial and errror, there will be a lot of skipping dialogue since you would've memorized it by then. I recommend also having a good amount of patience because it can and will get tedious after a while of trying and failing.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is this is a trial and error game, and you need to fail [i] a lot [/i] for you to learn. You'll get a whole lot of interesting endings, but patience is a virtue with this game. I found myself restarting rooms and even days for forgetting a step, but honestly, I didn't mind too much.\n\nThis trial and error system of the game is also aided with the hints the developers where smart and kind enough to add. The hints are very helpful because they direct you into storylines after you've experienced several trials. The hint system almost negates the use of outside sources/walkthroughs and makes the game substantially easier to complete. I only really needed outside help past the storylines and more for gaining collectibles/Monsterman cards.\n\nJust to end on the highs of this game, Kindergarten is true to the trailer and goes way beyond that. The trailer only gives you a taste of the gore and the hilariously morbid dialogue you'll find in this game, and the stories are actually completely fun to do (Lily's is the most interesting). Don't be afraid to fail just to see the dialogue because you'll still get a laugh or an oh-wow moment, and enjoy your neverending loop of Monday horrors.", "timestamp_created": 1514415182, "timestamp_updated": 1515836207, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.688408", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38742708": {"recommendationid": "38742708", "author": {"steamid": "76561198296668286", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498498379}, "language": "english", "review": "Yeah it's kinda cool but honestly just watch a youtuber play it", "timestamp_created": 1514389486, "timestamp_updated": 1514389486, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474138", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38731521": {"recommendationid": "38731521", "author": {"steamid": "76561198388513007", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 500, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514366759}, "language": "spanish", "review": "nugget quiere ser amado", "timestamp_created": 1514368406, "timestamp_updated": 1514368406, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38716391": {"recommendationid": "38716391", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107506101", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 261, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512617449}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun, yet dark game.

It's fun when you figure out how to get a certain character to do something without dying, or when you get access to a different room after seeing it every day. The characters are really good too! Of course they're not amazing, I mean, it's based off of Kindergarten, but they're still likeable and funny! The graphics are sort of a 16 bit style, and are just mediocre through the whole game. The music is AMAZING! There isn't much, but I still hum the main theme to this day!\n\nBut that's about all the positives I have for this game. There are a few negatives.\n\nFor one, you can't delete a save file. Since the day resets, it appeares that there's no issue with it, but your money doesnt reset! That means that you have to keep going to school, getting money, and killing yourself until you have max. Also, once you complete a character's story line, you get an achievment and an item, and that's it. This may not seem like a big deal, but I HIGHLY suggest using a walkthrough for this game, because it is almost impossible to figure everything out. Some, of course, are easier than others, but if you get really stuck on a character, just look up a YouTube video to help yourself. My final complaint is the Monsterman Cards. Throughout the game, there are collectible cards. Some cards are EXCLUSIVE to a character's story line. On my first run, I beat the game without grabbing Monsterman Cards, but if I want to FULLY beat the game, I have to play through each character's story again. In my opinion, it's not worth it.\n\nOverall, I HIGHLY recommend this game, but keep in mind, collect the Monsterman Cards on your first run, and if you cannot finsih a character's story line, then use YouTube. That's why this game got so popular, it's because everyone was looking for help on this game on the internet.", "timestamp_created": 1513458331, "timestamp_updated": 1513458331, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38322690": {"recommendationid": "38322690", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968748110", "num_games_owned": 268, "num_reviews": 96, "playtime_forever": 79, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512833264}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a fun simplistic game.

Mondays are usually a horror (more like a meme) among students because they mean weekend's over and time for school again. In the game, the Kid have to loop his Mondays, which can be pretty scary. However, this game is not scary to play. Sure, there is much gore but it's not as horrifying as monsters from other games like Re7 and Until Dawn. Anyway, I really like the game and how different characters develop their personalities. You get to know more of them bit by bit by completing missions given by each of them. There are consequences in the game as well, like, will you be able to survive for a whole day and collect stuff you need in order to do the final missions(ie. Lily's/Nugget's ALTERNATE)?

If you don't wish to have spoilers, do not read this review.\n\nIf you don't care, go ahead and read.\n\n\n\n\n\"Kindergarten\" is a very short game. It only took me around 2 hours to 100% complete the game (get all achievements). \n\nIf you're a fan of Groundhog Day and kids, you'll likely like this game. Because it's basically Groundhog Day with kids.\n\nThe story of Kindergarten is this: \nIt's your first day of Kindergarten and when you get there, you meet your fellow classmates, the creepy janitor and your teacher. \nOne of the girls is called Cindy and is a bit of a psycho. So let's start with her story. \n\nWhen you encounter Cindy, she will ask if you want to be her boyfriend. Sure. Why not. \nShe tells you that to become her boyfriend, you have to do something for her. Namely stick some gum in another girl's hair (called Lily) during morning class. Okay then...\n\nDuring morning, stick the gum in Lily's hair. Lily will start crying. Report to Cindy.\n\nCindy will be overjoyed at this fact and ask you to play House with her. \nWell, that seems innocent eno---\nCindy: \"Have you been drinking?\"\nOh. \nPiss her off enough and you'll have to pay her $1 to get off your case.\nIf you don't, she'll stab you in the face with a knife. Hell if I know where she hid it.\n\nIf you manage to succeed in not getting stabbed in the face, it's now time for lunch.\n\nDuring lunch, she wants something vegan to eat. But being a 6 year old moronic kid, she has no idea what 'vegan' means. You can either give her a Biscuit or a Salad you can buy for $0.75 from another kid (who I call \"Money Loving Brat\"). \nGive her either and she'll ask you to break into the Janitor's closet and get a bucket of blood. \nYeah. We're re-enacting Stephen King's \"Carrie\" here. \n\nDuring recess, speak to Cindy again. She'll ask you to dump the blood on Lily. She jumps down a giant hole to take suicide. Shortly after, a boy called Nugget does the same due to not having any friends. \nDo so and you'll get a flower for show and tell. \nDuring show and tell, show the flower. Cindy becomes overjoyed and asks you to keep the flower. \n\nThat's the end of the Monday.\n\nSecond day: Monday again. It's always Monday. You can never escape it. \n\n\n\nNearly all of the characters in the game has ways of killing you. \nIt ranges from beating you to death for snitching on the teacher, getting shot in the face for not bringing something to Show and Tell, getting stabbed for being a drunk during House, getting poisoned by a Poisoned Nugget or even getting killed by the creepy Janitor for hanging in his room when lunch break ends.\n\n\nEvery time you complete a day with a specific person, you get certain items. Said items are needed to complete the game.\nThe items ranges from the flower from Cindy, a special Lunch Pass from your teacher (do note that eating it during a specific route causes you to die. Because it's poisoned. You can also just stab your teacher if you want to. I mostly brought it to sell for $3 during the Morning).\n\nOverall, the game is short, fairly difficult because you have to constantly be aware of what you're meant to do and not. One screw up and you have to re-do the entire room.\n\nOh and I wasn't joking about dying if you didn't bring anything to Show and Tell.\nYou'll be sent to the Principal's Office, who shoots you, because kids who won't bring anything to Show and Tell will be failures later in life.

It's another quirky indie puzzle/adventure. The gameplay isn't special. As a matter of fact, I think the Apple System of limited actions for each room only exist to artificially inflate the game's playtime, because a lot of the solutions to each quest are completed by trial-and-error learning. It's pretty frustrating to get to the end of the day, only to learn that there was one step you missed because you didn't know anything about it. That said, it's not too time consuming to start over.\n\nWhat makes this game worth it is that it's balls-to-the-wall silly. Almost all the dialogue, characters, and events are treated as opportunities for goofy, unusual, or violent humor. It's very much like early South Park, which is the best praise I can give it.\n\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1507439860, "timestamp_updated": 1507439860, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.465116", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35541340": {"recommendationid": "35541340", "author": {"steamid": "76561198378273061", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499840933}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5e7c\u513f\u56ed\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u6211\u6295\u5165\u4e8619\u4e2a\u5c0f\u65f6\u73a9\u5b8c\u6240\u6709\u7ed3\u5c40\uff0c\u4e00\u70b9\u4e5f\u4e0d\u4f1a\u540e\u6094\uff0c\u6211\u7ed9\u51fa\u597d\u8bc4\u6709\u4ee5\u4e0b\u539f\u56e0\n1\u3001\u50cf\u7d20\u7684\u753b\u98ce\uff0c\u4fcf\u76ae\u53ef\u7231\u5374\u5e26\u7740\u4e00\u4e1d\u8840\u8165\u548c\u66b4\u529b\uff0c\u53cd\u800c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u6d3b\u529b\n2\u3001\u5728\u6211\u773c\u91cc\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u66f4\u50cf\u518d\u6559\u4f60\u793e\u4f1a\u7684\u771f\u7406\uff0c\u8010\u4eba\u5bfb\u5473\n3\u3001\u60c5\u8282\u6fc0\u52a8\u4eba\u5fc3\uff0c\u7d27\u5f20\u523a\u6fc0\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u8003\u9a8c\u4eba\u7684\u8111\u529b\n4\u3001\u5f69\u86cb\u591a\uff0c\u7ed3\u5c40\u591a", "timestamp_created": 1507374790, "timestamp_updated": 1507374790, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560811", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35520827": {"recommendationid": "35520827", "author": {"steamid": "76561198184265807", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 90, "playtime_forever": 161, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495684685}, "language": "english", "review": "babyrage simulator", "timestamp_created": 1507302891, "timestamp_updated": 1507302891, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35515933": {"recommendationid": "35515933", "author": {"steamid": "76561198311854046", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 335, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497669174}, "language": "english", "review": "Kindergarten is a game where you play achild that has started at a new school that is completely corrupt and definitily fictional. You are instantely involved into this massive scene about gaining friends, discovering truths and learning about your new school. Be prepared as you a brought through a gore filled rollercoaster of wierd people and even wierder basements as you learn the truth of the schools missing child. getting your thinking caps on because this ones gonna get hard and make you really use that educated brain.\n\nGRAPHICS: The art style of this game is very nice and what i call \"fake old\". It reminds me alot of a game like the binding of Isaac due to to the way it is presented in its 2d matter. The characters have a very unique astableshment and make you assume the way they sound durin the dialoge. Due to the games graphics simplicity this is an extremely simple game to run and does not require a very \"high tech\" computer at all.\n\nNEGATIVE SEGMENT: Although this is an extremely fun game at times it can be very difficult to cope with, you can spend 30 minutes just looking for one object/ending that can be really obvious in the end. The aspect of clues isnt as helpful as you would hope and dosnt help with making you not want to uninstall at times. I finished the base game and now have to acomplish collecting all the monstermon cards to get the special ending. This is taking massive amounts of time and patience and has gotten me close to giving up and uninstalling the game. The dialogue is somewhat unclear at some points but mostly good, i feel that mabye the developers have done that on purpose to make characters destinct but it can sadly make the game hard to follow at some points. The glitches in this game (which there can be alot of) can be easily avoidable but expected due the game beeing quite low project in my opinion, If you get affected by a glitch you usually have to restart the day which can be so annoying/frustrating but will most likely be avoidable the next time. \n\nPOSITIVE SEGMENT: After reading the last segment your probably surprised why i actually reccomend this game but i will tell you why this game is a must buy for anybody. The game has alot of features that we dont see alot in recent games and is sooo refreshing. This is a game that i could come home too after a long day and just enjoy it, That might also come as a suprise due to the sheer gore in this game but its suprisingly mellow if you choose it to be. At some points yes it is extremely frustrating but thats only if you choose it to be. If you just hang on to it and go through the proccess you can come out with it being very exciting and fun. I obviosly chose for myself to get angry over it but i relise now that if i just went through the proccess without showing so much anger i would have enjoyed it even more than i did. I sounded like i hated the game last segment due to the fact that that my problems where only for some points in the game and most of the time it was just alot of fun. The amount of role and characterisation put into each character was astonoshing for instance nugget was an outcast, he was different due to his \"nerdiness\" and his involvment in chicken nuggets. He is a very dark person and has alot of anger and grief due to his friends death. This u can tell through the imagry, dialogue and plot of the game. Each character is so different and have a completely different role to the others. It really shows how much work the developers put into the game in that aspect and allowes you to enjoy it that much more. The plot, setting and scene of the game is very good to. we have a very dark plot filled with drama and emotion. The idea of this corrupt, bad school as the scene adds so much more context to the school and fills you with some sense of connection to the game in your own weird way by the end. There is alot of room for improvment but constant updates and bug fixes really overpowers that.\n\nCONCLUSION: This game is very fun, gory and dark but adds alot of enjoyment and entertainment to your games library. I definately reccomend this to someone looking for a fun and affordable game to give them a nice fix or even as a weird occasional game u might play after a long day.\n\nspecial rating: 9/10  Date: 6th of October 2017", "timestamp_created": 1507288442, "timestamp_updated": 1507288442, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35507499": {"recommendationid": "35507499", "author": {"steamid": "76561198336087558", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 311, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507311281}, "language": "english", "review": "OMG THIS GAME IS SO GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD OMG OMG WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO JESUS HE NEED SOME MILK WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO", "timestamp_created": 1507254757, "timestamp_updated": 1507254757, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35506349": {"recommendationid": "35506349", "author": {"steamid": "76561198219975423", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2415, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1516139815}, "language": "english", "review": "THIS GAME IS WORTH SO MUCH MORE THAN $5!!!!!

I mean who wouldn't want to date the cute slutty kindergartner? And on the hint section it said that I didn't need any special items or anything to complete her missions. So I was like sweet! Go for it!\n\nSo I managed to do everything to the best of my knowledge. I was able to do her damn playhouse stuff and follow her dang plans, and I managed to do the super cool rat out the janitor thing for killing her dog and she straight up murders the dude. I think that's the morally better thing to do because the other option involves pouring blood over the depressed chick and her killing herself and the nugget kid killing himself too, but if she kills the janitor then she's all bloody and nasty and I'm afraid if I complete the quest that way she'll make out with me with blood face and I don't want that.\n\nBUT I DIDN'T COMPLETE THE QUEST\n\nTHAT DUMB FAT KID KEEPS BEATING THE SHIT OUT OF ME DURING SHOW AND TELL WTF\n\nSo I was like fine, I gotta find a way to get rid of dumb fat kid.

A STUPID FLOWER?! IT SAYS IM SUPPOSED TO GIVE IT TO SOMEONE WHO NEEDS LOVE, SO THE NICE GIRL?!?!\n\nIS THAT THE MAIN STORY OF THIS GAME?!!?

Every day consists of helping a kid solve their story-quest, mostly through trial and error. But, at the end of the day, the world resets except for the special unlockable magic items. Death is very common so get used to it. \n\nThe real gem of this game is the dialogue. It's full of weird twists and disturbing back stories that never really explain themselves, but you're sure that it isn't normal. Contrast that with the child-like animation and music, and the game becomes a one of a kind indie experience. The biggest downside is the trial and error problem; where screwing up something means that you end up taking the same dialogue path over and over.

I've now 100% the game, and as you can see, it only took me a little less than 6 hours.\nHonestly, I would say that if you think you'll like this game, get it. If you're on the fence, wait to see if it goes on sale.\n\nPros:\n-Cute Art style makes the... Shenanigains, yea that's what I'll call it, the sheninigains far easier to stomach for those who are squeamish (like me), as well as just being good in general\n-Very interesting story and generally fun gameplay\n-The characters are quite interesting and all around great to listen to\n-The puzzles are logical and generally fun, allowing use of some creative thinking to find solutions\n-The fucking collectable cards are hilarious, enough said.\n\nCons:\n-The trial and error can get old fast, especially for the trickier routes, and I only got about halfway through before just pulling up a guide because I didn't feel like guessing anymore. The game gives you a hint system, but some hints are only unlocked after you've already figured out wha the hint tells you, or at least, that's when I got them.\n-The dialouge tends to get repetitive due to the day being the same each time. Unfortunately, I feel this is more an issue with the way the game is formatted rather than the writing in and of itself.\n-There's no real payoff, or at the very least, the payoff is not all that satisfying. You find out what's going on at the school, yes, but it doesn't explain the kill-happy staff and other issues the school seems to have. The secret ending isn't all that good either, as it's surprisng and somewhat entertaining, but not enough to make up for the fact that it's a blatant sequel hook.\n-Not much in the way of replayability. Once you've gotten all the endings and collected all the cards, there's really nothing to do. The Cards aren't exactly replayability in itself as they (usually) only require one small task or another.\n\nIt may seem like I hate this game, but I don't, I love it a lot actually. It's got some issues, but for five dollars, it was well worth the money, in my opinion, and I would highly reccommend it if you think it'd be something you'd like. Just be prepared for some trial/error and don't be afraid to pull out a guide if something is elluding you.

I talk to the janitor and shit talk him for mopping the sidewalk, he then proceeds to murder me with said mop.\n\nAttempt 2:\nStart in same morning before school, get drugs, don't sell them this time, it was a waste of time. I steer clear of the janitor and drug dealer and proceed to talk to a blonde girl, who wants me to put gum in a girls hair in order to make me her girlfriend. Whatever. I proceed to the next area, which is morning time. I put gum in the girls hair, she cries, it was funny, then I talk to my girlfriend, who seems pretty pleased, then we go to play house. We proceed to have some weird ass argument about me being an alcoholic, she then tells me she's pregnant with another man's child. I tell her we should abort it, and give her the pill from that morning, she says abortions are better that she thought. \n\nI forgot this was kindergarten and not jail at this point.", "timestamp_created": 1501266629, "timestamp_updated": 1501266629, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33857777": {"recommendationid": "33857777", "author": {"steamid": "76561198312913084", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 60, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500295046}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0421\u0430\u043c\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0440\u0443\u0442\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430, \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u044f \u0437\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043b 140(\u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u043b\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u0441\u043a\u0438\u0434\u043a\u0430\u0445)", "timestamp_created": 1501254530, "timestamp_updated": 1501254530, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483871", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33843947": {"recommendationid": "33843947", "author": {"steamid": "76561198281282569", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 493, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508945754}, "language": "english", "review": "I can sit and watch the fat, pixel graphics, head bobbing characters all day\n10/10 wud recommend", "timestamp_created": 1501199261, "timestamp_updated": 1501199261, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484863", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33841247": {"recommendationid": "33841247", "author": {"steamid": "76561198373828801", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500253514}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun little game that is really really weird!

But if youre looking for a fantastic ravioli recipe you've come to the right place.\n\nIngredients\n- To Make the Dough\n375 grams (3 cups) plain flour\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n2 eggs\n1/4 cup (50 ml / 3\u00bd tablespoons) olive oil\n1/2 cup (120 ml / 8 tablespoons) water\nExtra flour for dusting \n\n\n- To Make Cheese Filling\n15 ounces (425 grams) container Ricotta cheese\n5 ounces (142 g/about 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) \"3 Cheese Italian Blend\" (Parmesan, Romano & Asiago)\nNote: grate these cheeses yourself and create your own custom blend.\n1/2 cup cheddar cheese\n2 eggs, lightly beaten\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/2 teaspoon pepper\n\n\n- Extras\nYour favorite sauce for the ravioli (i.e. marinara/ marijuana)\nParmesan cheese\nBasil\nFried vegetables\nShrimp\nFish slices\nChicken pieces \nMake the Ravioli filling.\n\n- In a small mixing bowl, add the ricotta and mash with a fork.\n- Add in the 3-cheese blend, Cheddar cheese, eggs, salt, and pepper.\n- Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth, paste-like consistency.\n- Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. \n\nMake the Ravioli dough.\n\n- Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.\n- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.\n- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.\n- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.\n- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.\n- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).\n- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn\u2019t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. \n\nFill the Ravioli shells.\n\n- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.\n- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.\n- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a \u201chomemade\u201d touch as well.\n- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.\n- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. \n\nForm the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.\n\n- Roll the dough into two sheets\n- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.\n- Fill with the ravioli mixture.\n- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.\n- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.\n\nCook the Ravioli.\n\n- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.\n- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.\n- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest \n- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed plates\n\nServe it up.\nTop with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!", "timestamp_created": 1500974707, "timestamp_updated": 1500974707, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504902", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33778375": {"recommendationid": "33778375", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061056745", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 882, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501001397}, "language": "english", "review": "This Game is absolutely Hilarious.

It's creative, and unique, and like nothing you've ever seen before.\n\nIn Kindergarten, you play as a boy going to kindergarten. But, shortly after you'll discover that there is more to this game than just going to kindergarten. Perhaps you'll talk to the lonely little girl and discover that her brother has gone missing. Maybe you'll talk to the weird little boy and learn that the principal is handing out drugs. Maybe you'll talk to the janitor and learn... that he's a man of his word. Whatever you do, you should find out quickly that something is not right with this school.\n\nKindergarten is an adventure game... in a sense. The gameplay revolves around collecting and using objects in order to advance the various quests you get from characters around the school. Most of them have some quest you need to complete and rewards you with an item needed to complete another quest down the line, and the story, for the most part, is aimed at trying to uncover the mystery of what happened to the missing kid.\n\nThat being said, neither the gameplay nor the story, is really the reason to play this game. The reason to play it is the humor. A lot of it comes down to just how twisted this school really is. You could be playing house with one of you classmates, and the next thing you know, she'll be berating you for your alcoholism, and you'll be asking her for a divorce.\n\nAnd, yes. Children can die in game. In fact, several of the quests require you to kill certain people around the school to progress. Which would be horrifying in a normal setting, but these children are not sweet and innocent by any stretch of the concept. Some are downright unapologetically cruel to the point where you want to see them die, and this mixed with the insanity of the setting and the clever way they're done leaves most of the death scenes still quite entertaining to watch... for the most part. A few deaths maybe go a bit far, but those are in the minority. Though it's also worth noting that the humor is also deeply rooted in the dialogue. It's usually worth looking through all the dialogue options just to see what sort of things people will say, and how they react to certain events.\n\nNow, for those of you out there who think this makes the game sound too macabre, messed up, and shocking to be enjoyable... it really isn't. The cartoony pixel art graphics of the game keeps anything from getting too graphic, and there's no real prolonged suffering from anyone (with one exception)... just weird and whacky death scenes surrounded by genuinely funny dialogue.\n\nI bought the game while it was in early access, and even back then, I realized that the game felt polished enough to be a full game if the developers just stopped updating it. And they haven't stopped yet, either, even though it's out of early access.\n\nAll in all, Kindergarten was a very enjoyable experience. The only real downside to me was that it involved a lot of trial and error, and one death was a bit too much... albeit that one particular death is actually avoidable. (when Cindy asks you to get something gross from the Janitor's closet, grab the note instead of the bucket... you'll thank me later) Still, despite the handful of flaws, this game is still very enjoyable to play through, and I highly recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1500566800, "timestamp_updated": 1500566800, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.578813", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33674148": {"recommendationid": "33674148", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992691929", "num_games_owned": 455, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 419, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500562873}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0425\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0447\u0451\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u044e\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0430", "timestamp_created": 1500562972, "timestamp_updated": 1500562972, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33671948": {"recommendationid": "33671948", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000024001", "num_games_owned": 685, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 463, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500309287}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Biscuit balls!\"", "timestamp_created": 1500556069, "timestamp_updated": 1500556069, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500225", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33671378": {"recommendationid": "33671378", "author": {"steamid": "76561198396743129", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500560364}, "language": "english", "review": "nice", "timestamp_created": 1500554083, "timestamp_updated": 1500554083, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33664769": {"recommendationid": "33664769", "author": {"steamid": "76561198183929135", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 394, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500522732}, "language": "english", "review": "I loved this game.

Although it isn't long, there is a nice collection bonus that pads the run time -- that's actually rewarding to complete. The characters are whacky and you'll love and hate all of them in turn. If you're looking for a violent kindergarten similator -- or if that's something you never realized you needed until reading that phrase, dig in! \n\nSo while the characters were fun and the story was interesting and rewarding to puzzle together, the game did have a few flaws. Namely the text. The text is humorous and brief--the first time. But when you go 4/5 on a character's storyline and want to blaze through / skip the dialogue you've already run through you're out of luck, more or less. You can speed up the text but skipping it is still a time muncher. Especially at the end, as I was finishing the card collection, resetting the days and going through the dialogue felt very tiresome. \n\nOn a different note, the puzzles were almost without exception ridiculously easy to solve. However there was one that I encountered that stumped me for an exceptionally long time (Monty's storyline). That's when you really feel the burn of combing through dialogue repeatedly to get to all the different possibilities and finally find a solution. The reset room button helps this somewhat, but if you make a mistake and think you're okay to advance but that crucial item was in the room before it--you're out of luck.

Whether your going to play for the Teacher and \"eliminate\" all other students, or be the best boyfriend ever, there is always something new and fun to do. The game also features a set of 25 small trading cards(called Monsterman Cards) and each one is earned by hunting them out or doing some VERY obscure and odd things that you would never do IRL(like, who goes back for thirds on Slop?!?!) The game is shorter than other games, I beat it with all the steam achieves in 5 or 6 hours with no online help(barring one time when i had no idea what \"stab the bully and get his stash\" meant).

At first it's funny, like a particularly dark episode of South Park. But as the game drags on, you'll realize that the only type of humor you're going to see is shock humor. After awhile, it gets very predictable and loses its charm.\n- The legnth. It's at once both too short and too long. While you can skip the letters filling a dialouge box, you still have to wait for the \"confirm\" button to appear, which means when you're mashing through conversations you've already seen 10 times it gets very uncomfortable and takes far too long. I completed this game in less than 6 hours, but I'm sure at least 1-2 of those were just mashing spacebar. That's not fun, and discourages experimentation.\n- The difficulty and hint system. It's all over the place. Most of the time you see a hint appear in your notebook, you've already done what it hints at you doing. And other times (particularly with some monstermon cards) the hints are so vague as to be almost useless. Other times, the hint will reveal much more information than you need and make the puzzles trivial. So if you want a challenge, don't look at the hints. You don't need them for anything besides the cards anyway. \n- When it ends, you just think \"Welp. That's it. Don't have to touch it again.\" Because you won't want to.

The story is interesting and genuinely engaging throughout. That being said, the puzzles fell into the category of either \"too easy\" or \"too difficult\" and once you have a feel for the actions that can be taken by interacting with the 9 different characters, the game become very easy to solve.\n\nThe $5 price tag is well worth it for this game, but anything more would begin to feel like a scam. The story, while great, is very short taking me roughly 2-3 hours to complete (less than an hour with a guide). Adittionally, there are a few minor bugs that could become irritating (sometimes animations wont trigger and chat options cannot be chosen), but other than that, the game runs pretty well.\n\nThere is virtually zero replay value as the solutions to the puzzles will always be the same which is also why the game gets easier the more you play, opposite of what you would expect in a puzzle game. Previously vague clues like \"find a way to get sent to the principals office\" become easier to solve after you've done it in the previous 2 puzzles.\n\nMy only real criticism is the hints system. Many of the hints only reveal themselves after you've figured out the solution OR after you've completed the character's quest, this does make parts of the game more difficult because you are essentially given no hints.\n\nAll in all, Kindergarden is a solid 8.5/10.\n\nTL;DR:\nPros\n- Interesting story\n- Cheap\n- Mentally engaging\n- Few bugs (YMMV)\n\nCons\n- Little replay value\n- Short\n- Difficulty scales backwards (puzzles get easier)\n- Poor implementation of hint system", "timestamp_created": 1499641242, "timestamp_updated": 1499641242, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538835", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33415623": {"recommendationid": "33415623", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051632742", "num_games_owned": 466, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498194184}, "language": "english", "review": "Asked a janitor why he's sweeping with a mop.\nGet impaled by janitor.\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1499636434, "timestamp_updated": 1499636434, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500834", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33415388": {"recommendationid": "33415388", "author": {"steamid": "76561198365646092", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 363, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499636566}, "language": "english", "review": "Kindergarten is an enjoyable and entertaining game with a dark twist.

There isn't much to do in this game, and you will be repeating the same actions a LOT, but it's really about unraveling the mystery. From what I've gathered so far you're trying to find out what happened to Billy, Lily's brother who went missing. During your first playthrough it will seem that the janitor did it (because he fucking murders you) but I can't imagine it's that obvious. It's really hard to explain why this game is good, but if you watch the  video on the homepage and it seems appealing there's a good chance you will enjoy it.

The dialogue stands out, the art serves its function and while you spend 95% of the game listening to a single music loop, it's somehow just the right amount of upbeat, catchy, and discordant with the chaos unfolding around it, while managing not to be grating. I did, pound for pound, enjoy it. So why the thumbs down?\n\n[i](TLDR: A 'meh' ending and several design flaws that get worse the farther you play. The thumbs down is more to signal that this is a critical review if you're looking for counterpoints to unconditional praise.)[/i]\n\nBecause amidst a perhaps misrepresentatively overwhelming sea of positive reviews and what I [i]did[/i] enjoy about the game, there are some rather pronounced flaws in its framework that add up to [i]insane[/i] artificial inflation of playtime, and REALLY start to wear on you if you're going for the 100% ending. I want to highlight these for both anyone gauging their interest pre-purchase, and perhaps the devs too should they see this.\n\nThe first and biggest problem is that while some of the individual stories and characters are engaging, the overall narrative falls flat with an extremely predictable (regular) ending, an equally predictable and underwhelming secret ending that serves as little more than a sequel hook, and some characters' questlines (particularly Jerome's) feel artificial, existing for little more reason than to give you an unlock to further the narrative. Perhaps one of the more intriguing aspects of the game is that it takes place in a short groundhog loop which somehow allows you to save special items to use on subsequent loops, but neither the loop itself nor this exploitation of it are ever acknowledged or addressed in the story.\n\nThe second problem is that after you've run through the game a few times, you'll quickly feel your brain start to glaze over as you hammer through the dialogue trees you're familiar with. With how intensely dialogue-heavy the game is, it is EXTREMELY annoying to have to wait half a second or so between each line of dialogue you're allowed to skip. It doesn't seem like much, but consider that you'll probably go through a hundred-plus lines of dialogue on most runs and that adds up [b]fast.[/b] I feel like my 9 hours to complete the game could probably have been shortened to 5 or 6 if the text prompts were more prompt. On top of which the dialogue also ties into everybody's favourite...\n\nThe third problem: needlessly cryptic bullshit. You can [i]probably[/i] figure out enough of the game firsthand to get the regular ending without using guides, but the [i]utterly labyrinthine[/i] dialogue trees hide many more secrets than you would think. These are of course concealed by a literal minefield of \"wrong answer and you die\" or \"lack an item and you die (but there's not always a hint that you COULD have survived with the right item)\" situations. Such feats as unlocking playing card #3 would probably require an actual series of flowcharts to figure out yourself. There are \"reset current room\" and \"reset day\" options, the former of which is only of any use if you IMMEDIATELY realize you screwed up, as you'll frequently realize halfway through the day that you didn't bring enough cash to school and have to start over... or realize that you botched something in the [i]previous[/i] room which you cannot reset to... or you'll realize immediately that you messed up, but be thrust into the next room before you can reset. The difficulty curve is extremely uneven with the first few questlines available to you actually being some of the most complex to finish. To its credit, the game features a built-in hint system that gradually unlocks tips for advancing based on certain flags as you attempt, succeed, and fail to complete certain tasks. Unfortunately...\n\nThe fourth problem: the game is still kind of buggy. You're unlikely to hit any real showstoppers, but aside from mostly cosmetic stuff like some characters referring to others as though they were in Condition A when they are in Condition B, a surprising number of the all-important hints never seem to unlock by attempting, failing, or stumbling around the task to which they refer, and will only unlock [b]retroactively after you have already completed the relevant task.[/b] Some of the hints are also decidedly unhelpful, such as telling you you have to shank Character C during X time of day, without [i]any[/i] indication of the crazy web of events and dialogue trees you may never have even seen to get the prompt for that to appear.\n\nLike I said, I still enjoyed it. It was worth a few bucks. The flaws aren't that pronounced, until you hit a stopping point and don't always have much to go on to figure it out.

You repeat the same day over and over trying to solve the mystery of what is going on at the school. Each student has a mission that you must complete to get a permanent item. These items help you complete some of the others quests, and If you dont do them in a certain order you could waste a day. This makes the game very focused on trial and error, which may be a little too aggrivating for some but I found it fine because I am a fan of Lakeview Cabin (GET THAT GAME). Each character gets built up with a story and a personality,and you will find yourself liking all of the characters by the end, even though they might not particularly like you. My only problem with this game is that the story ends on one persons mission, snd the ending is very epic with lots of mysteries revealed, but then you restart and go after the card ending and its not as great as the story ending. It doesn't ruin the game, but it is a little underwhelming, even though there is a nice sequel tease.

Every day there are phases: before school, morning class, lunch, recess, and show & tell. Your mission is to try to figure out how to uncover the weird stuff going on at the school.\n\nWhen you complete one of the NPC's storylines, you unlock a permanent item that stays with you when the day loops over.

I love time loops and the information gain from them. I was also able to beat the entirety of the game in my listed time with only needing a guide for 2 parts, Monty's mission and collecting all of the cards after I beat the main story. \n\nThe Good\nThe game is a fun mix of characters and ridiculous violence that contrasts the setting of a kindergarten. On top of that, you have interesting mysteries with some good hints that help you along the way to figuring out how to complete each individual character's storyline. I enjoyed my experience and found figuring out the patterns and other such to be worth my time, even for those frustrating moments.\n\nThe Bad\nI say I recommend with certain caveats because of the bad parts of my experience. The hint system is nice when it works and downright infuriating when it doesn't. The fact that for the Monty quest it mentions the chocolate bar is a red herring and frustrates me to no end that I couldn't figure out how to get it cheaper and then, upon looking up a guide, found that it wasn't necessary to get the amount of money you need. The card hints are atrocious as you can't tell what cards you have what cards you haven't collected. So I used a method where I didn't remove the \"new hint\" from the cards I hadn't collected until I picked them up with the guide. Another negative for the hint system is that some hints are unlocked via dialogue and others through actions you have to have performed once to get the hint. So if you've not performed the action, you might be unaware that something exists (I'm looking at you again, Monty's quest)\n\nAnother frustration comes from the need to actually do runs where all I'm doing is collecting money to get to the arbitrary max of $10 so I can do other runs which usually require a few dollars to complete. Why is there a max for the piggy bank? Why not just make a max of what you can bring so that on the runs I collect more money, I don't have to waste my time just collecting money because the quest I'm on this run requires me to have $3 to make all the necessary purchases or have enough for the bully.\n\nFinal Result: Recommended because of its low price and entertainment value. If you like time loop type stories where you capitalize on the gain of information from run to run, you'll really enjoy this. Just be careful of those moments of frustration where you realize you needed to bring more money, restart the day, and realize you don't have enough and have to waste a run collecting money.\n\nEdit: I will note that I beat the entire game, including the extra collectables and bonus ending in what steam is listing as 4 hours.

"english", "review": "i became aware of this game after seeing that a few youtubers started playing it, and was tempted to watch them just to see what it was like. but I decided that it would probably be best to play it blind and just see where it goes, and oh my god did this game surprise me. and i would recommend you do the same if you find yourself curious, because here is a perfect example of a game that just has to be played for yourself. it will not be fun at all to know all the answers going into it. and on that note, this review might have some spoilers, so play the game first before reading onwards.\n\nsomehow this game manages to cram as many things into it as possible without feeling like the devs just tried to lazily piece something together and push it onto steam, and every mechanic is just cranked up to 150%. this game will kill you in more crazy and unfair ways than Dark Souls. this game includes more illegal activity and crime than a GTA game. this game will have you reseting the game to try different choices more than Undertale. and this game's humor feels like the perfect love child between South Park and a Lego game. not to mention that each character has their own destinct personality that you immediately latch onto within the first half hour. this game nailed everything it was going for presentation-wise. i did notice though that some details are a tiny bit off, and as a guy who has been coding for about a year now, it leads me to believe this is somebody's early work, or even first game. and if it is, dude keep it up, this is fantasic and the industry needs more devs like you around.\n\nthe story goes like this. you are one of 8 students attending a local kindergarten. one of them has mysteriously gone missing, and the others pretty much want nothing to do with you, a lot like going to actual school. you them discover that the janitor and the principal have been up to some weird stuff... weird, murder-y, type stuff. you them have to assist each of the 6 other students so they give you special items that help you progress further. these tasks will vary from \"oh so thats what i need to do!\" to flat out rage inducing. you sometimes need to elaborately murder students, or teachers, and most of the time you will be dodging dialog options that kill you and make you restart. yeah, this game gets pretty messed up. and one point you even have to pour blood on somebody's head.\n\nnow onto the actual gameplay. as I said, you will be restarting more times than Undertale, because this game is 90% triggering certai events in the right order to yeild the right results. you could find yourself reseting the same day 20 times just to learn you didnt grab enough money at the start of the game, of there was an item you needed to pick up, or you could have simply chosen the wrong dialog and strayed to the wrong path, forcing you to start over. it gets frustrating beyond belief, but in a good way. every step closer you get to the correct path feels more and more rewarding. for one quest you need to save up $20 in one day, and various events can give you more money, but if you arent sure exactly which ones to trigger, you will have just wasted a day and will have to try all over again. you only get to trigger 5 events per room, and sometimes getting items or moneycould take up 2, 3, or even 4 event triggers. sometimes you need to rigger an event in an earlier room just to have the right item to be able to trigger enough events in a later room. its very trial-and-error based, it forces you to experiment with possibilities, which is why i recommend playing it blind. knowing all the answers will ruin the fun.\n\nfor some additional notes, this game has full controller support, but it really is up to you which feels more comfortable to use, which is a nice touch. the graphics are simple, you could argue that theyre bad, but i personally loved the style. and there some collectables hidden in the game for all you completionists.\n\nGameplay: 7/10\n-there really isnt much to be said other than what I stated before. its fun by all means, but Kindergarten is by no means a gameplay driven game. the choices do make for a lot of great possibilities though.\n\nStory: 8/10\nyou replay the exact same day over and over again with only special items and money being saved. this removed the risk of permanent consequences and allows you to relive dozens of insane stories. there is a definitive ending though, so dont worry about that.\n\nHumor: 8.5/10\neach character is messed up in their own right, and you cant help but laugh along with it. this game was in no way meant ot be taken seriously. even the name itself \"Kindergarten\" is its own sick joke.\n\nGraphics: 7/10\npixel graphics with some amatuer although nice visuals.\n\n---------------------------\n\nOverall: 9/10\nkindergarten is that perfect blend of insanity, violence, and humor that is great for a good kick. its the brilliantly crafted gems like this that are what make the indie game community shiny. i would highly recommend it", "timestamp_created": 1498705143, "timestamp_updated": 1498705143, "voted_up": true,

I felt as if I laughed more than I should have with its dark humor and gory-ish scenes. But this was a nice change of pace for me since I normally play FPS games. Mixed with a type of comedy and puzzle game, it was great playing even though it did not last very long. One downside I had was how repetetive the game can get. It's just a minor reason, but it got annoying once and a while each time I mess up and had to restart. This isn't much of a problem but more of a preference, but I disliked how I couldn't use the D-Pad on my controller to move around. It's such a small issue, but it bothered me because I don't really use the analog sticks for movement unless it's a racing game.

There are a million other ways the creator could have presented that plot line without making it seem like women (who dramatically under report rape because of fear of reprisal and public shame) simply make up stories about their sexual assault to get boys in trouble. It's a dangerous myth.\n\nI would have given it a positive review otherwise.\n\nEDIT: I'm getting a lot of backlash for this review, so for those interested here are some actual statistics with sources.\n\nThe United States Department of Justice estimates 8% of Sexual Assault Accusations are made falsely, with other government agencies reporting as little as 2% and virtually all research reporting less than 10%. That means at least 90% and more likely between 92% and 98% of reported Sexual Assaults occured as reported. According to the Department of Justice 2 out of 3 Sexual Assaults go unreported and of those unreported sexual assaults 20% did not report because they feared retaliation and 13% believed the police would not do anything to help and 30% further refused to give a reason for not reporting their attack. Sexual Asssault impacts all genders, and men are significantly less likely to report sexual assault out of fear of public shame and retaliation. False Accusations are often misreported in criminal justice reports as they are usually lumped in with \"undetermined\" or \"unfounded\". Being too late for a Rape Kit test or being unable to afford a Rape Kit test constitutes a large portion of \"unfounded\" sexual assault cases. According to the DoJ of every 1000 reported cases of sexual assault in 994 of those cases the perpetrator will walk free. Do the math. That means for roughly every 1 \"false accusation\" there are 27 actual sexual assaults and 26 if not all 27 of those perpetrators will go free, with only 9 of them being reported to begin with because of the victims fear that they will be retaliated against or have their case dismissed by police as \"unfounded\".\n\nIf you're interested in getting involved to help survivors of sexual assault or if you yourself are a victim of sexual assault know that you are not alone and there are people who can help. Search for the National Sexual Assault Hotline or the Rape, Abuse & Incest National network (RAINN) online. In an emergency please always call 911 or visit a hospital as soon as possible.\n\nhttps://www.rainn.org/statistics/criminal-justice-system\ni.

You play as an unnamed kid who has the power to relive the same day over and over again and you go around helping the other children (the puzzle element) in the Kindergarten which, by extension, sheds some light on the establishment\u2019s secrets.  \n\n[b] Pros [/b]\n\n1. Simple but entertaining characters\n- unique personalities that, while not memorable, were entertaining for the course of the game nonetheless\n- provide subplots that tie into the main storyline in the end. \n\n2. Engaging puzzle mechanics \n- Puzzles come in the form of helping characters with their quests\n- Puzzles require the use of resources like money and time (in the form of apples)\n- Puzzles require a good degree of trial and error and backtracking and it\u2019s pretty satisfying when you figure something out for Puzzle A when you\u2019re just talking to random people.\n- Game rewards you for gathering information first instead of trying to tackle puzzles from the get go. Encourages a more patient playstyle\n\n\n[b] Cons [/b]\n\n1. Repetitive backtracking\n- While backtracking is fine, having to see the same scenes over and over again ruin the pacing a little. Would like the ability to fast forward past these scripted events because otherwise it makes them unnecessarily slow.\n\n2. Basic visuals\n- Not a huge criticism taking into account the game\u2019s price but it should be noted. The title often looks a little outdated due to the recycled animations and pixel artstyle. \n\n\n[b] Conclusion [/b]\nKindergarten may not have a deep story or the best presentation, but manages to deliver a unique puzzle solving experience through both its setting and execution. I would definitely recommend this game at full price. \n", "timestamp_created": 1497727004, "timestamp_updated": 1497727004, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516660", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32512861": {"recommendationid": "32512861", "author": {"steamid": "76561198304418835", "num_games_owned": 177, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 591, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510543228}, "language": "english", "review": "you kill kids have kids kill kids have janitors kill kids and have prinsapls kill kids and have mosters kill prinsapls and obay nugget.", "timestamp_created": 1497722258, "timestamp_updated": 1497722258, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.397821", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32511639": {"recommendationid": "32511639", "author": {"steamid": "76561198263104442", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 895, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502679959}, "language": "english", "review": "Hey.

I loved it.  \n\nThe basic premise is that you play one day of Kindergarten over and over again altering your choices and getting different outcomes.  The plotlines are amusing and disturbing seeing as how you're playing a 5 year old.  You have several quests to do which means you do the quest in one day and finish it correctly.  There is also an overarching quest that you will collect pieces for throughout your play and later on exclusively for those pieces.  Each of the characters you interact with has quirks and as you play and choose different dialog options or other actions you will learn these quirks and discover hints to help you along the different quests.\n\nSome things about the game:\n[list]\n    [*]It took me about 5 hours to complete the game.  I did look up help with a few bits and pieces so if you don't do that expect around 6 hours of playtime for one game.  \n    [*]While some things must be done in a very specific order and precisely accurate, I did find a few places where you could change how you did things and still get the desired outcome.\n    [*]You can restart the room you are in if you make a mistake.  I loved this because sometimes I just misclicked and didn't want to have to start the entire day over again.  However, there are times when you get to the end of the day and realize you screwed up in the beginning and MUST start the day over again.  It can be a bit frustrating, but you are actually going to do the day over about 20 to 30 times.  Plus you'll have restarts that don't count which might increase that to about 40 times. \n    [*]The game is all about learning how the characters react to what you say, what items you have on you, and WHEN you talk to them.  So it really is trial and error and going down that mental checklist of, 'have I done this that way yet?'\n    [*]It is repetitive, but I never found it boring repetitive.  Each character quest feels very different. \n    [*]You get hints from the game that you can look over for help and you have a task list for each room as you go through the day to help you remember what you need to do with your quests.\n[/list]\n\nI honestly don't have many negatives other than I'm sad it's over.  I've started another game so I can replay it.  I'm not sure how many times I'll replay it before it wears out though.\n\nI highly recommend this game.

In Kindergarten, you play through each student's story by assisting them throughout the day for key items to help solve the muder case. \n\nReview: \n10/10 \nI got kindergarten as a gift.. and I admit I didnt like it at first but this game really grew on me. Its funny, cute and has a southpark vibe to it that I love. Kindergarten has dark humor and is pretty violent; i think personally you have to have a fucked up sense of humor to enjoy it and i really like it so far so lmao. \n\nConcept: \nIn Kindergarten, you play the same day over and over again. So that means that the dialogs and events in each day will stay the same unless you presue a characters story by trying to get them to like you. If you succeed, the character will give you an item which will help solve the mysterious murder. \n\nStory: \nI love story-rich games but I personally dont think Kindergarten has a that much of a story. It relies a lot on its humor and puzzles to get the players involved. [spoiler] Although youre trying to get answers for what happened; its pretty obvious what will happen at the end. \nUPDATE: actually no it's not obvious what happens in the end. there's a fucking alien monster underground hideout under the school lol. [/spoiler]\n\nCharacters: \nYou pretty much have all the classic essential characters in school. The bully, mean girl, nice girl, werido, rich kid, nerd and a collection of pretty fucked up teachers. All the characters are halarious and weird in their own way. They all grow on you as you go through their stories. [spoiler] I ship Nugget and Lily so hard lol [/spoiler]. \n\nGraphic and Design: \nI admire the design choice for this game. It's basic and cute which is a hard contrast to the gore and dark humor. I think it was a good idea since it just makes everything more funnier and amusing. At first, I didnt think the graphics were worth the money you were paying but it really fits the story.", "timestamp_created": 1497277519, "timestamp_updated": 1497642775, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560438", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32357922": {"recommendationid": "32357922", "author": {"steamid": "76561198194780375", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 341, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503820994}, "language": "english", "review": "LOL love this game cant wait for number 2 (if it comes out)\n", "timestamp_created": 1497242411, "timestamp_updated": 1497242411, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32353562": {"recommendationid": "32353562", "author": {"steamid": "76561198278019458", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498239824}, "language": "english", "review": "messed up af\n\n\n\n\n9/11 would destroy the world with cards again :D", "timestamp_created": 1497220600, "timestamp_updated": 1497220600, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32353314": {"recommendationid": "32353314", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154627377", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 576, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501257015}, "language": "english", "review": "Perfect game.

The game plays almost like an episode of South Park, but with more crass humor, less social satire and every character having Kenny's ability to not stay dead after getting killed in brutal ways. Your basic objective is to survive through each day of class (And believe me, you being a little infant will not exempt you from possible death if you screw up), but you can also undertake one of multiple missions to earn the friendship of one of your classmates. The missions allow for slight variation in the ways you can complete them, and relate with each other via the rewards you get. It also adds to its replayability: One day of class is pretty short, but you will need to go through multiple ones to see all the endings to the character arcs, as well as all possible interactions, not to mention the collectible cards. You're gonna need those if you want to see something special.\n\nThe characters are all stereotypes of classic school kid tropes: There's the bully, the cool kid, the smart guy, the weirdo, the alpha bitch... But they are made charming by being exaggerated to give the game a black comedy flavor that got a few chuckles from me. For example, the bully and the alpha bitch will not hesitate to send your sorry ass to the morgue if you anger them, the smart kid is a smuggler and the weirdo... Well, I could tell you about the weirdo, but I would be spoiling too much. They are a funny bunch, that's for sure.\n\nAnother point in its favor is the fact that the developer, unlike many other developers who release their games in early access, stays in touch with the community, pays attention to bug reports and does his best to solve them. That's the main reason why, even in its early access state, this is a fun and entertaining game, and you should give it a try.

A kid named [spoiler]Billy[/spoiler] has gone missing; his friend and his sister [spoiler]Nugget[/spoiler] and [spoiler]Lily[/spoiler] (respectively)  [i]\"knows who knows\"[/i]. \n\nYou complete missions from each character: [spoiler]Buggs, Cindy, Monty, Jerome, Nugget, Ms. Applegate and Lily[/spoiler], in which you gain items from them as you complete them. [b] Note, some missions require you to obtain an item which you receive from a different mission[/b].\nEach mission is unique and provides different routes and dialogues. [spoiler]The Janitor will impale you with his mop if you continue to bug him; as long as you dont have an item to get you out of the situation. Similarily, the principal will shoot you if you say the wrong things.[/spoiler]\n\nYou can buy items from [i]Monty[/i] providing you have the money. One thing I disliked about the game was you can only have $10 in your piggy bank at home, however it does solve the problem of everyone completing Monty's mission too easily: [spoiler]You need $20 dollars at the end of the day (after show and tell) to complete the mission, bearing in mind Buggs will steal half of your money you bring to Kindergarten (if you bring over $3). To complete this mission, you should buy the yo-yo and screwdriver from Monty before morning time and then talk to Nugget and get sent to the Principal's office. During morning time you can sell the pills you got from the Principal and give Jerome the yo-yo: in which he then gives you a stolen hall pass for you to go to the Janitors closet. inside there is a box with $5, then unscrew the shelf and get out of there. You know have a hall pass to sell and you also gained $5. Skip through the rest of the day to earn more money.[/spoiler]\n\nThe ending will surprise you, however I will not include it in the review, you should really buy the game to find out yourself. The game is great! There si a secret thing at the end in nuggets cave when you get all the cards. But this has not been released yet, and I am waiting to see it for myself.

This game is recommended for those who enjoy over the top characters, dialogue that would make anyone shocked that someone could even come up with this stuff, and enraging moments where you realize you must restart the whole day. This game is kind of a rage game, as for if you forgot to do something and made it all the way to the end, you'll have to restart your whole day and do the whole thing again. This may make the game seem super tedious, but when you do advance the story and do things correctly, it makes you feel really smart! The story is really interesting, as for you must do certain quests to get items and use the items you get to complete other certain quests. This is interesting, but once again, makes the game very repetitive and gets annoying after a while.

I feel super glad that this was the first game on Steam that I finally have beaten, (Since I usually only play Rocket League) and it has also let me to laughs and awes.  I have to admit, I did see the ending to the game, but what I didn't expect was those creepy white monsters.  Saving Billy was the best achievement of the game, so I don't know how the creators can possibly add on to the game.  I would definetly buy the second game if I got the chance to.  \n\nFor those of you that gave negative reviews, I am really disappointed in you.  By far, this is one of the best Steam games that I have ever played, and I hope that it stays that way.  Paying the five dollars for this game was worth it, and if they did have any updates to it, I suggest that you play it quickly.  I wish I did some youtube videos for the game, but instead, I just watch Jacksepticeye, and if I need help on Monsterman cards, then Bubble Knight Gaming.\n\nThe Best Parts Of The Game: Becoming friends with Nugget and going into the Nugget Cave was one of my favorite parts, not because it led me closer to Billy, but because I thought that this was a secret part of the game.  I did not have to look up any YouTube tutorials on how to get there, it was just simply by befriending Nugget when the teacher wanted me to.  There was another way to get to the Nugget Cave without the Ms. Applegate, but I had forgotten it.  The second best was the ending, obviously because I saved Billy, but also because I got clues to find all Monsterman cards.\n\nQuestions:\n- Why do the hints appear after you completed finding the Monsterman card, if normally you'd get hints before you find it?\n- Is there a way for me to get Early Access to the complete version of the second game (If there is one)?\n- How was the Janitor part of this, and why did he not die when you fought the principal?\n\nAnyways, that is my thought on the matter.  If you are considering buying this, I definetly would if I were you.

In its early access the game has only some items, 8 achievements and 8 storylines for all the achievements (after a storyline it will give u achievement). So i think after the early access there will be SO MUCH MORE to play in the game and the game should be way more than 5euro.\n\n10/10 - one of the most enjoyable games ever.

I completely forgot after playing it for like 5 minutes, it feels complete in its current state. Granted I haven't finished every route or collected every card yet.\n\nAs far as talking about the game itself, all you really need to know is: Groundhog Day meets Happy Tree Friends, as an adventure game. It's got an Invader Zim \"gruesome horror hidden in plain sight but everyone except you is too stupid or apathetic or medicated to notice\" feel, while being bright and peppy and sugary sweet. It tackles the complexity of player choices by having the day reset after the end of every day except for your money (up to $10) and key items, which makes it a series of puzzles you solve with dialog trees and the resources you got from previous playthroughs. Very compelling.

The gateway to hell. Where show and tell is a battle to survive, the teacher really is out to get you, and Monday never ends. Literally--Tuesday does not exist in this game. I don't remember Kindergarten being this hard.\n\nWhat starts off as a seemingly cute and charming school scene gets dark rather quickly, and for all that you have to fear from the downright sadistic and unchild-friendly staff harboring dark secrets, it is the antics of the classmates you will be forced to call allies that comes off as more disturbing. It kind of says something when even the obvious evil and violent tendencies of the principal or janitor pale in comparison to that of your \"good\" classmates who almost gleefully encourage you to perform increasingly horrible tasks and even outright murder. This game isn't only filled with Videogame Cruelty Potential, it's where I imagine the trope went to learn its trade. And no, the fact that these are children will not protect you or anyone else. You can be killed. You can also kill or cause the deaths or trauma of the people you encounter. You can get one of your classmates beaten to severe hospitalization with a mop or cause another two to attempt suicide. Taunt a classmate about thier broken home or gain their trust only to stab them in the back (or face) later. Or even wipe out your entire class much to the cackling glee of your teacher. You know, for kids!\n\nUltimately you have to undergo every potential storyline in order to make it to the \"true\" ending and discover what's really going on at the school (well, partly at least, there is no explanation for Nugget). All in all, it was incredibly easy to complete the game within 8 hours, but those were 8 very fun-filled hours. Trying to figure out which set actions and events could get me which results was trying and frustrating at points, but the humor and storylines (mostly the humor) made it well worth it. \n\nThe cons are that it is short and can get repetitive. You have to complete each \"path\" in order to get what you will need to reach the true ending, meaning you have to keep replaying the same day over and over again and do some very questionable things in order to progress. It's a lot of trial and error to figure out what to do for each person's path and you can only reset back to the start of the class period to try again if you mess up unless you want to play the entire day all over again--which you will have to do if you missed something from earlier on in the day. Fortunately, since each playthrough can be completed in a relatively short amount of time, there isn't too much you have to go through to get back to where you need to be. In addition, you can pass time immediately if you want to end the day quickly and get extra money doing so, and you'll be fine as long as you have something acceptable to present for Show and Tell at the end of the day. Money and certain unlockable items can be carried over in each playthrough, and once you have these items, they will remain unlocked and you don't have to try to get them again (unless you want to).\n\nAnother issue is that the game is still in Early Access. There are still a number of bugs and glitches in the game, and some features aren't available yet. I've had occasions where I would try to reset to the beginning of a class period only to be told upon doing so that the bell just rang and class is over--requiring a second reset of the class period in order to return to the beginning and play normally. These issues are still being worked on, and it's questionable when the game will be completed and all aspects corrected. Even so, you can get through the overall plot, complete every person's questline, and obtain all of the Monstermon cards as it stands currently.\n\nAll in all, the game is fairly short and while the playthroughs can get repetitive, with all the options available, that's not to say they are tedious--though you do have to be careful with the dialogue options to have specific outcomes be made available that aren't otherwise obvious.

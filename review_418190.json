First off, the game drops to like 10fps when you full screen. There is a workaround for it, but I shouldn't have to do so and I've played other games using the same engine version without this problem.\n\nSecondly, the controls. I have a Dual Shock 3 and it sets my left stick as the movement. This along with the fact that the game is only 4 way directional and your character runs everywhere they go makes even navigating the game world a chore. All too often I pass up my destination by a tile or two or it detects slight movement in an adjacent direction. This means when I'm holding right but move it even slightly up, it will now register as only 'up' being pressed since there's no diagonals. The worst part about it all is that there's no key or button binding options at all and users will have to resort to external solutions a second time just to make the game tolerable.\n\nThis is all a real pity because of what I did play, the battle system looks well thought out. The graphics are great even if the sprites are a bit small in-battle, but they are well animated. The extreme briefness of the intro is right up my alley. All of this means nothing though if the base controls and display have to be modified outside the game program making for a frustrating and inconvenient experience for most.", "timestamp_created": 1511461503, "timestamp_updated": 1511461610, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37150443": {"recommendationid": "37150443", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991858771", "num_games_owned": 313, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 288, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475568426}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow, I wasn't sure whether this will  be a ride I would recommend or not. Turns out - yes I really would!\n \nThis game is quite nice - and rather short. Is this a negative? I am not quite sure due to the battle system. I am not quite sure if I would have enjoyed it that much when it would be double the length. The game mechanic does a nice twist to the common turn-based RPG battle system. Every attack (determined by the weapon you choose every turn, you will have a handful like some game series heroes) will take some time to do - leaving you open or defending you the time doing so. The same goes for your enemies. Knowing when to strike, when to defend is crucial. Sounds nice, works nice but can get stale over the time.\n\nThe story isn't that big of an impact - though it is nice to experience (similar to a bed time story. You enjoy it, maybe learn a thing or two, and can move on.)\n\nYou get roughly 2 hours to 6 hours playtime. Replay-value isn't that high I'd say, so people want to squeeze every playtime hour out of their dollar, this could be the wrong game. You get a really nice little game for a really nice price.

You pick a weapon that blocks as much damage as it Def stats says it does, then after a number of tick equal to its Spd, you deal damage equal to its Effectiveness (minus enemy armor, of course). Same for the enemy, repeat until one side runs out of life points. There's pretty much no randomness involved, it's about picking the right strategy and luring the enemy into making a mistake.\n\nThis results in an extremely neat and satisfying combat. Truly one of the most rewarding and engaging combat system I have [b]ever[/b] seen in a RPG, and I do not say that lightly. And on top of that, the story is interesting, surprisingly less predictable than I'd have thought, and there are man great characters.\n\nGiven the cost of this game, it'd be a crime not to try it if

Topped off with that the areas are large, full of fun and mind challenging puzzles which may leave you scratching your head. It's full of cute enemies, spooky skelebones that like to run up on you sometimes, it's all just great.

It was well done and I adore the game and main character for how cute and relatable they all are. It's just great, it really is and for under three dollars you really can't go wrong. Do check it out! \n\nPros: Great combat system, unique and interesting characters, cool item varieties and strategies that you can adapt around them, a cute heroine and a bunch of lovable enemies and villains, cool secrets and plot points, twists and jokes and much more.\n\nCons: Predictable combat later in the game, some areas are buggy, some areas have the potential to outright crash you.

The combat is turn-based and single party and uses a \"tick\" system which gives it some tactical chops but can become repetitive since it's mostly about finding the winning pattern for a certain type of enemy and then repeating it when you come across it again.  Bosses fights are mostly well-done and require some planning.  Thankfully, the game is short enough to avoid becoming too repetitive (around 5 hours or so) and the difficult scales well until the last area of the game, which is mercifully short.  A big plus for being able to see enemies on the map so you can avoid them when you feel like it.\n\nThe dungeon design was much better than I expected from a 1.99 RPGMaker game.  There's some clever hidden paths and shortcuts and dungeons are more than a series of connected hallways.  The only downside to dying is being booted out of a dungeon, though your character moves quickly and it's easy to get back to where you left off, so you don't have to worry about lost progress to a fight gone bad.  You can also save everywhere and that always rules.\n\nHelen doesn't level up, but you get experience that you can put toward leveling items and they serve as the primary means of doing damage, avoiding damage and healing.  This is also the rare game that makes a good case for a limited inventory, since all the items you find can be useful.  It's nice to play a game where treasure chests aren't random crafting garbage or \"sword you already have+1\".  There's even a neat little treasure room set-up that makes dropping and reacquiring items simple and easy.  It's a surprisingly smart system where there's a room filled with chests you've found throughout the game.  Drop an item anywhere and it reappears here if you want to pick it up again.  It's simple and useful and I can't understand why more games wouldn't use such a method to keep track of treasure.\n\nStory is pretty minimal until the last part of the game and is bland and generic for the most part.  Being bland and generic is okay when there's not much talking and most of it is light and comedic but once \"cut-scenes\" start being more than about a couple of exchanges long, the mostly mediocre writing becomes annoying and you're just skimming dialogue.  That said, for the most part it's okay in a bland way and can be somewhat humorous at times.\n\nOn the downside, there's the typical RPGMaker clunk.   You can't customize controls without third-party software, can't change the level of in-game music (it's really loud at low universal computer settings), the controls when moving around are kind of stiff and event flags can be kind of finicky at triggering.  There's one area in particular when I had to \"sit\" on a chair next to a table to trigger an event, which I didn't realize you could do since I figured the chair was a a solid object.  I figured out what to do after a while but there's a few areas of the game that have this \"I know what to do, but I can't quite figure out how to trigger it\" problem.\n\nThere's also a bizarre widespread bug where you have to enter a double door building by the right door instead of the left one, otherwise the game will crash.  This is really annoying since it happens immediately after a boss fight.\n\nAll in all, I went in with no expectations for HMC and was quite surprised there was a solid, little game here.  If you can put up with RPGMaker clunk, there's a decent game here with some good ideas that could have really benefited from a larger scope.", "timestamp_created": 1508991099, "timestamp_updated": 1508991814, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.692508", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35933734": {"recommendationid": "35933734", "author": {"steamid": "76561198220694752", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508993311}, "language": "english", "review": "Hello, I enjoy Helen's Mysterious Castle very much.

Each weapon or spell has a \"wait\" stat on it that decreases the time you have until the enemy's next attack, ensuring that you have to pay close attention to every battle instead of just mashing the confirm button to move onward. The amount of swords, shields, bows, and spells you collect with varying wait stats offer a plethora of options in combat.\n\nThe plot honestly took me by surprise by starting off as yet another \"the amnesiac hero is on a quest to discover who they truly are\" story, yet there are enough twists and turns throughout the story combined with simple yet enjoyable characters that it manages to be a memorable tale by the time you get to the end.

If you're familiar with Cave Story, then you're already familiar with how a simply presented game on the surface can provide much more than you've bargained for.\n\nHelen's Mysterious Castle has all the fundamental things that make up a good game; an intuitive and unique easy-to-learn combat system, a developing story with humorous characters, proper difficulty scaling as you progress, and some minor exploration to unlock more equipment. The store page implies the game to be a bit difficult, and it can be if you aren't thinking proactively in battle and levelling up your weapons as you progress. Fortunately, I never found myself having to grind just to get past a part in the game. It's difficult for any game to find that \"challenging but not unfair\" feel, and I think Helen's Mysterious Castle nails it well.\n\nRight off the bat, it's easy for a player to notice several small things that seem off-putting or otherwise incomplete, such as Helen's lack of proper dialogue or inability to read. This isn't the developers being lazy; [spoiler]there are plot reasons for this that are explained in-game.[/spoiler] Any backtracking (which is completely optional in a casual playthrough) is helped with quick shortcuts to-and-from towns and areas that are unlocked as you complete them, so there's no need to trek all the way through a dungeon just to get to the next area if you've already done so before. The only reason you'd backtrack in this game is if you missed an item or equipment in a section and want to go back and get it.\n\nIt's easy to quickly judge and dismiss any RPGmaker game, but the experience I felt from Helen's Mysterious Castle is a significant cut above what you'd expect to feel from an RPGmaker game. I'd easily recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun RPG to play, especially if you're on a budget.", "timestamp_created": 1506761456, "timestamp_updated": 1506837780, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35251823": {"recommendationid": "35251823", "author": {"steamid": "76561198267233595", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 479, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506557650}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Usualmente no me gustan los juegos con RPGMaker pero este, es una hermosura.

Since it's all based on visible numbers (no real status effects, delays or anything to speak of), there is no real strategy involved. You just get the best gear that you can and there will always be a 'best' approach to combat, with no reason to deviate from that.\n\nNarrative is nothing special, either.\n\nThe real problem, though, is the technical execution. A few points in short:\n\n- No usable Fullscreen mode (dev even recommends to play in windowed mode on this very store page)\n- No possibility to load in-game or way to get back to main menu (in fact no pause menu at all). If you want to load a previous save, you have to Alt-F4 and restart\n- Gamebreaking bug after a few hours that the dev is incapable of fixing\n\nAll of these issues are inacceptable for a commercial release, even if it is cheap. For an 'okay' game, I am not willing to put in a lot of research to get it running myself. Perused the Steam forums to verify that the dev is not able or interested to resolve the issues with the game, then uninstalled.\n\nEDIT: I did file a request to receive my money back, however, since the gamebreaking bug occurs more than 2 hours after starting the game, that is not possible. This is, of course, not the fault of the developer, you just have to deal with the fact that Valve apparently can sell a defective product created by somebody who doesn't know what they are doing and not reimburse the cost if it doesn't feel like it.", "timestamp_created": 1504961779, "timestamp_updated": 1505560696, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.382565", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34824648": {"recommendationid": "34824648", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031071497", "num_games_owned": 203, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504910094}, "language": "english", "review": "I would certainly have to recommend this game. It's not very expensive and it manages to have some fun and clever gameplay for an rpg to mix things up a bit. While the game outwardly has a very cutsy and sometimes silly demeanor, there does seem to be a hint of some more serious things going on. What I can only describe as the \"Wait\" system has been very well implemented and adds a certain amount of complexity and strategy to battles despite the limited number of actual moves. Personally I felt it was kind of nice that there is little random chance and most things are a direct result of your actions. Another thing that was kind of nice was that it was not random battles and battles only started when you touched an enemy on the map. The developer also managed to utilize experience in a very interesting way that didn't really make the game feel grindy. The art direction and hud as well as the user interface are all very efficiently designed.  The only things that took away from this game for me was that it can be a little jumpy when you move, the game does not appear to be very long(Though for the asking price I can't really call this a fault), and I unfortunately experienced a  game breaking bug pretty late into the game. However, as far as I can tell this is a rather rare thing to happen so I can still freely reccomend this game. For all it's faults it does enough right in unique manner that I think it is certainly worth a try, especially for the price. One of these days I'll probably go at it again with a new save and see if I can get past that bug.

Das rundenbasierte System basiert auf folgenden drei Werten, wodurch es sich recht tatktisch anf\u00fchlt: [list]\n    [*] [i]Effectivity[/i] \u2013 Dieser Wert gibt an wieviel Schaden mit einem Angriff theoretisch verursacht wird.\n    [*] [i]Defensive[/i] \u2013 Dieser Wert gibt an wieviel Schaden eines Angriffs absorbiert wird. Beispielsweise bei einem Effektivit\u00e4tswert von 10 gegen\u00fcber einem Defensivwert von 9 w\u00fcrde also nur ein Schadenspunkt beim Ziel ankommen bzw. wirken.\n    [*] [i]Wait[/i] \u2013 Dieser Wert gibt an wie lange es dauert bis ein Angriff ausgef\u00fchrt wird\n[/list]\nAlles in allem fand ich es gelungen und kann mich da \u00fcber das System an sich nicht beklagen. Eher \u00fcber die steile Levelkurve die teilweise doch Grinding erfordert.\n\nDas Artdesign ist f\u00fcr ein RPG-Maker-Spiel ansprechend. Die Levels sind klug aufgebaut und mit Liebe zum Detail.\nDie Musik passt zur Story und ist eing\u00e4ngig, neigt aber auch gelegentlich ins Kitschige abzudriften. Das gleiche gilt auch f\u00fcr die Story, die zwar einen Twist aufweist aber jetzt wirklich nichts besonderes ist. Mal wieder Amnesie, na gut. Wer auf cheesige Stories steht wird damit vielleicht seinen Spa\u00df haben. Mir war es aber etwas zu arg und zudem kommt sie auch nur langsam in Fahrt.\n\nNegativ ist aber, wie schon erw\u00e4hnt, leider einfach, dass das Spiel ziemlich grindanf\u00e4llig ist und zudem einiges an Backtracking vorkommt, was es, gerade zu Anfang des Spiels, sehr repetitiv macht und dem Spieler all seine Geduld abverlangt.\nPositiv wiederum, dass man nicht an die Hand genommen wird und selbst herausfinden muss, was als n\u00e4chstes ansteht und wo man hin muss. Wobei man sp\u00e4ter auch einen Begleiter optional ansprechen kann, der dann einem mehr oder weniger hilfreiche Hinweise gibt.\n\nWirklich Spa\u00df hatte ich mit der Ausr\u00fcstung. Da ne Balance zu finden. Nach den ersten K\u00e4mpfen merkt man schon auf was man achten m\u00fcsste und kann entsprechend justieren. Nehme ich z.B. lieber die Armbrust mit oder behalte ich den Bogen. Der Bogen ist schneller (kleinerer Wait-Wert) wohingegen die Armbrust mehr Schaden austeilt.\n\nFazit:\nWem die Negativpunkte nichts ausmachen, sie anders gewichtet als ich oder einfach ein Faible f\u00fcr rundenbasierte JRPGS hat, der kann mal einen Blick wagen.\nAllgemein w\u00fcrde ich aber sagen, dass das gelungene Kampfsystem und die gelungene Equipmentbalance nicht die M\u00e4ngel in Story und Pacing (Grinding, Backtracking) wettmacht.", "timestamp_created": 1496419719, "timestamp_updated": 1496663410, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

Helen? Well, she is a young girl of few words, she can\u2019t read but loves a good steak! Helen\u2019s true forte is bravery. She will embark on an epic journey, fighting enemies twice her size in exciting dungeons. Are you ready to play Helen\u2019s Mysterious Castle? I knew you would be!\n\nHelen\u2019s Mysterious Castle is an RPG maker game where you will take the protagonist \u201cHelen\u201d into mazes and dungeons on a floating Island.\n\nThe game will start in a cute cottage where Helen lives with her brother, Ardis. Our heroin can\u2019t read at this stage and does not speak either. She has been advised by her brother not to venture into the northern ruins as they are full of dangers. Well, what did she do? Exactly the opposite. She picked up a longbow and started her perilous journey. \n\nAs she progresses into her journey, she will encounter a vast number of enemies, such as Orcs, Slimes, Goblins, Skeletons, Zombies, Griffiths, Harpy and many more. However, her first real challenge is to defeat the demon king and his four henchmen \u2013 Lord of Darkness, Lord of Poison, Lord of Paralysis and Lord of Silence. Be prepared for epic battles! \nA battle will start as soon as Helen touches an enemy. Depending on how far along you are in the game, you might have a selection of weapons (melee and range), magic spells (from books) and protective gears to choose from. The fighting mechanisms are very simple and easy to use. When Helen wins a battle, she is awarded experience points which you can use to upgrade weapons, spells and armour. Later on, Helen will be able to receive upgrades at the local blacksmith, too. Make sure you talk to all characters within the town when you reach that stage to progress further into the story. A quick tip for you - Helen will come across sparkling waters from time to time; these waters will regenerate her health when she drinka it. Also, make sure to break all pots you see laying around; some of them have additional health points hiding in them. Chesta and books (spells) can also be found in the dungeons.\n\nI am absolutely amazed at how good this game is, and pleasantly surprised at its price point, at only $2. Fabulous content and re-playability. \n\nNice graphics and simple combat mechanism. However, you will reach a point where the fights are too easy to win, in my opinion.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-\tNice graphics\n-\tLarge number of enemies\n-\tGood dungeons\n-\tFun, addictive and good re-playability \n-\tGreat price\n-\tTrading cards \n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~ \n\n-\tEasy to win a battle in the latest stage of the game\n-\tNo achievements\n\nA fantastic RPG maker game at a sensational price.

It is quite interesting and I did actually like some of the characters. I was left with a sense of accomplishment when it was all over, which is nostalgic in a way.\n\n\nGameplay\n\nHere's where things get interesting. The battle system is like something I've never played before, it's really unique. Wait time is the biggest factor when it comes to battles. NOW, HERE'S THE REASON FOR THE -1: You cannot load the game from a previous save after you die, you have to restart the game and then hit continue. Kind of a pain, but not too big of a deal. ALSO IMPORTANT: REFINE YOUR WEAPONS AND ITEMS OR ELSE YOU'LL BE SORRY. I got stuck on one of the final bosses because of this. After you get far enough, a certain person is no longer available, so you cannot refine items which made it impossible to progress.\n\n\nSound\n\nMusic is an easy 10/10. Sound effects and soundtrack fit this game perfectly especially during the boss fights and towards the end of the game.\n\n\nGraphics\n\nGood looking game for the price. The animations are well done and the battles are more interesting because of that. \n\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nBuy this game. This was an interesting journey and I think anyone would be able to enjoy it. It's simple, yet takes some strategy, but one is still left with a sense of accomplishment. So far, this has been one of my favorite games on Steam.

It's well reviewed but I had never heard of it so I was skeptical. This game is absolutely [b]awesome[/b].\n\nThe game has a unique battle system that is fun to discover. The system requires you to manage which ability you use based on your enemy's next move and in how much time they will use their ability. By studying your enemy's skillset you can trick them into using specific abilities which would you put you in a better situation. For example, if you start the battle with a quick attack they will start with a defense ability that lasts a while which gives you plenty of time to cast your spells. Learning how to juggle your foe is awesome.\n\nThe game also has very well designed levels. Nothing feels inflated for the sake of increasing the game time. Not only do the levels feel right, there are secret passages that lead to new items -- it rewards exploration. The secret passages are super obvious but there are visual cues that hint at something, so if you're attentive you'll be rewarded!\n\nAnother aspect that I loved about this game was the story. While the game starts off light on story, it's unravels itself as you explore the castle. I wanted to keep playing to find out what was going to happen next. This feeling was intensified by the awesome cast of characters. If I were to describe them in reference to another game, I'd say they are UnderTale-like. The type of characters I wouldn't be surprised to find in a Saturday morning cartoon. Fun and full of personality.\n\n[h1]The Bad[/h1]\n\nWhile I loved the characters, I think some of the charm is removed by the naming convention. [spoiler] The ancient hero from 100 years ago was named Alex. The new hero's name is Zack.[/spoiler]  The protagonist is Helen. I mean, might as well call it Brittney's Mysterious Castle. It's not a huge deal but it is a little immersion breaking, doesn't quite fit the setting.\n\nSome of the translation was a little sloppy. There were a few typos (albeit not many) but quite a few broken characters.\n\n[h1]The Ugly[/h1]\n\nLet's be honest, the game makes use of some of the default assets. That's a bit of a turnoff and is one of the reason I was skeptical when I was going into the game.

Suddenly those bosses are much more reasonable.)\n\nJust a charming, wonderful little game, and the $2 price point can't be beat.", "timestamp_created": 1485654677, "timestamp_updated": 1485654677, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29552717": {"recommendationid": "29552717", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120554220", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485646184}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a fantastic game and at 2$ it's great purchase.

1484921940}, "language": "english", "review": "Helen's Mysterious Castle is an absolute beauty of a game. It is made with RPGmaker but it has the nostalgia kind of feels towards the environment and characters. This game is an dungeon explorer, working with floors and puzzles, and also an RPG in terms of combat and story. \n\nThe environment of the game very nice. The music is pretty good but I wish there was an option to lower it or make it louder. The dungeons themself, there are 4 floors which are pretty well structured. I like how they did hide some of the items although in your first playthrough you are definitly going to miss half of them because they have a secret part of the wall where you can go in or something like that. Unfortunately due to the top down view of the dungeon you can't really see them. There is mostly healing provided at the beginning of a dungeon or sometimes in the middle. In the end of most dungeons, unless the boss is guarding something like an item you need to beat them to get into a new dungeon. Bosses get exponentially harder each time and you will need a decent strategy to be able to beat them.\n\nThe story starts off with a lot of questions, you literally get thrown out in the game without any sense of who is who and what the backstory is at all. For some reason she cannot read nor speak but whenever doing a certain chain of events she gets to read a little bit. I like the silent protagonist it fits the story because you are supposed to be a girl who suffered a blackout for a very long time and she wants to explore the world, or castle in this game. Like with the items advancing the story is also figuring it out along the way. In your first playthrough you are probably going to miss a few things or won't understand some puzzles along the way but don't worry it's normal in this game. I guess the abstractness is part of the challenge. The story really catches you with a fishing rod and reels you in successfully. Your vision of each character changes the longer you play. Not to mention the plot twists which come along. All the questions that were open in the beginning of the game are answered throughout the game which is nice. Along with a nice story belongs a certain level of humor, which I felt like they did achieve in this game, I laughed everytime because the timing and the joke themselfs were on point. The game gives the player the option to choose between two endings a good and a bad one. I don't think that should be an option since the bad ending just results in getting out in the heat of the action and missing the most heroic ending I've seen in ages.\n\nThe combat system is also something the developper should be proud of. Instead of the standard I get to stab the enemy gets to stab turn system they have worked out something that really makes you strategise more. In your inventory you can hold 8 items max and you can choose from a wide variety from weapons and shields or spells which you can level with XP or holding passive items which gives you a minor but mandatory boost sometime. Spells have different kinds of effects like healing, piercing, stunning, poisoning, silencing or absorbing. Unfortunately is that you get only to play yourself with the first two types of effetcs. I would have loved to try out the others. Every action has a waiting duration, this counts for you and the enemy you are facing. This means that you need to strategise which item to use and when and when to block and when to attack or when to heal. The surprise effect is in the beginning of the battle because they don't show what they queued until you have queued something. Most battles follow an algoritm, this also counts for some boss battles but they can go off from that algoritm. If it does happen it's mostly a counter to what you have queued up. Without a decent strategy you might die sometimes which is not as bad as it sounds. When you die you get extra max HP up to 90 (means that this works until 90, not that you get 90 instantly).\n\nAll in all a good RPG which shows that going aside from the RPG standards won't always result in a bad game. A very good catchy story, good combat system and lovable environment and characters. What I'm most surprised about is the costs of the trading cards if you are into that market.

There's no option/quit/load/load another save file.  Even though you'll have the option to save at anytime, there are certain areas of the game you trek through again but in order to avoid that you have to reload your save file.  It's very rare RPG Maker or not to run into a game with this failed feature.\n\nAside that, this game has it's own cute charm and it's a gem in its own way.  This game is more of a thumbs in the middle review (hence thumbs down).\n\nI didn't get the MC (Helen all too well) she was a non spoken progtanist but some of the dialog from the npcs gave you the impression of her responses.  For an elf, shes pretty ditzy.  Not sure If I liked the \"?\" \"!\" chat choices or not.\n\nThe battle system, for the most part is very unique.  Until near the end the AI gets a bit \"TOO\" smart for it's own good which becomes frustrating at times.  Which goes back to point one, of restarting your game.  When you get killed, you go back to your starting point of the first floor.  There are short cuts you unlock along the way but to make the trek back is still tedious it's better just to reload your save to reattempt a boss fight.  I had friends asking me \"What's wrong with the game?  Why are you starting it so many times?\"  I signed off my friends list just to spare them the annoyance.\n\nThis game reminded me of a condence version of Final Fantasy Legend for the gameboy.  Which was really cool and I liked that.  Tip to the developer:  Please for your future games ADD a reload feature, don't force a player to completely exit the game to restart.\n\nIF you can get passed the constant exiting at certain times, Helen's Mysterious Castle was a cute gem all in it's own and you should certainly try it.", "timestamp_created": 1484825972, "timestamp_updated": 1484825972, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.461292", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29329109": {"recommendationid": "29329109", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057683743", "num_games_owned": 267, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 460, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484933639}, "language": "english", "review": "god dammit .....\n\ni opened the game ....\nsaid meeh looks bad ....\nfelt like closing it ....\ntold my self that i should give it a try at least ....\n\n\nclosed it 7 hours later ( when i cleared the game )\n- i know i took longer than i should :D but you know noobs are noobs no matter what -", "timestamp_created": 1484707274, "timestamp_updated": 1484707274, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29321690": {"recommendationid": "29321690", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096844323", "num_games_owned": 211, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499277670}, "language": "english", "review": "Fullscreen doesnt work on my screen which runs 1080p.

It takes the turn based system of most rpgs and adds a timer to every attack, turning it into a much more strategic experience. You have to time your attacks so you can block damage when your opponents attack while landing damage when you do.\n\nEnemies mostly have their own attack patterns, and will change things up to try and counter your moves. And so long as you're strong and skilled enough, you can beat virtually any foe without taking a scratch.\n\nBoss fights are exceptionally creative, often times pushing you to your limits. And all of them are memorable.\n\nThe game is short, but charming. It starts out with you having no clue who you are or where you are. And as you progress, things start to make more sense. The ending itself is so fun, I've played this game an extra time or two just to enjoy it again.\n\nThis game costs only $2.00. It'd almost be a crime not to buy it. It goes WAY beyond what you'd expect to find from an RPG Maker game.\n\nAnd just a pro-tip. About mid-way through the game, you can have a town's blacksmith upgrade your tools. Don't ask him to upgrade anything that you haven't upgraded to +9 already. Otherwise, you're just wasting your time.", "timestamp_created": 1483649671, "timestamp_updated": 1483649671, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000",

Its cheap (and I don't mean the price) and unfair. You fight the damn skeleton at the beginning after he knocks out half your health in one hit if he doesn't kill you in two, go restore your health at the only available spot outside, come back in and...oh would you look at that, the skeleton is back again blocking the door so he can take off half your health or kill you again, so you have to go back outside to restore your health, so he can come back and do it again. You get no potions, no other means of getting health back aside from a steak that gives you 1 extra HP. Big whoop. How about a five-course dinner that gives you a thousand HP, since you'll need that much to ever get past the second floor of the Dungeon of Death.\n\nOh, and there's that nice unavoidable monster that runs in on the next floor after you get the thunder ability, which he then promptly takes from you after he picks his teeth with Helen's balsa wood bones.\n\nTo the creator of this game, what the hell were you thinking?", "timestamp_created": 1483225525, "timestamp_updated": 1483225525, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.190489", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28868927": {"recommendationid": "28868927", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084617081", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 552, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483186391}, "language": "english", "review": "When you start up the game, you're kind of thrown into the world without much explaination or background to the story, which might throw some people off, but everything gradually unfolds as you play; I think the idea was that you're playing as Helen, who doesn't know much, herself, and as she learns new things, you learn along with her.\n\nThroughout the game, you're given a lot of save file slots, which you may or may not use--you're also limited on how many items you can carry with you and forced to drop some in order to get others.  That might be concerning at first, but the game is easily playable without a guide, while still maintaining a sense of challenge.  [spoiler]Additionally, you'll find later that you can always reobtain what you've previously discarded[/spoiler], which is really nice and allows for more variety and experimentation. \n\nOverall, the game was really fun and has a nice story; I really enjoyed all the cute moments in the game.  The ending was really well done and wrapped things up nicely, giving you the option to revisit some of the places and people you've been to or met, before.  Don't be thrown off at the low price, either; it's one of the better rpgmaker games out there and I wouldn't have minded paying more than I did for it.\n\nAlso: If you like to savescum, F12 takes you back to the title screen without having to close the game.

thought I would buy it and never touch it, I was wrong. This game reminds me of old games i used to play similar to this like Lufia or even Final Fantasy. The game kept me occupied for the day and has a pretty good story behind it. If you like RPGs than this game is almost a must. It's value is definetly more than $2. If you like speedrunning, this game seems like a good game to do so.", "timestamp_created": 1482824506, "timestamp_updated": 1482824506, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.584274", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28701732": {"recommendationid": "28701732", "author": {"steamid": "76561198281792625", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 476, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482821009}, "language": "schinese", "review": "[h1]\u60f3\u8981\u89e6\u78b0\u90a3\u5929\u7a7a\u4e0e\u6d77\u6c34[/h1]\n\n\u975e\u5e38\u6e29\u67d4\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u6700\u6e29\u67d4\u7684\u83ab\u8fc7\u4e8e\u90a3\u5929\u7a7a\u548c\u6d77\u6c34\u3002\n\n+\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u6218\u6597\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u4e2a\u4eba\u7231\u597d\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6218\u6597\u65b9\u5f0f\uff08\u4e00\u5f00\u59cb\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u53ef\u4ee5\u5347\u7ea7\u6b66\u5668\u5361\u4e86\u597d\u4e45\uff09\n+\u7b80\u77ed\u7684\u53f0\u8bcd\uff0c\u5374\u80fd\u5851\u9020\u9971\u6ee1\u7684\u4eba\u7269\uff08\u597d\u559c\u6b22the undead knight\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u90a3\u4e2a\u5728\u770b\u5929\u7a7a\u548c\u6d77\u6c34\u7684\u4ed6\uff09\n+\u52a8\u4eba\u7684\u97f3\u4e50\uff0c\u6700\u559c\u6b22\u4e34\u8fd1\u7ed3\u5c3e\u5904\u7684\u90a3\u9996\u539f\u58f0\uff0c\u975e\u5e38\u52a8\u4eba\n+\u597d\u7f8e\u7684\u5929\u7a7a\u548c\u6d77\u6c34\uff0c\u611f\u89c9\u7ecf\u8d39\u5168\u7528\u5728\u5929\u7a7a\u548c\u6d77\u6c34\u4e0a\u4e86\n\n-\u8bfb\u6863\u53ea\u80fd\u9000\u51fa\u6e38\u620f", "timestamp_created": 1482821465, "timestamp_updated": 1482821465, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566929", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28660751": {"recommendationid": "28660751", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113276072", "num_games_owned": 339, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482901040}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u76f8\u5f53\u68d2\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u7d20\u8d28\uff0c\u6211\u90fd\u89c9\u5f97\u8fd9\u5b9a\u4ef7\u6709\u70b9\u4f4e\u4e86\n\u901a\u5173\u5171\u7528\u65f65\u4e2a\u534a\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u9690\u85cf\u8ff7\u5bab\u5168\u7834\uff0c\u5168\u6536\u96c6\n\u597d\u4e45\u6ca1\u6709\u78b0\u5230\u8fd9\u6837\u8ba9\u6211\u4e00\u53e3\u6c14\u7834\u5173\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u4e86\uff0c\u5c31\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b57\uff0c\u723d\n\u6e38\u620f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7406\u5ff5\u5c31\u4e0d\u662f\u4e00\u5473\u7684\u5ef6\u957f\u73a9\u5bb6\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5728\u76f8\u5bf9\u77ed\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u65f6\u95f4\u4e2d\u63d0\u9ad8\u73a9\u5bb6\u7684\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u8fd9\u70b9\u76f8\u5f53\u68d2\n\u987a\u4fbf\uff0c\u672c\u6e38\u620f\u6c49\u5316\u5df2\u51fa\uff0c\u8bf7\u5728S1\u8bba\u575b\u6e38\u620f\u533a\u627e\uff0c\u6253\u4e2a\u5e7f\u544a\u563b\u563bo(\u2229_\u2229)o", "timestamp_created": 1482733183, "timestamp_updated": 1482733183, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28652557": {"recommendationid": "28652557", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009358827", "num_games_owned": 271, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 546, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482794086}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is way, way too cheap.

Each weapons or spells have different stats, and \"wait\". Whenever you choose to use a weapon in the turn-based combat, both you and your opponent's wait countdown ticks down, until they reach zero, then the effect happens. So for example, if you use magic with 15 ticks wait, and enemy use dagger with 5 ticks wait, after 5 ticks the enemy attacks you, then they can choose another attack (since you're still in your magic casting). If they use another dagger attack, tough luck, in another 5 ticks they'll attack you again and you're still casting your magic.\n\nIt's simple, makes sense, smart, and fun. You try to strategize what weapon should you use this turn, should you use this long-casting magic spell that put your defense to zero but you think can down the enemy in one hit? This sword that is weaker but at least have some defense? Or should you put up your shield and try to find opening in your enemy's assault?\n\nAt first it might feel too simplistic or boring, but later when both your weapons and the enemies get more diverse, it get more fun.\n\nAnd tha'ts not counting the simple but charming look of the game.\n\nNot sure how long this game last, but with this price, it definitely worth it.", "timestamp_created": 1481971594, "timestamp_updated": 1481971594, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28410909": {"recommendationid": "28410909", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105027882", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1088, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481917550}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041f\u043e-\u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u0431\u044b \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0438\u0433\u0440!!\n\u0421\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0431\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0447\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043c \u0437\u0430... \u043d\u0430\u0438\u043d\u044f\u0448\u043d\u0435\u0439\u0448\u0443\u044e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443!) \n\u0427\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430, \u0434\u0430\u0439 \u0432\u0430\u043c \u0431\u043e\u0433 \u0437\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044c\u044f :D", "timestamp_created": 1481916985, "timestamp_updated": 1481916985, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.592031", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28333544": {"recommendationid": "28333544", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960389353", "num_games_owned": 712, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 377, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480042686}, "language": "english", "review": "A simple yet inspired combat system combined with a heart filled story turn this RPG Maker title into a real gem.", "timestamp_created": 1481578328, "timestamp_updated": 1481578328, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28302210": {"recommendationid": "28302210", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012511360", "num_games_owned": 725, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 416, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481360612}, "language": "english", "review": "As expected of it Playism RPGs, this game was an amazing JRPG with a spin on the battle system.

For $2 it's an absolute steal.\n\nAnd now, here's why!\n\nPut simply, Helen's Mysterious Castle avoids most of the pitfalls common in RPGs throughout the ages- it even avoids the ones that Undertale falls into across repeated playthroughs. This isn't to say that it's a perfect game or that it avoids every pitfall, because it doesn't. But what it does do is avert a lot of expectations about the genre in very cleverly done ways.\n\nDon't like random encounters? Good! Like Chrono Trigger, enemies wander around the various dungeons and battles only trigger on running into them. However, the enemies also move around in different patterns depending on the enemy. Cerberus will lunge at you at a high speed, Skeletons won't move, some enemies will move much faster if they notice you, and so on. This results in a very streamlined experience where you fight the battles you want to fight, or fail to avoid. Throughout the game there are very few forced non-boss encounters and these alone give you enough XP to beat the game, if you're careful.\n\nGrinding is greatly alleviated and Helen has a very incremental rate of progression. Rather than leveling up on obtaining enough XP, you decide which weapons to level up with your experience. This can be done at any time, and poses some interesting strategic decisions. Do you level everything equally to be prepared for everything, or do you specialize in one or two attacks and hope that it's enough to take down everything in your path? The balance here could stand to be a little better, as the Blacksmith you encounter about a third of the way through the game can refine equipment 1 level beyond what Helen can, and the LongswordSP shatters game balance to the point where I highly suggest avoiding it. Other SP weapons are perfectly fine for balance, though.\n\nAs for the weapons throughout the game, there's a very solid mix. All attacks have three stats, and optionally a bonus effect such as piercing (ignores defense) or draining HP. These stats are Effect, Defense, and Wait. This results in a very simple system similar to Paper Mario where every attack has a predictable damage output, while also adding a huge layer of tactical planning that turns most boss encounters into puzzles. How can you exploit their moveset to create an opening to attack without leaving yourself open? This gameplay was very engaging to me and I played through the entire game in one sitting, taking about 5 hours.\n\nDamage dealt is Effect of attacking move - Defense of defender's move. The tactical aspect comes in with the Wait stat- everything has one, and attacks only happen when the counter hits 0. If you cue up a Thunder spell, you'll be waiting a lot of ticks and any enemy with a fast attack will be free to wail on you during the cast time. This can sometimes feel a little bit like trial and error early on when you don't know how enemy attacks work, or what attacks a given foe has at their disposal, but Helen's Mysterious Castle allows you to save anywhere, at any time. Some battles do feel a little like there's One Right Choice for your loadout, but the sheer size of Helen's potential armory can make replays fresh, and with grinding being entirely optional, the battles don't get old even when they start playing out the same way every time. This simple system adds a ton of replay value by making the best choice at any given time dependent on what you're holding, and what your opponent is doing.\n\nMany battles have creative gimmicks to them that can force you to change your entire strategy; one removes your current attack as an option for the rest of the battle, several poison you at the start which makes you take 5 damage after your every action, several can lower your max HP within the battle, some will make your next attack take longer to execute, one notable case will reflect all damage blocked... the list of creative gimmicks goes on and on. Every boss feels unique and fresh, which is a marvel for how overall simple the systems involved are. Helen's Mysterious Castle is definitely a case of real complexity through fewer meaningful choices. This is compounded by the fact that Helen can only carry 8 pieces of equipment at a time- anything dropped can be picked back up at a specific area opened fairly early on in the game.\n\nOn the topic of replay value: the longest cutscene in the game is about a minute long, barring the final boss gauntlet of the good ending. Again, this neatly dodges the common issues of RPGs having more dialogue and cutscene than gameplay these days. What gameplay there is, as mentioned, is only as tedious as you want it to be. The final boss gauntlet is even very nice in that it autosaves between each of the battles, instead of making you sit through the cutscene and refight any bosses you've already beaten. So many RPGs make you do this, it's kind of absurd! It doesn't hurt that the soundtrack throughout the game is always a good listen and always an amazing fit. Everything from the hanging gardens boss onwards is amazing, and while testing speedrun strategies for the last bosses of both the good and bad ending, the soundtrack never got old. And I was testing strategies for over an hour on the good ending gauntlet!\n\nLet's see... I suppose I should mention the story. There really isn't much of one, and the characters don't stick around too long or develop much. But this is an otherwise small blemish on an otherwise fantastic game: especially since the small story manages to throw in a couple surprising twists even to longtime fans of the genre. Even I fell for the fake ending, and I can usually see through those a mile away.\n\nOh and I mentioned speedruns of this earlier- everything it averts above makes it a very fun RPG run with very little downtime. It fit everything I'd been looking for in an RPG speedrun, and I played it because I was looking for a short RPG to play through. I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did, but I'm very glad I gave it a play soon after picking it up.\n\nIn conclusion: Helen's Mysterious Castle is a fantastic experience for any RPG fan, new or old. Newcomers will enjoy the simple systems and the depth they create, while longtime fans will appreciate everything it does differently from the norm.

The really good aspect of the battle system is that you and your enemy are using the same battle system to defeat each other, with many different types of enemies taking a different approach to how they outplay you. This comes clear in the latter half of the game when enemies will actively try to punish you for misplays or for your potentially one-sided inventory.\n\nFor me personally, it's the boss battles that were really thrilling in Helen's Mysterious Castle. A whole lot of different play mechanics were brought into battle that bosses incorporate in their play but the mechanics still feel fair in terms to the battle system. Many players fill their inventory with their unique blend of equipment combinations, making the game feel really refreshing if you decide to use different equipments on your second playthrough.\n\nWhat this game could have done better would be to include a general place to get tips and advice on how to proceed. On three occasions the game tried to artificially lengthen your playtime by obscuring your next tasks. You actually need to backtrack and check for information, find secret passages based on what was told by an NPC / written on a bookshelf or do specific things infront of objects - all in order to proceed.\n\nI bought the game for 140cents, definitely worth the price.

I'll give a brief overview here, but if you simply experience the game it won't take long for you to grasp it.  Your attacks have 3 main stats - attack power, defense power, and cast time.  As you progress you will have as many as 8 attacks to choose from in any given situation and have to predict what actions the enemy will take as you select your moves.  If you play too defensively, they might use an attack that ignores all defense power, making you waste time you could be attacking and still get damaged in the process.  If you play too aggressively with low defense they'll outspeed you and hit you while you're vulnerable.  It makes even simple enemies potentially dangerous since each attack and strategy has pros and cons to it and you'll have to adapt for each enemy.  For this reason, this is the kind of RPG where you are likely to die, as a new enemy you don't know how to handle can outmaneuver you.  However, \"Death,\" is lightly punished (it's actually beneficial if it's at the right part of the game as you'll get an HP boost) as you'll respawn in a bed without losing any XP you gained before, \"Dying.\"  If you do get stuck for a while, a bit of grinding to boost up your equipment, and adjusting your approach will likely see you through quick enough.\n\nGrinding in this game is different than in others as you use experience points like currency to upgrade the power of your weapons.  Some are inherently weaker and improve very little, even when maxed out, whereas others increase by larger amounts, and are a better investment for your experience.  I do wish they were a bit more balanced in that regard, but it works, especially as there is a decent inventory of equipment for the scope of the game.\n\nI suppose the game does live up to its title, as there are plenty of secrets in the game, requiring the player to inspect and navigate the areas carefully in order to get much needed equipment to progress, as well as get to the next section.\n\nOne thing that amuses me about the story of the game is how it keeps going on further than expected.  There were two times in the game where I thought it was nearing the end, but that turned out to be a diversion as there was yet another area to go through.  I've played plenty of RPGs in my day, yet they did surprise me with that, as it is hard to tell the exact length of an RPG maker game though the chest layout should have given me more of a hint there was still more to go.  What further supports this point is that you don't get much exposition at the beginning and are merely tossed into the game world, which worked quite well here.\n\nI did experience a glitch that crashed the game, which can hopefully be patched so it doesn't discourage people from finishing the game.  Thankfully you can save at most anytime, and if you do so after every mini-boss, you shouldn't have any issues.

I've enjoyed every minute of it.\nThe unique thing that stuck out for me... and the unique thing that sticks out for everyone is the battling system, let me give a basic (If horrible) explaination of it.\n\nThere is a 'wait' attribute with every weapon, this dictates the amount of 'time' you must wait before damage is delt or for how long the item is active, for example the wooden sheild (First sheild in game) has a wait of 8, therefore the sheild is active for 8 'turns' (That's how I'll refure to it from now... okay?) however the 'thunder' spell (Again the first you get in the game) has a wait of 10, this means 10 turns pass before you attack with the spell.\nThis 'wait' also applies to enemies meaning the game get VERY tactical very quickly, especally in late game, which devolves to: Use most powerful spell in game, heal, sheild, sheild, sheild, use most powerful spell. Rince and repeat.\nThe final boss is HORRIBLE for this.\n\nNow, lets talk something else, say maps...\nWhile the overworld maps are very small and sometimes constrictive, they work. It is hard to explain why they work, but they do. There are your confusing ones, the ones you wish didn't exist, the \"this is a perfect spot to grind\" ones and a little town one. OH BOY! What varity.\n\nThe game is very short, a decent player can reach a clear in about three hours including grinding times, how ever I an not decent at this game, it took me NINE HOURS to reach a clear for the first time... not as bad as Suguri... 31 hrs and counting... still haven't finished it on easy...\nSigh... back to this game 'though.\nIt's brevity is good, in a portal way. You can tell whoever made the game was running out of default assets to use (Did I mention that this uses default assets? No) because not long before end game you have to backtrack through the ENTIRE MAP...(S) with the shortcuts cut off. THough the default assets can be put aside, mainly because of the combat system... and the fact it was made in RPG school (From the name I'm going to guess it's babbys first RPG Maker) the readme confirms this.\n\nStory wise there isn't much to say, the brevity of the game means there is little time for telling of lore and such, however the story we have is solid, but has a tendency to introduce charactors at the last minutes unless you've been paying attention throught the entire game and have found all of the readable bookshelves.\n\nSo, here we are, the end of my review. There isn't much to say about a normal $2 JRPG, but this game is special, oh so very special. In it's combat, it's kind of stupid storyline and not to mention the maps (Yes I'm going to harp on about them... despite them being small... and sometimes kind of shit...)\nSo Pros and Cons... the poor mans TL;DR.\n\nPros:\nUnique combat system\n\nWacky and stupid story that we all love.\n\nLots of hidden secret passages and such holding... sometimes powerful gear.\n\nAn enemy named 'What is this?'\n\nPrice tag\n\nCons:\nSometimes it's hard to get decent gear without being killed or knowing the maps and such.\n\nOne or two annoying parts (Namely one door I can not for the life of me figure out how to open, but somehow do. And one boss where you can't see their health bar or they're 'wait' timers or the stats of the attack they're about to use)\n\nSmall maps, the maps that exist are good, just EXTREMELY small... and sometimes hard to navigate.\n\nSome gear can only be found once, for instace right before a boss fight when you shouldn't drop your good weapons but for completeionest sake you do anyway, admitently the particluar situation I'm talking about yeilds a rather good weapon with a great Debuf.", "timestamp_created": 1479713039, "timestamp_updated": 1479713039, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499982", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26702871": {"recommendationid": "26702871", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063505124", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 79, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490487215}, "language": "english", "review": "Entertaining", "timestamp_created": 1479602854, "timestamp_updated": 1479602854, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.455657", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26681409": {"recommendationid": "26681409", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057263203", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1716, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484474101}, "language": "english", "review": "After playing games like Wadanohara and LiEat that had amazing stories but were too easy combat wise, (as in you'd had to try and lose the battles) I've been looking for a new RPG Maker game that actually challenges you with fairly challenge and well balanced in difficulty fights. With this game, I got my wish.\n\nStory:\nOverall, it's a very simple story. You play as the silent protagonist Helen (literally, all she really says is \"?\" and \"!\" and stuff along those lines) as she is seeking to get to the first floor of the island to discover about her past and the world below. Along the way, she faces many challenges against different kinds of monsters. There isn't much too it until you finally reach the 2nd floor that the plot takes a surprising turn, but that is best saved for you to find out.\n\nCharacters:\nDespite how simple the story is, I found the characters very likable. Helen despite being silent is simply adorable, and you'll find yourself attached to many such as the Undead Knight and the Demon King as well as Helen's brother. There isn't really much large character development, but I'd say it works for a very simple story.\n\nGameplay:\nUnlike other RPGs, this game runs on fighting a single enemy each battle. The three stats are as followed:\nEffect - How much damage you'll deal\nDefense - Reduces how much damage you'll take through simple subtraction. If the Defense is higher than the Effect, unless there is a pierce effect, you'll take no damage.\nWait - How long before you take action.\nThe key here is use the multiple of weapons, armor, magic and tools you find to combat against the enemies you fight, since all of the enemies actions have a wait and the turn won't end until you attack. And example is fighting Slimes in the earlier stages of the game: You can get in two shortbow attacks before the are close to attacking with their command, so use the wooden shield after that to guard their attacks and negate the damage before launching the final attack you'll need to finish them. In addition, you can only have up to eight items at a time, so you will need to discard items to replace for different ones. This in term brings strategy to the game as you'll need to figure out how to combat enemies effectively as there will be points enemies can out-think you and will guard or perform a quick powerful magic attack while your preparing for a strong hit. As you get closer to the end, the enemies get smarter and more challenging, especially the bosses. In fact the bosses from the 2nd floor and to the end of the game are highly considered some of the hardest fights in the game. This game is short, but it's by no means easy if you can't think carefully. You will be losing a lot.\n\nFinal thoughts, it's a very short and simple story that will make you feel for many of the characters. But the battles can prove to be very difficult to the un-prepared compared to other games. I'd highly recommend it as it is ONLY $2.

First, fullscreen mode (accessed by holding Alt and pressing Enter) caused horrible stuttering on my system and I know I am not the only one. The best way around this that I found is by using Windows Magnifier. You can trigger this by holding the Windows key (between left Ctrl and Alt) and using the + and - keys to zoom in and out. By default it zooms in where your mouse cursor is located. On a 1440p monitor I found +325% zoom to be just right.\n\nSecond, the main character, Helen, is illiterate at the outset of the game. You can learn to read, but it is easy to miss and cannot be unlocked by backtracking late in the game. I'll spoiler tag the instructions, but this is a very, very minor spoiler: [spoiler]When you first unlock the second shortcut back to your home there will be a new gravestone nearby. Examine it for a cutscene where, among other things, Helen is taught to read.[/spoiler] If you don't do this you'll miss out on some nice tidbits of lore that help to more fully illuminate what's really going on in this mysterious castle.\n\nThe third and final tip: After fighting the Undead Knight, there seems to be a common game crash that is avoidable. It happens immediately after the battle when entering a double doored cathedral through the left door. The right door does not seem to be affected by this crash, but it's worth saving your game just in case.\n\n[b]Now, on to the actual review.[/b]\n\nThis little gem of a game's brightest aspect is its battle system. Combat encounters are elegant duels that have you constantly switching tactics in order to counter your opponents moves. I will leave the details for you to discover on your own, but in short you have 8 inventory slots to fill from a collection of equipment that includes bows, swords, shields, various magics and passive stat boosting items. You will need to keep a diverse selection in order to be successful.\n\nYou find new items at a steady pace throughout the game. Many of them are in optional side areas. As you gain experience in the game, you do not level up yourself, but instead use your experience to upgrade your equipment. This grants a satisfying sense of progression that gives you frequent, small boosts in power.\n\nThe combat isn't entirely flawless though. First, fights are only ever 1 vs 1 affairs. The mechanics don't lend themselves well to having numerous participants. Second, once you've found a winning strategy against a particular monster, you can usually easily repeat the process on successive battles with that opponent type. This is both good and bad in that it rewards you for skillful play, while also making further battles less engaging. These are minor complaints that are largely counteracted by excellent boss encounters, many varying enemy types and the relatively short length of the game.\n\nUncovering details about this game's castle setting and its inhabitants is a joyful experience. You are set loose in the beginning with no exposition and only slowly learn the true nature of this place and its people. There are a few minor writing errors, but the script is otherwise skillfully woven in a way that, as more information is revealed, you can look back on some previous conversations and see deeper meaning in them. The story is often cute, relatively lighthearted and even comical at times but it is not without touching moments and serious topics. Visuals and sound commendably convey the emotions of the scenes, albeit in a familiar SNES RPG style.\n\nIn addition to being illiterate, Helen also speaks with only two symbols, \"?\" and \"!\". This gives the sense that she is also mute, making her hard to relate to as a character but easier to apply your own personality to. I didn't care for this design decision. Regardless of this, she does have a short but interesting past that's tied into the plot. Most other characters are enjoyable but the game isn't long enough to give them great depth. There is one character that I won't reveal the identity of that is the main focus of the story. We get to learn a lot about them, even more so if you unlock the ability to read.\n\nI ended up playing through this game twice. My first playthrough took just over 6 hours to complete while the second was a little over 3 hours. I actually accomplished more the second time through despite taking half the time. Unfortunately this game is occasionally unclear with its directions on how to proceed. Two instances in particular had me lost for a significant amount of time before discovering that the way forward was through a hidden passageway. I only discovered these by mindlessly running into walls in the general area that I thought I was supposed to be in. I wouldn't call that good game design and it artificially pads the game length.\n\nThere is decent replay value to be found here. Trying out different equipment builds can be fun.

It does what it does well and scratches all the right JRPG itches, with an awesome combat system that you can pick up in moments, yet which keeps on delivering depth throughout the whole 5-6 hour experience thanks to the plethora of unique items and interesting encounter designs. Much like the combat, the story starts off incredibly basic, yet manages to pull off an emotionally engaging ending by the time it's done. I have to give this game huge points for being so accessible and easy to pick up, unlike so many JRPGs that frontload slow paced story and tutorials. Helen's Mysterious Castle has enough confidence in its gameplay and tone to allow those parts to suck you in first, before layering on the narrative and mechanical complexity as the adventure unfolds.\n\nThe only noteworthy negative I encountered with the game was related to a section of backtracking, waiting, and moderate confusion at around the mid point, where the requirements for progression started straying into the \"run around talking to everyone and examining everything to try and find the progression trigger\"  ballpark. There are perhaps one or two other moments in which this might happen for some players when the progression path is unclear, and the lack of online walkthroughs for this game might result in a little frustration, but thankfully there is at least one commentary-free LP on youtube that should help anyone who gets stuck.\n\nAside from that, however, my time with Helen's Mysterious Castle was thoroughly enjoyable. The music is fantastic and enthralling, the storyline and characters are cute, the difficulty progression ramps up beautifully from smooth to challenging, and there's potentially a fair bit of replay value if you want to try and find all the hidden items and try out varying builds.\n\nAs far as simple, small-scale indie JRPGs go, this is one of the best I've played.

The level layouts are smart, economical, and dense. The one-on-one battles last under a minute a-piece, and pose extremely clever and engaging tactical challenges. It's a hard game at times, but also very kind -- death in battle poses no penalty except for sending you to the start of the dungeon, where you're given a meal that permanently raises your max HP.\n\nThe aesthetic builds on default resources with heaps of excellent custom sprites, animation, and reorchestrated music. For someone already delighted by the RPGMaker 2000 aesthetic, the effect is intoxicating. \n\nHelen's Mysterious Castle takes exactly the amount of time it needs to fully explore the greater realities of its combat and its characters.

Quick, flimsy attacks allow you to deal great damage when an enemy uses a low-defense weapon, and coordinating your wait times to use a heavy hitting weapon without getting hit are just two examples of how this battle system opens many unique encounters with new strategic opportunities.\nYou do not level up in this game. Instead, XP is spent on weapons to upgrade them. You can only have eight weapons at a time, so choosing an effective loadout is important.

Very short. About six hours short. But that's not why I'm not recommending the game.

How do controls work? Where are my menu options? What key presses do I need to do? How is my controller mapped? I probably spent half an hour going, \"Ok... wtf?\" You kind of run into that through out the game, as it does a poor job of explaining itself to you.

The game mechanics work really well, being turn- AND Wait-based. Wait-based? Yes! The Wait gauge telling you how long you have to \"wait\" until you can execute your move. Being fast usually means hitting less hard, but being quick can result in the opponent doing some serious damage.\n\nStory:\nThe story is a bit lacking. Took me a while to figure out I was a monster, living with monsters that look like humans. The game is pretty linear, and so is the story, but it can be difficult to figure out just where to go and what to do next. There's not much character development either.\n\nInventory:\nYour inventory is limited to eight items, be it weapons or gear. If you collect an item, that you later wish to drop, just drop it. It is \"collected\" by one of the NPC's and you can easily get it back. The weapons and spells are pretty cool, but the Heal-spell is a bit of a let down. It decreases a level every time you use it outside of a battle, meaning you have to upgrade it again.\n\nLeveling:\nYou don't level. Your character, Helen, doesn't get stronger. The EXP you earn are instead used for leveling and upgrading weapons and spells. That's a pretty interesting and unique idea for a game made with RPG-Maker! Throughout the story, you'll be able to find Health Bonuses, boosting your Max HP with a few HP. The steaks you get when you die, help a bit too, but only to a certain extent.\n\nVisuals:\nThis game looks wonderful! It's made in RPG-Maker, but it looks so much better and more customised than any other RPG-Maker game I've played before. The characters look cute, you can actually open cupboards and every monster is represented by an overworld sprite and a portrait.\n\nMusic:\nStandard music, but nice tunes. In the credits, all songs are credited, which leaves me to assume they come from the free music database. That doesn't make them any less fun to listen to though! ^ u^\n\nControls:\nReally easy to use. Just use the arrows to walk and Z and X for other actions, hold Shift to run and you're good to go. Don't accidentally hit the F12 key to make a screenshot, it brings you back to the Title Screen... That happens to some people, you know >///>\n\nOverall Opinion:\nA wonderful, short, fun and exiting RPG to play, that can be challenging at times, but never too much to make you stop playing it. I've read some reports of the game crashing, but I haven't even encountered a glitch, other than the music not always starting when you reload.\n\nGet this game, it's fairly cheap and a lot of fun to play!

The gameplay is so unlike any of the other RPG Maker games on Steam that you won't even realize it was made on such an engine (unless you once tinkered with the program yourself). Instead of having a party, every battle is one on one. Along with that, you can avoid battles by walking around enemies, although this can be a tad difficult with the grid-based movement in the world.\n\nThe combat is a mixture of Turn-Based and the Active-Time-Battle system you see in many Final Fantasy games, with a hint of Pokemon in the sense you can customize your movesets. Every item you pick up is either an active or passive item, and you have 8 inventory slots + a bank which holds found items that you've dropped from your inventory. I could explain this more and talk about the surprisingly complex mechanics , but essentially everything is deliberate in the game. Enemies have AI that react to what you do, which becomes much more important towards the end. There is no noticable RNG, as critical strike chances and missing attacks is not an issue in this game. You see the stats of your enemies attacks, and the stats of your own as you fight. It makes for this very flow-like combat system that is surprisingly addictive, but never too easy. In fact, later encounters become fairly difficult. Towards the end of the game, regular enemies are hazardous and you can't simply brute force your way through.\n\nThe writing and storytelling of the game is decent. A majority of the characters and NPCs in the game are memorable, and the game manages to pack in enough plot twists to keep you on edge and surprise you as you continue into the castle. It's definitely a game of wonder and discovery, but it's never overwhelming. The game world is large enough to be interesting and explorable, but small enough so that travelling around is never a chore, and it has many shortcuts unlocked throughout the game to make travelling that much easier.\n\nI'm sure my writing here is starting to seem like an incohesive mess, so I'll just end it like this. The game's super cheap (2 Canadian Dollars is a hell of a deal) and it kept my attention for 7.5 hours straight. That's playing through the story, and unlocking every item and secret, and completing the bonus dungeon. In that time it never felt it was dragging on, but at the same time, the game never leaves you wanting more (although I do recommend completing the post-game bonus dungeon as it has some of the best fights in the game and gives access to unique equipment). Helen's Mysterious Castle achieves an almost perfect balance of everything. Difficulty, Content, as well as Humour and Story Depth are presented as professionally as an RPG Maker 2000 game can be, and it's an extremely good example of how a whole can be so much more than the sum of its parts.", "timestamp_created": 1467507053, "timestamp_updated": 1467507072, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497495", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24000576": {"recommendationid": "24000576", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009329593", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 574, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470531440}, "language": "english", "review": "Perhaps one of the better games out there made in RPG Maker.

After progressing deeper into the dungeons, the story begins to unravel revealing much more than what was introduced. Characters you meet each have unique personalities with most brimming with optimism.\n\nThe gameplay is centered on duels, with each enemy having a unique pattern or gimmick you must solve either by brute force or careful strategic planning.

It's most likely a short game given its price. But as you go along with the game the story slowly but surely unfolds itself both subtlely and obviously as you progress through the game.\nBut what I really made an impression on me is that you can tell the devs had fun making this game as its evidently clear with its plot twist trolling and pun intended humor. Not to mention what surprised me was its refinement system and simple yet intuitive turn based battle sequence. Also the OST tracks are quite memorable and the MC is a cutie. (When you open the item menu keep an eye on her every couple seconds. You won't regret it)\n\nGenerally you see \"EXP\" as the numbers to indicate when your character will lv right? Welp not for this illiterately challenged elf girl. The \"EXP\" gained from defeating foes is soley used to refine the equipment you find via the item menu.  As your Eff(Atk) and Def is soley based on the gear you chose to use during combat.\nElf girl herself doesnt gain any stat boosts at all other than HP boosts you find lying around or free steak when your defeated (yay).\n\nNow the combat system is different but intuitive in its own little way compared to the generic turn based combat. I'll over glorify it alittle. This games combat is all about momentum and how well you can control the flow of battle with some slight predictive insight on how the enemy will react to the equipment you decide to bust out in battle.  As each equipment has a \"Wait\" count to it which is the amount of numerals it will take for the equipment used to take effect. That applies to the enemies as well. Refinement generally reduces wait count on said equipment so be sure to grind for EXP. You will be fine as long as you know simple subtraction.

The story reveals itself as you make your way through the titular mysterious castle, and while an RPG that drops you right into gameplay without a cutscene or whatnot can be disorienting, it does allow you to get right into the battles, which is where HMC really shines.\n\nI'm a fan of JRPGs that:\na) require more than mashing A to win\nb) have defending be a viable strategy\nc) have grinding/buying a ton of healing items not be the solution to everything\n...and HMC meets all three criteria. Battles are duels - you (Helen) v. a monster. As you explore, you can find a massive array of weapons, with each weapon having three stats - Effect (how much damage the weapon does), Defense (how much of your opponent's damage the weapon can negate), and Wait (how long it takes to use the weapon). Each enemy also has its own set of attacks, which makes battles a kind of back-and-forth dance: the monster is getting ready for a big attack! Do you put up a shield to block it? Or use your longsword to both attack and block some of the damage? Or spam a ton of quick, weak attacks so that you beat them first? Or charge up your healing spell so that it comes out right after the attack connects?\n\nAnother thing that makes HMC unique is that Helen herself never levels up: you still earn experience points after battle, but they're instead used as a kind of currency to level up your weapons, to increase Effect & Defense and/or decrease Wait. The only way Helen can get stronger is through HP upgrades, which are found through exploring - these optional upgrades, as well as the veritable arsenal of weapons you can find, gives the game a great amount of replay value.\n\n\nThe story is genuinely funny at times, although ultimately it's not much to write home about. The game itself isn't particularly long, too - it can easy be finished in an afternoon. Regardless, Helen's Mysterious Castle is a delightful little JRPG, and two dollars is a steal for a game this fun.

game theres a girl outside your house that it will tell you not to go north, obviously you would be like ''alright i won't go...... *goes north anyway*'' the story of the character is not very clear since she cant even read books, but somehow can use spells *game logic*, later on you would notice theres no other pathway but north, if you die you will respawn in a bed, normal stuff, the battle mechanic its a little bit confusing since again, no tutorial, in the game you have to figure it out yourself throughout while batteling low level monster, which it shound't give you any problem at all, in every rpg game there is always hidden treasure another element of this type of game, hidden treasures arent hard to find, they arent, it's a little bit boring to be honest but for now i really liked it even though most of my review sounds negative and i can't say its really bad just yet since i played two hours of the game so i can't jump to conclusion, *cought*[spoiler]haters[/spoiler]*cought*\n\nfor now two hours if the game i enjoyed it since the story of it, its been little by little unfolding itselve, maybe in the end there might be a twist, maybe the character might finally learn to read a book, maybe she won't stop destroying pots for no damn reason one day, we won't know until the end but for now ill give this game a....\n\n5/10\nSince there was no tutorial in the beginning and no introduction of anything, you just start the game in a house, you don't even know the protagonist name and they usually say it has soon has you start the

The feeling of having to figure out the game and its story on your own is a whole lot better than having a \"hey listen, hey listen\" tutorial bot nagging in  your ear every 2 feet. The gameplay or combat system is where the game REALLY shines, it's a 1v1 match (every time) and is all about strategy and timing, it is fun and incredibly addictive, in addition everytime to defeat an enemy you gain XP, but not to your character but to your weapons and gear so most of the game (until you are full of beef) you are basiclly in the same hp status. The graphic yes are not the most stunning when looking at todays modern games, but is still charming to view.

Just select weapons that you find. You must choose which is best for each fight. There is not much, just the basics for each level. Those that you do not keep are stored in a location that you access easily.\n\nThe most interresting happens during the fight! You must use sparingly every second of every fight!

Helen, the titular Elven child warrior, fights each enemy one-on-one.  Every weapon and spell has attack power, defensive power, and a specific deployment countdown; thus you can use a broadsword, which has high defense, as an automatic shield as you wait for it to slash.  The enemies operate likewise, and just as you can see their countdowns and the attacks they lead to, they adjust their tactics based on yours.  There are no random die-rolls; every bit of HP loss is determined directly by weapon stats and defensive subtractions.  This system is very fun, and it creates a much greater sense of involvement than the \"I hit you, you hit me, I heal me\" progression of yore.  I never got bored with it in the nearly 12 hours I spent with the game!  [i]Helen[/i] is fairly easy, but it's so much fun fighting monsters and exploring the castle that it doesn't really matter.    \n\nNegligible negatives:  I encountered a couple of crashes and you currently can't fullscreen it without FPS drops or tearing (I would suggest Windows Magnifier to combat the lack of fullscreen).\n\nHighly recommended -- a wonderful value for the cheap price!

Took me about 8 hours to beat it, but I'm also the kind of person who likes to grind, so about an hour to an hour and a half of that was grinding. The combat is definitely interesting, that much I'll say. You have a variety of weapons that take different amounts of time to execute, so you'll be planning ahead most of the time rather than reactionary decisions. \n\nThe enemy's attack and remaining \"wait\" are always visible, so every fight kinda feels like a puzzle. You have up to 8 weapons that you can carry at anytime, so what you bring will determine what your strategies will be, which is a really interesting idea that I hope someone adds more complexity to in the future. Some of your weapons offer a passive effect to further add a little bit of variety in your playstyle. Your character never levels, but you find items that increase your max hp, and the experience you gain is like a currency that is used to level up your weapons.\n\nWhat kept me playing the game until the end was the combat and my curiosity for what new weapons there were. By the end of the game you can pretty much predict what will happen, so the story wasn't a big interest of mine. But the combat remained interesting, for at least the first half of a fight when you encounter a new enemy. After the first half of a fight the AI will fall into a predictable pattern, but I suppose that's the \"puzzle\" aspect for ya. Figure out the optimal strategy and you've got it down. And that's what I enjoyed, manipulating the system in every fight, maximizing the efficiency of my loadout and strategies.\n\nThe one big gripe that I had with the game was that when you finally find that new weapon you've been waiting for, but your inventory is full, you have to drop a weapon to get the new one to try it out. You can get the weapons you drop back, but it's a lot of leg work to go back and change them out. So when you find that sweet new sword, but give up your bow only to find that you miss that l'il bow, now you gotta hoof it through enemies to get your sweet baby bow back. I would've enjoyed this game much more if you had, say, a backpack to carry everything, but could only bring your loadout into a fight.", "timestamp_created": 1459226326, "timestamp_updated": 1459226515, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22102228": {"recommendationid": "22102228", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066518607", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 288, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478017894}, "language": "english", "review": "It's got an interesting storie, a unique battle system and even a secret dungeon (if you manage to find it)!

Definite recommendation.\n\n[h1] Longer Review: [/h1]\n\nHelen's Mysterious Castle is, at its core, an action-adventure game with RPG elements. The main character, Helen, explores the titular castle to discover who she is, why she's there, and whether or not she should leave. However, Helen cannot speak, or even read, instead conversing with by replying \"?\" and \"!\", adding a charming quirk to her adventure. Side characters instead will fill you in as the game progresses, and the story is pleasant enough for any age, neither too childish, nor too serious.\n\nPerhaps the biggest difference between this game and other RPGs lies in the unique combat system. Imagine an Active Time Battle system from Final Fantasy that you can control the flow of. Each weapon has a \"wait\" stat, which tells you how many more moves you'll have before the item you selected will be used, or, in the case of shields, how long it will be active for. This adds tactical play, as all battles are 1 on 1, and you can see when the enemy will attack, too. EXP from battles goes to leveling up items, and health is increased by breaking jars that sometimes contain health capsules. \n\nBattles are fast, dangerous, and even puzzle-like, but your inventory can hold 8 items at a time, and a majority of items are useful enough to get you through a fight one way or another. If you run out of room, dropping an item will place it in an item bank you can access later in the game. \n\nAnd if you die in battle, you aren't forced to reload a save--the game sends you back to a nearby location and gives you a health boost item to make the fight a little easier next time. I beat the game without saving after dying and I don't think a 100% perfect run unlocks anything special, so don't worry, there really is only a benefit to dying.\n\nThe Mysterious Castle is packed with secrets and intelligent game design, teaching the player the mechanics without telling them, in a sense. Graphics are pleasant, sound is great. If I had one qualm, it'd be that sometimes there are secrets that involve walking through random walls. Some of these areas are hinted at through dialogue, but I became conditioned to run straight into every wall for a while just in case. Nothing is missable, but items are valuable, so I can't hold it against the game necessarily.\n\nPlus, the game is only $2. I won't give a playtime so you won't know when the game ends, but I guarantee you'll get your money's worth. \n\nI 100% recommend this game, especially because even if you don't like it, you're only losing a Large Fries side order at Wendy's, and the money goes to someone clearly passionate about game design.", "timestamp_created": 1459124611, "timestamp_updated": 1459124750, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.577673", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22075888": {"recommendationid": "22075888", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018279219", "num_games_owned": 197, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 327, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479346111}, "language": "english", "review": "I greatly enjoyed this game, I havn't enjoyed anything in a long time either.  \n\nI can't give it any higher praise than that.", "timestamp_created": 1459044142, "timestamp_updated": 1459044142, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.649055", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22039084": {"recommendationid": "22039084", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993976949", "num_games_owned": 456, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458899509}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u4eca\u65e5\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3057\u3088\u3046\u3068\u3057\u305f\u3089\u30bb\u30fc\u30d6\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u306e\u9805\u76ee\u304c\u7a7a\u3063\u307d\u306b\u2026(;_;)\n\u524d\u56de\u3044\u3064\u3082\u901a\u308a\u666e\u901a\u306b\u30bb\u30fc\u30d6\u3057\u305f\u7d42\u4e86\u3057\u305f\u3093\u3067\u3059\u3051\u3069\u306d\n\u305d\u308c\u307e\u3067\u306f\u666e\u901a\u306b\u30bb\u30fc\u30d6/\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u304d\u3066\u305f\u3093\u3067\u3059\u3051\u3069\u306d\n\u30c4\u30af\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u30d0\u30b0\u306a\u3093\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\u304b\u2026\uff1f\n\u8efd\u3044\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3068\u306f\u3044\u30483\u6642\u9593\u540c\u3058\u884c\u7a0b\u3092\u3082\u3046\u4e00\u5ea6\u306f\u304d\u3064\u3044\u2026", "timestamp_created": 1458900203, "timestamp_updated": 1458900203, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494217", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22035243": {"recommendationid": "22035243", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031789432", "num_games_owned": 838, "num_reviews": 156, "playtime_forever": 229, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462799434}, "language": "english", "review": "This game doesn't start you off with any story, just a warning not to go explore the ruins.

More fun than just about any other RPG on the market, completely unlike any other RPG Maker game I've seen. Each weapon has its own advantages and disadvantages between Effect (attack power), Defense (you can reduce damage even while attacking), and Wait (the delay before the attack occurs). The wait timer is the key to it all, as even a single point of difference in Wait can change your options significantly.\n\nYou don't have levels, but your weapons do. You spend your XP to improve your weapons, so your starter gear can still put up a fight for a long time without needing to be replaced. There are also a lot of weapons to choose from, but you can only carry 8 at a time. However, you are able to get back dropped items, so there's never any worry about dropping the wrong item to make space for new ones.\n\nThere's very little randomization in the way enemies react, so it's a little like a puzzle to try to figure out the most efficient ways to take down each enemy. Saying that, the AI is a little weak. Once you know what attacks they have, It's easy to lock enemies into a pattern that they will never break out of. Figuring that out, though, can take some educated guesswork.\n\nThe dungeons are different in both appearance and theme. One area is about helping people, another is about solving (easy) puzzles, a third is about finding secret rooms (other areas have hidden rooms, but this area uses them to progress as well), and the starter areas and final zones to round out the package. The story takes you up and down through the levels multiple times, so there's additional backtracking in case you missed something or you can use shortcuts. Content-wise, other than the equipment there isn't really a whole lot, but I don't have any complaints for the price I paid.\n\nI'd really love to see more games in this style, and I definitely

So far i'm loving this title already and while some \"might\" get stuck at parts, they just have to use what they can plainly see to get them through each time they are stuck.  The part with the locked rooms for instance, well...

Ich habs offline gespielt.----\n\nHelen's Mysterious Castle spielte sich etwas anders, als ich erwartet habe. Hinter der niedlichen Fassade verbirgt sich ein kleines, kampflastiges Rollenspiel. Die K\u00e4mpfe machen Laune, sie sind aber auch oft ziemlich knackig. An dieser Stelle ein kleiner Tipp: Man kann seine Waffen im Inventar durch Erfahrungspunkte verbessern, sp\u00e4ter auch beim Schmied.\n\nDas Kampfystem basiert auf Aktionspunkten. Ein Schlag mit dem Breitschwert ben\u00f6tigt z.B. 14 \"Z\u00fcge\", ein Schuss mit dem Langbogen nur 5. Daf\u00fcr haut das Breitschwert viel st\u00e4rker rein und bringt starke defensive Boni. Ein Zauber macht am meisten Schaden, daf\u00fcr dauert es ewig, bis er ausgef\u00fchrt ist und man hat w\u00e4hrenddessen keinerlei Verteidigung. Das ganze wirkt dann wie ein kleines Schachspiel, denn der Gegner kontert die eigenen Z\u00fcge. Man wirkt zu Beginn einen Zauber? Dann greift er eben mit seinem Schwert an und verursacht jedes mal vollen Schaden, weil man ja keinerlei Verteidigung hat. Also nutzt man z.B. am Anfang einen Bogen, damit der Gegner den Schild rausholt und wirkt dann einen Zauber, der die Verteidigung durchdringt. => Da der Bogen weniger Aktionspunkte verbraucht, als der Schild des Gegners, h\u00e4lt er also noch ein Weilchen den Schild hoch, w\u00e4hrend man in Ruhe zaubern kann. So hat man einen kleinen Vorteil.\n\nDa das Spiel sehr kampflastig ist, h\u00e4lt es sich nicht sehr mit der Erz\u00e4hlung einer Story auf. Klar, es gibt sie und sie ist auch nicht schlecht, aber sie tritt bei dem Spiel doch in den Hintergrund. Zur Story selbst m\u00f6chte ich nichts sagen, da ich nicht spoilern will.\n\nUm im Spiel voranzukommen, ist es manchmal notwendig, kleinere R\u00e4tsel zu l\u00f6sen oder verborgene Pfade (in W\u00e4nden o.\u00e4.) zu finden. An einer Stelle artete es leider ziemlich aus, den Pfad zu finden.\n\nIn ca. 6-7 Stunden hat man dann jedenfalls alle K\u00e4mpfe bestritten, alle verborgenen Pfade entdeckt und kann sich im Abspann dar\u00fcber Gedanken machen, was f\u00fcr ein wunderbares, kleines Spiel Helen's Mysterious Castle doch ist. Denn es spielt sich sehr kurzweilig und wunderbar anders, als die Stardard-RPG-Maker-Spiele.

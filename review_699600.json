of content: 127 levels on 7 different boards, plus 4 boards generated every day once you unlock daily levels. it can take a while, but thankfully you don't need to complete every level on a board to unlock the next, and once you gain access to one, you can play all the levels there in any order. otherwise most players (including me) would be stuck on the circle board or level 1 (ONE!) of the double diamond board for a long time. the latter looks pretty easy until you realize it's the trickiest one of them all, at least on that board (nothing beats circle 14).\n\nthe presentation is also worth mentioning. it's colorful and has plenty of settings, unlike most minimalistic puzzle games that tend to take minimalism really seriously and offer no customization whatsoever. there are volume sliders, resolution options, windowed mode, various music tracks, background options, statistics (moves, levels completed, dailies completed, game time), and my favorite: speed settings, plural, because you can customize separately how fast you want pegs to move and the level complete animation to play. really nice. displaying level numbers would be something to consider adding, but there's a level select screen and you can move between levels while playing, so it's not a huge deal, though exactly because of the latter it'd be useful to know where you are on the board.\n\nlevels start out easy, then get a lot more challenging, as I mentioned, but it's a really fun game and should be in every puzzle gamer's library. at the price of a single euro/dollar I'd recommend it even if it had half as many levels and no dailies, but as it is, it's an even better value for money, and I'd also like to mention 'customer support' as a positive, very helpful developer, worth supporting what he

Well is true for the first group of levels, but then the game becomes more and more tricky, and I appreciate this, some days I couldn't finish a level but the next day I resolved it in my first try because I used a different approach.\n\nThe game is polished, the animation, controls, and options are there and they work. This seems quite obvious but there are other puzzle games that don't have those things and the gameplay feels tedious after play for a while. The simple art design gives more value to the game, with a low budget the game look really nice. \n\nI recommend this game, but I don't wanna sound repetitive in my reviews,  the game doesn't have any guide yet, so you should wait a little bit if you don't have patience when you're stuck. \n", "timestamp_created": 1509735960, "timestamp_updated": 1509735960, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472902", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36233867": {"recommendationid": "36233867", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025498220", "num_games_owned": 1938, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 564, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509705575}, "language": "english", "review": "The first thing that came to mind when I played this was trying to solve those triangle peg puzzles I'd see at restaurants while waiting for my order.

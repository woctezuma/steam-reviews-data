I mean, the truth is, this is a shmup. You either like them or you hate them. Personally, I like them, though I acknowledge not all of them are great. Danmaku Unlimited 2 (DU2) does nothing crazy innovative. On the other hand, it takes the common shmup formula and really zeros in on what makes it good.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nIn the realm of shmups, this is what you call a \"bullet hell\" game. That recognizing patterns, dodging bullets, and rarely staying still. To give this game more dimensions, there's a system where you need to build up to use your stronger offensive modes. If you time things just right, you can chain together the different modes for rampant destruction. Also, you can earn credits, which allow you to buy more abilities, which allows you to progress further in the game. \n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\n\nWhile this game has a retro feel, it's by no means a retro-style game. It uses polygons that are pretty basic, which is understandable since Danmaku 2 started life as a mobile game. For a game like this, it doesn't need to look like Crysis. After all, you're operating on a 2D plane blasting away at enemies. One soft criticism I have is that I wish this game ran in portrait mode, which would make it more immersive, and more akin to a proper arcade experience.\n\n[h1]Sound[/h1]\n\nThis is the high point of DU2  for me because it's got a killer soundtrack. It's filled with techno and heavy metal instrumentals. When the double kick bass drum starts, you get pumped for the action. The sound effects are likewise gorgeous, and they really augment the experience. \n\n[h1]Control[/h1]\n\nDU2 runs smoothly on both keyboard and controller. On keyboard, you're using Z, X, C, and the arrow keys. I'm quite thankful that they don't force mouse control or lots of button mashing. I likewise tested this game on both an Xbox 360 and a Steam controller, and they both worked well. This is the kind of game were you need precision controlling, so make sure you're using something fairly comfortable and durable.\n\n[h1]Hardware Compatibility[/h1]\n\nSeeing how this started out as an iOS game, it's disappointing that this isn't at least compatible with Macs. This quibble aside, Danmaku runs on virtually any modern Windows hardware. I tested it on an i7 tower with a GTX 1050 Ti (2017), an HP Stream 11 (2014), a Lenovo ThinkPad E31 (2011), and an Intel Compute Stick (2016). It all runs fine and smoothly on all those computers.\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\n\nIf you're looking for a bullet hell shmup that puts you in the zone and has a killer soundtrack, then DU2 is for you. It's fun and energetic, and has lots of challenge. That said, I wish this was a more robust PC port because portrait mode would be nice.\n\n[b]Score: 3.5/5[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1506470462, "timestamp_updated": 1506470462, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34794400": {"recommendationid": "34794400", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055185716", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 365, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508622029}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent!", "timestamp_created": 1504790951, "timestamp_updated": 1504790951, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34325521": {"recommendationid": "34325521", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048735141", "num_games_owned": 1278, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504117942}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm not a maniac of bullet hell games and, actually, I suck with them badly.

want to start your journey with bullet hell genre, this game is great choice. It's certainly easier than the other STGs on Steam and the graphics are much cleaner which makes dodging bullets easier.\n\nAre there any downsides? Firstly, I don't really understand why there isn't any bomb system. Seriously, it's one of the core elements of bullet hells. It kinda feels like playing FPS without crouching and jumping. Secondly, the game balance is a bit broken. It's not like it breaks your experience completly, but it certainly interrupts flow of the gameplay. For example - let's take third level (I'm talking about hard and extreme difficulty). At the beginning the game literally grabs you and smashes you to the ground. You have barely any space to move because bullets are everywhere plus it's really easy to fly into enemy ships coming from bottom of the screen. However, the boss is certainly the easiest one in the game, barely any challenge.\n\nI really lke this game, though.

Questa tipologia di giochi trae le sue origini dai classici SHMUP aerei a scorrimento verticale da cabinato (per esempio i vari 194X, Aero Fighters o la famosa serie Raiden) e ne amplifica a dismisura la difficolt\u00e0, costringendo il giocatore ad evitare delle vere e proprie raffiche di proiettili che si muovono secondo pattern pi\u00f9 o meno prevedibili.\n\nDU 2 comprende due modalit\u00e0 di gioco principali: Classic e Burst. L'obiettivo in entrambi i casi sar\u00e0 sempre lo stesso, cio\u00e8 farsi largo tra centinaia di nemici (e un numero imprecisato ma molto pi\u00f9 grande di proiettili) all'interno di 5 stage differenti; ci\u00f2 che cambia sono invece le tipologie di attacco e le modalit\u00e0 di ricarica delle nostre abilit\u00e0. \n\nNalla modalit\u00e0 Classic avremo a disposizione due tipologie di fuoco, una principale con uno spread di proiettili abbastanza ampio e un'altra detta \"focus\", un raggio frontale pi\u00f9 stretto che avr\u00e0 l'effetto collaterale di convogliare verso la nostra navicella le stelle azzurre droppate dai nemici uccisi. Queste stelle andranno ad accumularsi lentamente in una barra azzurra, che una volta riempita ci permetter\u00e0 di entrare in modalit\u00e0 \"trance\": per tutta la durata di questo stato (10/15 secondi) la nostra potenza di fuoco aumenta notevolmente e i nemici colpiti rilasciano delle stelle dorate che vanno ad incrementare il nostro punteggio.\n\nLa nostra navicella ha (fortunatamente) una hitbox molto piccola, che \u00e8 rappresentata dal nucleo scintillante al suo centro: schivare i proiettili facendoli passare sopra lo scafo della nostra navicella senza toccare il nucleo equivale a compiere un \"graze\" - letteralmente uno \"sfioramento\". I \"graze\" in modalit\u00e0 Classic servono principalmente per incrementare il  moltiplicatore di punteggio e creare combo (interrotta appena verremo colpiti) che vengono premiate con punti aggiuntivi.\n\nLa modalit\u00e0 Burst offre un piacevole diversivo rispetto allo schema classico appena descritto, e il punto focale \u00e8 proprio l'importanza dei \"graze\" a cui accennavo poco sopra. In questa modalit\u00e0 il \"focus\" secondario \u00e8 sostituito da un'abilit\u00e0 \"beam\", un raggio frontale dagli effetti devastanti, che si ricarica lentamente grazie alle sfere azzurre droppate dai nemici uccisi e che risulta molto utile anche in chiave difensiva, per la sua capacit\u00e0 di distruggere i proiettili nemici sulla sua traiettoria. A differenza della modalit\u00e0 Classic la barra della \"trance\" si rigenera sfruttando i \"graze\", quindi per riempirla dovremo metterci costantemente in pericolo sfiorando i proiettili ed esibendoci in schivate millimetriche.\n\nDal punto di vista della grafica DU 2 sfoggia un 2D che rasenta la perfezione.

In certain sections, particularly after level 2, it is nearly impossible to NOT take a hit - and bosses are guaranteed to deplete your lives in a hurry (try to get to the boss in Wilde Sau with as many lives as possible - you're going to need them!) In spite of this, however, the game never seems unfair or cheaty - if you die in Danmaku 2, it's your fault. And as noted, you WILL die. Plenty of times.\n\nPart of this is because the game rewards the player for being adventurous. Grazed bullets earn you points, and can help replenish the Trance meter faster. This, in turn, goads the player into becoming reckless and 'showing off' - which leads to warranted and inevitable death. Again, however, at no point does this mechanic seem unfair; it is simply a trick meant to boost the difficulty, and it's the player's own fault for falling for it.\n\nThis review could not end without mention being made of the music. While the sound effects are minimal, and nothing you would not expect from a game of this type, this is by no means a downside, as more space is given to the GORGEOUS musical score. Each level is scored by crisply-played, adrenaline-pumping instrumental thrash metal, which perfectly complements the game's ultra-violent, yet stunningly refined atmosphere. It is the kind of music which makes you regret that the soundtrack is not available, and takes you to Bandcamp to see if BLANKFIELD have a page on there.\n\nAll in all, then, Danmaku Unlimited 2 comes across as a winner all round. Stunning visuals, smooth controls, hard but fair difficulty, and a fantastic soundtrack all contribute to create a superb retro blast, which would have been a steal at full price, let alone on sale!

But you've to deal with bullets, a lot of bullets, OMG bullets EVERYWHERE !\n\nThe game isn't easy (good point), musics are delicious and goes very well with the action (very good). Graphics aren't very beautiful, but clear and I like the color pallet (good point as well).\n\nYou can choose two game modes (burst and classic), you can buy some upgrades for your ship or lives/credit. I don't like that much upgrades in Shmups, IMHO those kind of games may be played with only 1 credit and without starting with bonus : the game will be more more more fun :-) But I can ignore this step, so watever.\n\nBurst mode bring a beam (button 2) and the Trance mode (button 3). When activated the beam can \"broke\" bullets, you're safe using this. The Trance mode make you powerful.\nClassic mode bring an alternate shoot (button 2) and The Trance mode as well (button 3). No beam in Classic mode, but the Trance is better : more powerful and safe (small bullets disapear when activated).\nI personnaly choose the Classic mode. The Trance mode is safe and the alternate shoot make you slower, so you can use it to slalom between waves of bullets.\n\nNote that you can rotate the display, to put your screen vertically.

Veteran danmaku won't have a problem with this,but do buy for the music.\n\nThis game is practically the oasis of a desert of poorly optimized and graphically subpar danmakus on Steam.\n\nThe gameplay doesn't differ from any other Danmakus. But since it's a genre it should not try to be different since there's little room for change. Think of FPS games. \n\nI really liked the leveling system in the game. It's pretty fresh and it gives me a reason to go back and play it. Pardon me as I inflate my ego by stating that I beat the game on extreme on my second try. Which to be honest is a pretty troubling thing for me. Spending money on bullet hell only to play it for an hour and never touch it again because there's no reason to.\nBut do not use this as a basis of your judgement on the difficulty of the game. I have an unhealthily long log of Danmakus that I've beaten on the highest difficulty so I guess I can be considered a veteran.\nThis game isn't hard nor is it too easy. It's perfect for beginners-above average\nYour arsenal contains of the usual projectiles in which you'll hold on to the button the entire time you're playing.\nThen there's the bomb which will convert all incoming enemy project into point orbs.\nThen there's the laser which will destroy any projectile that it can reach.\n\nThe graphics are surprisingly smooth and clean. Seeing as how I was greeted by a small window for settings when I first started the game I immediately had my expectations lowered. People who played a lot of the other Danmaku will know what window I'm talking about. *Looks at eXceed , Acceleration of Suguri etc.*\nDon't get me wrong,those game are fun in their own aspect. \nAlso keep in mind that this is a mobile port... The very thought of playing a bullet hell on a mobile phone terrifies me.\n\nThe soundtrack really took me by surprise. The first stage music started off lightly with a few acoustic fingerstyle strums before pleasantly transitioning into heavy metal.

the doujin shmup scene, especially when it comes to accessibility and difficulty curves. Indeed, the sheer size of the challenge laid out before would-be bullet hell players often proves itself to be the greatest obstacle that separates those who develop a fondness for games of the genre and those who don\u2019t. While the sub-genre has always possessed a high entry-barrier that no doubt contributed to its limited appeal outside of Japan in the past, those games that hail from the doujin variety tend to stand out in particular. With Danmaku Unlimited 2 Doragon Entertainment seeks to recreate that iconic doujin experience. For the most part, they succeed.\n\nIf Danmaku Unlimited 2 has an in-depth story, it isn\u2019t presented in the game. Like most shmups, Danmaku Unlimited 2 puts narrative to one side and gives its full, undivided attention to the gameplay experience alone. While each of the game\u2019s five stages provides some degree of context for the action, it\u2019s clearly the case that this isn\u2019t a story-driven game. \n\nThe driving force behind Danmaku Unlimited 2 stems from its well-polished, highly-refined core gameplay. A typical scenario begins with the player gunning down countless enemies as they appear at the top of the screen, all the while avoiding the beautiful but deadly hail of bullets sent the player\u2019s way. Defeating enemies causes scoring items to appear and fall towards the bottom of the screen. The final phase of each level is indicated by a boss, who throws a series of different bullet patterns at the player in sequence, switching to the next pattern each time the player inflicts a certain amount of damage upon the boss. Dealing with such heavy densities of enemy fire can prove troublesome, but that\u2019s where \u2018Trance\u2019 comes in. Destroying one\u2019s opponents charges the Trance Gauge. When the gauge is full, Trance can be activated, converting bullets in the player\u2019s immediate vicinity into scoring items and also enabling the player to unleash more powerful attacks than before.\n\nThe enemy placement within each level has been well-thought through. Weaker enemies are often clumped together, prompting the player to mow them down in quick succession to boost their score, while stronger enemies like to hide at the top of the screen, peppering the player with bullets and forcing them to take evasive action. However the bullet count consistently remains quite low, particularly for a game seeking to emulate a doujin shmup. It isn\u2019t made any more challenging by the fact that the bullets also tend to move rather slowly. Those two factors lead to the game feeling somewhat easier than what one might initially expect, which could be a good or bad thing, depending on one\u2019s past experience with bullet hell games. Players who are no strangers to the conventions of the genre are more than likely to find themselves underwhelmed even on higher difficulties, which is a shame, considering that those are the people most likely to possess the strongest appreciation for the doujin shmup.\n\nBefore setting off to battle; either from the start of the game or from any stage of the player\u2019s choosing via \u2018Free Play\u2019; one may choose from one of two modes. \u2018Burst Mode\u2019 provides the player with a potent beam attack which can be used for going on the offensive, or for clearing a path through enemy bullets. The advantages afforded to the player by having such a tool at their disposal are offset by their inability to generate scoring items by killing enemies through the use of normal fire: accurate, efficient use of the beam attack and Trance become the only means of guaranteeing a high score. \u2018Classic Mode\u2019 offers up more a traditional bullet hell experience that those already acquainted with the genre should feel right at home with, in which attacks of any sort are adequate for creating scoring items.\n\nThe beam attack and Trance are both well-conceived mechanics. They can double up as additional defensive measures for those getting to grips with the action, while also serving as means for securing additional points, for individuals already on top of things.\n\nPlayers operate the Senko fighter, a versatile craft capable of undergoing numerous upgrades to suit the situation as necessary. Playing the game in any mode earns the player experience. Accumulating experience will gradually allow the player to progress in rank until they hit the top and become an Ace. As rank increases so too do the player\u2019s options to outfit the Senko with the capabilities of their choosing. Players can opt for three different forms of attack for their fighter, in addition to the beam attack. It\u2019s possible to take multiple forms of attack for the sake of versatility, or to focus on upgrading one in order to support a specific playstyle. Those willing to forego the luxury of having extra lives and credits at their disposal will find themselves able to maximize their offensive capabilities. This upgrade system gives players a chance to experiment and find a playstyle that works for them, while also lending the game additional replayability. It\u2019s a nice touch, and one that feels original but still has its place in a bullet hell game.\n\nDanmaku Unlimited 2 is a visually stunning 2D piece \u2013 the graphics are easily some of the best seen in a bullet hell game in recent times. The cyan/purple colour palette gives the game\u2019s environments an \u2018otherworldly\u2019 look, but not one that feels too far-fetched. Ships have a bold, coloured outline that makes them stand out, even when the screen is literally filled with explosions and scoring items. The centralized HUD also makes a difference: it\u2019s nice not having to take yours eyes too far from the action to glance at some game-critical info. A cyan-coloured dot marks the player ship\u2019s hitbox, which still remains easy to spot in the midst of a heated battle, thanks to the trail it gives off. Unfortunately the same can\u2019t be said about the game\u2019s audio. Most; if not all; of the music quickly gets repetitive. The sound effects themselves are surprisingly weak, and don\u2019t have any real impact, with some explosions being barely even audible even at higher volume levels.\n\nOverall Danmaku Unlimited 2 is a fairly enjoyable game that\u2019s likely to find the most favour with those caught in the middle-ground. Long-time veterans of the genre might find the experience a little too light, but for the uninitiated and anyone with only a moderate degree of bullet hell experience, Doragon Entertainment\u2019s love letter to fans of the doujin shmup delivers an entertaining package that; generally speaking; knows and understands at least part of its audience.", "timestamp_created": 1422796787, "timestamp_updated": 1423378112, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14110255": {"recommendationid": "14110255", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085155460", "num_games_owned": 206, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 545, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511883333}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice Bullet Hell game with really really great metal soundtrack.

Sadly, I fell rather disappointed by this game, and consider it to be severely lacking. Even among independently developed games it can\u2019t measure up.\n\nThe game itself seems okay at first sight. You get a modifiable fighter plane with weapons \u2014 straight shot, homing shot, wide shot \u2014 that you can mix and match. There are two scoring modes, Burst and Classic, and four difficulties each. Following STG convention, the game has five stages, with mid and end bosses, and if you finish the game on one credit on at least hard\u2019, you\u2019ll face a \u2018true last boss\u2019 as well. As a bonus, there is a boss rush mode, and a free play mode for those who like to credit feed through the game.\n\nWhile Danmaku Unlimited 2 follows the STG formula in broad strokes, it sadly goes awry in many, many areas. Let me describe some of the problems I\u2019ve had with it one by one:\n\n1) The music is incredibly bland and does not synchronise with the action on screen at all.\n\n2) There are very few sound effects, not even for basic actions like shooting.\n\n3) The shield system is poorly thought out. If effectively acts as a life bar, meaning that you can take several hits. However, if you slip, you lose the ship. This seems needlessly punishing. As I'll describe later on, there are situations where it's easy to trip up due to design flaws of the game.\n\n4) Bullet visibility is pretty poor. While you can tell bullets from the background, there is not enough contrast. Have you ever wondered why in Cave games the bullets have garish colours, while the backgrounds may even seem a bit washed out? Here, bullets and background are often in similar colors. This problem might have been prevented had there been actual background images instead of mostly static colors.\n\n5) Further, I am not fond at all of how some of the bullets overlap. There are instances where smaller bullets move underneath larger ones, so while you focus on avoiding the larger ones, you may get hit by a small bullet that just emerged underneath it.\n\n6) In many STGs, there is a dead zone around turrets, meaning that if you\u2019re getting close, they won\u2019t fire. In Danmaku Unlimited 2, this is not the case, which means that as you move past a large space ship, you may just get hit without expecting it.\n\n7) What I also find very unfortunate is that smaller enemies don\u2019t get invincibility frames. Particularly in stage 5 it may happen that you get hit because you didn\u2019t memorise yet that you entered a part of the stage where a swarm of small enemies enters from the side. Those deaths through collision punish players who have not yet memorised a stage, and are a sign of poor game design, in my opinion. A good counter example on Steam is Crimzon Clover, by the way, where enemies that fly into the screen can\u2019t hit you for a few frames.\n\n8) Overall, the difficulty is really uneven. Some boss patterns in later levels are laughably easy, just to be followed by much trickier ones. In a carefully balanced STG I expect something different.\n\n9) I strongly dislike that I have to unlock game features. This means that you start out with an underpowered fighter, and have to earn in-game currency (thankfully no IAP), to unlock more lives, continues, or more powerful weapons.\n\n10) There seems to be a bug: When you 1cc the game, you end up at the title screen, but you don\u2019t unlock any achievements, or get any of your in-game currency. However, if you then enter a new mode, and exit prematurely, then the game records your progress.\n\n11) Minor quibble: I would have appreciated if the game let me skip the credits.\n\n12) The high score boards are hacked, which is always unfortunate, as it shows a lack of support of the developer.\n\n13) The scoring system is poorly thought out, since a few successful actions completely negate the entire rest of the game. Some people are upset because in Cave games it is often the case that you score more in stage 5 than in the entire rest of the game, even though stage 5 normally is a lot longer and has a lot more enemies, so it\u2019s pretty much justified. In Danmaku Unlimited 2, though, your score depends on something like a minute or two of play time in total.\n\n*** added ***\n14) The achievements with point values seem broken. I just reached 1 billion in total,  but it didn't activate.\n\n15) Some bullets, like the hexagons, are incredibly poorly designed. Those only harm you if you get hit by the center, meaning that the hitbox of your ship can safely sit on a large part of the area of those bullets. Another example are the large bullets in the last phase of the stage 5 boss. However, those have no demarcated center. Just like with the other bullets, if you don't know this, then you think those boss patterns are a lot more difficult than they are.\n\n16) The transition from iPhone to PC should have led to changes in the control setup. On the phone, the speed of the ship is relative to the speed of your finger. In this version the ship has a relatively high default speed, and to slow it down, you have to use the burst shot. This is fine in Classic mode, since that shot is available without limit. However, in Burst mode, you can only slow down by activating a burst shot with a separate gauge that has to be filled. If the gauge isn't high enough, the ship does nothing at all. This means that some boss fights, where you have to weave though tight patterns, are incredibly tedious, and take a lot longer than they otherwise would.\n\nConsidering all those issues, some minor, some large, I simply cannot recommend Danmaku Unlimited 2. There are other STGs of much higher quality available on Steam, or on consoles. My personal recommendation on Steam is Crimzon Clover: World Ignition, which is also independently produced, and one of if not the best STG around.\n\nI'd recommend this game to people who think that touch screens are a superior input alternative for STGs, those who think that superplayers can dodge rain, and those who consider Touhou to be the pinnacle of this genre. Danmaku Unlimited 2 is not the bullet hell you need, but the one you deserve.\n\n2/10", "timestamp_created": 1420565524, "timestamp_updated": 1420665051, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.589552", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13850971": {"recommendationid": "13850971", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055174933", "num_games_owned": 1092, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 373, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1423397257}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\u5f39\u5e55\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b80\u5355\u6d41\u7545\u597d\u4e0a\u624b\uff0cBGM\u4e5f\u633a\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\uff0c\u753b\u9762\u4e5f\u5f88\u7cbe\u7f8e\uff0c\u4e24\u8fb9\u8fd8\u6709\u653e\u5927\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u753b\u9762\uff0c\u5f39\u5e55\u4e5f\u633a\u534e\u4e3d\u7684\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e00\u5173\u7684boss\u6218\u90fd\u6709\u7279\u6709\u7684\u5f39\u5e55\u6280\u80fd\u548cBGM\uff01\u8ba9\u6211\u60f3\u8d77\u4e86\u4e1c\u65b9Project\uff08TouHou Project\uff09\uff0c\u53ef\u60dc\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0d\u591a\uff0c\u4e14\u603b\u4f53\u96be\u5ea6\u504f\u4f4e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u6700\u9ad8\u96be\u5ea6\u4e5f\u4e0d\u80fd\u6ee1\u8db3\u6211\u554a\uff0c\u6709\u70b9\u5931\u671b\uff08\u771f\u4e0d\u5982\u4e1c\u65b9\u7cfb\u5217\u5f39\u5e55\u6e38\u620f\u7684L\u96be\u5ea6\uff09\n\u4e0d\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4f9d\u65e7\u662f\u4e2a\u597d\u4f5c\u54c1\uff0c\u8d5e\u4e00\u4e2a\uff01 \u5bf9\u5f39\u5e55\u5c04\u51fb\u6e38\u620f\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c1d\u8bd5\u73a9\u73a9\uff0c\u5f88\u597d\u4e0a\u624b\u5462\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1420478556, "timestamp_updated": 1420478556, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511202", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13819488": {"recommendationid": "13819488", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084199436", "num_games_owned": 749, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 362, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443362644}, "language": "english", "review": "I normally wasn't a big fan of bullet hell sh'mups, but this was tide turning. \nThe gameplay in here gives you enough tools to get through, but doesn't hold your hand the whole way through like most games.

This is a bullet-hell 2D shooter, the kind where your screen gets flooded by death and you're expected to survive and get a high-score. While lacking in style, DU2 has the fundamentals down pat, is sufficiently challenging, and can be quite entertaining.\n\nI forgot the plot to this game. It was probably too dramatic and complicated for me to understand.\n\nTo start with, DU2 has an upgrade system. It's a little unique in that while you eventually get more points to distribute, you never get enough to max out anything. Your options include increasing your firepower, your ADS (shield), and additional lives & continues. Extra survival sounds nice, but taking damage will severely penalize your score. Unless beating the true boss reveals the best ending since -insert your favorite videogame ending here- I'd consider investing elsewhere. Most of your \"upgrades\" are going to come the old-fashioned way, playing through the game again and again until you figure it all out.\n\nThere are two modes of play, burst and arcade. I'm going to refrain from speaking too much on the scoring systems. If I understood anything at all I'd have scored trillions of points. If I had to guess, I'd say getting a high-score involves lots of staying close to bullets, knowing when to trigger the hyper ability, and keeping that multiplier high. Burst mode is probably a bit easier to figure out, since you can use a wicked laser to build up the multiplier. Arcade mode is easier though, mainly because holding down the fire button provides a homing shot, allowing you to focus almost entirely on dodging stuff.\n\nHonestly, there's not much else to say. Danmaku Unlimited 2 doesn't really throw any curveballs. Once you understand the basics, it's all a matter of dealing with the increasing intensity of enemy fire. Each of the five stages has the standard mid-boss/boss setup, and the bosses themselves are multi-form behemoths with the occasional gimmick. Like I said, this game doesn't do much to stand out in terms of visuals. This can be considered a good thing however. Not everybody wants to play a shooter, where all of the characters are little girls, and they're fighting an army of giant crocodiles over the world's supply of rice cakes. \n\nDanmaku Unlimited 2 delivers exactly what you'd expect out of a quality 2D shooter.

You've seen tons of them at the arcades, the japanese gaming industry pumping out thousands of them, even indie developers like ZUN making ENTIRE SERIES of them. The thing is, that's because they are brutally challenging, aesthetically pleasing, and reward high risk gameplay and daredevil flying, so a lot of skill and high reactions are required. Danmaku Unlimited 2 is perhaps one of the purest examples of such a thing. It's the Bullethell shooter genre distilled into a two-flavoured package.\n\nI say that because DU2 actually has two modes of play. Both are exactly the same game, and the upgrades and progressing you unlock (oh yes there's that too) apply to both modes, but each mode changes the core mechanics of the gameplay.\n\nIt's not immediately obvious from the outset, so here's a rundown. You have Burst mode, and Classic mode to choose from when you start a game. Classic Mode is your average Bullet-hell style shooter. You have a ship that's pretty mobile, it has a tiny little hitbox (that nice glowing core on your ship, don't let bullets touch it!), and you can shoot your guns. Your primary fire (Z, or X on a 360 pad) is your wide area rapid fire shooting, and your secondary fire  (X, or A on 360 pad) is your Focus ability, which most STG fans will know is where your fire goes to a narrow path straight ahead and is concentrated, all point items on screen are sucked towards you, and movement is slowed allowing for more precision movement. This allows you to weave in and out of the beautiful bullet patterns to \"Graze\" your ship along bullets. Grazing increases your score multiplier and also powers up your \"Trance\" ability (C, or Right Bumper on 360 pad), which is the same between both modes - a quick wipe of all bullets CURRENTLY on the screen, and your power is massively increased, allowing you to destroy enemies rapidly, also causing them to drop very high value point items... for a limited time of course. Once Trance runs out, it has to recharge. In Classic mode, it automatically recharges over time.\n\nIn BURST mode on the other hand, you still keep your regular primary fire as normal, but your Focus ability is changed to a \"Beam\" ability. It has all the benefits of the usual Focus mode, EXCEPT that you don't fire again until AFTER you release the button, and ONLY if your Beam gauge is full, sort of like a mini Trance power! The Beam power is STUPIDLY powerful, and wipes out bullets it shoots too, so FANTASTIC for getting out of a tight spot. However you can only actually fire with it if the gauge has enough power in it, and hte more power, the longer it fires for. How do you build up the guage for the beam? You collect point items! Simple yes? Trance is exactly the same in BURST mode, except that in THIS instance you can ONLY build your Trance gauge up if you graze bullets. It does not automatically refill this time. You actively have to put yourself at risk to get it back so you can save yourself in a pinch.\n\nHere's where Danmaku Unlimited 2 really shines. At its core it's pretty bog-standard STG format, with a few little twists (like Burst Mode for example), but it is a game entirely built around risk and reward, ESPECIALLY with the Burst Mode. The closer you are to enemies when you destroy them, the more your multiplier is built up, and the higher value pointitems they drop. The more bullets you graze, the higher your score, the quicker you get back your Trance gauge. The better you do and the further you get, the more 'XP' you get, which grants you more points to spend on upgrades to make your ship ever more powerful.\n\nIt's devilishly hard, and a lot of fun... and that's not even mentioning the ASTOUNDING soundtrack by BLANKFIELD. Give it a listen, it's pulse-pounding, adrenaline-fuelled metal and it is GLORIOUS. It's just a terrible shame it's so pricey at $9.99!.. but then you do get the soundtrack for the previous game in the series, the sadly iPhone only \"Storm Strikers\". Oh well!\n\n(I think there's a Danmaku Unlimited 1 as well, but that's again iPhone only... and may actually be Storm Strikers, I don't know. I can find VERY little details on both Storm Strikers and Danmaku Unlimited 1!)", "timestamp_created": 1413249899, "timestamp_updated": 1413249899, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 50, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.818734", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12473287": {"recommendationid": "12473287", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105408904", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1413251591}, "language": "english", "review": "Music: 9/10\nGraphics: 8/10\nControls: 10/10\nFun Factor: 10/10\n\nGood graphics, perfect controls, and an awesome soundtrack!

The controls are super tight, allowing for pin-point movements of your ship between waves upon waves of bullets. The hitbox of your ship is obvious and phantom hits are very very rare. Bullet curtains from mini bosses and bosses are obvious (and on some occasions very beautiful), however navigating the plethora of neon projectiles will take multiple attempts.\n\nThere aren\u2019t any gimmicks with the gameplay, simply shoot enemies and avoid bullets. You\u2019re super weapon charges over time or after an enemy kill. When it reaches 100% you can unleash a devastating beam of energy that temporarily removes all projectiles and deals massive damage to enemies in it\u2019s path. You get a multiplier to your score based on how many bullets \u201cnear-miss\u201d you, that is come within centimeters of your ship without hitting you. You also get bonus points for how close you are to an enemy when you destroy them. For those going on a high score run, it pays to live dangerously. \n\nBosses are another area in which this game shines. Bullet patterns the bosses force you to dive through are spectacular and very beautiful. Each boss requires a few playthroughs to understand their attack patterns through each phase. As you advance through the game the number of phases a boss increases, making a untimely bullet hit or ship loss even more costly. \n\nThe icing on the cake is the price point. $4.99 on Steam or from the developers own site is all you have to pay for this excellent game. This game is perfect for beginners (you can reduce the difficulty to beginner levels) or veterans (you can increase the difficulty to rage-inducing levels). No matter your bullet hell playing level, you will enjoy this game.\n\nSee more of the review at: http://www.skepticalminotaurgames.com/danmaku-unlimited-21", "timestamp_created": 1412719063, "timestamp_updated": 1412719063, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12384696": {"recommendationid": "12384696", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995414153", "num_games_owned": 547, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 229, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509539702}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been played a lot of Bullet Hell games.

This Authentic Japanese Doujin Shooter's Qualities will appeal to many gamers\" [/i] [/h1]\n\n[h1] [u] Introduction - My Story [/u] [/h1]\nWhen I saw this game and dashed through its content, I thought it looked quite familiar and when I decided to watch its trailer and after that, I immediately wanted to buy this game. Watching the trailer seemed to spark something lost in my memories I have forgotten. After buying this game and then afterwards playing it, I was never so happy to find other games similar to the ones I had played during my childhood.\nPlaying Danmaku Unlimited 2 has relived my memories from years ago of playing my favorite Arcade Style & Scrolling Shooter series Raiden and other Japanese shmup games.\nNow that you heard my story, why should you buy this game now?\n\n[h1] [u] The Game Changing Elements [/u] [/h1]\n[b] [u] Introduction: [/u] [/b] For beginners & newcomers this is a great choice for a Bullet-Hell Genre. You can and will rapidly adjust to your game play by the upgrades and difficulty that helps adjust with YOUR OWN GAMING STYLE. There will examples like Side Shooting or even Homing Rockets for you to choose depending on what you may prefer.\n[b] [u] Graphics: [/u] [/b] The Graphics of this game are amazingly exploding in 60fps HD quality, being quite appealing to the eye. Along with a Smooth & Beautiful Background that doesn't distract you from enjoying the game and if the Mirror Background does happen to disturb you at all, then you can always disable it in Options. Otherwise, the graphics won't be distracting at all during Gameplay.\n[b] [u] Controls: [/u] [/b] Your Controls are very Swift and can be changed to your handling. Using only the Arrow Keys for Movement and Z - Primary Fire, X - Secondary Fire or Beam, and C - Trance Mode as default controls.\n[b] [u] Difficulty Mode: [/u] [/b] As for the Difficulty Modes, they are very Forgiving and No Hassle to change. I'm a veteran with this genre of gaming, but yet always choose Easy/Medium first to get used to the game first (Same goes to almost any game I play, I'll either start with Easy or Normal. Also, because I want to enjoy the game first), later switching over to \"Impossible Difficulty\" and had no trouble... With some practice first, of course. At times it can certainly be fun and challenging.\n[b] [u] Game Modes: [/u] [/b] There are 2 Different Game Modes being Classic & Burst Mode. The only differences between those 2 modes are your Secondary Fire and Trance Mode; For Classic your Secondary will be fired in a different position from your Primary Fire and appear to home in on your Target/s until you go up the screen at a certain height and the Trance Mode Bar will automatically fill up by itself. In Burst Mode you will have a Beam as your Secondary; The once charged will unleash FURY UPON YOUR ENEMIES and even wipe away any bullets upon its path. However, the Trance Mode Bar in Burst Mode does not fill up automatically.\n[b] [u] Bullet Patterns:  [/u] [/b] Creative Bullet Patterns are something that must be payed attention closely as you play multiple games for your benefit studying them; while some patterns are easy to follow and others require a few glances to understand its nature. The harder the difficulty the more complicated the patterns will turn out. Figuring the patterns out are also key, \"To Increasing your score by Glazing Bullets, therefore increasing Multiplier\".\n[b] [u] Upgrading System: [/u] [/b] Now the Upgrading System, while some games back then offered multiple ships with certain stats changed and different weaponry or items also; Danmaku offers an upgrading system allowing you to adjust what you prefer like Firepower over More Lives. You get more points throughout the game as you play and Rank Up. Upgrades will include 3 Different Weapons, Lives, ADS (Amount of Hits you can take in 1 Life) etc.\n[b] [u] Music: [/u] [/b] The Music by BLANKFIELD is out of this World. I'll admit I have never heard of them before, but very glad I did and without their work this game would have never had such amazing music to ease your game playing. Intense Gameplay & Roaring Music... Without one of them, we would be missing a huge element.\nOh, and it's Only $5 and Really Helps the Developers + BLANKFIELD as thanks for this game.\n\n[h1] [u] Conclusion [/u] [/h1]\nOverall, I really like to thank the developers for creating such an incredible game and for letting me experience my childhood once more :P.\nI would definitely be interested in a sequel to a clearer story as many others aren't sure as I am to what those Allied Fighters' purpose was after they took off with you in the beginning of Stage 1 with you and later on 1 got destroyed during combat? You will not see them again later on in the game after that occurring event.\nI thought that later they might help you out, but I guess they didn't so I would like to know their purpose. Until then that part will remain a mystery to everyone.\nI brought this game for $7.50 (At the time it was still $10, but for 25% off) and I didn't regret one cent, as this was truly a great game that I have enjoyed playing.

I believe the developer worked soley on iPhone games before this one and you can definitely tell.  I found it difficult to navigate around the playing field at times and felt claustrophobic on more than a few occasions.  This is a shame, because it's not how you should feel when you're playing a shmup - the bullet patterns should make you feel like you're threading the needle down a narrow canyon, not like you're trapped inside an elevator.  Adding to this complaint, the ship speed felt slow to me.  You couldn't zip around and avoid bullets if you needed to, and then slow down using a focus-fire mechanic, there seemed to be no change in speed of your ship when you switched to focus.\n\nI started playing the game on \"Normal\" difficulty and felt challenged.  This is a good thing - when I say challenged I mean to say it was really difficult.  There were two difficulty levels above \"Normal\" and I was pumped to check them out.  After beating the main game I jumped right into \"Extreme\" (hardest) difficulty expecting to get my socks blown off...unfortunately, that didn't happen.  Extreme was nearly the same difficulty as Normal was, just with a few added bullets here and there, but the patterns were largely the same, and if you had figured them out on Normal, adjusting to Extreme wasn't that much bigger of a deal. \n\nUpgrade mechanics - this I didn't like.  The game has an \"Upgrade\" mechanic in it.  Basically it seems you're supposed to grind the game out quite a bit before your ship is fighting at its full potential.  I think that's stupid.  There's no reason I should have to throw myself at enemies with an underleveled ship numerous times and die in the process before I can have all my unlocks earned.  That's not to say this mechanic *can't* work - it's just that DU2 doesn't fit this style of gameplay.  Example - one of my favorite shmups of all time is Tyrian, it has an upgrade mechanic and it works beautifully as you can upgrade in-between levels and there are numerous paths and levels you can go down.  DU2 is one path, five levels, and you're supposed to grind those same levels out for awhile until your ship's weapons are upgraded and you have all your lives and all your continues available.  No thanks, all or nothing please, this half-way attempt was detrimental to the player's experience.\n\nThe music was good, although I did wish there was more of it.  Each level had a song and there was a \"boss\" song that repeated at every boss fight except for the final boss.  It was good and unique for a shmup - metal, sounded kind of like Animals as Leaders or Between the Buried and Me or something.\n\nThere are two gameplay modes - Normal and Classic.  Normal is the developers take on a scoring system I guess, but I didn't really like it and stuck to classic mode.  The only difference that I really saw was that instead of a \"Focus Fire\" mode you had to charge up a beam cannon that lasted only a limited time as well.  \n\nOverall I like what the developer was going for here but the above mistakes prevented the game from being a standout (especially the sprite-sizing and claustrophobic feeling).  That's not to say I wouldn't recommend it, I do, but I would only recommend it for fans of the genre.  There are better titles to play (especially for new players) and I would recommend starting there before grabbing DU2.\n\nWith all that said, DU2 is a fine addition to a shmup fan's catalogue and I'm sure you'll have some fun going through the game a few times.", "timestamp_created": 1409193373, "timestamp_updated": 1409193532, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11804884": {"recommendationid": "11804884", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025363090", "num_games_owned": 281, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 317, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494702165}, "language": "english", "review": "A must for every bullet hell fan.

You usually don't hear music this good in a shmup.  It's easily my favorite OST at the moment.  I can't overemphasize how many points that's worth, in a genre centered around visceral appeal combined with a little brain overload.  The music is important, and DU2's music gets you pumped as heck.\n\nThat said, I have mixed feelings about the actual shmuppery.  Don't get me wrong, I recommend it, because it's fun.  The scoring is simple to wrap your head around, the game itself is relatively straightforward and the patterns are nice, etc.  The bullets are chunky and bright and easy to read, in nice colors.  But the game uses a leveling system that ends up being pointless after you play for a few hours and hit max level.  It just becomes an extra screen to mash through after each playthrough.  And they don't give you enough points to max out more than one shot type, or to have more than one level in each if you want all of them.  So, why even have you level up?  Why not do different ship types?  The shield system also feels pretty noobish.\n\nAll that said, though, the game is still a lot of fun to play, and the stages and bosses have some patterns that are really fun to dodge.  The game also gets ridiculously difficult on higher settings, so there's some longevity to it.", "timestamp_created": 1404600164, "timestamp_updated": 1404600164, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11076748": {"recommendationid": "11076748", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996638544", "num_games_owned": 284, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 80, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511133807}, "language": "english", "review": "What can I say.

What DU2 makes up for however, is an upgrade system very akin to Beat Hazard, in that the more you play, and the better you score, the higher a rank you will achieve, and the more points you will have to upgrade various elements of your ship.\n\nMy only complaint however is to do with the audio -  a minor issue.\n\nI feel the heavy guitar fits the setting of the music, but I feel like it's too much, and can become bland, or jarring to a degree - a little melody here any there could have really made this soundtrack more memorable. Secondly, the SFX seem slightly lacking, I've yet to tweak the audio settings, but at default, it's as if your ship has no firing SFX, putting more focus onto the BGM which doesn't particularly help, and could possibly break immersion.\n\nOther than that, you get a very good experience for your money, the game feels, and DEFINITELY looks the part, so I see no reason why I shouldn't recommend this to anyone.", "timestamp_created": 1404404063, "timestamp_updated": 1404404063, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11013038": {"recommendationid": "11013038", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029951224", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1403845835}, "language": "english", "review": "OMGGGGGG LAZORS!!!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1404272885, "timestamp_updated": 1404272885, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10995172": {"recommendationid": "10995172", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965897648", "num_games_owned": 542, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1404641366}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my favorite bullet hell games.", "timestamp_created": 1404203169, "timestamp_updated": 1404203169, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10982550": {"recommendationid": "10982550", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038629391", "num_games_owned": 318, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1421490351}, "language": "english", "review": "Being new to the 'bullet hell' genre, I had only seen youtube videos of impossible-looking levels.

YES!\n\n-=TL;DR=-\nDanmaku Unlimited is an extremely well crafted vertical shooter that nails controls, difficulty, bullet patterns, graphics and sound design. While a bit difficult due to its bullet hell nature, the game is argurably (and often noted as) accessible to the non-danmaku player - the kind of person that would play shmups ocassionally, but generally not these types. The presentation of DU2 is of top-notch quality, most especially the soundtrack and sound design, and video options even include screen rotation, though, not my 2560x1080 resolution.  Danmaku Unlimited 2 is a pefect buy for shmup/danmaku fans, and a solid introdution for the non-fans, especially at a low price. I knew immediately within the first minute of gameplay that this game was excellent.\n\n\n-=Gameplay=\nFirst off, the options screen provides options to change prize drop visibility, trance mode (super attack) sound cues, screen rotation, most notably the ability to change from X-Input (Xbox 360) or D-Input (DirectInput, the standard of controllers before X-Input), as well as the sound/music options seen in most games (why the hell you'd turn that down is a matter of sin). I've read that the game doesn't support arcade sticks, which is insane, but I would think a X-Input or D-Input stick would work, at least with something like JoyToKey\n\nMain game modes are Arcade and Bonus. Arcade makes the player ship move in a consisten speedt and provides a beam weapon that can cancel bullets and is refilled either by time orbs (I can't tell). The player has a choice of chosing a Focus (Straight) shot, a partial straight and homing shot, and a spread shot. Classic plays more like Exceed 3rd, where the ship moves quickly in its standard shot, and moves slowly to help you carefully dodge and shoots semi-homing bullets in a narrow line, which causes more damage. The Bonus mode offers a Boss Rush and a Free Play mode where you can choose to practice on any level. While most shmups's replayability comes from practice and and doing One Credit Clears (callled 1CC, beating a game w/o continues), the replayability comes in the form of a level up system, which gives you points to improve your weapon type, beam weapon (ADS), Burst attack, lives, and continues after winning or loosing the game. Points for levels are granted regardless if you win, so you are not at a complete disadvantage if you loose, though, most Shmup players will be fine with the standard weaponry.\n\nThe hitbox is clear and quite forgiving as I've had the edge of bullets actually touch the box itself and the bullets are drawn, colored, animated, and used perfectly to give a player an idea of where the bullet is going and where you need to dodge. This is important, as grazing bullets on your sprite is handy in scoring multipliers and points. The bullets are flashy, but not distractedly so, and as long as you focus on the pattern and your location, you should do well. More bonuses are rewarded when you kill enemies with in the circle around your ship which is the point blank range, the same area points are absorbed into when the fall down the screen.\n\nUnless there is some missing/idle cutscene I skipped, there's no story here, and that's how I like it. \n\n-=Presentation=-\nI'm a sucker for cyberpunk/spacepunk/sci-fi-punk style games, so I automatically love the sharp vector look mixed with soft lighting effects. and bright, but non-offensive blue, pink, and green hues. The appearance may be rough for epilieptics, and maybe a little overwhelming if you not used to this genre, but I feel there is a certain crispness and color selection of the bullets that is just right. Though, the game doesn't reach my high native resolution, so the graphics look a bit off compared to what I think it should look like.\n\nThe sound design is perfect. The instrumental techno-metal soundtrack is very similar to Exceed the 3rd: JPBP which is exactly the type of music needed to get you pumped and ready for the bullet chaos. It is exactly my style of music, and I bought the digital soundtrack of CDBaby (can be found on iTunes as well). There's not too much noise beyond explosisions of ships, some bullets/patterns, the perfectly low \"click\" from grazing bullets, the \"ping\" from collecting points and you don't have to deal with dialogue or annoying chatter - if you're not a fan of shmup dialogue or the Japanese schoolgirl chatter common to these games, you don't have to deal with it.\n\n-=Conclusion=-\nEverything about DU2 is solid and of great quality. The Steam reviews are 100% postive according to Enhanced Steam. The game is a must-buy for shmup/danmaku fans. I really want to see non-bullet hell fans give this game a shot on easy or normal difficulties - they need to feel how and why shmup fans like myself are so into these type of games.", "timestamp_created": 1404047077, "timestamp_updated": 1404047077, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10889072": {"recommendationid": "10889072", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995299097", "num_games_owned": 1140, "num_reviews": 78, "playtime_forever": 57, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456801666}, "language": "french", "review": "Tr\u00e8s bon Danmaku, les paterns sont plut\u00f4t sympa, a difficult\u00e9 change radicallement le nombre de boulette \u00e0 l'\u00e9cran ce qui est appreciable, le gameplay et lui aussi bon m\u00eame si j'aurais aimer un peu poil plus de rapidit\u00e9 dans les d\u00e9placement,\n\nGraphiquement les vaisseaux sont tr\u00e8s sympa, les d\u00e9cors sont un peu vide mais gageons que \u00e7a rend la visibilit\u00e9 meilleure, les musiques dans le ton Metal un peu japonisant coupl\u00e9 a de long breakdown sont sympathique mais sans plus; c'est original par rapport au habituellement musique \u00e9l\u00e9ctro.\n\nUn grand +1 pour la fonction qui permet de mettre le jeu en vertical, pouvant pivot\u00e9 mon 16/9 en vertical c'est juste du pur bonheur avec mon stick d'arcade. \n\n\nJe vous le recommande si vous \u00eates en manque de bullet hell.", "timestamp_created": 1403914036, "timestamp_updated": 1403914036, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534164", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10868910": {"recommendationid": "10868910", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042041061", "num_games_owned": 345, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 97, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1419689214}, "language": "english", "review": "I have to admit, I wasn't expecting too much from this game, given the low price point and its status as a mobile port.

I'm used to cartoony (mushihimesama) or pseudo-2.5D (ketsui) graphics, but DU2 focuses more on high contrast and slick, crisp graphics. The background are dark, and the projectiles are neon-coloured. This makes it very easy to spot, and dodge, them.\n\n###\nGameplay - Very similar to cave games, in particular something like dodonpachi daioujou, but this doesn't have the feel of a clone. While many of the bullet patterns will be familiar, the creators have pulled off the feel of a classic bullet hell and added some unique personality to it. The difficult covers a good spread of ability. People new to the genre will be challenged by \"easy\", but not so much that they will give up before completing it. For even casual players who have some experience with bullet hells, \"easy\" will be a walk in the park. Experienced players will find \"extreme\" challenging, and only the most serious fans of the genre will be able to 1CC at this level (upgrades notwithstanding). Even for those players, this will not be an easy game, and there is plenty of replay value for players of any expertise in aiming to top their high-score. \n\nSome may find the burst mode a little unusual. It's kind of like using bombs in most other games, but you don't need to use them so sparingly because your burst meter is constantly being refilled. Unlike bombs in, say, dodonpachi though, the burst does not make you invincible. It clears bullets in front of you, but you have to be careful to not fly sideways into them. This means that it's not a complete get-out-of-jail-free card, as you still have to avoid getting cornered or time it well so that you avoid any projectiles that the beam won't clear. For those who don't like the burst mode, there is also a classic mode, which has a concentrated beam and ship slowdown that many will be familiar with from cave games.\n\nUpgrades seem like an unnecessary addition. I would have preferred to see them added as in-game items, or just make the weapons more powerfull to begin with. A choice of ship type would have also been another good way of implementing different levels of spread/power. My guess is that this system was an attempt to stand out from the game's predecessors by avoiding being too much like dodonpachi and other similar games, but in my opinion this particular aspect wasn't the best choice. \n\n###\nDesign - This is where my only real gripes are. Tate mode is not well implemented for those of us who have a portrait mode monitor permanently set up. It is implemented by going in to the options and rotating the view, but this can only work on a monitor that is set up in lanscape mode in Windows. Considering that most people who have a portrait monitor don't have it set as their primary display, the workflow goes:\n\nSet portrait monitor to primary display -> set to landscape -> tilt head sideways to be able to read things on the display -> launch game -> rotate view in options -> tilt head upright again -> zoom view in options until game fills the screen - > play game -> exit game -> set monitor back to portrait -> change primary display\n\nBecause this is such a hassle, it means that I usually play on my primary monitor in landscape mode, but with the added problem that when I DO use tate mode, I have to change the rotation and zoom inside the game each time, both before and after playing. This could be made much simpler by enabling portrait resolutions natively.\n\nThere are some other minor complaints about the design. The game doesn't remember your previous choices (apart from upgrades) and has no retry option. This means that when you die and want to retry, you have to exit the level to the main menu, and select mode, difficulty level, etc. all over again. A post on the forum by the developer suggests that a retry option will soon be added.\n\n###\nOverall - Despite some flaws in the design, this is one of the best bullet hell shooters out there; it's definitely my favourite non-cave one. I would quite happily give it 4/5 stars as is, but once the retry option is added, if native portrait resolutions were also added, I'd be hard pressed to find a reason not to give it 5/5.", "timestamp_created": 1399031544, "timestamp_updated": 1399350337, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9990899": {"recommendationid": "9990899", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003352401", "num_games_owned": 701, "num_reviews": 150, "playtime_forever": 462, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1397997484}, "language": "french", "review": "Le Canadien Sunny Tam a fait un travail ph\u00e9nom\u00e9nal avec Danmaku Unlimited 2.

The Burst mode is another twist, where getting close to enemies now gives you meter for a giant laser beam. Said laser will proceed to wipe out almost every bullet it hits, and give you a multiplier based on that.\n\nDU2 is also abound with customization. You got the standard wideshot, focused shot, and tracking shot for your ship, and you can spend points to upgrade their effectiveness. The way you level everything up is nice as well. As you progress through the game (and inevitably die), you'll rank up and that gives you points. These points can be spent on the three addons, giving your ship more hitpoints, more lives, and continues. Points are never lost, only spent, and can be retracted to spend on different parts. At the rank of Major, I prefer having full life points and as many lives as I can. DU2 allows for intense customization options, and lets you personalize your playstyle to a great degree.\n\nI'd say this is the best $5 I've spent on a game in a very long while, and is well worth it.\n\nUpdate : Finished the game.\ni hate this game so hard, but it's so good.", "timestamp_created": 1397614983, "timestamp_updated": 1397878486, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9803558": {"recommendationid": "9803558", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039362025", "num_games_owned": 500, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 342, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495946555}, "language": "english", "review": "This game makes me have to lie down sometimes.\n\n10/10 would buy again.", "timestamp_created": 1397367664, "timestamp_updated": 1397367664, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491071", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9790789": {"recommendationid": "9790789", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012251809", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476887355}, "language": "english", "review": "Buy it now , it worth", "timestamp_created": 1397254681, "timestamp_updated": 1397254681, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9774786": {"recommendationid": "9774786", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010552431", "num_games_owned": 389, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 31, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1397085567}, "language": "english", "review": "Shiny shiny patterns, yo.

Some other games like Ikaruga and Luftrausers have thrown some unique modern twist on the genre and come out the other end for the better. But as far as traditional, no-frills attached, pure shmups go we haven\u2019t been too lucky and Danmaku definitely comes out sitting atop those that have tried. \n\nIt is exactly what it appears to be, a bullet hell in the vein of the genres heyday like DonPachi and Blue Wish Resurrection (in fact, you might think you\u2019re playing the latter at first). What separates it from many of the manic shooters that have appeared on Steam is that it is largely pattern recognition. Some might disagree but for me this is what makes a bullet hell enjoyable, complicated but recognizable patterns that after spending enough time with the game you begin to memorize until you can run through the whole thing easily enough, and jump to the next level of difficulty. Repeating the process.  Though the game still requires twitch reflexes at times (and let\u2019s face it sometimes luck as well, unless you\u2019re a bullet hell god) I rarely if ever found myself getting hit and feeling like it was the game being impossible. I always felt like if I did get hit it was completely my fault for parsing the pattern wrong or simply reacting slowly, and that\u2019s what makes a game like this fun.\n\nThe game also sports a really solid difficulty curve. Rather than starting and staying hard/easy, or suddenly jumping there is instead a clear and obvious progression. With the first level being manageable for anyone with at least a passing interest in the genre, working its way slowly up to the final confrontation that lives up to the \u201cbullet curtain\u201d term. \n\nFrom a gameplay systems standpoint it\u2019s pretty standard fare. The combo system works as games in the past have combining grazing bullets and simply racking up combos. One distinct difference is the game is engineered to make you WANT to use your \u201cbomb\u201d instead of saving them. Not a bomb in the traditional sense and instead a supercharge (that recharges as you fire/pass time depending on mode) to your weapons that neutralizes the currently on-screen projectiles and grants a brief boost to your combo multiplier. There is also a system of \u201cranking up\u201d where you can then put gained points into increasing weapon damage, continues, etc, but anyone who spends more than an hour or two with the game will quickly reach the max rank so it\u2019s quite unimportant. Though it certainly helps you get familiar with the game by making the early levels much easier.\n\nIt has an attractive if generic sci-fi, top-down shooter aesthetic and perhaps more importantly conquers another shmup hurdle with the bullets being clearly defined. With a few exceptions the bullets are a contrasting color to the backgrounds meaning you almost never get hit with a rogue shot that your peripheral vision didn\u2019t see meshing with the other on screen colors. It also has some fantastic music that while not my favorite soundtrack in the genre definitely gets you in that \u201czone\u201d such games strive to achieve and mixes well with the associated encounters. \n\nLong story short I think anyone who enjoys classic shmups needs to pick Danmaku Unlimited 2 up. It\u2019s probably the first in the genre to come to Steam that I can see myself putting significant time into, trying to master it, instead of just being a passing interest.", "timestamp_created": 1396219169, "timestamp_updated": 1396219865, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531641", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9649446": {"recommendationid": "9649446", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064361622", "num_games_owned": 382, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1395984177}, "language": "english", "review": "what is this and where are the badly-drawn lolis", "timestamp_created": 1395984282, "timestamp_updated": 1395984360, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479094", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9633898": {"recommendationid": "9633898", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008275921", "num_games_owned": 238, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 53, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1396370536}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4... \uc7ac\ubc0c\ub2e4!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\uc194\uc9c1\ud788 bgm\uc774 \uac19\uc740\uace1\ub9cc \ubc18\ubcf5\ud574\uc11c \uc9c0\ub8e8\ud558\uae34\ud55c\ub370 \ucd1d\uc54c\ud53c\ud558\ub290\ub77c...\u314b\u314b\u314b \uc815\uc2e0\uc5c6\ub2e4.\n\n\uc608\uc804\uc5d0 \ud574\ubcf8 \uac81\ub098\uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \ub3d9\ubc29\uc601\uc57c\ucd08 \ubcf4\ub2e4\ub294 \uc870\uae08.... \uc544\uc8fc \uc870\uae08 \ub354 \uc27d\ub2e4.", "timestamp_created": 1395840559, "timestamp_updated": 1395840844, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500611", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9628841": {"recommendationid": "9628841", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038969128", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 235, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1396200114}, "language": "french", "review": "c'est du bon !!", "timestamp_created": 1395781688, "timestamp_updated": 1395781688, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9627003": {"recommendationid": "9627003", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097871372", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 542, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1418755160}, "language": "english", "review": "Entry-level danmaku/bullet hell.

Anyone who likes the gameplay of a Cave shooter or one of the many main-series Touhou games will feel right at home here.\n\nGameplay comes in two flavors, the Classic style with regular and focused shooting modes, and the Burst style with a bullet destroying laser in place of focused shooting. There is no slow movement mode so the player must be extra careful while manuvering through the many concentrated bullet curtains.\n\nThe scoring system goes unexplained in the game's built-in tutorial, so I'll give a brief overview. Classic style has point items and multiplier items drop from defeated enemies that must then be collected before they fall off the screen, with them being collected when they touch the large circle surrounding your ship. The Burst style has automatic pickup of all items dropped, but requires the usage of the laser weapon to obtain multipliers, with enemies only dropping them when destroyed by the laser weapon. The Burst style also quadruples your multiplier while the player has activated DU2's Trance Mode, which while available in both styles and upgrades all dropped point items to the highest level, only has the quadrupling boost in the Burst style.\n\nThe game features a ranking system, where by playing the game and levelling up you are awarded points to distribute amongst your ships weapons, shields, extra lives, and available continues. The only complaint I have about this system is that you cannot reduce available continues to Zero, slowing down the ability to restart the game for the one credit clear (1cc) fanatic.\n\nDifficulty wise, the game starts out easy and gradually getting harder as you go along, but with an extreme jump between the 4th and 5th stages. I personally found the 5th stage boss to be incredibly easy in comparison to its stage, but I imagine that the developers saved the difficulty for the true final boss that I am unable to even face at present due to being bad.\n\nOverall, I reccommend this game to anyone who enjoys shmup gameplay. Storywise the game has almost nothing going for it, with the remnants of a planned story remaining in the game just to add some spice to the game's opening act.\n\n[Cleared Burst Mode on Normal using

"language": "english", "review": "As a person who enjoys playing shmups and bullet hells in general (even if I may not be exactly 'good' at them), I have to say I am super impressed by this game. This game has all of the things a shmup should have: Smooth mechanics, responsive controls, wonderful visuals, clear differences between enemy fire and power-ups, great music, and a difficulty level that is not too difficult nor too easy which still ramps itself up at a pace that makes the game enjoyable and not boring. I'll admit I've only played a little on easy mode to test out the game, but I highly doubt the other difficulties will be any different in terms of the smooth upscale in it's difficulty.\n\nI haven't done a whole lot with the customization, yet, but it seems to be very well done. It doesn't require an over-reliance on micromanagement nor is it too simple that it's a non-issue. The actual game mechanics are also simple and small enough that it doesn't bog down the entire game, but still not minor enough that it makes the game super generic. All of this means that you can certainly play the game how you like depending on your play-style (I, generally, play more with focused weaponry and just watch my ship to dodge instead of focusing on enemies, and the game screen is clear enough to do this quite well and doesn't throw too many stupid curveballs at you that make this tactic ineffective.).\n\nAlso, as I said before, the game looks very clean and plays very smoothly. Your ship, enemy ships, power-ups, and enemy fire are all clearly defined so you won't find yourself flying into an enemy bullet while thinking it's a power-up very often, which is a pet peeve of mine for shmups. Pretty much if you fly into a bullet, it's your fault and you can't really blame it on the visual definition even when the screen starts getting wild. The controls are also very tight, if you tap an arrow key you move just that much and you don't end up floating too far to the side and screwing yourself over.

To delve into pseudo-philosophical babble, the game is like staying calm and steadily making your way amidst \"chaos\" - which never is real chaos but a proper pattern. While the ship mode is large, only the small hitbox (\"core\") must avoid being hit by the bullets. \n\nFor danmaku veterans, this game is a rather welcome addition to Steam's library. Its visuals are clear and the supported resolutions include 1920x1080 (apparently the largest), although the in-game ship models aren't anything to write home about, somehow reminding me of the ones in Tumiki Fighters/Blastworks. Controlwise, at least XBox360 controller works without any configuring and the buttons can be rebound.\n\nAs an absolute must for this type of game, it has online leaderboards on Steam for each game mode and difficulty level separately.\n\nLet's compare this with the eXceed series games, especially 1 and 3. For one, the graphics do not include pretty girls at all. Plot? There is no apparent plot. There are no bombs either: there is the \"trance\" mode, which increases (or multiplies) the score multiplier for a moment and allows the player to rake in much higher score, and a forward-facing cannon that can also destroy bullets and increase the multiplier. There is no autobombing option.\n\nA feature brought over from other game genres is that while there are no collectible powerups that I have seen, playing the game will increase your rank and reward you with additional customization points to be allotted at the start of the game to, say, the number of continues, shields, lives, weapon levels and so on. Career progression ahoy!\n\nSpeaking of shields and lives - dying will reset the multiplier, as will changing the level, but getting hit so that the shield absorbs the bullet will only decrease it. \n\nThere is no \"slow\" or focus mode either: the ship moves always at the same speed.\n\nThere are four game modes (incl. free play and boss rush) and four difficulty levels. \n\nUnfortunately, the music is a bit lackluster and apparently cannot be changed - I would've liked to replace them with some other tracks, but alas, no such luck.\n\nThe biggest problem I see with the game is that it lacks 'soul', so to speak. It's almost on the same level as Kenta Cho's abstract shmups, and just aiming for a high score is not necessarily enough justification for people to clear the game even the first time. The enemy ships being rather bland also doesn't help the situation.\n\nEven so, this is a fun danmaku and worth the price of purchase.", "timestamp_created": 1395499836, "timestamp_updated": 1395514211, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552501", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9590086": {"recommendationid": "9590086", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074373508", "num_games_owned": 225, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 394, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462179272}, "language": "english", "review": "One of low-cost danmaku fun you can get, definitely buy it if you are a Shoot em'up fan", "timestamp_created": 1395462591, "timestamp_updated": 1395462591, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502909", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9587322": {"recommendationid": "9587322", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065094737", "num_games_owned": 201, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 813, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1396959563}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0421\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0443 \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0436\u0443, \u044d\u0442\u0430 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0434\u0430\u0441\u0442 \u0432\u0430\u043c \u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u043e\u0449\u0443\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439, \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0432\u044b \u0437\u043d\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043c\u044b \u0441 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0436\u0430\u043d\u0440\u043e\u043c \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b. \u0412\u0441\u0451 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0438 \u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e. \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u044f\u0440\u043a\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0437\u0430 \u0438 \u0442\u044b \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0448\u044c \u0441\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f, \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0432\u0441\u0451 \u043c\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043a\u0430\u0435\u0442, \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0446\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u0438 \u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0435. \u041d\u043e \u0433\u0434\u0435-\u0442\u043e \u0447\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0437 \u0447\u0430\u0441 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0438 \u0442\u044b \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u0441\u043f\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0439\u043d\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0448\u044c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438\u0445 \u0432\u0440\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0432, \u043f\u043e\u043f\u0443\u0442\u043d\u043e \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0435-\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0438\u0448\u0442\u044f\u0447\u043a\u0438. \u041d\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u0440 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u0432 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0443\u0449\u0435\u043c \u0443\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043b\u044c. \u0414\u0430!

I could be mistaken with my points.\n\n- The tutorial is a bit of a joke. Unless of course, it's intentionally sparse, and part of the fun is figuring stuff out.\n\n- Considering how there isn't a focus fire button, and you have to get particularly close to the bullets for the graze to register, grazing is hard as balls in this game. If you're an agressive grazer like I am, it might be a little frustrating.\n\n- The stages feel a little long, the enemies a little too indistinguishable from one another, and wave progression barely identifiable (That's a crap ton of clouds!). The pretty backgrounds don't offer much in the way of landmarks, so it's hard to get a sense of how far into the wave you are at times. And because you don't have that extra bit of information to rely on to remember stage patterns, you gotta either play reactively (which is terrible for serious scoring), or memorize enemy patterns (which is a bit of a chore since the stages can get quite long). The music's pretty good, but in light of how you can't get cues from the music because it doesn't really sync with stage crescendos, which hampers with the gauging of progression as well, it isn't as enjoyable as it could've been.\n\n- The \"unlock more power-ups for your ship as you play\" mechanic is interesting in theory, introducing a sense of persistence in the game, but good god, do I hate flying a gimped ship that requires grinding to power up. I mean, if the entire arsenal weren't locked behind an arbitrary currency system, and you could gimp your own ship for higher score multipliers, that might've been a more engaging experience.\n\nIt's a pretty game, sounds really good, and has kinda interesting bullet patterns and mechanics, but these were a couple of things that kinda bothered me.

No need to scrounge shmup forums just to learn how to score correctly.  It's also pretty open ended in execution, leaving lots of room for experimentation and pushing you luck for a little more juice.\n\n2) Bullets have great color contrast and stand out well from the background.

In the course of gaming for nearly three decades, I've played many shmups since Space Invaders on the Atari, but have only begun to truly appreciate them in the last year - better late than never!  With developers like Cave, Treasure, Raizing, Seibu Kaihatsu, and many more - there is an enormous wealth of quality titles to experience and yet, Danmaku Unlimited 2 holds an important position within the genre in my estimation as a relatively \"new\" player.  While those many other games are awe-inspiring on a number of levels, they are largely geared toward the very practised player and require a level of skill that can be offputting to somebody who is trying to gauge their interest.  \n\nDanmaku 2 has the perfect balance of accessibility and ramping difficulty.  The mechanics of the game are very clear, and the hitbox of the player ship is obvious and visible.  The visuals are crisp, clean, and colourful, without creating any visual confusion, and the music is fanastic and sets a great atmosphere.  I feel that Danmaku Unlimited 2 is the perfect \"training course\" to the greater arena of shmups, and by investing time into this game, my skill level has increased by leaps and bounds in the other games.  Still, it's plenty challenging in its own right, and I've yet to 1-continue complete the game on any skill level above normal.  I find it a sublime rush to play on the hardest difficulty - with the excellent soundtrack blaring on full blast through my headphones, the screen rotated vertically (Tate) and my arcade joystick sat on my desktop, I often experience a feeling while playing DmkU2 that may resemble so-called \"battle calm\" - a tranquil trance-like state of absolute focus and heightened response where time seems to slow down and greater reflexes allow dodging through seemingly impossible bullet-hell situations.  I can't honestly say I've really experienced anything similar in other gaming genres, and it feels awesome - that's why I find myself becoming avid about shmups!

I picked it up on the iOS app store, about same price as this I think, played it a ton there, worked my way up from normal to extreme, cue some time passing, I made a friend on a Garry's Mod prop hunt server. Cue later in that year around Christmas I was gifted the steam version because it was on my wishlist. However my laptop at the time couldn't run it, BUT now that I have one that can you can bet I put time into it. I was more than happy to replay the game and get things back up to where I was. \n\nThis game has upgrades, at first, you're weak and barely can survive, but as you play fail play fail...you'll level up and earn points, these points are used to upgrade your powers, such as your focus beam, or add tracking bullets, or widespread. However you don't need those to beat the game, at all, in fact there's achievement for not having them. \n\nAs this is a bullet hell, you will face onslaughts of danmaku, and you need to bring your A-Game, however amongst those upgrades, you have some that can give you more breathing room which is a blessing in a game like this. You have what's called the ADS, \"Active Defense System\", it's basically your shields, if you get hit, you destroy bullets on screen for a split second, HOWEVER, the trick to this is that it has to recharge, so you're left in a state that no matter how many points you have to it, if you are hit you're losing a life. So you may have 5 ADS points, but if you're careless, they won't matter anyways.\n\nYou can also boost your lives and continues counts, which combined with ADS points, help bump up survivalbility, say you have 5 lives and 5 ADS points, and you don't get hit during recharges, that's TWENTY FIVE times you can be hit approximately before your run is over, much more generous than most bullet hells. However it also balances out by making the game rather long in a nice way, and making it tough.\n\nSo if you're into games that push your skills to the limit, have simply amazing music (didn't wanna go on a rant about the music alone, just know if you're into metal, you're gonna be very very happy), and like quite the pretty graphics, this is a STEAL at five bucks. \n\n9.9/10\n\ntenth a point lost on how I wish there could've been a survival esque mode, just straight up enemies, nothing else, nonstop, that woulda been neat.", "timestamp_created": 1516284611, "timestamp_updated": 1516284611, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39382301": {"recommendationid": "39382301", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053212872", "num_games_owned": 193, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 419, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 419, "last_played": 1516078464}, "language": "english", "review": "If you are someone like me, who is bad at shmups but enjoys them all the same, I highly recommend this game.

Playing multiple runs levels up your overall ranking, which in turn gives you points which can be assigned to various optional perks, from weapon upgrades to extra lives and continues. Not only will you get better with each run, but the game can become a little bit easier with future ones, if you wish.\n\nOn top of that, the music and graphics are great, the bullet patterns are intricate and gorgeous, and the shooting and controls simply feel right. I do wish that there were separate achievements for the different difficulty settings when beating stages, but that's my only real complaint. Overall, this feels like a game that was designed by someone with a lot of love and respect for danmaku shmups, and is one that casual players should be able to enjoy as well.", "timestamp_created": 1516079744, "timestamp_updated": 1516255314, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 344, "total_negative": 21, "total_reviews": 365}}

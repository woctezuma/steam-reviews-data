I know the description and tags show that it is heavily narrative-based but I just want to emphasise that because if I had seen more narrative screenshots, I probably would have bought and played it sooner.\n\nThe things I love the most are the setting and the writing. I don't normally get very enthused about steampunk but I really liked this universe. Part of what can make me iffy about things taking inspiration from the Victoria era is the colonialism, but this game addresses these issues and doesn't just hide them away. The world is full of anti-colonial conflicts, revolutions, and discussion of slavery and you can often talk to characters directly impacted. There are also plenty of women in the world doing non-traditional things (which you can choose to be shocked by, usually). The writing is of a very high quality and the narrative choices frequent (with impacts ranging from minimal/non-existent to huge). I can't even imagine the full extent of the script, although I'm sure it will become apparent if I play it many more times! I really love being Passepartout and I find myself very engaged by the narrative.\n\nIf a game is described as 'replayable', it doesn't necessarily mean that I will want to replay it. Well, I've already gone around the world several times now and I know I still have plenty of places to visit and events I'd like to find and read. There are also some situations I'd like to do over because I know I missed out on something the first time. Starting another playthrough (so far, and I think I'm up to....number six?) feels like the start of a new adventure, and not like something you have to slog through just to get this scene or that ending. Each new game feels like an entire story that I'm happy to read from start to finish.\n\nI read a few negative reviews out of interest, because I genuinely couldn't understand how someone could dislike this game, except if they really hated reading. So to address some of the things I saw:\nYes, the controls can sometimes be weird, which is annoying when you're doing something time-dependent. It doesn't happen to me very much, and I assumed it was because I'm using a laptop with a touchpad. After playing for a while, I rarely had any issues.\nIt's true that you cannot save in order to go back and do an event again, and that sudden unpredictable events can ruin everything you planned, but I like that (and I rather think it's the point). If you're struggling to get a certain outcome in a single event (or you fatally misclicked), you can exit the game before reaching the end of the event and reopen to make your choices again.\n(This is just a negative I thought of:) The discussion/generic 'what will you do tonight' parts can get samey, but they're very quick to click through so I don't really mind.\n\nThat's it!

At least not until the next play through.\n\nIt's based on the Jules Verne novel \"Around the World in 80 Days\" but it is modern steam punk. So expect to be travelling via mechanical birds with pregnant captains. This isn't political correctness gone mad (which I abhor) but a change which allows the game to provide interesting interactions, differing routes and alternative choices.\n\nAs you travel as fast as possible, not only must you look after your employer, but try to make trades at the markets to increase your funds (sometimes by a great deal). You may also pick up little jobs in the cities which will increase your funds marginally.\n\nThere is a lot of replayability in this purely because of the alternative routes and interactions which you can come across. Not having a certain item with you can make a huge difference to how happy your employer is and therefore how much time you need to take with him, rather than interact with the other characters and gain intelligence about future routes. \n\nIt can be so easy to go swimmingly and then bam, stuck somewhere for four days or have to consider paying thousands to get an earlier transport.\n\nEach play through isn't quick.

It's also a love letter to Jules Verne and his fantastic tales of technological marvels in the late 19th century. Unfortunately, it's also a textbook example of SJW politics marring an otherwise superb game. As such, I cannot recommend it to the discerning gamer.\n\nThe premise of the game is simple: travel around the world in 80 days or less using planes, trains, automobiles, and all manner of exotic craft. The world of [i]80 Days[/i] is a fantastical alternate reality where steampunk inventions permit voyages under the sea, to the center of the earth, and from the earth to the moon. Quite simply, this is a best written game I have ever played, and it's a good thing, too, because the gameplay is almost entirely text based.\n\nBecause there are so many cities to visit and routes to consider as you travel across the globe, every playthrough is unique, and the core gameplay is addictive enough to ensure that you will want to play through a dozen or so times just to sample the well-written and affecting storylines that lie off the beaten path.\n\nBut then there's the SJW stuff. To put it simply, the world of [i]80 Days[/i] is absurdly and gratingly egalitarian. Female ship captains, soldiers, and even boiler room attendants litter the world. The game is also annoyingly anti-colonial, envisioning Wakanda-like technologically advanced empires in Subsaharan Africa that are the fear of Western colonial powers. I understand that anything is possible in a fictional game that takes place in an alternate universe, but the distinctive tinge of 21st century social justice feels way out of place in this steampunk universe.\n\nThe most egregious deviation is the character of Passepartout, the role that the player assumes. In Verne's novel, Passepartout is the loyal valet to Phileas Fogg, who circumnatigates the globe to win a bet. In [i]80 Days[/i], Passepartout is all of these things, and quite obviously homosexual (or bisexual at the very least). Many paths in the game allude to homosexual attraction between Passepartout and Fogg, while other paths offer opportunities to flirt with male and female (but primarily male) characters. There is also at least one path that leads to a romantic liaison with a male. It's an insult to Verne to mangle his character in such a way, and once again represents an anachronistic, 21st century American view of the world.\n\nWith a few judicious edits, [i]80 Days[/i] would earn a strong recommendation from me.

So, long story short, I really enjoyed and still occasionally enjoy this game! It is an interactive fiction and as such heavily relies on its story. And this is really the big plus here. The story is funny and exciting and offers so many little site \"quests\" and optional outcomes. Your job is it to choose a route for your travels, but you also have to manage your money (even in a steam punk version of the late 19th century you still need to pay for your train ticket) and still keep Monsieur amused and happy. It seems a very simple concept, but it just seems to work.\n\nIn my opinion, the biggest advantage is its replayability (is that even a word?). Since your possible routes around the world are manifold, you can fail at the first attempt (like me) and still play a completely different story at your second try. The fact that one circumvention of the world does not take you long is an extra plus for me. You don't have to invest days and days in it (but probably can?). \n\nAll and all, I strongly recommend it (as long as you don't hate reading!) and will surely return to it  from time to time. :-)",

I love the idea of having Passepartout as the main character who organizes the journey and keeps his master alive and afoot. \nThis game works quite well as text based adventure, you have to manage money, time and Mr. Foggs Mood while buying and selling trinkets or gathering information to further your journey. The steampunk elements mix very well with political and cultural details and every runthrough of the game is different. I can't wait to discover more! Try the beduin-Expedition into the desert. ;)\n\nBut there's one point I don't like: So ok, you organize the travels and there's no savegame to fall back to. Exciting! You never really think about it until... you lose everything over a dialogue you stumble into and can't get out. Anyways, how come Passepartout can lose all the funds in one lonesome exploration of a city? That's just unresponsible of Mr. Fogg to let the servant take all the thousands of pounds with him into the alleys and bazars and opium cafes. A significant loss would be a shock and hinder the gameplay, too, but to have your funds drop from ~7000 to zero in one dialogue is just frustrating and kills the run off. \n\nAs I said, I really like the style, the idea and the creativity of this game and as long as there's so much more to discover I just start a new playthrough when something horrible happens to the two adventurers. :P But to complete a run, in time or not, should be the goal.

Each city you visit comes with a bevy of decisions: where will you travel next? How many suitcases can you fit on a steam-bicycle? Should you detour to Siberia to sell the items you just picked up and fund your continued travels, or keep going straight on and risk having to wait for the bank to transfer money to you?\n\nThe writing is excellent.

A lot of locations are merely stopping points where you have a few hours to take in the sights before hopping on an airship to the next place, but sometimes you're pulled into an involved storyline where you have to think about colonialism, slavery and other nasty things of the era.

It also has light management sim elements in it, as you will need to discover the most efficient routes to take around the world, along with buying and selling items to fund your journeys. It also evokes a feel of a fantastic, \"bygone\" steampunk era remarkably well.\n\n- Why shouldn't you get this?: You dislike reading. There is a ton of reading in this - it's pretty much the main gameplay mechanic, aside from figuring out where and when to leave places from. And speaking of that, I could also see this being stressful to people who don't like to make snap decisions, as you will sometimes need to do as you roll into countries in the nick of time and need to quickly get your bearings to move on to the next area before the local train / car / airship departs.\n\n- Did Max enjoy this?: Yes, very much so. I had heard this game was well written, but I was surprised at how much it ended up digging its narrative hooks into me. I also ended up speaking like an English gentleman for the next couple days, much to the annoyance of everyone around me.\n\n- Similar games to check out: the Sorcery! series, Out There Omega Edition", "timestamp_created": 1514654964, "timestamp_updated": 1514731188, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508414", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38832540": {"recommendationid": "38832540", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993567244", "num_games_owned": 682, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514578051}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun adventure, full of surprises and very well written.

Simple, in a way that really good things are, hiding away a deep layer of complexity under a well-designed and joyful presentation, suffering from a slightly clunky UI and lack of automatic stats. \n\nAfter playing it through a couple (of dozen) of times, I can say that I am almost as addicted to this as I was to replaying Fallout 1- in its own way, this is an open world game that adapts to your choices and decisions, with many paths through it, offering almost infinite replaybility due to the number of routes through the world. \n\nThe world itself also bears comparing with Fallout's- an alternate history, set earlier than the 1950's, and during the preparation for the coming apocalypse, caught in the moment between Empire and Modernity with a Steampunk twist worthy of Captain Nemo. It reminds me of the \"League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\", as written by Alan Moore (NOT the film), and gains by being described, rather than shown, adding to the personal narrative develop. \n\nIt gains depth with every reading and reads like a DIY page turner, growing in every playthrough as plots, twists and characters unlock, enriching the players understanding of the diffeent facets of the world they are traversing by a journey. \n\nTo paraphrase: the game is highly replayable, as the player discovers and creates the world for themselves through meaningful choices and encounters in several short-ish playthroughs, summarised in slides at the end of a run. It combines simple, but effective puzzle, trade and planning mechanics, and a few surprising enconters that unlock over time. It is not, however, for haters of inventory management. Permadeath, executed through the mechanic of eastward-only motion, is a highly effective driver of devision-making.\n\nIf I were wishing for more, I would ask for consequences in the world over several playthroughs, such as having characters permanently added to your team in Saville Row, adding perks and bonuses over playthroughs and altering the course of the world as Passepartout and Phileas relive the time loop of 80 days over and over, every time making little changes that add to the whole, which would provide dedicated gamers a definitive endpoint to the narrative you can discover within the game- a big, fat \"The End\".", "timestamp_created": 1514312734, "timestamp_updated": 1514504956, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38670323": {"recommendationid": "38670323", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123517194", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1520613443}, "language": "english", "review": "I had heard of this game some times ago and on offer for less than 3 quid I thought I'd give it a go.

A real underrated gem!\n\nLike the Jules Verne novel, it's a straightforward plot - Phineas Fogg and his valet Passepartout are travelling around the world in 80 days, and it's up to you as his valet Passepartout to plan the journey - whether that's through the frozen wastes of Siberia, the deserts of Africa or the jungles of South America. Along the way you can trade goods to fund your journey, and enjoy some of the beautifully-written, semi-randomised encounters with the people and things along the way. It talks politics. It makes you think about industrialisation, and colonialism, and the spirit of adventure. It makes you fall in love.\n\nIt's a game about travel - boats, trains, and airships - and the fantastic wonders of the steampunk world created by the developers. It's not one of those games with long stretches of boring and badly written text - 80 Days is superbly written, and left me hungry for every nugget of adventure - being held up by a bandit in Mexico, drinking coffee with the engineers of Tehran, or riding on the legged leviathan of Agra through the wilds of India. Every city is written with a unique flavour and events, and the writing really makes it come alive.\n\nI've played other text-heavy games where the gameplay is just something to do between bouts of story, but 80 Days is genuinely compelling in its gameplay too. It's great fun to try and pick out a good route, when you're trying to decide whether to spend \u00a31000 on the fast airship or perhaps take that detour to Auckland to sell a special item. It plays out in real-time too - the ticking clock adds urgency to every action. Can you explore the city and do your trading at the market before the autogyro to Panama leaves at 3pm? It's the rare example of gameplay and story intertwined in a comprehensive package.\n\nI've never played anything quite like this.

I have been a big fan of Verne since I was a kid and have read the book several times so I was really looking forward this game.\n\nAs the game description says, the game has a steam punk \"twist\". It's not entirely out of the blue, given some of the contraptions in the book, let alone Vernes other books. But it seemed more than half the stories and journeys are on those lines and that is a little too much for me. \n\nThat said the characters of Fogg and Passepartout are faithfully recreated and it seems obvious that the games makers where fans. Despite the steam punk aspect, the game does a good job at recreating the feel of the book.\n\nThe game is very replayable with many variations and plot twists that are possible each time. The interface is simple and easy to use. The game is very simple- there is an inventory which you can use to buy and sell things but other than that there are no RPG elements or indeed anything to distract from the journey around the world and the choices you make along the way.\n\nI'd say if you like the book or the idea of a simple, casual adventure game then this worth a go. On the other hand if you like the game and haven't yet read the book then you should read it.", "timestamp_created": 1508965569, "timestamp_updated": 1508965569, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35957174": {"recommendationid": "35957174", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995424732", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 674, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504834096}, "language": "english", "review": "Charming as heck.

Alles hat so seine Vorteile. \nZu Beginn des Spiels ist allerdings nicht f\u00fcr alles Platz im Koffer. Au\u00dferdem muss es schnell gehen, denn Meister Phileas Fogg ist eine heikle Wette eingegangen: In 80 Tagen will er es um die ganze Welt schaffen. Und die Uhr tickt gnadenlos! Zus\u00e4tzliche Brisanz gewinnt die Reise, weil ein Krieg in Europa  droht und mysteri\u00f6se Konkurrenten an der Wette teilnehmen, die sich nicht immer wie Gentlemen benehmen...\n\nIm Jahr 1872 reist ihr also Hals \u00fcber Kopf von London aus los, wobei ihr zig M\u00f6glichkeiten habt, was die Route betrifft. Schon wenn man in Paris landet, ergeben sich viele Wege f\u00fcr das ehrgeizige Duo, wobei man selbst in die Rolle von Foggs franz\u00f6sischem Diener Passepartout schl\u00fcpft. Der muss nicht nur vieles selbst entscheiden, sondern sich fast m\u00fctterlich um seinen Meister k\u00fcmmern. Phileas verliert n\u00e4mlich mit der Zeit kostbare Lebenspunkte, wenn die Reise zu strapazi\u00f6s wird. Also kann man ihn k\u00e4mmen, f\u00fcttern oder sich anderweitig bem\u00fchen.\n\nGegen die Zeit, das Geld und die Konkurrenz\n\nAuch die richtige Kleidung kann helfen. Wer auf einer staubigen W\u00fcstenstra\u00dfe dahinrattert, profitiert von M\u00fctze, Brille & Co. Interessant f\u00fcr Sammler ist, dass es Sets gibt, die meist aus zwei oder drei entsprechenden Kleidungsst\u00fccken bestehen. Hat man sie komplett dabei, verliert man weniger Gesundheit oder bekommt ganz neue Optionen in den Dialogen. Aber keine Bange: Es geht nicht um Sammelei und Babysitting, sondern in erster Linie um Erkundung und clevere Planung in einer Parallelwelt, die sich mit einigen technischen und politischen Entwicklungen von unserer unterscheidet \u2013 das weckt nat\u00fcrlich auch die erz\u00e4hlerische Neugier.\n\nHinzu kommt der wirtschaftliche Aspekt: Man startet mit stolzen 5000 Pfund, die zu Beginn noch wie ein Schatz anmuten. Aber je weiter man kommt, desto teurer wird es, denn man kann Reisezeiten \u00fcber Bestechungen oder horrende Passagekosten einsparen. Um sein Budget wieder zu f\u00fcllen, sollte man das Gesammelte in den St\u00e4dten verkaufen. \nAber Vorsicht: Jeder Gegenstand erzielt nur in zwei, drei St\u00e4dten wirklich gute Preise \u2013 ansonsten muss man ihn verramschen. Manchmal kann sich also ein Umweg lohnen, um statt 10 vielleicht satte 1000 Pfund einzusacken.\n\nAlles in allem ein sch\u00f6nes Spiel was jedoch sehr weit weg ist von der Buchvorlage. Wen das nicht st\u00f6rt schl\u00e4gt hier zu. Ich w\u00fcrde aber auf ein Sale warten da 10\u20ac meiner Meinung nach zu viel sind.\n\n[b]Tito gibt 60%[/b]\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q37rDWJEXJM&feature=youtu.be", "timestamp_created": 1508523903, "timestamp_updated": 1508865732, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35869510": {"recommendationid": "35869510", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035759961", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 757, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509942555}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun and engaging way to kill some time.", "timestamp_created": 1508521243, "timestamp_updated": 1508521243, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35861089": {"recommendationid": "35861089", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150068649", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1045, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508790696}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is beautifully illustrated and has a very rich story.

At the end of the day, 80 Days is really just a choose your own adventure game. In many ways it reminds me of playing Oregon Trail on MS-DOS. You are put into the role of a 19th century valet charged with caring for your English overlord in a world filled with automata powered by steam and magical sciences. Expanding on the duties of a valet you are also in a race against the clock to win a wager against your master's antagonists. This is not an action packed RPG by any means, but it is chalkbox full of adventure. The imagery of the story is nearly as inspiring as the Jules Verne novels upon which it is loosely based. Some of the  situations in which you find yourself as a result of your unplanned travel choices are shocking. Now, I have only played through this game thrice. Within a total playtime of about 13 hours, I have enjoyed the feelings of dread, hilarity, frustration, disbelief and anticipation. In some cases, I have experienced several of these emotions in a single round trip. This game has a replayability like few others I have witnessed. Yes, it is a story based game. However, with over 170 cities to visit around the globe, of which each offers  different experiences; one could, in theory, play this game a hundred times and never have the same experience. It's kind of an inspired game when viewed in that light. \n\nThere are some noteworthy developer comments I have for this game as well. I really enjoyed the art and sound in this game. I like that it is not the central focus of the game. The art and sounds are rather used as a supplement to create a starting place for the mind's eye. Akin to reading a book, most of this game takes place in the imagination. The story choices and game art are creating cues for your imagination to paint it's own picture. I like that about this game. It makes me feel like the devs think highly of me. In some games I feel like everything is drawn out for me because they think I'm a moron. All of this, means that this game is not just happening on the screen; some of this game is taking place in your brain. In this way the game reminds me slightly of Dungeons and Dragons. DND: The OG RPG excels at creating its own imagery and leaving you with lasting memories. This game does the same thing. I can remember each one of my round trip adventures in this game. That means the writing is good and the game's environment is conducive to emotional connection. Ultimately that is how we experience any game. And any game that recognizes that connection is bound to be good.", "timestamp_created": 1504755977, "timestamp_updated": 1511403387, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34765419": {"recommendationid": "34765419", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032096255", "num_games_owned": 243, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 354, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507130950}, "language": "english", "review": "Found out that austria has an actual arms and that the taj mahal moves...10/10", "timestamp_created": 1504649198, "timestamp_updated": 1504649198, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.464684", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34736945": {"recommendationid": "34736945", "author": {"steamid": "76561198169784634", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 722, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510410873}, "language": "english", "review": "Probably one of my new favourite games.

The game looks simple on the surface -- travel around the world in 80 days -- but there is much more to this game.  Juggling suitcases, buying and selling goods, exploring cities, talking with people and learning things, and keeping your master happy are just some of the things you have to do.  Do you travel across Russia?  If so, does the master have cold weather gear?  Do you go south and cross North Africa and risk crossing the desert and, yes, riding a camel?\n\nThe interface is incredibly easy to use.  Managing your suitcases and inventory is a simple drag and drop process.  To buy goods, you drag them to your suitcase.  To sell, you drag them out.  Easy as can be.  All of the items have tooltips that shed some light on them -- the value, where they should be sold, and/or how they might help you during your journey.   Your market purchases can impact your travel plans too.  Certain items can be extremely valuable in certain cities.\n\nUsing the map is very intuitive.  Your mouse wheel is used to zoom in and out.  Click and drag spins the globe around.  There are also buttons for zooming in and out as well.  \n\nWhat really hooked me is the \"choose your own adventure\" aspect to the game.  As you converse with your master, train porters, and people in various cities, you are presented with a few dialog options to choose from.  Each option has pros and cons.  Some will improve your relations with your master.  Some will shed light on travel routes.  Some will tell you little facts about various cities, histories, or travel tips.   As you learn new things, little information boxes appear when you click on each city -- no need to remember stuff or write it down.\n\nI'll update this review when I finish.

Game Over. And I had enjoyed every second of the game, even when it became apparent I would not beat the game the first time around. I had been kidnapped by overzealous nuns, and walked on the bottom of the sea. On my second playthrough I failed to solve a murder mystery aboard a boat, but took a big gamble and blew up our airship just before arriving back home in England. But I did arrive in London within 60 days. I can\u2019t wait to see what other adventures are in store.\n\nTaking Place in a Cyberpunk version of Jules Verne\u2019s <i>Around the World in Eighty Days</i>, you play as Phileas Fogg\u2019s valet, his personal servant Passepartout. Remarkably well balanced, 80 Days tasks you to both carefully master your master\u2019s finances, his needs and whims, and to keep the end goal in mind. \n\nSome of the game\u2019s best moments come from the tensions between these: the player might want to explore a city or move speedily on (all so the master wins his bet), but Phileas Fogg himself might insist on having a proper dinner made ready. Travel is ingenious and goes by airship, submarine, car, and anything in-between. Often there are multiple routes available, with widely diverging prices; you only find out which routes there are by questioning characters during your travels. Which route you take: the expensive, speedy, and experimental one or the slow, safe, and cheap one is up to the player, and their finances. Better not visit the market to sell your belongings if the next train leaves within an hour though.\n\nA typical trip round the world can be made within 2 hours.\n\nBrilliantly written, and brilliantly crafted.\n\n[h1]5/5[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1500079513, "timestamp_updated": 1500079513, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503012", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33537338": {"recommendationid": "33537338", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007979373", "num_games_owned": 586, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500086938}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has become a recent favourite to play together with my partner.

The game is full of humour and adventure, and even if the mechanics do not vary much I am finding it quite entertaining and worth the discounted Summer sale price I paid for it.\n\nHowever, I wish the developers had paid more attention to a few details: the game is never too hard and all in all I find it well balanced, but there are a few hurdles that make it more frustrating rather than adding proper challenge. For example:\n\n- The little maps that show new routes around the world take away A LOT of space in the luggage, and they MUST stay in the luggage otherwise Passpartout and Fogg will forget them. I think they could have had their dedicated space, or take away much less since in reality they are flyers that can be folded and take away virtually no space at all.\n\n- The passage of time isn't always clear or well stated: I lost a lot of days of travel in one city because whenever I went to the bank +2 hours would go away and I would miss my boat. While it does state \"+2 hours\" when you visit the bank, it doesn't state so when it says \"funds available\" instead. A warning message from Fogg woulda been nice, since we planned the trip, he knows about it and he is capable of warning about other stuff like the Market.\n\n- During trips Passpartout can speak to people like the ship's captain to learn things such as new routes. It would have been great if it was possible to look at the map while asking for directions, I never remember which city I am interested in! Also it would have been nice to have a list of possible things to do during trips to go back and forth from rather than having them happen in a linear, pre-decided order. I think a hub like the city one would have been great!\n\n- Speaking of city hubs: the art style of this game is very minimal.

Every game consists of an attempt to make the journey around the world in 80 days (or less!), but rather than following a fixed itinerary, you get to choose the path to take at every leg of the journey. Not all paths are immediately available to you and it'll take multiple playthroughs to unlock everything -- that's OK, though, because you're almost guaranteed to get something new and interesting on every journey. Maybe you'll get kidnapped while trekking through the jungle. Maybe you'll brave the arctic in a steam contraption and discover a hidden city. Maybe you'll spend your last funds on a rickety airship to Reykjavik, arriving barely in the nick of time to win. Maybe you'll even find love... who knows? \n\nThis is a game for people who like to read. The graphics and sound are fine, but the interesting parts happen in small bits of writing that exercise your imagination. The writing is excellent, painting a recognizable world that's nevertheless much different from our own, with a lot of winks and nudges to both the source material and actual history. Having read [i][url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/103]Around the World in Eighty Days[/url][/i] isn't required, but strongly recommended, as you'll miss the chance to have your expectations subverted otherwise. Besides, it's still a really good read.\n\nA warning for people who like their adventures/stories strictly turn based: the game is semi-real time, with time passing at various rates while you're traveling, buying inventory or planning the next leg of your journey. It never becomes a twitch game, but you may miss a connection if you dawdle too long. There's a strong impetus to keep moving forward, which is perfectly in line with the theme of the game, but it may turn some people off. There's no need to regret a missed opportunity too much, though: you can always have another playthrough. A full journey around the world takes only 1-2 hours, depending on how you play it. Most encounters have multiple outcomes, of which you'll see only one in each playthrough.

It\u2019s strikingly similar to the Oregon Trail if you just take out all of the survival mechanics and add a lot more encounters and events that no player will ever experience without playing the game through a dozen times or more.\n \nThe game is played out by traveling from city to city. In each city you are greeted with an event that allows you to look around the city as you desire and have any number of things happen to you. You can visit the market to buy and sell items, the bank to withdraw cash, and plan the rest of your journey out. While travelling you also encounter similar events and the goal is to circumnavigate the world in 80 days. You have to pick your path and balance your budget while attending to your rich master of whom you play the servant. Collecting certain sets of items along the way will help make your travels easier, but there is one giant flaw to this gameplay. Time ALWAYS moves outside of events. You have no time to leisurely play this game and examine things or get up and get a drink without hitting the escape key. You\u2019re playing a strategy game where you\u2019re on a time crunch and to make the time crunch even worse, you\u2019re given about a minute upon arriving to each city before it\u2019s too late to travel out for the day and now you have to spend money to sleep at the hotel because there is no pause button for time. If you want casual relaxed gameplay this is not the game for you. The events are so long and filled with so much text too that the devs clearly want you to enjoy, but you\u2019ll probably find yourself trying to click through them extremely quickly in-pace with the anxiety-riddled \u201churry up or you\u2019ll miss the only train for the next week\u201d gameplay that the rest of the game forces on you. Also, the goal in the game is to spend as little money as whilst circumnavigating. That\u2019s something they don\u2019t actually tell you until you beat the game. So it\u2019s good to know before going in.\n \nIt\u2019s a very small indie game so I\u2019ve actually already talked about all there is to talk about in it. There\u2019s graphics but they\u2019re just really of a world map. It\u2019s a small game; one you\u2019ll beat in two hours. The intention of the devs is clearly for you to play it multiple times and try different paths around the world. But for me it just wasn\u2019t fun enough for that. I give it a 4/10. It\u2019s below average. Imagine a featureless version of the Oregon Trail that punishes you for every second you spend not traveling.

I made a huge gamble, even with spending only 10$ on it. That is everything that I would normally hate in a video game, yet I took the chance.\n\nIt paid off. I already own a few other games about getting from point A to point B while having adventures, the Curious Expedition and Renowned Explorers, which I have both reviewed before. While unable to reach their greatness of those two games, this is still something I plan to own for years to come, despite the fact I have yet to actually finish the race in 80 days. People who only want games about doing epic things should go elsewhere, but 80 days has walking cities, uprisings to dodge, Fogg's funny social awkquardness and quite a lot of other things that add to its charm. It appeals to the content junkie in me, and the part of me who always has thought the unsung heroes are the most accpmplished. Even the look is sharp, graphic novel-like, despite the lack of animation or voice acting. \n\nThat said, it seems to be lacking in tactical depth and it needs several replays for you to realize what the game's really all about, and really capable of. If you go by first impressions, you will get bored of it quickly, but patience and replays bring out its real spirit. Another minus is that while the game does the book due justice, its seriousness and low stakes might not appeal to younger gamers, though the same traits at least keep away the kind of people who would make fun of it on principal. This game is still good despite being a shallow romp because it defies convention and shows you an indie game can spit in convention's face without resorting to making bashing its own medium its central premise.", "timestamp_created": 1496968118, "timestamp_updated": 1496968118, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32259256": {"recommendationid": "32259256", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037827082", "num_games_owned": 217, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 489, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496858773}, "language": "english", "review": "I picked this game up through a humble bundle deal that I purchased for one of the Worms games.

Essendo un'avventura testuale quello che il gioco ci richiede di fare \u00e8 leggere fiumi di testi e fare delle scelte per modificare il corso degli eventi al fine di completare il giro del mondo prima dello scadere degli 80 giorni. Purtroppo \u00e8 necessario conoscere bene la lingua inglese dato che non \u00e8 presente la localizzazione in italiano.\n\nLa particolarit\u00e0 del gioco \u00e8 che potremo effettuare un itinerario completamente diverso da quello compiuto dai 2 protagonisti nel romanzo. Piuttosto che passare dal nord america, il giocatore pu\u00f2 scegliere di passare dal sud america, oppure fare anche una visita in australia, o, addirittura, fermarsi qualche giorno sulle calde e soleggiate spiagge di Honolulu. Le opzioni sono molteplici e contribuiscono ad incentivare il giocatore ad intraprendere il viaggio pi\u00f9 volte per affrontare ostacoli differenti e trovare l'itinerario pi\u00f9 veloce.\n\nE' presente anche un piccola componente gestionale: per compiere ogni viaggio da una citt\u00e0 all'altra dovremo pagare un biglietto. La gestione del denaro \u00e8 quindi essenziale dato che per recuperarne dalla banca, presente in ogni citt\u00e0, dovremo aspettare dei giorni. Ad ogni citt\u00e0, inoltre, ci si pu\u00f2 fermare al mercato per comprare o vendere oggetti. Alcuni oggetti hanno il semplice scopo di essere rivenduti ad un prezzo maggiore in determinate localit\u00e0, altri hanno possibili utilizzi per superare ostacoli durante l'avventura, altri ancora permettono di negoziare il prezzo dei biglietti per effettuare i vari viaggi. E' una meccanica interessante, essenziale e poco complessa da comprendere.\n\nTutta l'avventura \u00e8 accompagnata anche da una colonna sonora piacevole e da illustrazioni semplici ma efficaci. Tutto \u00e8 comunque ridotto ai minimi termini in modo da non distogliere troppo l'attenzione dal testo, perno centrale del titolo.\nPeccato non sia stato fatto il doppiaggio dei testi, a mio parere sarebbe stata un'aggiunta gradevole che avrebbe potuto rendere ancora pi\u00f9 coinvolgente il titolo.\n\nIn conclusione, \"80 Days\" risulta essere un ottimo passatempo per qualche ora, per niente impegnativo, il gioco scorre fluido per tutta la sua durata, senza momenti noiosi. Non \u00e8 un titolo fondamentale, non ha nulla di estremamente originale, ma se siete appassionati di Jules Verne e di viaggi, un pensierino io ce lo farei, soprattutto se lo trovate in qualche bundle o in sconto qui su Steam.", "timestamp_created": 1496485656, "timestamp_updated": 1521365324, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514563",

You are Passepartout, French servant of an Englishman named Phileas Fogg, who made a wager to his fellow clubmembers to circumnavigate the world in, well, 80 days or less.\n\nThe game has remarkable depth for a CYOAG. Mainly your adventure unfolds based on the cities you choose to travel next, but along the way, you'll engage in interesting conversations. Some lead the story to deep, contemplative moments, while some gives you knowledge to unplanned travel routes or even access to faster, cheaper means of transport. The hundreds of cities to travel in addition to a plethora of conversational options makes it rare to experience the same story on each playthrough.\n\nThe success of your circumnavigation depends on two things: money and items. You start off with 4,000 pounds in cash, but you can buy some items in, say, Munich, and sell them for profit in, say, Istanbul. In that note, although there are some basic economic elements to it, it isn't necessarily a trading game. The items you buy makes your trip easier. For example, buying coat furs and mittens help you cope with the Siberian cold should your travel pass through there.\n\nAlthough it's mainly text-based, the accompanying artwork is beautiful. You'll notice remarkably different atmosphere between cities in every continent. The excellent original soundtrack makes them even more memorable. (The music for the game's finale is my favorite!)\n\nThis review barely scratches the surface and I wish I could express my love for this game much, much more than I could in here! There's just so many things to see and experience in this game that makes [i]80 Days[/i] not only enjoyable, but also highly replayable.

So some stories you may find you follow all the way, some you might lose track of and your left wondering what happened to that person. But this helps add to the feel that your character is travelling the world and on a time schedule. Of course you will meet people on your travel but you will then move on, as is life.\nThere is also times where you can risk spending an extra couple of days to try and continue that story, say by visiting another city that\u2019s wasn\u2019t exactly on the route you where originally planning.\n\nThis can also happen in scripted events, where for some reason the city you where journeying to will, suddenly no longer be your destination, which can sometimes frustrate or delight.\nHow so, because travelling the world cost money. You start the game with plenty but unless you start doing some wheeling and dealing, you eventually find your funds running out, especially for some of the more expensive but faster journeys. So it\u2019s up to you, to buy items in markets, and then sell them on.\nThe game tells you where you will receive the most money for selected items, but is it on your route? Do you head that way, just to make money, hoping that you can continue your journey from there?\nAnd you don't have all day to decide, as part from when your reading the clock keeps ticking, and if you spend to long at the market or planning a route across the country, you may find that you've just missed your connection and the next one isn't for 5 days! Do you then choose another way? Wait the days out? Or bribe somebody to lower the amount of days until the next journey?\n\nI've played through it three times now, not once have I stopped midway.\nMy first attempt, it took me 84 days and I was gutted that I just missed out! My 2nd try, it was 74 days and I was genuinely over the moon, to have made it, and exactly 10 days quicker than my first attempt. And my third attempt before writing this review, it took me 75days.\n\nIt isn\u2019t exactly a long game but its got character and a charm about it, which somehow has you glued to your seat from the start of your journey till the end.

All routes have pros and cons, and one of the downright coolest things is you get to see recent players on your map and guage the speed theyre going with your own.\n\nSome of the limits placed on you really force you to play intelligently, some modes of transport only allow certain amounts of luggage meaning you must dump all that valuable junk youre carrying around, some items are of extreme value in places but on your route there is simply no way you can make the time to go there.  \n\nAll things being said, I have about 50 hours in this game logged while connected to the internet, but I am sure that i have quite a bit more than that, and I still haven't really discovered everything there is.

S\u00e9rieusement. En bref : l'univers est g\u00e9nial, le jeu a une grande rejouabilit\u00e9 et reste passionnant \u00e0 la troisi\u00e8me partie (et je dois me mesurer pour ne pas en lancer une quatri\u00e8me tout de suite), ce jeu est vraiment excellent. Recommand\u00e9 pour : les amateurs de Jules Verne, de steampunk, de bonnes histoires, de bons personnages.\n\nL'univers d'abord est tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressant, c'est une reprise int\u00e9ressante et steampunk (il y a des mechas!) de l'univers de Jules Verne (au del\u00e0 du seul Tour du Monde en 80 jours, on a aussi des allusions / clins d'oeils par exemple \u00e0 Vingt Mille Lieues sous les mers et Voyage au centre de la Terre), avec des reprises d'\u00e9v\u00e8nements historiques (la Commune de Paris, etc.) et un background tr\u00e8s riche qu'on d\u00e9couvre, comme le personnage au fil du voyage.\n\nCa m'am\u00e8ne aux personnages. On s'identifie tr\u00e8s vite \u00e0 Passepartout, au travers de qui on d\u00e9couvre l'univers. Personnellement, j'ai ador\u00e9 le jouer tr\u00e8s fid\u00e8le \u00e0 Fogg et avec des soup\u00e7ons de bromance / romance \u00e0 sens unique (no comment) mais c'est tr\u00e8s libre (m\u00eame s'il me semble qu'on ne coupe pas vraiment au lien avec Fogg, parce que l'un des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de gameplay consiste \u00e0... Garder Fogg en bonne sant\u00e9). Et on rencontre \u00e9norm\u00e9ment de personnages tr\u00e8\u00e8\u00e8\u00e8s int\u00e9ressants et tr\u00e8s cools au fil des voyages (voleur.euse.s, \u00e9tudiant.e.s, peintres, militant.e.s etc.) dont on d\u00e9couvre une partie en discutant avec eux.\n\nEt toute la diversit\u00e9 de l'univers et des personnages fait qu'on a envie de rejouer encore et encore pour essayer de nouveaux trajets / choix. Parce que tout dans ce jeu est \u00e0 propos de rencontres, de d\u00e9couvertes, d'aventures. Du moins je l'ai per\u00e7u ainsi, et c'est ce que j'ai vraiment ador\u00e9 dans ce jeu et qui le rend assez difficile \u00e0 raconter. J'ai tr\u00e8s envie de raconter tout ce que j'aime dans ce jeu, mais je n'ai pas envie de spoiler les aventures, les choix ou les embranchements que vous pourriez prendre en jouant.\n\nEn somme : jouez-y, s\u00e9rieux.\n\nAh oui, et CE JEU EST BEAU PUTAIN!

Other times all I wanted to do was get to the next city but I was bogged down with screen upon screen of dialogue and story.

But there is one catch. You must do it in 80 days.\n\nThe writing is the highlight to 80 days and is very much as premium as an expensive book. \nThe 'choose your own adventure' side is amazing as well. Unlike other choose your own adventure games, your choices effect the game a LOT. It's not just a short term effect like other games, but it can be long term and game changing as well.\nJust by doing something as simple as asking a pedestrian for navigation to saving someone from drowning can COMPLETELY change the game and it is here which makes the game really shine. The art style is great and there is different art at every city you go to. I really like how this has a visual aspect because most novel type games are just plain and bland.\nIn my first 5.1 hr playthrough (which I failed to do in 80 days) some of the things I experienced was: Got held at gun point, recruited as an agent to be sent on an espionage mission, stole a car, worked at the circus, went bankrupt, nearly got arrested and other crazy and awesome stories\n\nVerdict\nEven if you don't like reading, or aren't into games that are as simple as this, I still highly reccomend you pick this up. \nIt's cheap and I got my copy 75% off to make it even more of a bargain. \n\nPros:\nCheap\nGreat writing/story\nArt is great\nGreat strategy involved\nMemorable moments and characters\nReplayable\n\nCons:\nNo sort of system to let you save and see your journey at the end of the game\nOccasional grammar/punctuation errors", "timestamp_created": 1495528970, "timestamp_updated": 1515001336, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.672255", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31822454": {"recommendationid": "31822454", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042679485", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 296, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495115618}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly one of the finest games I have ever played.

This plays well on PC but I think one of the mobile versions would be as good if not better if that makes it easier for you to play.\n\n2. This game could actually be converted to a pure text game along the lines of [i]Zork[/i] and it would lose very little process. I say this as a good thing.\n\n3. So I've never read [i]Around the World in 80 Days[/i] but the plot is simple enough to understand: rich man makes a bet he can travel around the world in 80 days. Adventure ensues. The plot of this game is the same. You play as this rich guy's valet, which means you do all the work. He has the money. This is life kids, get used to it.\n\n4. On your journey, you have a few basic tasks: find routs to new destinations, book travel, buy and sell equipment and accessories, manage money and attend to the needs of your rich guy master. \n\n5. Circumnavigating the globe in 80 days is not terribly difficult. You are graded on how well you did in certain areas but mostly you have to find your own challenge if challenge is what you want. \n\n6. You can chose to try to go around the world as fast as possible. You can try to visit the most cities. You can find the cheapest routs. You can try to keep your rich guy master as comfortable as possible if you want to do that for some reason. Esp. if you don't care about actually finishing in 80 days, you can do whatever it is you damn well please.\n\n7. Each playthrough of this builds from a different seed but the variations are not that great. If you chose to take the Trans-Siberian express across Asia every time, you are going to run into about the same situations each time. If you want something truly different, you have to take it upon yourself to find it. I think ultimately this is a good thing because, really, if you want to make it your goal to get through as fast as possible, you need some consistency.\n\n8.  Really, the joy here is in finding on how your journey plays out depending on what choices you made. Each city you visit has a bit of a story which you will discover both before, during and after your visit. The people you meet have stories you can learn about or chose to ignore. Things you do early on affect how your journey transpires later. This game is about making a story out of a few simple choices. \n\n9. You can totally make out w/ both dudes and chicks in this if you got the swagger to pull it off.\n\n10. The writing in this is a pretty impressive feat. Almost every few sentences, there is an opportunity for player input and the writing always goes along seamlessly w/o seeming award or computer generated. I think they must have had a writer or team of writers actually go through and compose these hundreds or thousands of conversations trees. \n\n11. There are lots of little annoyances while playing but nothing really gamebreaking. It drives me nuts that the clock keeps running at hyper-fast in-game time while you are shopping or reviewing travel options. I get that it takes in-game time to do these things but you can basically lose a day if you get distracted in real life for two minutes. \n\n12. Rich your guy master in this is kind of a twat. OK, really a twat. If I could offer the developers one improvement on gameplay, you should allow players to kill him and pay off officials to look the other way. \n\n13. Honestly, during my first playthrough, I got kind of bored by the end of the game which makes it a bit hard to wholeheartedly recommend this . But as I was thinking about it afterward, something happned: I decided that I wanted to play it again. And it was worth it!

Get it when it's on sale.\n\nPros:\n- Good storytelling\n- Many options to choose from in dialogue and it feels like your choices have great impact on the story\n- Atmospheric visuals\n- Writers have a sense of humor\n\nCons:\n- I am not a living and breathing world map/atlas.. Sometimes the game refers to certain cities but I dont know immediately where they are, and the clock that keeps ticking leaves no room for the player to look up where exactly the game is talking about. This is very important because it can help determine your route.\n- When you are concidering options on what to do in cities the time will keep on passing and sometimes if you dont decide in a matter of seconds suddenly the bank will close, etc. and you can't even go there any more unless you want to spend another day. I wish time would pause everytime the player considers options.\n- I was hoping for a little more visuals to add to the dialogues.. Although I guess this game is sold as an interactive novel and thats exactly what it is so maybe it's too much to expect.\n- I would like to be able to replay the game though another perspective. Perhaps the perspective from Phileas Fogg?\n\nThis is a good game. The cons dont weigh up to the joy you will have going around the world in 80 days :) If you want to have a relaxing evening playing a novel game set in steampunkt England, by all means buy this game.

a colleague in order to win a bet. It is in fact a [b]text based[/b] game but does a very good job with it's wording. You will start at one point and be given the freedom to traverse wherever the current location you're at can take you, assuming you can afford it. There are many different places you can visit and they're all different. You can't visit every stop in one sitting so the replay value is extremely high. \n\nThis is the kind of game where you travel point to point managing relationships, money as well as time. Again, you travel with a colleague so you aren't alone and is actually the one person you need to maintain a stable relationship with since you are with him for the entire trip. You will however run into other people in different countries and cities that can either help you or hurt you. Some will give you helpful information such as which route is cheaper, which countries/cities to avoid, or which items sell more in what countries/cities. Where as some will hold you hostage delaying your progress, steal money from you, or even backstab you. Thus, based on the events that happen, you must be able to strategize at any given moment so your trip isn't handicapped anymore than it is. 80 Days is also a game where choices do matter and affect the way the game plays out. You will run into problems no matter where you go and most if not all areas of the world you visit will contain some form of conflict you must address that will affect how you're character is perceived, how your financial status ends up as, as well as how tight your time constraint becomes. Again, time is also passing no matter what you do so time management is a really important asset to consider when playing the game. \n\nIn terms of difficulty, despite what's been said, it definitely is more lenient when you aren't able to make it around in 80 or less days. In that sense I found it quite difficult to circle the planet in 80 days or less but if you were to reach the deadline unsuccessfully, you can still play on. All that happens is that your colleague will just notify you that you and him have failed to reach the 80 day goal and have lost the bet but then says that it isn't a big deal. He then continues to say that the journey is [i]\"not complete until we've returned back home!\"[/i] and you will still be able to complete the game, regardless of failing to reach the goal. [b](I'm not sure if there is a limit of how many days over 80 you can play for since you can in fact go bankrupt so just beware).[/b]\n\n80 Days is definitely a game for both hardcore and casual gamers, although not very action packed, it is very tense. It is recommended for those who like reading and making decisions that affect the storyline, as well as managing important real life problems such as time, money and relationships. You know, like a responsible adult. \n\nTL;DR: A text-based travelling game where choices matter with high replay value where the player must be able to manage money, time and maintain relationships.", "timestamp_created": 1491371551, "timestamp_updated": 1491372171, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30777323": {"recommendationid": "30777323", "author": {"steamid": "76561198248105534", "num_games_owned": 187, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 562, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494361713}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Al principio, esperaba una versi\u00f3n videojuego de la famosa novela de Verne, pero poco tard\u00e9 en darme cuenta que era mucho m\u00e1s que eso.

But after a few moments of playing you can see that it's not only moving on the world map. It's also an adventure. Each city gives you a possibility to explore and discover new routes, sometimes you'll end in different place than you planned, some things will happen during your travel. What really amazes me in this game is the sense of adventure. Your car may be captured by air-pirates, you can find that Transsiberian Railway is more than meets the eye, you may walk the oceans bottom, solve murder cases, travel with world's greatest thief and much more.\nThe graphics are rather simple, but it's enough for this game. The plot is given through text - so there's a lot of reading and sometimes the game may seem slow. When traveling, you see only a black silhouette of your vehicle, and those are really inventive: steam cars, hovercrafts, mechanical elephants, walking cities, flying cities, submarines, rockets. One moment you are moving with the slow horse-caravan, next moment you are flying in a bird-like airship.\nWhile one gameplay may be completed in about two hours, the number of adventures and places to see is enough many laps around the world.

Et, vu que mon colloc' pionce, j'ai le temps, alors je le fais. \n\nTout d'abord, une note: 17/20? Quel est le bar\u00e8me, je ne sais pas, ne m'emb\u00eatez pas avec \u00e7a. Disons que c'est de la capacit\u00e9 de juger dans son \u00e9tat le plus pur. \n\nBlagues \u00e0 part: je n'ai pas \u00e9norm\u00e9ment de temps de jeu enregistr\u00e9, mais c'est parce que chaque run doit \u00eatre savour\u00e9 dans toute la densit\u00e9 qu'il offre.\n\nAlors, c'est une variante inspir\u00e9e du Tour du monde en 80 jours de Jules Verne -jusqu'ici, on s'en serait dout\u00e9, l'abruti que vous \u00eates en train de lire ne vous en apprend pas des masses sur le jeu que vous pourriez \u00eatre amen\u00e9 \u00e0 convoiter. Je vais essayer de faire plus int\u00e9ressant. Le jeu est beau (vravo le beau), mais surtout extr\u00eamement int\u00e9ressant de par le gameplay qu'il propose. \n\nInt\u00e9ressons-nous de plus pr\u00e8s au gameplay: c'est une course contre la montre, exactement comme dans le livre, on part de Londres en incarnant ce bon vieux Passepartout, et on prend des d\u00e9cisions d'itin\u00e9raire en t\u00e2chant de garder son ma\u00eetre, et les finances de ce brave ploutocrate, en bonne forme. Et, exactement comme dans le livre, il faut arriver \u00e0 faire le tour de la plan\u00e8te en 80 jours ou moins. Jusqu'ici rien que de tr\u00e8s banal, me direz-vous: on se balade, on d\u00e9cide par o\u00f9 on se balade, et on essaie de g\u00e9rer la montre, c'est comme un jeu de course mais en plus ennuyeux. Mais l\u00e0 o\u00f9 tout devient int\u00e9ressant, c'est dans la litt\u00e9ratit\u00e9 du gameplay. K\u00e9saco?, je n'en suis pas bien s\u00fbr moi-m\u00eame, mais les concepts \u00e7a fait toujours bien. Non, s\u00e9rieusement, on s'en moque pas mal de faire le tour du monde en 80 jours. On le fait, excellent, on a gagn\u00e9! On ne le fait pas, tant pis, on doit tout de m\u00eame rentrer \u00e0 la maison. Alors on continue. Ce qui est int\u00e9ressant c'est la g\u00e9n\u00e9ration d'une v\u00e9ritable histoire litt\u00e9raire que ce jeu propose: les textes interactifs sont formidablement bien \u00e9crits -m\u00eame s'ils demandent une pratique certaine de la langue de Shakespeare pour \u00eatre correctement appr\u00e9ci\u00e9s, et pr\u00e9sentent de v\u00e9ritables enjeux vid\u00e9oludiques de surcro\u00eet que demande le peuple qui se prend pour ce qu'il n'est pas?\n\nOn se renseigne sur des itin\u00e9raires, on les parcourt en \u00e9vitant quelques petits soucis -ou gros, c'est \u00e0 voir-, on d\u00e9cide de faire des petites escales (m\u00eame si le temps est compt\u00e9) et tout ceci en \u00e9crivant litt\u00e9ralement de petites histoires qui ressemblent soit \u00e0 des phases de dialogue \u00e0 enjeu dans un RPG, soit \u00e0 des mini-jeux de l'\u00e8re la plus primitive (rien d'insultant dans cet adjectif) du jeu-vid\u00e9o. De ces petites histoires, des nouvelles pistes \u00e0 explorer pour l'histoire principale, ou bien des boni (pardonnez le pluriel latin, on parle litt\u00e9rarit\u00e9 dans un jeu vid\u00e9o l\u00e0, oh!), soit des mali (m\u00eame bail). Mais au final, rien de bien important, que de l'histoire et la jouissance litt\u00e9raire certaine que le style de r\u00e9daction, tr\u00e8s fluide, permet. \n\nAlors, pourquoi diable aller jouer \u00e0 \u00e7a si on peut se contenter d'ouvrir un livre pour retrouver le m\u00eame genre de plaisir? Eh bien, parce que c'est assez nouveau, assez inattendu, et, sans que je comprenne tr\u00e8s bien pourquoi, c'est prenant! On a envie de jouer \u00e0 cette chose! Et pas uniquement pour lire. Il y a l\u00e0 un vrai plaisir de d\u00e9couverte, une vraie volont\u00e9 d'action, et puis tout est fait pour que l'on garde toujours la qu\u00eate principale \u00e0 l'esprit et que l'on ne puisse s'emp\u00eacher de se scalper quand on apprend qu'un chameau est tomb\u00e9 en panne alors qu'on faisait route vers le Y\u00e9men. \n\nA ceci s'ajoute un vrai effort d'invention de la part de l'\u00e9quipe artistique -\u00e7a n'est clairement pas un jeu de codeur-. Derri\u00e8re la d\u00e9marche de \"ludicisation\" -\u00e7a existe? non? alley, osef- de l'univers litt\u00e9raire de Jules Verne, il y a une r\u00e9interpr\u00e9tation de la v\u00e9ritable fascination du XIX\u00e9me pour la technologie et le progr\u00e8s technique.

Not only do you have to select your route from a number of onward trips, but each leg of your journey offers a narrative with dozens of choices - while sometimes it's just idle talk, often these choices linger with you on your adventure. You meet people who later help (or hold you back), you receive items that become important later etc. Thus each of your journeys becomes a unique one, and at first the game overwhelms you with this abundance of options. You replay it just to see what could have happened if you made a different choice in some place... and then make a different choice much, much earlier, derailing the adventure to a completely different route.\n\nThe narrative itself is excellent in form and content. Lots of micro-plots you encounter in your journeys have unexpected turns and sometimes you find yourself not in the place you intended to reach. The steampunk atmosphere is wonderful, it hits all the tropes of the genre, yet still feeling both genuine and creative. The amount of different contraptions, vehicles and mechanisms you see on your travels is surprising. Also, as you replay the game, you begin to value the political picture of the game's world. The nations are making wars and alliances, different organisations dabble into political affairs, and you start feeling to be a part of this grand scheme.\n\nThe main 80-day objective is relatively easy, you will most certainly hit it on your second playthrough. The real challenge, though, is the 40-day achievement, which seems impossible at first. It is much harder to nail and requires familiarising with the game, noting the fast routes and ways to make shortcuts or earn fast money.\n\nI highly recommend this game, it is full of surprises and is quite entertaining at least for a dozen of playthroughs.

You play as Frenchman Jean Passepartout, valet to the Englishman Phileas Fogg. Fogg has just made a wager of \u00a320,000 that he can make a journey around the world in eighty days or less, beginning and ending in London. It is up to Passepartout as his valet to plan out this journey and try to win the bet.\n\nThis game is a combination of interactive fiction and some strategic management. The planning of the journey itself requires the most strategy in the game. You begin the journey with a set amount of funds and you have to figure out how to use that money for the best purposes. This means deciding what types of transportation to take as different types cost different amounts of money. There is also the aspect of inventory as you can buy items that might be useful to you on your trip or you can engage in some buying and selling to help fund the journey. All along the way, you have to keep an eye on the calendar if you hope to make it back to London on time and pay attention to Fogg's health.\n\nAside from management, the other major aspect of the game is the storytelling. All along the way, you have the opportunity to meet and talk to many different people from all over the globe and find yourself in different situations. Talking with people comes off as important aspect to your journey as well. Perhaps a stranger knows of certain routes that will make your trip shorter or offer tips on where the best places to sell items are. Although taking place in 1872, the game's story and design contains many steampunk-themed elements. Thus, you have talk of various types of warfare and civil unrest. The steampunk theme is also prevalent in the world such as some rather unconventional types of transportation available. There is the more standard things such as trains and ships, but you also have things like hovercraft and walking cities, all with that steampunk theme. If you like storytelling, there is a lot to enjoy in this game.\n\nI also thought the game's graphics looked pretty good even with its minimalist design. You spend most of the game looking at a simplified map of the globe, but there are stylistic graphics depicting the various forms of transportation you use and destinations you visit.\n\nEach journey you take can probably be completed in around three hours, though I imagine a single journey can take much more time depending on the decisions the player makes. I have only played around four trips so far, so my review is based on that experience.\n\nFor me, there are only a couple of negatives. The first is a complete lack of multiple saves. The game autosaves where you left off when you quit, but there is no option to have multiple games. I really fail to see why there is such an annoyance. The other major negative aspect that I came across is that it is possible for your journey to hit a dead-end with no possible way to continue and yet there is no indication in the game that this might happen. It is quite frustrating to play for two or more hours only to have to end the game in such a way.\n\nOverall, while a couple of flaws might be annoying, I generally enjoyed the adventurous nature of this game.

My only real complaint about the game is the way it implements the multiplayer.  Basically it shows other peoples travels.  And that's it.  You can't trade items, exchange info, or interact  in any way.  They're just there, and that's the end of it.

I was pleasantly suprised.\n\nWhat normally dulls my enthusiasm for adventure games is the lack of real player agency. Most hold you by the hand, tell you a story, and then after a few hours the credits roll. 80 Days avoids this problem with playthroughs that are comparatively short (1-2 hours, depending on how you play), but have plenty of paths to take and choices to make. Some of the routes are more linear, while others will take you in all sorts of unexpected directions, and all of them are impeccably narrated. I've done maybe 10 full playthroughs or so, and while I've seen plenty, there are still cities and stories I haven't discovered yet.\n\nThough even the most open-ended adventure game eventually becomes repetitive. Some of the early and late game events have started to wear on me, so I may not turn over every stone, but by now I definitely feel like the game has given me my money's worth in excitement and entertainment.\n\nThe only complaint I have is a bug I have encountered a few times where the game clock would get stuck and I would be forced to restart. I haven't identified a cause or a fix, so it's rather vexing when it strikes while I'm having a good run.

The differences from game to game can be subtle or glaring, ranging between your starting supplies, which cities the Orient Express happens to run through, or whether or not you are granted the opportunity to go on an expidition to the moon! After the 5th or 6th time playing through, I realized that there's an option to go through the North Pole! How's that for a shortcut? (Also, if you can, do that. Some of the game's best writing lies down that path.)\n\nThe feel of the game is perfect. Since the clock is always ticking, you feel like you have to weigh careful planning with expediency, which can end up forcing you down paths you might not expect! The differing routes and methods of travel from game to game keep this feeling fresh after multiple runs.\n\nThe game captures the feel of 19th century penny dreadfuls perfectly, with swashbuckling adventure and outlandish (if somewhat campy) secrets in pretty much every run.

There is something very cool and charming about this games but there's also few issues.\n\nPros:\n-The journey: It's pretty epic and there's always things waiting to happen you probably can't expect and it keeps you kinda on your toes the whole game. The first playthrough is pretty much for you to understand the purpose of the game and various mechanics and after that you are probably smarter to try again this time actually managing to go from London to London in 80 days.\n\n-Replay Value: Even though the 1 trip from London to London takes maybe 3 to 4 hours depending on how many days it'll  last and how much time you do on planning and thinking the next possible route it still has a lot of replay value. There's 160 (if I remember correctly) cities to visit and (I assume) thousands of options to go across the globe so I can imagine this game to be at least worth of 20 hours of playtime (or 5 to 6 playthroughs).\n\n-Intelligent: This game challenges you to take calculated risks and think few steps forward. It's pretty uncommon these days and I found myself enjoying in this aspect in the first playthrough (even if it took +120 days to get to London). There's always challenges waiting for you that you didn't confront the first playthrough and it even challenges you to do the around the world trip faster than 40 days (steam achievement).\n\n-Jules Verne References: There's many references to Jules Verne's books maybe because \"Around the World in 80 Days\" is one of those books. I don't want to spoil anything more but all those who are familiar with Verne's novels there will be lots of \"fan service\".\n\n-Something Fresh and Different: This game truly is something fresh and different and maybe that is the biggest thing I enjoyed it the most.\n\n\nCons:\n- You need to read a lot: There is lots of reading you need to do through the game. Because there is no voice acting you need to read shit loads of text... I don't know if it's a bad thing or not (though for some it might be). For me it's not a bad thing but I don't like it that much either. I mean it can be a bit exhausting because the pacing of the game is kinda fast.\n\n-It's a mobile game: To be honest that's what it is. I can imagine it's a bit more enjoyable to play with PC but it's still pretty much just a port of a \"mobile game\". Though this could be pretty good way to spend time on a plane playing this game!\n\n-There's luck (or is there): Sometimes it feels that somethings (specially when playing blind playthrough) are happening because of luck.. 'cause no matter how much you made yourself think your next route it just might shit on your face and the \"non logical route choice\" were probably better one. And that's sometimes pretty demoralizing. But if you think of it it's the late 1800's so anything could happen in your journey around the world.\n\nI paid 4,99\u20ac on this and I'm pretty happy that I did. It's pretty fresh experience and maybe it's NOT something new but at least it's something different. If you think you might enjoy this I recommend of buying it.

Enjoy :) [/quote]\n\n80 Days is a game developed by inkle Studios (known for the Sorcery! series) and ported from the original mobile port by Cape Guy Ltd. and is based on Jules Verne's classic: Around the World in 80 Days\n\nAfter travelling the world once, I literally felt as if I'd experienced an epic trip around the world and I can recall all the craziness and wild adventures as if they were real memories, the game is very immersive\n\nThe writing is masterfully done writing and the story (which is based off Jules Verne's book) is really good, and just feels incredibly immersive and a great balance of strategy and story-telling with lots of classic literature easter eggs to be found\n\nThe gameplay consists of you playing a servant in 1872 but with a steampunk twist. You are the servant of Phileas Fogg as he takes a bet that he can travel the world in 80 days or less, you make text-based decisions about how you want to interact with people and situations and where you want to go. 80 Days also has heavy strategy elements because a large part of your success depends on how you plan out your route around the world. There is also an economy element of balancing your funds through buying and selling items, among other things\n\nHowever, 80 Days has ;ots of reading and is not for the impatient, thankfully you can change the text speed from slower to faster. Originally, 80 Days was built for mobile, but enough has been added/tweaked to merit the more expensive Steam purchase\n\n80 Days takes Jules Verne's Around the World in 80 Days and makes it into an interactive wild ride!\n\n[h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1480113279, "timestamp_updated": 1480169715, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.468615", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27544379": {"recommendationid": "27544379", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027497267", "num_games_owned": 321, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 407, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480106590}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, great price.", "timestamp_created": 1480107150, "timestamp_updated": 1480107150, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27525065": {"recommendationid": "27525065", "author": {"steamid": "76561198304332683", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 404, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487321280}, "language": "dutch", "review": "Very nice game, especially if you're into the book.

I find myself checking google maps to find the location of cities I might be able to sell goods at (because once you close out you lose the abilty to/have chosen your options already), this game forces you to learn your geography, and I think that's cool.

It's like the Amazing race if you have watched that TV show (I love that show for the same reason, it takes you all over the world). Around the world in 80 days was the perfect setting for this though, timeless classic! My current strategy is to travel the same route each time trying to perfect my time and (hopefully) beat the game, I see endless replay value in trying to go by completly different routes in the futre.The game is everything I expected from reading reviews. I was going to wait for a sale, then decided to hell with it, I want it now! I'm glad I bought it, I'm having fun!

As did the fact that this is one of those 'story telling games' where your decisions determine the path you're going to take, and thus how the story continues.\n\nHowever the problem arises when the decisions you make, aren't actually all that interesting. As opposed to making the player wonder how their decision pans out, it gives you an uninteresting outcome. Which then makes you not really care about any forthcoming decision making. As mentioned in another review, this game is very wordy. I don't really see that as a problem, however it is when it isn't captivating me with those words. And that's what's happening in 80 days, throughout the game.\n\nThe only time I felt my decisions gave me a satisfying outcome, was when at the end of my game I was faced with starting a mutiny on a boat. The mutiny failed, however that was the only time where I felt the story I was 'creating' was grabbing me. And that was well at the end of the 80 days time period. So everything before that: meh.\n\nWhich brings me to a complaint that was brough up by another reviewer. This isn't a game you're supposed to finish in 1 playthrough. You're supposed to do things differently and learn from prior games, to be able to make that 80th day deadline. However the only time where I learned to do something differently in a next game, was again with the mutiny scenario. And I wasn't going to make it even if it had succeeded. There's no real learning point, as you don't really know what you did wrong, other than try a different path. And there are loads of those.\n\nBut then we're back at the game's scenarios and decisions not really being engaging, and after 1 play through I didn't feel like doing it all over again. I can see 80 days being a good game to other people, as it's not really 'bad'. However I personally wouldn't recommend it to everybody.

However, unlike Sorcery! I did not enjoy this one as much. I am sure there is a plethora and depth to this game that I barely scratched with my 5 hours of playthrough, but I was not satisfied with the story telling or gameplay. \n\nI went through one playthrough, made it 61 days through the north pole which I felt confident afterwards that may have been one of the easier runs perhaps since much of it was standing still waiting for something to happen with little decision or choices to make. There was some cool story telling at times, but the dialogue as an American player felt like I was trying to understand European culture or at least UK English to understand certain \"ways of life.\" There were quite a few words that I never use or have rarely seen in my lifetime and I don't account that for a lack of education, but just not understanding the certain style of the European language used to make the game.\n\nTo top it off, right as I got to day 30ish and into the artic the game started to eat away at my CPU taking 98%-100% power at a time. Noteworthy, I never ran into the issue in any Sorcery! game and this is a 5k desktop computer; I run much more demanding games than this title. I tried to google a fix, but found nothing besides restarting; which I begrudging was worried that the game wouldn't save so I just slogged through it which probably added another 20-30 mins.\n\nThe difference I feel with Sorcery! and 80 Days is two things. The story telling and the mechanics. For the story telling it is lightly flavored text and only mixed with some small story based on where you travel; like the artic had a short arc as well as each city if you stayed there, but after all was said and done, that was it. You are here or traveling there for a bit and you move on to the next location; nothing felt meaningful. There were light dialogue options to choose from, but not all of them felt like they had weight; sure, some helped \"us\" live in the artic, but I think I could have easily done it without any item or any dialogue assistance. (Maybe the medicine was the only choice that was key for survival. Not sure though).\n\nAnd the mechanics, like the story telling, is also very light. There are small interactions with inventory and money management, but I never used the bank once. I sold one item for about 8k and came back with 4k (and the 20k prize). I never felt short on cash. I also could never tell what the Figg/Fogg guy thought of me really. I tried to look for a stat screen but was unable to find one that incorporated it.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s a quick adventure and that\u2019s it. I am sure there are optimal routes and other cool short stories to read, but Sorcery! was built on the foundation of Peter Jackson's novels. They only thing that Inkle had to do was to build a foundation of a game with playable mechanics that would match the novels. This game showed a difference in focus where half was for story and the other for mechanics. And it turns out to be a light adventure game set in a steam punk 1800s worlds.

In what is a story based game about adventuring, route optimization, wondrous stories and relaxing rides through an alternate 1872 as the valet to a well known gentleman who has made a wager.\nAlong the way you will need to manage funding, items, packing, and selecting the routes to follow. It sounds simple, but it is complex enough to keep you busy.\n\nTo get it out of the way, yes, this is phone game. Do not let that scare you off, all it truly means for you as a PC gamer is that even your most outdated toaster can run it, the controls are simple and they do not need to be any more complex to do what you need to do. Game mechanics themselves do not suffer either, with a great majority of your options being simple choices in dialogue. Choices that actually do matter many times, with stories to tell you that I found surprisingly pleasant and interesting to read. \n\nYou can embark on an adventure and enjoy a richly filled world while balancing your own interest at exploration and your task as valet to keep monsieur Fogg in good condition and comfortable, on track to win his wager. It is not difficult to make it in 80 days if you try and plan things out in advance, but often there will be opportunities and potential rewards just a little off your chosen path. A lot of tempting things can drag you out to somewhere you didn't intend and it can both be a great boon to your funds and travel time or a disaster. With every city and most travel lines in the game having their own or connected stories, you will need multiple playthroughs to see them all. And even then it may not be likely unless you actively try. \nLosing is alright as well. The wager won't bankrupt you, and you will be able to just try again. After all, why bet only once? A playthrough will take about an hour, perhaps a bit more or less depending on how much of a rush you are in.\n\nBut then there are some things that you should probably not get very hyped about either. Racing other people? Live multiplayer feed? Unless you actively go looking on the map for them, you likely won't find others except near the start. Even then, there is no interactions with them and I have yet to notice any sort of multiplayer feed. At best there are some icons on the map of where others went before you, and some things you aren't told and have to find out the hard way(Leaving a train at a midway stop when you have a ticket to the final destination of the train voids your ticket. You aren't allowed to get back on with the next train passing by. Some routes don't let you resume at all if you buy only a partway ticket, and so on)\nThe game is surprisingly easy to break as well, crashing or freezing if you try to do too much at once. A good autosave system helps with this, so you likely won't have issues- Just start it back up and you're back to where you were.\nBut in the end, these are small issues that don't actually hold it back. \n\n80 days is a great game that tells you a story, while giving you full control over the story it tells, with excellently fitting graphics and amazingly done mood setting. Its flaws are few and easily forgivable, with a very competitive price to make it definitely a worthwhile buy.", "timestamp_created": 1475037605, "timestamp_updated": 1475037605, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.554973", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25731076": {"recommendationid": "25731076", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080640831", "num_games_owned": 198, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 1447, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474911139}, "language": "swedish", "review": "When I grew up I believe I managed to read every book by Jules Verne that was available at the local library, including mostly forgotten titles such as The Purchase of the North Pole and Dr. Ox\u2019s Experiment, but the favourite one was Around the World in Eighty Days. Hence, I felt great excitement when I had a chance to play the game 80 Days which is based on that book. The game started with a spinning globe with a number of cities marked, but I noticed immediately that it is spinning in the wrong direction. I saw that as a bad sign, that maybe the game lacked attention to details (such as having the sun rising in the west), but apart from that bad mistake I found 80 Days to be extremely enjoyable.\n\nThe story starts very abrupt. You play as Passepartout, the valet of a certain Phileas Fogg who has just made a wager to travel around the world in 80 days, and you have to pack a bag in a hurry in order to get on the evening train to Paris before you even know how to play the game. Already on this first train it is clear that the 1872 in this game is much more steam-punk than the real version of 1872. The world is rapidly changing thanks to fantastic machines and strong empires are growing everywhere around the world. This makes the journey difficult to plan since you do not really know which routes are more convenient than others. The first time I played the game I actually managed to return to London in the afternoon on the 80th day, so I beat the game immediately. However, there were so many adventures and encounters along the way that I wanted to follow up on, and so many more wonderous places in the world I wanted to explore, so I needed to play the game again, and again, and again.\n\n80 Days is more an interactive story than a game, but since there are so many choices available it does not feel restricted. The writing is excellent. It is condensed, but still it manages to be both detailed and evocative. The characterisations of the multitude of characters encountered are made with finesse, and the adventures along the jorney often takes unexpected turns. In fact, the writing is actually the only really good thing in this game, but it is so good that it defines the game.

The majority of my time put into 80 Days has been spread out over a long period of time because its the only one of these games where I know for a fact its going to be something completely different than before. And not just because the guns and maps are randomized like FTL, but because I will choose to play differently. The brilliant thing about this game is that you don't have to go crazy out of your way to have a completely different experience. You choose one route you haven't gone on before, and all of a sudden you're in a rocket ship bound for the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665in MOON, or in a walking city a la the spider from Wild Wild West.

Furthermore, this game has a fair amount of replay value as you are able to choose your own journey (you will not get to visit every city / country in one playthrough due to your 80 day / turn time constraint).

Well, I won't go into details because this is a spoler-free review, but the world is completely different from the one in the book (and from real life history at the time). The main theme is steampunk, as you will encounter various wondrous machines, contraptions and robots throughout your adventures.\nThe writing is witty and immediate, with a focus on the character's thoughts (he is, supposedly, writing on his diary), so it never gets too heavy or boring but doesn't skim over important parts of the plot and adds nice details to make the world come alive.\nThe art style can be described as \"inky\", with a focus on blacks and shadows. My only issue with the visuals is the fact that the 3D globe is a little too shiny, and sometimes you can even confuse the land with the sea because of the lack of clear, defined lines. It would be nice to have a way to change the color of the land and the sea to better suit the player's needs. The game runs absolutely fine, and it will do so on pretty much all machines.\nThe sound is limited to ambient sounds and some background music, but it does help you focus on what's going on in the story.\nGameplay wise, apart from the multiple choices, you also have to manage your budget, plan your trip to the next city, buy and sell items (some of which help you during challenging weather conditions), keep Fogg alive and, of course, make it back to London within 80 days (although the game does not end if you fail to do so, you always make it there eventually).\n80 Days is not too difficult (as far as I've seen there's no true failure state), but it does offer a challenge in the form of indirect multiplayer with other Passepartous around the world.\nThe game is both turn-based and real-time: the hours of the day pass by as you wait, but you have to take some set routes from one city to the other.\nOverall, I really enjoyed this game and I'm probably going to buy anything Inkle makes if the quality remains this high.\nSorcery, their other narrative-driven game series, is also really good, so if you enjoyed 80 days you'll most likely love that one as well.", "timestamp_created": 1471290344, "timestamp_updated": 1471290344, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.591390", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24936996": {"recommendationid": "24936996", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105044513", "num_games_owned": 170, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 53, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471278008}, "language": "english", "review": "its an ok game, but when it says in the description \"race against other players\" dont beleive it, the game is solely single player and it is a choice based story, there is no multiplayer on the game.\n\nbut as i said it is an ok game, if your looking for a game to simply relax with that isnt very challenging, this is probably your game but personally im not a fan of it.", "timestamp_created": 1471278208, "timestamp_updated": 1471278208, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478977", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24809014": {"recommendationid": "24809014", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118133182", "num_games_owned": 211, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512935157}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u0445\u0430\u043b\u0441\u044f \u043f\u043e \u0422\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441-\u0421\u0438\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u041c\u0430\u0433\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0438;

The world was fashionable and entertaining and retained that incredibly important feeling of adventure.\nI found glee in both being a good valet, and a bad valet, I found myself both sympathetic to forign governments with their armies of machine men and to the revolution in the heart of a woman found in the snow, nearly dying. \nYou get to have really divisive moments where you can choose to show your humanity or retain the steely veneer of a professional Valet. \nThis is a game I would let my kid play to not only allow them an understanding of geography & risk-taking but to give them an understanding of the scope of our world. This is a great, game, maybe not Game of the Year, but a damn good game to sit down and feel the wind in your hair and rekindle the sense of passion one would feel from travel.\n", "timestamp_created": 1470205170, "timestamp_updated": 1470205170, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24673384": {"recommendationid": "24673384", "author": {"steamid": "76561198169876730", "num_games_owned": 288, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 2804, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470748150}, "language": "english", "review": "A great game for something I picked up cheaply as part of a Humble Bundle.

Better suited/designed for mobile/handheld but works fine on PC.\n\nYou start in London and then slowly make your way east through a variety of cities. It seems like each of the many cities are uniquely described and you often meet interesting personalities who can hinder or help your progress.\n\nThere is a steampunk aspect to it (a lot of mechanical contraptions, robots/androids, artificers' guilds) and alternate history type of things that clearly distinguish this world from the real history. So the most education you'll get is geography (learning where cities are located), the rest is flavored/inspired by the real world but not something you should take seriously.\n\nMy favorite part of the game was finding and dealing with the events that occurred. Sometimes events can have different outcomes when you bring items from previous locations (like the Artificer's Medallion).\n\nYou have four options in most (but not all) cities: Market, Bank, Explore, and Sleep/Depart. The Market is where you buy and sell items. The Bank is where you can withdraw money after waiting a period of time. Explore is used to find routes out of the city. Sleep/Depart is to move to the next day or view routes out of the city.\n\nItems come in four varieties: Travel items to keep Fogg in good shape while travelling under certain conditions, Conversation items that allow you to ask more questions about routes, Commodity items that sell well in certain cities, and Route Maps that show available routes in a region.\n\nYou have three options that can appear during travel: News/Wait, Converse, and Attend. News brings up a one-line headline on world events that usually doesn't affect travel. Converse is where you talk to learn about routes and destinations and use Conversation items. Attend raises Fogg's satisfaction with your service and his health by a few points.\n\nSome other notes:[list][*]Travelling uses only city names (no country/region) so you might want to have wikipedia/google open to refer to unfamiliar cities.\n[*]Feels nice to see your route and spin the globe around at the end.[/list]\n\nWorth a look if you enjoy VNs/text-based adventure games.", "timestamp_created": 1468635708, "timestamp_updated": 1468635708, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24307475": {"recommendationid": "24307475", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156373372", "num_games_owned": 647, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 572, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480399393}, "language": "english", "review": "Quite simply a diabolically good game!

Set in a steampunk 1700s (?) world, in which the artificers guild has amazing contraptions that can help you get around the world, you play Passeporteau (spelling?), the French serving man to a wealthy English gentleman. He made a twenty-thousand pound bet that he could get around the world in 80 days, and it's you're job to accomplish that.\n\nYou can go just about any way you like, through just about any cities you desire, in your attempt to race around the globe. You have to manage your money, and your Monseur's health, in order to complete the trip. Buy and sell goods to keep the income flowing, or visit a bank, and never look back. The artwork is fantastic and the music is simple and charming.\n\nThe one thing I really didn't like about this game was the... what's the word. Dialogue? Monologue? Thought processes?\nI don't know what to label it. The game is told past tense, through the Diary of Passeporteau. By selecting his conversation options/choices in the diary, you tell the story that is told in the Diary. A very interesting and fun mechanic. However, You play as the servant and only the servant, and you directly make all the decisions in the game, yet there are several points in the game where it directly contradicts this. For example, if attempting to go to the North Pole, you'll ask your Monseur why he wants to go there, and he'll say that that was the plan all along. Despite the fact that YOU (as Passeporteau) made the decision to go north.\n\nOverall, though, it does not detract from the enjoyment of the game.\n\n9/10 - Would play again (already have played 4 times.)", "timestamp_created": 1467765134, "timestamp_updated": 1467765134, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24112639": {"recommendationid": "24112639", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058024225", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 164, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467735089}, "language": "english", "review": "Very enjoyable, short game.

The idea is you are playing through Jules Verne's book Around the World in 80 Days, but as Phineas Fogg's valet, which is an odd choice but not bad. You choose routes from city to city, hopping or crawling your way across the various continents. If you make it back in 80 days, well, I don't know because I didn't make it either time. If you don't, the game rather lamely laments and starts you over again. \n\nThe first playthrough was fine. I made obvious mistakes, but did well on money. I narrowly missed the 80 day mark (arriving in around 86 days), but I saw it coming and understood based on some of the circuitous routes I ended up taking in pursuit of good market deals. The narrative was fine, and I was kidnapped and narrowly escaped cholera and packed all sorts of guns across America. \n\nThe second playthrough was aggravating to the extreme. I remedied the errors of routing I had made before, and so made excellent time across Asia. Then I was stopped at the Pacific coast, as each city I came to gave me routes only to other Asian cities, effectively halting any progress westward. I went from Vladistok to Yukohama to Pyongyang to Manila, finally losing a week for a bank withdrawal (having lost my money idly wandering), another week to cholera, and then finally managed to get to Honolulu, broke and nearly dead. \n\nI recovered in America, made good sales, recouped my money, made good time to Chicago, then suddenly had the same problem. No routes across the Atlantic. Chicago to Atlanta to MIami to Port Royal to Port-Au-Prince, and tere stopped, broke and in cities without banks, so my only option was to return to Washington. I had lost nearly 40 of my 80 days with unavoidable game circumstances, making what should otherwise have been a sure thing impossible. Frustrated and finished, I closed the game and uninstalled it. \n\nIf it were a game of better money balancing vs. route planning, I would support it more. But bad luck or dead-end routes have little appeal. Also, I would prefer if the rather tiresome interruptions would serve to give more real histories, rather than the fantasy stories it presents. \n\n5/10", "timestamp_created": 1466726071, "timestamp_updated": 1466726071, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.387870", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23735076": {"recommendationid": "23735076", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040720048", "num_games_owned": 294, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 200, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466714102}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm not surprised at how much I enjoyed this game.

Nel gioco rappresenteremo il maggiordomo Passepartout, con l'obiettivo di riuscire a compiere il tragitto in meno dei fatidici 80 giorni della scommessa. Dovremo gestire il denaro e cercare di non finire a secco, grazie a piccole compravendite o prestiti ottenuti dalle banche. Il tempo scorre sempre e dovremo quindi pensare alle tratte migliori, ma che non costino troppo, valutare quando fermarci, se dormire in albergo o sotto le stelle, se aspettare l'apertura del mercato o il prossimo treno, piuttosto che partire prima con una carovana di nomadi mongoli. Un'altra caratteristica da tenere sempre sotto controllo \u00e8 la salute del nostro Phileas Fogg, che patir\u00e0 parecchio le tratte pesanti e potrebbe ammalarsi o addirittura (ma molto difficilmente) morire.\nLa componente molto interessante del gioco \u00e8 data dalla narrazione e dai numerosissimi eventi che possono succedere nelle partite, in base alle decisioni compiute nelle tappe precedenti. Nella mia prima partita, per esempio, sono stato rapito da una setta in India, per poi precipitare con un dirigibile al largo di Singapore e sconfiggere un pugile in un match a New Orleans nella seconda run, invece, ho incontrato una principessa mongola sulla transiberiana, per poi ritrovarla in Mongolia, quindi essere arrestato alle Hawaii e partecipare ad un viaggio fotografico tra Per\u00f9 e Brasile, concludendo poi a Londra, dove ho ritrovato la principessa mongola con tanto di proposta di matrimonio. L'ultimo viaggio che ho fatto per\u00f2 \u00e8 stato il pi\u00f9 fantasioso: mi sono ritrovato invischiato in un viaggio verso il Polo Nord, durante il quale purtroppo Phileas Fogg \u00e8 morto e l'avventura ha preso tutta un'altra direzione.\nCome potete vedere si tratta di un gioco davvero sempre differente, in base a piccole decisioni prese durante le tappe, questo garantisce anche una buona rigiocabilit\u00e0, nell'intenzione di scoprire nuove citt\u00e0, percorrere nuovi tragitti, incontrare nuove persone. I numerosi achievement sono spesso collegati ad alcuni eventi che possono succedere durante il viaggio, non esistono quasi per nulla guide su internet, quindi riuscire a sbloccarli \u00e8 una vera e propria avventura a s\u00e9.\nL'unica pecca \u00e8 che il gioco \u00e8 in inglese e, data la presenza di numerosissimi brani scritti di narrazione, se non lo conoscete bene, perde tutto il suo fascino.", "timestamp_created": 1466156833, "timestamp_updated": 1466156833, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512789", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23607127": {"recommendationid": "23607127", "author": {"steamid": "76561198234138956", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 580, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494997743}, "language": "english", "review": "Surprisingly fun!

I liked the fact that there were so many female characters to encounter on the voyage, though I did find a few characters to be sadly stereotypical (though this isn't unexpected in a period adventure from 1872 even given the alternative travel methods available in these adventures).\n\nI look forward to my next playthrough and just exactly what my character will encounter or experience!

As the Bundle's title suggests, I purchased six story based games (my favorite type of games). I had always seen advertisements for this game both on Steam and on the App Store. I decided to forego reading any reviews until at first experiencing the game. 3.1 hours in and I completed my first 80 days, I must say this is probably one of the most replayable games I have played. I am eager to try out many different scenarios, including attempting traveling the globe beginning east, as opposed to the west. I want to give out as little as possible, as this game must be experienced, however the objective of the game is to go around the world in 80 Days (beginning in London) with your master Monsieur Fogg. After this, everything is up to you!\n\nAfter my first playthrough, I already miss the characters Monsieur Fogg and Passepartout. The writing is intelligent and there are always twists and turns happening in the game to keep one engaged. There are so many cities to visit! You have the option to visit over 200 cities, and the time crunch to get back to London was thrilling. Another option is try to go around the world visiting the least amount of cities. There are so many hidden gems in this game I have yet to explore but cannot wait to! I am absolutely loving this game so far and would've gladly paid full price.

This game does take heavy inspiration from the Jules Verne novel but adds it's own unique twist and spins a narrative around your actions that is VERY compelling.\n\nYou start as Passepartout, the valet of Phineas Fogg who has just made a wager where he must travel around the world in 80 days. As the valet, you must plan your travels across the major cities on the globe and ensure you meet the goal and win the bet for your master. You must decide upon your mode of transport from one city to the next, manage your finances, go to markets and buy and sell goods which will fetch you some profit with which to pay for passage to the next city. You will face many situations and forced to make choices along the way which shape the narrative of the game.\n\nWhat sets this game apart is it's one of the first games I have played which is narratively focused where your actions will ACTUALLY AFFECT THE OUTCOME. As enjoyable as the Walking Dead series by Telltale games is I never feel as if any of my choices leading up to the end ever mattered leaving me only with a binary choice of some meager description. This game is so refreshing in it's beautifully written world which changes as you make choices along the journey and in the cities you visit. The way you interact with people you talk to, the decisions you make, the items you buy, the paths you take, every single one of them shapes how your journey goes and whether you actually return to London, the city from where you begin this epic tale, on time to win the wager for Phineas. There are also so many references to the original which are done brilliantly yet subtly which I absolutely loved.\n\nFor all the praises I have been singing about this game, truly there is but one, though enormous, demerit to this game. One that would almost make me not recommend the game. For all this amazing story-telling along the way, what they give you at the end of the journey as a \"journal\" of your travels is so pathetically sparse and idiotic in it's presentation that I almost don't feel like playing it again. What happened to the grand tales of my fight on a train, my almost missing a boat, my meeting the owner of a freight company and other such amazing little stories? All they show you are logs of what happened and the date AND THAT'S IT!\n\nIf it weren't for the pure joy of seeing your journey unfold before your very eyes and the amazing number of branched paths that are possible and events that you may face which I very much look forward to finding, I would have completely stopped playing yet I find myself wanting more. I want to experience that thrill of exploring and finding people, nooks and crannies that show me new things along the way.

You must juggle departure times, funds, and your luggagge if you hope to make it back to London in time to win the wager, and even when you think you've got the perfect route, accidents can happen occur along the way.\n\nI bought 80 Days as part of the Narrative Humble Bundle, so I didn't pay full price for it, but I think it's probably worth its retail price--there's a lot of replayability in this game, as you're never going to be able to visit every city AND make it back to London in time, so you have to prioritise different tasks in different playthroughs. But I think there's more than enough content, particularly as you get to choose different responses and thus provoke different outcomes to the situations you and Fogg find yourselves in.\n\nMy only complaint, really, is that the game will show you other players' progress as you're playing, which isn't particularly obtrusive but I found it kind of distracting, and I can't find a way to turn this off in the game settings.\n\nNonetheless, I fully recommend 80 Days! It's a lot of fun if you like choose-your-own adventure-style text games, and it's a lovely new take on Jules Verne's original novel, with a whole host of secondary characters. The game also feels very progressive in the right places--a lot of female characters, particularly women of colour, play prominent roles within the side stories in positions of power or academia, and there is at least one storyline where you, as a male character, can kiss another man.", "timestamp_created": 1464975872, "timestamp_updated": 1464975872, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.630012", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23361709": {"recommendationid": "23361709", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048284995", "num_games_owned": 255, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 560, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458349737}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is one of my top recommendations to people. If you want a game that will tell you amazing stories, this is it. It also does a fantastic job of making you feel like you're on a journey as you only see snipets of characters' lives before you are whisked away. The writing is superb and the simple presentation encourages your imagination to run wild.\n\nGameplay-wise it's very simple. It's most like a visual novel with some very simple time, inventory, and money management to push you along.\n\nRepresentation-wise this game is also fantastic. The world is a crazy steampunk Victorian era. Half the drivers, captains, and pilots as well as incidental characters are women. The racial diversity is also plentiful, as one would hope of a game about traveling around the world. Additionally, half the romance options are female and half are male.\nIf you're turned off by all this SJW crap, you should play the game anyway. It all works in service of building a unique and varied world that's not just entirely populated by white men with brown hair and giving you a sense of the rich tapestry of people that inhabit the entire world.\n\nOverall, you should absolutely pick this game up. It can get a bit repetitive as you repeat travel routes and stories multiple times, but it's not so much that it's a deal breaker.

In some ways I don't like to mention it. It was a heart-stopping moment of my adventure. Less than 24 hours from London and my literally world collapsed. I found myself back on the desktop, the game had crashed! Were my 78 days of travelling going to end so ignominously? With a shaking hand I at last found the courage to click on the button that would bring things back to life. Perhaps, just perhaps, there'd be an autosave that meant I'd only have lost a day or two of my trip. In all my excitement it had certainly never occured to me to make any form of manual bookmark.\n\nI needn't have worried, the creators in their wisdom had tracked my progress right down to the moment I'd made the ill-advised visit to the market. I was back at the hotel, all my bags were where they should be and my master was waiting for me. In my relief, I abandoned any thought of making a last-minute deal in the markets of Lisbon and hurried aboard that last airship to London.\n\nSomehow I (or maybe that should be we) made it, with almost two days to spare and money in our pockets at that!", "timestamp_created": 1464848117, "timestamp_updated": 1464848117, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23338792": {"recommendationid": "23338792", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997673144", "num_games_owned": 201, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1819, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519776917}, "language": "english", "review": "Got this as part of a bundle for another game I wanted, and it's been an extremely pleasant surprise.

This immensely dialogue rich game immerses the player in a world (with a little imagination) not too dissimilar from our own. Set in the 1872 it explores not only the geological but plunges into the philosophical and ethical as you converse with people around the world in every country. \n\nWhile the visual aspect of this game belies it's touch-screen origins it did not detract from the overall aesthetics as the vector heavy, high contrast, less-is-more approach to the graphic content more than made up for this very slight shortfall. 9/10\n\nThe audio is palatable for a few hours as it assists in immersing the player into the world it offers, however, depending on your sensibilities, it may take a single playthrough to notice the looped tracks. Personally I played through twice before switching to my own playlist. I can appreciate the attention to detail of the composition of these tracks and how they seem to draw the player ever along on their global trek changing slightly to befit the corresponding country. 6/10\n\nThis game has a ridiculously high replay value and I relished the opportunity to play through again and again as not only did I want to explore and discover the seemingly limitless paths spurring me on to London but also to follow in my footprints yet again to uncover a conversation I had missed or a city I had passed on a rail journey of which we did not disembark to explore. 9/10\n\nRegarding gameplay I cannot speak highly enough. It was refreshing to play a character that you could flirt with two young ladies leaving France for a holiday, or have a romantic interlude with the muscular captain of an ice-walker. The dialogue and response options were also a breath of fresh air, this character could have shortcomings or may have a grandiose personality, or a penchant for mischief. Being able to choose your character's personality as you go really made it a giddy experience and a reminder that even if you try your hardest you can still fail; which is just another one of the positive aspects of this game. While I did found the audio a little repetitive, the immersiveness, replay value and relaxing aesthetics make this a game I shall continue to enjoy for many more hours to come. 10/10\n\nOverall I love this game for many reasons. From the simple and elegant visuals, the rich story, the depth of the dialogue through to the gameplay and replay value. 9/10\n\nTL;DR: \nAudio 6/10\nGraphics 9/10\nReplay Value 9/10\nGameplay 10/10\nOverall 9/10 - would happily repack luggage again and again and again...\n", "timestamp_created": 1463463209, "timestamp_updated": 1463463209, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.606668", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22996111": {"recommendationid": "22996111", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037619790", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 493, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517044936}, "language": "german", "review": "F\u00fcr Fans von Jules Vernes ein MUST", "timestamp_created": 1463306338, "timestamp_updated": 1463306338, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22745714": {"recommendationid": "22745714", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046222380", "num_games_owned": 364, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 1164, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462622594}, "language": "english", "review": "Pleasant, relaxing, very emotional", "timestamp_created": 1462119129, "timestamp_updated": 1462186349, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493858", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22663953": {"recommendationid": "22663953", "author": {"steamid": "76561198230285872", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 603, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488828296}, "language": "english", "review": "This is my first review for a game, because I felt the need to share the love.

Too bad, play again.\n\nHow could you not realise that to finish the Mongolian plot you needed to travel between two particular cities in South America, in order to meet someone who'd never previously been mentioned?

hint of how to bring the tale to the surface.\n\nIf it was a hardcore action game I could deal with an abrupt story end.\n\nBut '80 Days' ends up feeling like you were halfway through a book, when

bought it on sale along with a bunch of other games, didn't get around to it for a couple of months. I was curious and wanted to try it, but the screenshots made me a little reluctant. Honestly going into it, I thought it was going to be a linear, pre-plotted course. I thought the decisions would be in the dialogue, where occasionally you might give advice regarding the next destination.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised. You get to choose the course entirely, also each time you play (or at least every time I've played) the seed changes. I'm not even sure what all that changes, all I know is I've plotted a different course every time I played and each time offered quite a different journey. This game is a lot of fun and really rich with adventure. I did not expect the replayability to be so high, but it truly is great. I've gone on four runs, so far.\n\nOn my first run, I was still familiarizing myself with the game and made some poor decisions. We were late, and made it back to London in 90 days (I got stuck in Africa, my only way out was an airship full of people mad at me for riding in on a slaver ship, I had to spend a week and a half begging for money to afford the venture). I was pleased to discover that even once you pass the 80 day mark, you still plot your way home as normal, there's no instant YOU LOSE screen or anything.\n\nOn my second run, armed with my new knowledge of how the game works, I pulled off a round-the-world trip in only 60 days! Huzzah!\n\nOn my third run, I believe was my trip north, I made it in 50 days. That was quite adventurous.\n\nMy most recent run I did not break my record or anything, it was 60-70 days and I took over a ship, beat a champion boxer, and came home with $10,000, and my peak during our trip was $17,000.

It tells the story of Phileas Fogg, who takes a bet to circle the world in 80 days, starting from London in October of 1872. You play as Passepartout, Fogg's new valet, who assists him on his journey. That is where the similarities end, though. The story takes place in an alternate history 1872, in a world full of fantastical technology such as automatons, underwater trains, flying machines, and even mechanical camels, but it's also very aware of contemporary political and cultural struggles.\n\nThe game part of this game comes in planning out your journey, trying to find the quickest path, managing your funds, and negotiating for lower ticket prices, seats on trains or zeppelins or submarines. BUT ALSO, you talk to people in the cities you travel to, witnessing or becoming part of the stories. For example, one path gets you involved in an Agatha Christie style murder mystery that you can try to solve. In my first game, I got arrested, organized a mutiny, accidentally blew up a boat, and lost a boxing match and still managed to get back to London JUST UNDER the time limit at 78 days.\n\nThe writing in this game is fantastic. It's a wonderful adventure, full of surprises and thrills and even heartbreak. Everywhere I went, I encountered people who touched the character's heart in unexpected ways. But I had to leave them behind, because the game is focused on the challenge. You're always moving forward, leaving things behind.\n\nAnd the game also explores themes of anti-colonialism, unique cultures and how varied the cultures of the world are, as well as celebrating a diverse cast of adventurers, inventors, and even criminals (in my game, I had a romantic tryst with a woman who was an internationally wanted thief and cardsharp). All manner of people are represented and from my admittedly white perspective, it represents the world cultures in a way that is not exoticized.\n\nThe world is realized so well. The beautiful art is simple and evocative. The historical events represented are all affected by the game's fantastic steampunk-ish world, and your characters are not the focus of the world, just participants in it.\n\nAt it's core, it's an incredibly complex choose-your-own-adventure story, with hundreds of branching paths and possible narratives. There are 170 cities in the world you can visit, and in a single playthrough, you might visit 20, and depending on your choices, you might only see one possible part of the stories present in that city. Discussing this game with my girlfriend, my mind began spiraling from the possibilities of this story. And all of these possibilities are elegantly tied together with the focus on your goal and your relationship with Fogg as you go on this journey together.\n\nThis is a wonderful, beautiful game, and I'm certainly not the first person to see this; it won Time Magazine's Game Of The Year in 2014, and it was even nominated for 4 BAFTA awards.

I'm hesitant to use the word steampunk, but the tech definitely seems to follow some of those tropes. Not to say that the tech is the focus; the game does a wonderful job of painting exotic locales around the world that are made all the more fantastic by this amazingly advanced technology akin to magic.\n\nBased off of Around the World in 80 days, you play as the valet to a rich man who has taken a wager to travel the globe in 80 days. To do this you must not only plan your route using major cities as little event nodes in which small, choose your own adventure vignettes take place, but also must keep your prim and proper master in immaculate condition.\n\nOr not. It is a choose your own adventure game after all! Your valet can be anywhere from a Batman-esque Alfred super butler to a brusque racist who cares little for these exotic cultures and even less for your pompous master (although if your master's condition drops too low I'm assuming you lose the game; I wouldn't know, I had to much fun being an Alfred type).\n\nThe game has loads of replayability as not only can you see your past routes but also the routes of other players. However, I did feel it was a bit short, and the events in each city node don't seem to have much variation, so once you explore them all, which will take a while, you wont have much left to do except try to speedrun the game and maximize your effeciency.\n\nThe atmosphere carries this game.

Con multitud de rutas y opciones posibles los desarrolladores nos ponen bajo la piel de Passepartout, el criado de la c\u00e9lebre obra de Julio Verne que tendr\u00e1 que cuidar de su se\u00f1or y viajar en todo tipo de extravagantes aparatos.\n\n80 days cuenta desde los \u00faltimos meses del pasado a\u00f1o con versi\u00f3n en PC, adem\u00e1s de Android e iOS. Esto marca una clara l\u00ednea de expansi\u00f3n que van a seguir otros t\u00edtulos y que pretende dar a conocer al gran p\u00fablico las interesantes propuestas de esta desarrolladora indie.\n\nEl t\u00edtulo es lo m\u00e1s parecido a vivir dentro de una novela pero con una particularidad que lo hace a\u00fan m\u00e1s interesante: la posibilidad de elegir y dirigir nuestro propio destino. Las elecciones que llevemos a cabo con Passepartout van desde la ruta a seguir a los comportamientos que adoptemos, los cuales definir\u00e1n nuestra personalidad a lo largo del juego.\n\n80 days tiene unas mec\u00e1nicas de juego muy sencillas, asumibles para cualquier tipo de jugador, y un objetivo claro, viajar lo m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido posible. El manejo se limita a seleccionar opciones y rutas disponibles, que vamos descubriendo a lo largo de nuestro viaje.\n\nEn cada ciudad hay varios elementos comunes que se repiten: la posibilidad de pasar la noche en un hotel, invertir horas en la exploraci\u00f3n, acudir al banco o comprar y vender cosas en el mercado. Aunque el objetivo para completar el juego est\u00e1 muy claro y no hay un gran elenco de opciones para llevar a cabo en las ciudades, decidir en qu\u00e9 invertir el tiempo es una cuesti\u00f3n primordial y m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil de gestionar de lo que puede parecer en un principio.\n\nTambi\u00e9n tenemos que tener en cuenta los fondos de los que disponemos, que pueden ser ampliados de diferentes formas: sac\u00e1ndolos del banco pero perdiendo uno o varios d\u00edas en este proceso, o bien a trav\u00e9s de la compraventa de mercanc\u00edas, la opci\u00f3n m\u00e1s rentable y para la que necesitaremos conocer y planificar nuestra ruta. Esta \u00faltima opci\u00f3n se basa en conocer en qu\u00e9 ciudades podemos vender mercanc\u00edas a un precio mayor, a trav\u00e9s de lo cual se puede conseguir una buena cantidad de dinero.\n\nLigado a los fondos est\u00e1 la gesti\u00f3n del inventario, fundamental para viajar de forma eficiente y sin realizar demasiados gastos. Adem\u00e1s de servirnos para transportar bienes, en los maletines podemos almacenar algunos objetos que har\u00e1n nuestro viaje m\u00e1s placentero y menos da\u00f1ino a la salud, o que nos permitan ganar ventajas como la de adelantar la salida de algunos medios de transporte sin coste adicional.\n\nA lo largo de nuestros viajes suceder\u00e1n una serie de eventos en los que tendremos que elegir entre diferentes opciones. Estos, como ya hemos dicho, definir\u00e1n nuestra personalidad, pero tambi\u00e9n influir\u00e1n en el propio viaje. Una determinada elecci\u00f3n puede provocar que nuestro viaje se atrase o adelante, que descubramos informaci\u00f3n interesante sobre ciudades y rutas que las unen, compromisos con otros personajes o da\u00f1os para el Monsieur Fogg.\nLa salud de Fogg es otro de los aspectos de los que tendremos que estar pendientes, ya que si descuidamos este aspecto puede llegar a morir. Nuestro se\u00f1or perder\u00e1 salud con los viajes (hay algunas formas, con determinados objetos, de mitigar el da\u00f1o recibido) y tendremos que recuperarla descansando, afeit\u00e1ndolo y ase\u00e1ndolo.\n\nEl tono literario y narrativo lo convierten en un reclamo importante para aquellos que disfrutan con un buen relato, por lo que aunque estrictamente no se trate de un RPG, es id\u00f3neo para aquellos que disfrutan con este g\u00e9nero. No obstante su vertiente literaria tiene un h\u00e1ndicap, la ausencia de una traducci\u00f3n al castellano. Esto provoca que incluso usuarios con un cierto nivel de ingl\u00e9s tengan que detenerse para llegar a comprender el significado de algunas palabras.\n\nLa ambientaci\u00f3n tambi\u00e9n dota al relato de originalidad. Adem\u00e1s de aparecer algunos de los inventos que relata Verne, aparecen otros muchos, con un estilo steampunk. Hay una gran variedad de inventos, en los que nos montaremos y disfrutaremos del magn\u00edfico trabajo art\u00edstico del que goza el juego. La ambientaci\u00f3n gr\u00e1fica se ve acompa\u00f1ada de una magn\u00edfica banda sonora que har\u00e1 todav\u00eda m\u00e1s entretenida la experiencia de viajar alrededor del mundo.\n\nEn definitiva, 80 days aporta frescura a todo el g\u00e9nero de los videojuegos. Al igual que hizo en Android e iOS, ahora con su expansi\u00f3n al mundo del PC Inkle gana un p\u00fablico potencial mucho mayor. 80 days nos ofrece disfrutar de una adaptaci\u00f3n libre y plagada de elecciones de un cl\u00e1sico de la literatura.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxT0Zki7Xqg", "timestamp_created": 1453458015, "timestamp_updated": 1453458075, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568176", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20675162": {"recommendationid": "20675162", "author": {"steamid": "76561198149206745", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 78, "playtime_forever": 2179, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 46, "last_played": 1521635282}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] BUY IT NOW [/h1]\n\n[b] This game is the best book on Steam.

You play the trusty valet/sidekick Passpartout, charged with getting your gentleman master Phileas Fogg safely around the planet on time and on budget, no matter what the world throws at you in terms of surprises. That said, some of the greatest adventures are not along the more direct or traditional Foggish route, and there are loads of little encounters with historical figures of the era as well, be they inventors, poets or adventurers. It can take a while to sort of the real people from the fictious ones.\n\nThe writing in this game is superb, and the many potential paths - some of which take a while to unlock or riddle out - offer great replay value. Going the [i]same[/i] route won't likely be as appealing, as the story of each city or travel path is largely identical with each gameplay (there are factors that alter dialogue options, such as items in your inventory, past choices, and Passpartout's valeting skill) - but with the possible exception of Paris, you'll still have so much choice of where to go that this potential repeat has little consequence in your first few dozen playthroughs.\n\nThe only negative thing I can say about the game is that you cannot pause the clock (if it's running - it stops whenever there is something to read). This can make you miss vital connections because you suddenly realize you have too many bags of luggage when you attempt to depart, and by the time you've thrown surplus items away, the ship has sailed without you. Quite vexing, if you paid the captain thousands of pounds the night before to sail a few days early. :-p\n\nYou do not want to be a packrat in this game; travel light - the world is large and is begging to be explored.

A different choice of response can take you down a totally different path, opening and closing story options.\n\nMy only caution is, your character, Passepartout, has opportunities for romance with various people you meet along the way,  both male and female, which may be confronting for some people.

This is Gamer Guy (In a Suit) from the Echo Army YouTube channel! Today I am bringing you a review of the Indie Adventure/CYOA 80 Days. 80 Days was released on Steam on September 28, 2015 by Developer Cape Guy ltd. and Developer/Publisher Inkle Ltd. \n\n(NOTE: This game was NOT reviewed using a key provided by the Developer and/or Publisher, it was a game I purchased for my own account)\n\nVideo Review: \n\nhttps://youtu.be/IPMhq2I5ReU\n\nThe \"Too Long, Didn't Watch\" Review:\n\nAround the world in 80 Days, the novel. Fully playable, very Steampunk.\n5/5 DO NOT MISS THIS ONE!\n\nThe \"Meat & Potatoes\" Review:\n\n80 Days is, simply put, an absolute treat! This has easily become one of my favorite games as of late. WHat it is is a re-imagining of sorts of Jules Vene's classic \"Around the World in 80 Days\". Your master, upon accpetance of a wager, intends on circling the globe in under 80 days. You are his Valet and are in charge of not only caring for you masters well being, but planning his route. Along your journey you will engage in buying and selling goods from various markets to balance your funds (and to make your journey easier at times!). Another key component to the gameplay is the conversations. You must explore and converse as much as possible in order to find and open up new routes to facilitate your journey. Then, you must pick and choose carefully which of these routes you will take. The entire game is built around the CYOA mechanic, as you read through the incredibly well written dialogue you must make choices as to which direction the story takes as well. All in all, the writing is superb and the art and sounds are very, very beautiful. It is no wonder that Time Magazine gave it Game of the Year status for 2014. THis is also available on mobile devices, but the Steam version is well worth it. 5/5 and easily worth $10.\n\nHappy Gaming!\n", "timestamp_created": 1451762645, "timestamp_updated": 1451762645, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527952", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20213360": {"recommendationid": "20213360", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161768342", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1314, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494257145}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc601\uc5b4\ub97c \uc870\uae08 \ud558\uba74 \uc815\ub9d0 \uc7ac\ubbf8\uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0ac\uc804 \ucc3e\uc73c\uba74\uc11c \ud55c\ub2e4 \ud574\ub3c4  \uafc0\uc7bc. \ucee8\ud2b8\ub864\uc5d0 \uc870\uae08 \uc57d\ud558\uace0 \uae4a\uc740 \uc774\uc57c\uae30\ub97c \uc88b\uc544\ud558\uc2dc\ub294 \ubd84\uc774\ub77c\uba74 \uac15\ub825 \ucd94\ucc9c", "timestamp_created": 1451734978, "timestamp_updated": 1451734978, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20196357": {"recommendationid": "20196357", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023852028", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 8218, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467857108}, "language": "english", "review": "Just did my first walktrough around the north pole, gf was mad because I was stitched to my scren, 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1451689082, "timestamp_updated": 1451689082, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.463287", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20194499": {"recommendationid": "20194499", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042522168", "num_games_owned": 686, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451685177}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good game that took around 2 hours to beat but can be replayed many times", "timestamp_created": 1451685292, "timestamp_updated": 1451685292, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20194289": {"recommendationid": "20194289", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023306905", "num_games_owned": 945, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483568395}, "language": "english", "review": "A wonderful little take on the classic novel.

The game is an adaption of the classic Jules Verne novel about consummate British gentleman Phileas Fogg and his wager to circumnavigate the world in 80 Days, and does its own spin on it by adding steampunk. Now steampunk is usually squandered into just being greasy nerds covering themselves in gears and talking in bad British accents instead of actually exploring the punk part of the term, but 80 Days uses the trappings very effectively, adding on to the feelings of wonder and adventure as well as actually exploring the social and economic impact of such inventions like dealing with how they interact with the ills of the Victorian Era, but also the hope for a brighter future such innovations could bring as well. The world of 80 Days is also an interesting a mix of real history such as France still recovering from their humiliating defeat in the Franco-Prussian War that led to the unification of Germany and alt history such as the Zulu being a rising world power that successfully repelled British invasion. You play as Fogg\u2019s valet, Jean Passepartout, and gameplay is strategizing your money and supplies as well as making choices to learn more about possible routes, win people to your side, and improve relations with Fogg, among other things. This game is dense as hell and there are so many places to go and people to meet on your journey that you will definitely miss out on a lot in just one playthrough.\n\nOverall it\u2019s a really engaging experience and to just give a more detailed example, in my first playthrough I took a northern route cutting through the Baltic and going overland through Russia. Hijinks along the way included getting caught in a battle between Communist rebels and the Czar\u2019s mech-pilot soldiers in St. Petersburg, getting chucked off the Siberian Express in the ass-end of Siberia after inadvertently deep sixing a young romance, getting waylaid to Beijing and seeing a Chinese opera performed by robots, delivering the captain\u2019s baby on a boat from Honolulu to San Fran and running into a gang of Chicago hooligans that lifted houses off their foundations with their machines if they didn\u2019t get paid protection money. With less than a week left and finding myself in New York, I sold all our stuff to take a rocket sub to Iceland, and after that finally made the worldwide journey back to London\u202682 days later.\n \nBut in the end it didn\u2019t feel like a failure, it kind of felt like a fitting ending. Fogg and Passepartout didn\u2019t make it, but close enough to still make it impressive, and their whole journey was a grand adventure and the two became close friends by the end of it. My two subsequent playthroughs were much more successful and were unique adventures of their own, such as solving a murder and going down the Amazon. And that\u2019s what 80 Days really succeeds at and deserves the praise it\u2019s gotten, really making you feel you went on an adventure.

You are the servant of a wealthy man who bet that he can make it around the world in 80 days, as the title suggests.\n\nAnd this world is really something.  The whole place is this incredibly realized steampunk alternate future where horses have been replaced by metal horses, and where pirates use airships to plunder over land.  I don't want to give anymore away, those are two early examples of the game's incredibly cool atmosphere.  Some if it is incredibly inventive, at least as someone who doesn't know much steampunk stuff.\n\nAnd the game is, as I said, quite punishing in a fair way.  You can miss an entire day just by missing the departure of your chosen method of travel.  If 3 different methods of transport leave at 1:00 PM and you're still clicking the option to get an extra bag on-board at 12:59, you'll miss the train/ship/car/railroad etc.  It's both frustrating and realistic, seeing as they won't wait around for you all day.\n\nThe game is about managing the options for your travel amid various circumstances which present themselves in the game's choose your own adventure texts.  You go through multiple stages of dialog which can improve your relationship with your master, or with strangers, and perhaps net you items or new information on how to travel to another destination.  \n\nYou have to be wary of your master's health, which decreases over arduous journeys, or he'll die.  You can buy gear which aids traveling over the stressful paths, like desert clothes or storm gear for oceanliners.  Be sure to get items from various cities to sell elsewhere, too, so you can afford transport costs.  There's lots of really funny, interesting things that happen and I've only gotten to day 70 on my first try (I had to restart because I screwed up).  There's an entire northern half of Europe, both North and South America which I've yet to even step foot in.\n\nYou really should get this game, and hopefully many more games like this come about in the future.  It's got great music, the writing is easy to read and not overly wordy (unlike lots of games which bombard you with text and then claim to have \"great writing,\" such as something like Pillars of Eternity).  Even the globe of the game has a color scheme which reinforces the theme.  All the art is very pretty to look at also.\n\nJust an absolute joy to play the game.  The myriad of choice supports multiple playthroughs, though you will doubtless run into some scenarios twice.  You can handle these differently to see what the outcome is though.  The game also reacts to your path and the number of days you have left in a way which seems really impressive; my master was not pleased when I decided to go west after heading northeast because it went against our progress, even though it meant we'd be able to do this quest and get tons of money while boarding the trains more to the south.\n\nDefinitely get this game if you like choose your own adventure style games, and this is a really cool introduction to the genre for people who don't normally play this kind of thing.", "timestamp_created": 1451343001, "timestamp_updated": 1451343001, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20048252": {"recommendationid": "20048252", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011087058", "num_games_owned": 154, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451855410}, "language": "english", "review": "80 Days is simply a very superb game.

This game is quite the exception! 80 Days is a charming \"choose your own story\" type of game in which you take the role of a faithful valet in service to Phineas Fogg, an English gentleman. Fogg has taken a bet, in now so have you! Your goal is to circumnavigate the globe of an alternate history late 19th century world filled with steampunk creations in 80 days or less. I found discovering unique modes of transportation to be an ingenius plot advancement device and I never knew what might come at the next stop. I'd like nothing more than to describe just a few of these fictional vehicles, yet to do so would ruin that sense of discovery that I've enjoyed so far.\n\nSo, aside from managing your master and deciding on your route, you must also balance your books and ensure you have funds to spare. Much of this is done by buying and selling for profit. This is all quite transparent and easy to understand. That is a boon to this title! Simplicity and ease is one of the greatest selling points of 80 Days and I would even recommend it to those who don't regularly play PC games. \n\nI highly recommend this title to just about anyone. Whether it is the exploration, excellent writing and plot or the challenge of the unknown and a strict timetable, this title will not disappoint. That being said, do not expect to win on the first play through. This is a game that is highly replayable, and I would even say that it is a necessity.

Having completed a trip a few times on Android I wanted to give it a go on Windows for the achievements and the comfort of a bigger screen and a mouse. \n\n80 Days follows the story of the wealthy Phileas Fogg and his valet Passepartout. In the game you have to try to travel the world in eighty days (what a surprise!). How you do it is up to the player: will you try and brave the deserts of Arabi or take the long railway through the cold Russian lands? You can make a lot of decisions which make for a unique travel each time you play the game. \n\nWhen you find yourself in cities, you have multiple options to pass the time: find banks to transfer money from London, visit markets to buy and sell items to help funding the trip or to ease the harsh travelconditions. You can also explore each city to find new travel methods and interesting stories about the city you're in. Each city has a nice story, some longer than the others, which can really add something to the experience or the trip.\n\nWhen travelling stories will present themselves in which you can make choices what to do and what to say. These choices can really matter, so be careful what you choose. You can fall in love, get your airship boarded by pirates, strand at sea with no escape left; there's a lot to explore, discover and experience.\n\nThe world itself is very interesting. It's a futuristic steampunkish world with its own morals and codes. It's a world Jules Verne (the game is based upon his novel) has created and it's really amazing. The developers did a great way to shape the content to be a hommage to Verne.\n\n\nIs this game something for you? If you like cool storylines with a great interactive touch this is something for you.

A literary classic told through fitting music, charming art that while simple never becomes boring and surprisingly deep and involving game mechanics. I was physically unable to stop my journey once it had first begun, and though much of it was played relatively safe there was still plenty of close shaves and action which made the entire experience one of the best adventures I've had in a game in recent memory. Sadly, I did not make the first trip in 80 days, in part due to poor planning but also from being marooned on a small island in the middle of the pacific ocean where Mr. Fogg almost left his senses. I am already excited to start my next playthrough, with so much of the world left to discover I believe it won't be the last one, either.\n\nIf I had to have one complaint, only one, it is that I felt like I experienced an abnormally high amount of female characters compared to male ones. From my start in London, over Paris, Copenhagen, into Russia and across the middle east, East-Asia to New Zealand and into the dark heart of Africa and back into Europe, the amount of male characters I encountered could be counted on one hand (and left me wondering where they all were. Replaced by automatons?). On one hand it was humours, given the game takes places in an (albeit fictional) period of time where women were not often seen in these very male-centric professions, on the other the almost total lack of male characters (and the game at one point describing a grizzled boiler-room engineer as a petite Indian women in a beautiful sari) took a little away from the overall immersion, and I had to wonder if it was intentional or if my route just happened to let me encounter every possible pilot, captain and engineer of the feminine persuasion.

The game places you in its narrative as the valet of Phileas Fogg, a gentleman adventurer propelled onward by a wager to circumnavigate the globe within the titular 80 day period. On this journey you will explore the world's cities as you chart your own course to make it back to London before the clock runs out, balancing Fogg's health and your monetary funds as you plot and trade your way across the world.\n\nAs 80 Days is essentially a text-based game (though it is dressed up quite a bit with an attractive interface and travel graphics reminiscent of the [i]Indiana Jones[/i] movies), its success lives or dies on the quality of its writing - and it manages to live quite large.

Though I'm not usually one to revisit a game like this, I'll certainly be going on another journey soon, as there's just so many different cities to visit, and you could easily play the game many different times before repeating a single step of your journey.

Although it is possible to \"lose\", winning and losing are not really what this is about.\n-This is not a particularly \"fun\" game.  The pacing and story-bound nature of this title don't really lend themselves to instant gratification.  It is far more contemplative than that.\n-This isn't really a \"game\" at all.  As other have mentioned, it is much more a choose-your-own adventure book, heavily steeped in a strange alternate reality that we might call steampunkish, but which is really a close modern approximation of what Jules Verne's imagination produced.  If you don't enjoy reading, steer clear of this one.\n\nWith all that out of the way, I really enjoyed my first play through, and look forward to completing several more.  I think the format of the game lends itself well to multiple replays, as there are numerous routes and methods at your disposal to get from one place to the next, and the time requirement makes visiting more than a handful of locations during a single playthrough difficult. How replayable it is after more than a handful of playthroughs is debatable.  I'd guess that after about 4 or 5 circuits (about 8-10 hours) you'd have exhausted many of the locations and dialogue, and it might start to get a bit stale.  \n\nMy only real gripes are that the interface is slightly wonky for keyboard and mouse, as it was designed for iOS.  I had a hard time figuring out how to get from \"planning\" back to where you could go to the bank, etc while in a city.  Turns out you have to click on the city you're currently in to go back.  Also, it should be noted that on PC this title is 10 bucks, whereas on iOS, it is 5.  I think the experience lends itself better to a tablet as well.  So there's that.  \n\nOverall, if you enjoy books and reading, and especially if you are a Verne fan, you'll likely love this.  If you dislike reading and are looking for action and excitement, you'll probably hate it.

It would seem he is a gambling man.\u201d Orchestral music with a sense of urgency starts up as the globe begins to turn around its axis. Right off the bat, 80 Days gives out an intriguing vibe. The journey begins in London and, as everyone knows, follows the adventures of Phileas Fogg as he attempts to circumnavigate the world in 80 days. In this take of the Jules Verne classic novel Around the World in Eighty Days, Fogg takes a backseat to his French servant Passepartout. Players assume the role of the valet who is in charge of picking the route, handling the funds, baggage, and taking care of Fogg himself.\n\nThe game distances itself from its inspiration even further thanks to its setting. It is still set in the second half of the 19th century, but 80 Days boldly embraces a steampunk theme and an alternate take on history, which simply makes perfect sense. As you travel the world, you will discover strange means of transportation, automatons, and a mysterious guild of creators called the Artificers. There is something interesting to learn about each city, sometimes without ever even going there.\n\n80 Days is designed as a roguelike and it is intended to be played over and over again, discovering new routes, visiting new places, and experiencing a new story. 80 Days is quite an undertaking regarding the storytelling. There are massive amounts of text here with choices at every turn. Even though the choices primarily impact your experience, sometimes they also have more tangible repercussions. For example, your actions might get you imprisoned in Russia or your intended route might get drastically altered after a scuffle in the middle of the ocean. The most remarkable thing about this game is that each playthrough is totally unique thanks to this emergent method of storytelling. You never know what is going to happen next and where you will ultimately end up, which truly contributes so much to the game\u2019s sense of discovery and wonder.\n\nThe writing is interesting and strong throughout. Each part of the trip consist of these lovely mini-stories with unusual and fascinating characters. However, there are also these separate conversations that you can engage in while travelling from point to point and they feel completely different. They are very poorly written and they simply feel completely unnatural. The main purpose of these conversations is to determine new routes and find out information regarding valuable items and trades.\n\nOutside of storyline choices, the gameplay revolves around managing all aspects of the voyage. As Passepartout, you will need to choose the best possible route, taking in mind the price and conditions of each trip. A cheap trip in a run down car or a shanty boat will take its toll on Fogg, lowering his health. He won\u2019t die if his health gets depleted, but he won\u2019t be able to travel any further until he recovers. You can tend to him during travels, or buy items that you can use in order to increase his health points. You can also buy outfit sets. Some sets will nullify negative health points while travelling by train, others will provide bonuses when riding on horseback. Outfits can also help negotiate faster departure times, so that you don\u2019t have to be stuck somewhere for two or more days. Sleeping in hotels instead of the streets with homeless people and dogs will also help keep Fogg\u2019s health up.\n\nGoing around the world costs money. There are several ways of earning enough of it to arrive in London on time. You can take out a loan in a bank, but you will have to wait for the money up to a week \u2013 depending on how much you want to withdraw. A more efficient way is to buy items along the way and then sell them in cities where they are worth much more. However, this approach may take you off your desired route. But it is actually this kind of unpredictability that is most appealing about 80 Days. It should be noted that you don\u2019t really have to make it back to London in 80 days. You can just explore and go wherever you want. My first playthrough took over 100 days. You can play the game in any way you like. You can race the clock and try to beat your best time, or you can simply unwind and just take in the sights.\n\nEven though the game actually gets more interesting on repeated playthroughs as some additional routes and storylines open up, I have also experienced moments of boredom. Certain stretches just feel a bit laborious and dull. I also have to say that the interface is somewhat clunky, especially when you want to do several things in a hurry (visit the market, check your luggage) before your transport departs.\n\nThe game sports a clean art style that is pleasing to the eye. The music is also good, but there is not a lot of variety there. Overall, the production values provide a sufficient amount of atmosphere, but I was left with the impression that more could have been done to give each location a stronger sense of place. For a game that is all about travel and discovery, locations could have had more of an awe-inspiring impact from an audiovisual standpoint.\n\n80 Days is a unique and imaginative game that serves as an apt and worthy homage to its inspiration. It manages to bring so much of its own regarding the storytelling and world-building, and it competently mixes multiple styles of gameplay. This is one grand voyage you should not miss out on.\n\n[h1][b]7 OUT OF 10 (VERY GOOD)[/b][/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1447977012, "timestamp_updated": 1447977012, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496560", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19152696": {"recommendationid": "19152696", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065135383", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1898, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508091571}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is simply magnificent, I cannot recommend it enough.

The conveyances in particular are well rendered, which you may see in the screenshots.  The map itself is very nice.\n+Good ambient sound and music\n+It's a piece of interactive fiction with a story to tell.  There aren't \"wrong\" choices, just different ones.\n+The Phineas Fogg health mechanic is EXCELLENT!  Instead of managing your character's health, you are charged as Mr. Fogg's valet.  You may abuse him or care for him as your whim dictates.\n+The system is relatively intuitive and operates very much as though you had a globe and touch-menu available in your room.  They ported it from iOS or whatever very well.\n+The game autosaves often, which offers an easy way to treat this as a casual game.  I did not mind that I couldn't manually save given the relatively short amount of time it took to play a journey.\n\nCons:\n\n-Every journey (so far for me) starts from London to Paris.\n-Playing through a journey sort of wears out the fun.  Each journey builds toward the triumphant return to London (if you make it!), so for me starting a new trip right after completing one felt more like a burden than a truly new adventure\n-Each city, conveyance, and character has its own art, but really the only striking art was the conveyance.  The characters are very much colored cameo/silhouettes, while cities are a bit forgettable.\n-No tutorial or other instruction is readily apparent.  It took me half an hour to figure out that it was easier to use the arrow keys to switch between possible routes and an hour to figure out that my character needed particular equipment in order to negotiate quicker passage with the available conveyances.\n\nIn all, if you're even considering getting this game then I recommend it.  It's a nice way to while away the time on a lazy afternoon or quiet evening, offering a bit of adventure to contemplate.  The script author is an excellent writer, and I very much enjoyed seeing what she came up with.  I think it's a good bargain at $10.

This game is a great example of an interactive novel. You are Passepartout, Phileas Fogg's valet, and it your job to plan the route that will take you Around the World in 80 Days ( I couldn't resist). As you plan your route, you have to manage the finances which involves purchasing gear that will help speed up travel or be more comfortable, or purchase artifacts or luxury items to sell in other parts of the world. The routes you can take depend on what maps you have, and who you talk to. There are so many ways to travel around the world, and so many side stories to be discovered. Expect multiple playthroughs to discover them all. The only potential drawback with this game is that you have to read everything. There are nice backgrounds to each place you go but the game relies on the players imagination to visualize a great bulk of the action.

You play as Passepartout, a valet of his master Fogg. The master waged a bet that he could travel the globe in 80 days or less, so off you go, travelling from city to city in a steampunk world, discovering new routes along the way and trying to figure out the most effecient route while managing your finances and hoping you won't get any obstacles on your way - which you surelly will get!\n\nIn the beginning I had the urge to finish my trip as quickly as possible - which is obviously the intention - but because of that I was more focussed on moving along and thus missed out on some exploration/background story in various cities which might have resulted in discovering better routes or learning more things. Luckily this game has a high replayability value since the world is randomly generated and has a lot of cities to visit and many routes to use. So my advice, don't go for a record run on the first try but rather enjoy the world a bit more, play relaxed and you'll gain more satisfaction from playing.\n\n[b]The pro's:[/b]\n[list][*] Story rich world\n[*] High replayability\n[*] You can see how other players did on their journey compared to you and which route they followed while you're travelling. It gives a positive sense of competition because you can see how far in front or behind you are from others by seeing the amounts of days travelled so far.\n[*] Nice art which suites the setting of the world[/list]\n\n[b]The Con's:[/b]\n[list][*] Sometimes background music doesn't loop fluently.\n[*] When in conversation with characters while traveling/'on the road', their answers to some of your questions seem odd to me[/list]\n\n[h1]My first travel summarised[/h1]\nI did my first run in 82 days which took me about 2.5h playtime. Knowing the replayability you can get your money out of this game easily. Started in london, took mainly the train through central Europe towards Moscow to then take the Siberian Express. I planned on using the train till Vladivostok but I heard only Military personnel was allowed there so I got off early. Encountered a group of Mongols and traveled through the mountains on horseback which wasn't really comfortable for master Fogg. Once arrived in a city in Central Asia I mainly took aireal rides in mechanical birds towards Japan to end up somewhere in the Pacific. There I took a titanic-like looking ship (which also had the posibility to submerge) towards the US. Due to a storm the ship had to divert to central America. We attempted a munity to regain control on that trip but failed miserably. From Central America we crossed through the Amazon on a large digging machine to the east coast. From there on we took an air ride towards Africa to then travel north back to London.

I'm not a particularly big fan of them, but if they are being made, they must be selling. It's quite peculiar, though, to see a video game straddle different forms of media, to re-tell Jules Verne's classic tale of Phileas Fogg and his 80 day trip around the globe, and in a choose-your-own visual novel, no less! True, it isn't a direct re-telling, in fact it's almost entirely original material, bar the initial bet that sees Fogg traipse across the planet. But if 80 Days can rekindle my love for the written word, then I'm all for it.\n\nIf you've previously read Around The World in Eighty Days, you can pretty much forget everything you thought you knew about Fogg and his valet, Passepartout's, journey around the globe. While Fogg is still a stuffy, well to do type, and Passepartout attends to his every whim, the world around them is drastically different. The age of steam, gears and machinery has taken hold, and it's up to Fogg and Co to take advantage of it to arrive back in London before their 80 day deadline is up. A fortune awaits them if they can make it back in time, with bitter defeat and ridicule being the only other option - a fate worse than death!\n\nSetting off from London, they can travel to any of a large number of cities, all across the globe. There's very little in the way of restrictions to stop Fogg and Passepartout,well, aside from their bank balance.\n\nTheir journey is set against a beautifully-rendered interactive globe, with sprawling travel routes running like a circulatory system across the planet. Each city they visit has its own story, people, market and events. So whether you're in Paris sipping coffee in a cafe, or stealing heavy machinery with a mining crew in South America, each location feels unique, and most importantly, authentic - no mean feat considering the truly monumental scale of the game.\n\nBeing men of the world, Fogg and Passepartout bump into all kinds of characters. Sometimes, you'll get a great tip about places to visit or faster travel routes, other times, you might end up comatose in an opium den, only to end up on an airship going in the wrong direction. Mon Dieu!\n\nTraveling across the world isn't cheap, and whilst Fogg is a wealthy man, you'll still need to watch your expenses. Fortunately, you won't be shy of an opportunity to earn some coin. Marketplaces are a great spot to pick up trinkets, travel-appropriate clothing, and items that might be worth a bob or two in other parts of the world. Failing that, Passepartout can always dress up as a bearded lady in the circus.\n\nMoney affords Fogg and Passepartout comfort and luxury, but some routes may not be so accommodating, meaning traveling can impact their health. If you've managed to collect appropriate clothing sets for your journey, like scarves and hats, you can lessen the damage done., but some times you will be left with no option than to rest. You can keep Fogg in tip top shape by attending to his needs whilst you travel. It's amazing what a cup of tea and a tidy moustache can do! Just don't drink the local water.\n\nMake no mistake about it, 80 Days is a gorgeously detailed book, rich in detail, and with more than a few laughs thrown in for good measure. Developer, Inkle, has crafted a gamebook so lavish with descriptive language that its easy to become engrossed. It doesn't matter if you win the bet or not, so long as you enjoy the journey, and trust me, you will.\n\n80 Days is a wonderful re-imagination of Jules Verne's classic book \"Around The World in 80 Days\"\n\nhttp://criticalindiegamer.com/2015/10/around-the-world-in-80-days-or-so/", "timestamp_created": 1444070635, "timestamp_updated": 1444153798, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544199", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18334740": {"recommendationid": "18334740", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081303377", "num_games_owned": 223, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1657, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506093946}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has a little something for everyone.\n\nCompetitive?

First you need to plan routes around the world in order to complete you journey within 80 days. This is an interesting mechanic since you need to carefully plan your route but not take too long or you can arrive too late for your preferred form of transportation and have to wait losing precious time. You also need to handle your inventory buying and selling goods that will help you on your journey and help fund your travels. \n\nThe biggest mechanic in the game is the story itself. Most of the game revolves around interacting with the people and events you encounter on your journey. This requires a lot of text reading with the occasional option to decide how the story plays out. This is main reason why I said that the game will not be for everyone. If this doesn't appeal to you, you won't like 80 Days. If you like a good story though I think you can really enjoy 80 Days. \n\nIf you like the idea behind the game and like a good story that requires quite a bit of reading you should really enjoy 80 Days since it is a truly original engaging experience. \n\nNote: I received a free review copy from the developer.\n\n[url=http://www.geekyhobbies.com/this-weeks-steam-releases-and-reviews-october-2nd-2015/#80Days] Read My Full Review [/url]\n", "timestamp_created": 1443969097, "timestamp_updated": 1443969097, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18326679": {"recommendationid": "18326679", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995235223", "num_games_owned": 1490, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 867, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1444406793}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic work of interactive fiction with great writing and is very replayable due to the many possible routes and choices one can make along the way.", "timestamp_created": 1443967861, "timestamp_updated": 1443967861, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490900", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18322015": {"recommendationid": "18322015", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142755350", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 953, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483090429}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u975e\u5e38\u597d\u73a9\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u7684\u82f1\u8bed\u8db3\u591f\u597d\u7684\u8bdd\u3002\u7b2c\u4e00\u904d\u73a9\u7684\u65f6\u501996\u5929\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u904d79\u5929\u3002\u4f46\u6211\u8fd8\u6ca1\u600e\u4e48\u8e0f\u4e0a\u8fc7\u975e\u6d32\uff0c\u5357\u7f8e\u6d32\uff0c\u51c6\u5907\u63a5\u7740\u73a9\u3002\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\u592a\u6ce8\u610f\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u8bdd\uff0c\u8def\u4e0a\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5c31\u73a9\u4e0d\u4e0a\u4e86\u3002\u6ca1\u8bfb\u8fc7\u539f\u8457\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\u771f\u7684\u8bb2\u5f97\u5f88\u597d\uff0c\u8eab\u4e34\u5176\u5883\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5e7d\u9ed8\u53c8\u6709\u8da3\u3002\u5f88\u597d\u73a9\u7684\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1443947450, "timestamp_updated": 1443947450, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.591792", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18317461": {"recommendationid": "18317461", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985166414", "num_games_owned": 222, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 392, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1444005781}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game. period. \nIt got humour, it got action, it got RNGESUS, I can't ask for more.

After a few unfortunate mishaps and decisions I could have made better! \n\nBut what I love even more about 80 Days is the fact that once you finish your around the world trip the next time you play it, everything is different you get different items to start with in London and instead of heading South why not even head North? Before I knew it on my second time around I found myself journeying towards the North Pole before eventually crashing and left for dead but miracles happen and we found our way out and were bound for Canada before we knew it, a train across Canda before making another rather stupid decision seeing us thrown off the train and left fending our own way back to London. Then we happen to come across a pilot going to Reyjavik on only day 50!\nThough rather out of pocket we had to wait an agonozing 5 days in Iceland waiting for bank funds to come in before paying for the last leg of our Journey back to London! (Thinking about it we could have gone to the bank in Toronto and gotten the same funds the next day).\n\n80 Days is a real gem and you can spend hours on end plotting your way across the world, YOU are in control and it's up to you to decide how best to arrive back in London!\nI highly reccomend the game to anyone who's ever been a fan of 80 Days around the world or interested in travelling in general, there is so much fun to be had!", "timestamp_created": 1443642477, "timestamp_updated": 1443642477, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471819", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18266492": {"recommendationid": "18266492", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063757068", "num_games_owned": 243, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 559, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508172625}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is the ultimate adventure-travel around the world game. it really true to the original story, but it give the player many possibilities.\n\nyou choose everything in this game from what lagauge item to takefrom london, to what route to take next.\nsome routes can be veryfast, others slow, and other dangeraus.\nsometimes you get sorf of lucky and be transported to another city onword instantly.\n\nthis game is quite a awesome adventure", "timestamp_created": 1443638691, "timestamp_updated": 1443638691, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18263272": {"recommendationid": "18263272", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108094838", "num_games_owned": 238, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 4277, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452779380}, "language": "russian", "review": "Finally on Steam!

Be it inquiring fellow travellers about possible routes, preparing Fogg's shaving water or just making conversation to improve his mood and constitution.\n\nHowever, the game is obviously based on Jules Verne's famous novel and if you've read it, you already know that travelling won't be a walk in the park. There await countless random events; technical malfunctions, robbery, mutiny - even death.\nBut fear not, for you will also encounter various characters with the most interesting backgrounds whose friendship (and sometimes even love) you can win and who will often aid you on your voyage.\n\nThe story feels surprisingly thorough and responsive, considering it used to be \"one of those pesky mobile games\".\nIn pretty much every situation you have 2 or 3 different (text) options to choose from and alter the progress of the overall journey.\nThey managed to create and maintain a perfect balance between wanting to make haste in order to win the bet (circumnavigate the world in less than 80 days) and wanting to explore foreign culture. A perfect balance between \"I can't wait to continue on my way because I'm keen to visit new cities and countries\" and \"But I also want to explore this city some more and learn about its recent history and its people\".\nI think this is probably the greatest plus of the game and the reason it feels so incredibly vivid, almost as vivid as the actual novel.\n\nThroughout the adventure Passepartout will also develop in a certain way, depending on the choices you make. So it's entirely up to you if you want to be the exquisite Monseigneur or a sly daredevil - or maybe it's for the best of your gutless character to stay out of trouble and keep quiet?\n\nConcluding my impressions after almost 3 hours into the game I can promise you that if you are a fan of Verne's works, there is no risk at all in buying this. I can also wholeheartedly recommend it to historically interested people, since you get to learn quite a lot about the time the game is set in.\nJust make sure to keep in mind that it's more of a strategical exploration game with lots of text.\n\nUltimately, if you're still not sure whether to buy or not, just do it.

Highly recommended in combination with a glass of scotch and a relaxing evening.", "timestamp_created": 1443530183, "timestamp_updated": 1443530183, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 176, "votes_funny": 32, "weighted_vote_score": "0.879455", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 909, "total_negative": 87, "total_reviews": 996}}

There\u2019s not really anything to play. There are no choices given to the player, nor is there anything you can do to alter the route or ending. That being said, I didn't particularly mind.\n\nThe characters are likably tropey in that 2002-era style, and the story lures you into a false sense of security before pulling the rug out from beneath your feet.

The two are actually very similar, with the VN being a little bit more in depth. The VN only covers part of the anime, which makes sense since this is only chapter 1. However, the visual novel does have some good parts of it, and being able to control the pace is really nice.\n\nThe bad part of this visual novel is that the beginning is way too slow. There is way too much unnecessary banter and exposition in parts that don't really matter. Do you really need to show exactly what card was played in a card game and what thoughts were going on? If they dove into the suspense and content a bit faster, it would have been better, but I am looking forward to the next 4 chapters to see how they will pan out compared to the anime.\n\nOverall, I would say that it might be a bit faster for your time to just watch the anime, but the Visual Novel is not bad. Also its an easy 100% achievement game (just play through it and the extra).\n\nRating: 8.0/10\nRecommend Price: $4.99 or below", "timestamp_created": 1515386695, "timestamp_updated": 1515386695, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.605081", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39151323": {"recommendationid": "39151323", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050637112", "num_games_owned": 176, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 550, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 363, "last_played": 1515334228}, "language": "english", "review": "Ah from where should I start to review this beautiful masterpiece. More than five years ago I played the visual novel after watching both HIgurashi No Naku Koro Ni and Umineko Naku Koro Ni - just up to chapter onikakukshi. The first wallpaper I ever made was for Keiichi Maebara one of my favorite protagonists of all time. Being a girl and watching plus reading the VN even though it was not reverse harem was nothing for me. This VN is a pure masterpiece along with the anime. The anime which was considered as the mother of all horror anime for me will always be Higurashi. \n\nBack then when Yuno Gasai wasn't around the dazzling yandere stage was kept up by Ryugu Rena mostly and for me it's still her. Following the start up atmosphere of Doki Doki Literature Club aka starting from a bubbly atmosphere to a sudden dangerous scary one is Higurashi's one specialties. More than that- the VN starts with the saying of one of the most greatest characters in Umineko called Frederica Bernkastel : The witch of miracles. Keep in mind that this is a kinetic visual novel with no well choosing options and etc. But seriously even without that and reading it for the second time it still makes me so depressed, scared and angry. This is Ryukushi 07's epic masterpiece although he does have other stories written. He was always enthusiastic about marketing his works outside Japan- such a sweet heart :3\n\nYou don't have to do anything to get the achievements just keep reading the hell up including all tips and the Cast Review thingy in the Extra menu. The only thing that was lacking was the voices. But, artwork has been seriously remade which is admirable. For the voices- I heard the PS3 version had em' and in the steam community guides there is a particular walkthrough to get the voices. I didn't add em of course because I found it after the story was close to over- but now I'm itching to start the chapter two I might alter that one if there is a voice patch in there.

I knew about Higurashi and had seen the first season of the anime, so when I saw the bundle on sale I figured what the heck.\n\nHigurashi, When They Cry: Ch1 is a visual novel, meaning there is little to no interaction or choice.  You will read the story as it is presented to you, evaluate new tips between segments, and follow the progress of the protagonist, Keiichi. It's also important to note this is Ch1 of the four chapter questions arc. Don't expect the mysteries to be wrapped up in a nice bow by the end. You'll leave with more questions than answers.\n\nSo, what a ride! The characters have good chemistry and aren\u2019t slapped together cliches. The mystery aspects are captivating. I'm a huge horror fan and don't get scared easily, but there were moments when I found myself glancing over my shoulder and feeling really [i]really[/i] creeped out. The anime didn't come close to doing that for me. I cannot wait to start episode 2. If you like anime or just don't mind sitting back and reading a scrolling story, I would give this a shot, especially if it's on sale. You're going to put in a LOT of time reading it, so set up the auto scroll and sit back and relax. If you can, play in a dark room alone with headphones in. Story is a slow burn but worth it.\n\nOh, and I played with and without the PS3 patches, and I have to say: get the patches! It's sort of mind numbing without them. You can search for the links, I found them on a reddit post.

Ok, here goes, so, im not really an anime/manga type of person. Theres some good animes, and theres some good mangas, just not really my thing.  Then theres Higurashi. See i started by trying out Doki doki Literature Club, right? Next thing i know steam wants me to know about every visual novel available on the platform, almost kind of annoying, as i only played one, and so many more of other games. Why is this important? Shut it, im getting there. Over the holidays i was doing the que thing and getting the trading cards, then this \"game\" popped up. I read most of the store page, some reviews, and decided for a 2 bucks, at worst i could refund it if i wasnt interested. 14 hours later I was purchasing the chapter 2, i currently own all 5. I guess my point here is, you dont need to be a weeb to get into this. \n\nLets cover something first while were in the middle, this game has a preset difficulty thats mentioned when you first start. One may wonder, \"why does this book have a difficulty?\", and the answer is simple, How hard did you try to understand and figure out what was going on. Thats the game, understanding. \n\nSo lets cover some pros\nAmazing story, i mean its nuts. \nCharacter depth is phenominal, each person in the story has their own unique personality and traits.\nThe music is fairly catchy\neasy to pick up and put down as neccessary\n\nof course theres some downsides\nIts written kind of like a book, so at times it can be ahrd to tell whos saying what, but not overly so\nthe ui kind of sucks\nthe orignal backgrounds look funny\nthe original artwork is absolute hot garbage, thank god for the updates\n\nOverall, after reading all 5 available on steam, Im eager to read the rest (i think 14 in the whole story), The story has been enthralling thus far. youll laugh, maybe cry (dont be a weenie), be shocked, confused, anxious, and downright angry a times. maybe youll get those shivers and chills down your spine, goosebumps like i did as the story starts to develop. It has a super slow start (chapter 6 or so is when it starts to kick off, hard too.) but damn does it turn into a ride. And it only gets better as the music begins to vary more, and starts to match the situations better. \n\nThere are patches that add the ps3 character sprites, background, and i think voice overs, however as with most games, i would reccomend you experience this \"vanilla\" your first time thru.  \n\nAlso some really easy achievments here (yes, they have achievements) if your an achi hunter. cant argue with that. \n\nThis is a fantastic place to start your visual novel experience, or to add to your current collection.

It has a really slow start however so you will have to suffer through a few hours of slice of life stuff. One thing that really irked me was how little alternate art there was.

O jogo aborda um per\u00edodo de 2 semanas durante o ver\u00e3o do ano de 1983, nesse per\u00edodo tu \u00e9s apresentado ao grupo, sua vida cotidana e lendas misteriosas da regi\u00e3o, mais especificamente a uma s\u00e9rie de assassinatos que ocorrem todos os anos pouco depois de um festival que ocorre na cidade. Todo o ano depois de um certo evento - o governo central tentou construir uma represa na regi\u00e3o que iria inundar toda a cidade no ano de 1979, o projeto acabou sendo abortado depois de incidentes que culminaram no assassinato do respons\u00e1vel pela obra e no sumi\u00e7o de uma pessoa - uma pessoa morre ou \u00e9 assassinada e outra some, alguns dizem que isso \u00e9 a maldi\u00e7\u00e3o de Oyashiro-sama (o deus da cidade). \n\nO jogador assume a perspectiva de Keiichi Maebara, um aluno rec\u00e9m transferido, filho de um artista que veio a cidade para se inspirar para a elabora\u00e7\u00e3o de sua obra. No jogo pouco \u00e9 falado espec\u00edficamente sobre a fam\u00edlia de Keiichi Maebara. A obra pode ser dividida em tr\u00eas partes, o come\u00e7o onde \u00e9s apresentado a cidade, o grupo de amigos e as brincadeiras feitas, bem como a sua vida cotidiana, a segunda parte onde o personagem vai ter acesso a informa\u00e7\u00f5es a respeito desses incidentes e parte para a investiga\u00e7\u00e3o e a terceira parte onde o personagem totalmente imerso no clima conspirat\u00f3rio acaba tomando medidas extremas. No final de cada cap\u00edtulo \u00e9 dado ao jogador dicas a respeito dos acontecimentos de modo que ele possa elaborar suas pr\u00f3prias teses a respeito do mist\u00e9rio, passam desde relatos/depoimentos a arquivos policiais e m\u00e9dicos. \n\nEm cada um dos jogos da s\u00e9rie essas mesmas duas semanas se repetem com eventos se alterando em raz\u00e3o de atitudes diferentes dos personagem, \u00e9 como se fossem realidades alternativas que d\u00e3o diferentes perspectivas ao jogador, ajudando-o a desvendar o mist\u00e9rio. A s\u00e9rie rendeu um anime de duas temporadas e uma sequ\u00eancia de 5 OVAs --> Higurashi no naku koro ni (26 epis\u00f3dios), Higurashi no naku koro ni Kai (24 epis\u00f3dios) e Higurashi no naku koro ni Rei (5 OVAs) que encerra a hist\u00f3ria. Recomendo o jogo e o anime fortemente aos amantes do g\u00eanero suspense/terror psicol\u00f3gico. Ah, algumas cenas do anime s\u00e3o muito fortes no n\u00edvel de viol\u00eancia, ou seja, n\u00e3o \u00e9 algo para ver com as crian\u00e7as a menos que as queira traumatizar, \u00e9 aquele anime/jogo enganoso onde os personagens s\u00e3o bonitinhos e carism\u00e1ticos, mas os temas abordados na obra n\u00e3o s\u00e3o para crian\u00e7a n\u00e3o. Alguns destes temas s\u00e3o de viol\u00eancia dom\u00e9stica e abuso de drogas s\u00f3 para ter uma no\u00e7\u00e3o. Outra cena para te convencer a n\u00e3o assistir com crian\u00e7as --> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3oSg7bNxSg\n\nImportante salientar que nesta visual novel o jogador fica em um modo bastante passivo, pois n\u00e3o me recordo de ter de tomar qualquer decis\u00e3o no jogo.

immersive. Play this game alone in the dark, with headphones on and it can definitely be really, quite immersive and spooky. While it cannot boast to have the same level of illustration as many other visual novels, the greatest strength of HIgurashi is in its writing. The characters are likeable, and the story (plus the tips system) are genuinely interesting and clever. The UI is simple and effective. The music can be a bit hit-or-miss, ranging from functional to excellent. The story itself can also be a bit too anime from time to time, but the strong points more than make up for it.\n\nOne bitter pill to swallow is the fact that I did watch the Higurashi anime before reading the visual novel. As far as I've seen so far, the anime mirrors the VN quite well. The problem with that is I've already got an idea of what is happening (which does impact the spooky level negatively). I have to say, however, that despite this Higurashi manages to be creepy and I'm enjoying it plenty. Although the VN doesn't handle action quite as well as its anime counterpart, it has the benefit of more internal monologue and substantial depth. It's also incredibly long--I've invested two evenings so far and still haven't completed the first arc, Onikakushi.\n\nI recommend you get this game, but do yourself a favor and make it as immersive an experience as possible. It's definitely worth it, especially if you enjoy intrigue or being spooked.", "timestamp_created": 1513208640, "timestamp_updated": 1513208640, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.726675", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38282194": {"recommendationid": "38282194", "author": {"steamid": "76561198302831631", "num_games_owned": 243, "num_reviews": 112, "playtime_forever": 184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513180010}, "language": "schinese", "review": "#\u5bd2\u8749\u9e23\u6ce3\u4e4b\u65f6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u7ae0 \u9b3c\u9690#\uff0c\u730e\u5947\u81f4\u90c1\u7684\u60ac\u7591\u7c7b\u6587\u5b57\u5192\u9669\uff0c\u8f6e\u56de\u7a7f\u8d8a\u9898\u6750\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u4e3a\u9f99\u9a91\u58eb07\u3002\n\nhb\u4e00\u5200\u5305\uff0c\u65e0\u5b98\u4e2d\uff0c\u6c49\u5316\u94fe\u63a5\uff1a https://steamcn.com/t280440-1-1 \uff08\u73b0\u53ea\u6709\u7b2c\u4e00\u7ae0\uff0c\u4eba\u540d\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6709\u70b9\u95ee\u9898\uff09\n\n\u6ca1\u63a5\u89e6\u8fc7\u7684\u53ef\u4ee5\u5148\u770b\u4e00\u4e0b@\u5c15\u4e36\u5929\u5802\u7684\u6f2b\u8bc4\uff1a https://www.bilibili.com/video/av6910342/?from=search&seid=17488799012088519345\n\n06\u5e74\u52a8\u753b\u5316\uff0cB\u7ad9\u6709\uff1a https://bangumi.bilibili.com/anime/3554\n\n\u6e38\u620f\u672c\u6765\u65e0\u914d\u97f3\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6c49\u5316\u8865\u4e01\u4e2d\u52a0\u5165\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3\u8865\u4e01666\ncv\u8868\uff08\u540c\u52a8\u753bcv\uff09\uff1a\n\u524d\u539f\u572d\u4e00\uff1a\u4fdd\u5fd7\u603b\u4e00\u6717\n\u9f99\u5bab\u793c\u5948\uff1a\u4e2d\u539f\u9ebb\u8863\uff08\u521d\u4ee3\u67f4\u5200\uff0c\u5178\u578b\u75c5\u5a07\u201c\u517b\u5f97\u7d2f\u201d\uff09\n\u56ed\u5d0e\u9b45\u97f3&\u56ed\u5d0e\u8bd7\u97f3\uff1a\u96ea\u91ce\u4e94\u6708\n\u5317\u6761\u6c99\u90fd\u5b50\uff1a\u91d1\u4e95\u7f8e\u9999\n\u53e4\u624b\u68a8\u82b1\uff1a\u7530\u6751\u7531\u9999\u91cc\n\u53e4\u624b\u7fbd\u5165\uff1a\u5800\u6c5f\u7531\u8863\n\u5927\u77f3\u85cf\u4eba\uff1a\u8336\u98ce\u6797\n\u5bcc\u7af9\u6b21\u90ce\uff1a\u5927\u5ddd\u900f\n\u9e70\u91ce\u4e09\u56db\uff1a\u4f0a\u85e4\u7f8e\u7eaa\n\u5165\u6c5f\u4eac\u4ecb\uff1a\u5173\u4fca\u5f66\n\u77e5\u60e0\u7559\u7f8e\u5b50\uff1a\u6298\u7b20\u5bcc\u7f8e\u5b50\n\n\u5f53\u5e74\u300a\u5bd2\u8749\u300b\u8fd8\u6709\u8fc7\u4e0e\u300a\u4e1c\u65b9\u300b\u3001\u300a\u6708\u59ec\u300b\u5e76\u79f0\u201c\u4e09\u5927\u540c\u4eba\u5947\u8ff9\u201d\u7684\u8bf4\u6cd5\uff08\u73a9\u7b11\uff09\uff0c\u5982\u4eca\u8f66\u4e07\u51b7\u996d\u70ed\u996d\u8fde\u7740\u767b\u5f55steam\uff0c\u578b\u6708\u66f4\u662ffate\u62db\u724c\u4e3a\u6240\u6b32\u4e3a\uff0c\u53ef\u60dc\u5bd2\u8749\u6ca1\u4ec0\u4e48\u52a8\u9759\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1513179380, "timestamp_updated": 1513180122, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.769231", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38281891": {"recommendationid": "38281891", "author": {"steamid": "76561198430677606", "num_games_owned": 1084, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 283, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513522263}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u90fd\u53ea\u662f\u7537\u4e3b\u7684\u9050\u60f3\uff0c\u5018\u82e5\u591a\u4e00\u5206\u4fe1\u4efb\u7ed3\u5c40\u5c31\u4e0d\u4f1a\u3002\u3002\u3002\u3002\u3002\u3002\u989d\uff0c\"\u7531\u4e8e\u573a\u9762\u5ac9\u5992\u8840\u8165\u66b4\u529b\"\u6b64\u5904\u7565\u8fc7\u4e00\u5343\u516b\u767e\u4e2a\u5b57\u3002\u60f3\u8981\u597d\u7684\u7ed3\u5c40\u53ef\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u8d2d\u4e70\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u5468\u76ee\uff0c\u7b97\u662f\u63ed\u79d8\u5427  \u3002", "timestamp_created": 1513178517, "timestamp_updated": 1513180098, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498258", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38234289": {"recommendationid": "38234289", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054964194", "num_games_owned": 368, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 708, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513489130}, "language": "english", "review": "Lets cut to the chase shall we?

Every single other VN I have experienced (a total of seventeen, by my count) has as a core part of the interface a way for the reader to tell which character is speaking at any given time.  This VN lacks even this most rudimentary of features, which makes it a puzzle at best to figure out who is actually speaking any given line when multiple characters are present.  Given the dialogue-heavy nature of the story, in my view this is a truly crippling and inexcusable flaw.\n\nVoice-acting would likely alleviate this problem to some degree, but of course there is no voice-acting in the core product.  The result is, to be blunt, an incomprehensible mess, and I find I cannot bring myself to continue the story without an external patch to fix the problem--a patch which has, at least on the first two attempts, not actually worked at all.  That said, even if it does eventually work and I am able to experience and enjoy the resulting product, it is not the product I purchased on Steam, so this review stands regardless.\n\nIn the future, I will be sure to confirm the presence or absence of this feature before purchasing a VN.

It adds a new sense of immersion which makes it the definitive way to experience these novels, in my opinion[/b]\n\nWhether you're already a fan of the anime/manga or you're dipping into the world of Higurashi for the first time, I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys visual novels. The characters are loveable, the mystery is very interesting and the psychological horror aspect is brilliant in my personal opinion. Even as someone who's watched the anime twice and knew what was going to happen, I still found myself quite spooked on multiple occasions. I was also surprised by how engaged I found myself in it, despite again, having already watched the anime twice. The VN definitely has enough to keep those who enjoyed the adaptions interested, while giving those who jump in for the first time an absolutely captivating experience.\n\nI really only have two complaints. The first is that the pacing can be quite slow at points. Though that's more of a nitpick that applies to the genre as a whole for me and it never drags for very long, so don't even worry about that one. More of a personal peeve than anything else and it never truly affected my enjoyment.\n\nThe second complaint is not even about the game itself, but rather the marketing. Despite MangaGamer insisting otherwise, this is a novel through and through. No gameplay is present. I could go on about how this is essentially lying to the consumer but I'll hold my tongue. Personally, I don't mind the lack of gameplay as the story itself was more than enough to keep me invested during all of my playtime. But understandably, the lack of any sort of gameplay or choice will turn off some players. Which is part of why the misleading marketing really annoys me, but I digress \n\nAll in all though, if you enjoy visual novels I implore you to at least check this one out. It's not exactly expensive either, so do yourself a favor and pick it up if you haven't already.

No choices or anything like that. This is basically just a novel.\n-No voice acting\n-4:3\nLast two cons can be fixed via few patches, which you can find in community guides. But bear in mind that there is slight differences in writing. As far as I learned, voiced version is a little lighter in some sentances. 16:9 patch also changes backgrounds. I feel like original backgrounds is darker and more apropriate for this VN, but you can choose for yourself.\n\nConclusion:\nOne of the best VN's I ever read. If you are a fan of horror and mystery genge, this game is the business. Haven't once got scared from reading anything, but this VN gives me chills. Don't read this on weed in a dark room, trust me.\nAnd if you are wondering value-wise, this VN took me about 15-16 hours to read from cover to cover(my reading speed is about average, as far as I can tell).

I originally bought it just to see what it was like. I had seen the show several times, I thought it would just be a lot of text to scroll through. It turned out, to be a bunch of text to scroll through. However, what I never thought would happen, did. I thought that having seen the show so many times, there would be no effect. I have never been so wrong. \n\nFirst of all, I have to credit the excellent sound design. The music is fantastic, there are energetic and lively tunes, and more sombre slower paced tracks. Not to mention compelling scenes aided by no music at all. The sound effects are crisp, and they all feel like they have actual impact. The cicada cries never become annoying, and they serve as insanely fitting background noise. \n\nThis is a visual novel, and I'd be comitting a crime if I didn't applaud the fantastic writing. Not only is it superbly translated, (From what I can tell, my japanese is a little sketchy) The dialogue is witty, and snappy. You'd think I'd be frowning, sad, or scared the whole time. However, the slice of life sections made me smile and laugh more often than the actual show did. All of the characters speak so naturally, and abide by their characters well. The normal sections are hilarious, and the creepy sections have this undeniable weight to them, as if you are completely sucked into the world. \n\nThe atmosphere is too good to describe. The game can set any scene and it becomes believeable and almost surrealy life like. The simple fact that there is a static image on screen, with words covering a good portion of it, and I am completely immersed is something to praise. The writing, the art, the sounds, they all come together to make the game really transcend its own medium, to become something far more. \n\nThe art, first of all, the characters are absolutely beautifully drawn. From the screenshots, they are far improved from the original versions. They are all far more expressive than I'd think possible. How they can so easily shift from emotion to emotion is incredible. They do reuse the exact same faces and sprites often, however, they never become boring to look at. Also, new ones are occasionally added, the spice things up. Rena in particular has the greatest set of faces in the entire game. Now, the backgrounds are a little disappointing. They all look ok, as I cannot tell if they are photographs with a filter, or water color. Maybe if they were higher resolution, or fitted the characters better, they would be better. However, it is nothign but a minor flaw. \n\nAs for content density, the game itself is about 4-5 hours long. If you read all the tips, and do the after party. Now, I did not use auto mode, nor did I skip all of the text. Also, I read at 606 words per minute, at an average of 250, it would probably be closer to 9-10 hours. Overall, I was surprised with the amount of content there was. The tips flesh out the world, the after party is fun, and the story itself is well written. \n\nIn the end, I cannot reccomend this enough, even if you have not seen the show, this is absolutely fantastic.

Even though I saw the anime first, this was an exciting experiance indeed. \n\n[h1]What is it?[/h1]\nHigurashi when they cry is a sound novel series. The games use sound effects, images, and appropriate music to generate an atmosphere for the story. (And might I say that do it rather well indeed.) The key characters have sprites to help you get a better idea of their appearance, and their current mood. Images tend to be scenes so you can get the idea of where the character is.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nWhile the game uses all that above to generate a brilliant atmosphere, it wouldn't quite be complete without a story now, would it? Chapter 1 (Onikakushi) is seen as the, shall we say Introduction to the series. (There is more on this matter in the after party.) The rough outline of the story (without spoilers) goes as follows:\n\nYou are new to the small village of Hinamizawa. After a few weeks/months of living a normal life there you begin to learn that there is a strange event there every year, one person dies, another goes missing. Some believe this to be a curse, others believe it to be a conspiracy. You are now caught up within it. You, with the help of the detective Ooishi need to find out what the cause of this is, but most importantly you need to survive long enough to bring the truth to light.\n\nWith theories like the use of meth, schizophrenia, and even being possessed by a diety, it certainly is interesting. \n\nHigurashi when they cry puts you in the character's position, you know what he hears, says, sees, and even thinks.\nThere are optional tips that come up that give you (The player) a chance to observe an incident that the character you are following may not have been in, or know of.\nNOTE: This game follows a set path.\n\n[h1]Cost[/h1]\nFor the experiance, I'd say this game is definately worth the cost. To top it off, it's cheap for the playtime on a single runthrough. (At the time I finished the game once through I had around 14.7 hours playing the game.)\n\n[h1]After Party[/h1]\nAfter you have completed the game, you unlock the \"After Party\". This is also titled as the \"All cast review session\". In it, the characters break down the 4th wall and share their opinions on the game, and their theories behind the inccidents, also discussing what the beta players thought. (A surprisingly nice way to end the game, as it doubles up as a brief recap.) It also discusses the preperations for the second chapter (Which I have high expectations for.)\n\nThis game, as said above, was great. I just fell into the world they were trying to portray, even after seeing the anime, some elements of the game surprised me.\n\nWhy are you still reading this?

Not sure why they took those out for this release. But after playing with the voices and the new backrounds, I cannot imagine going back to the 'vanilla' version. A short google search for 'higurashi voice patch' is probably enough.\n\nReview:\n\nScrew this game, man. It's a trap. It literally tricks you. You start off a tiny bit spooked. You don't know what's going on. Then it TRICKS you. Lulls you into a false sense of ease and security, happiness. Friendship. You spend hours making friends and having a good time then while your guard is down and your mind is filled with cute girls and happy times it walks up, inserts its ice cold claw into your butt and shakes you by the spinal cord.\n\nThis game has caused so many chills down my spine I thought I had a problem with my central nervous system. I literally do not know how this can go on for so many more games when it's as intense as it is RIGHT NOW. My hands sweat the entire time I'm playing and I'm getting sweaty just thinking about it.\n\n(With patch)\nVoice over: 7/10\nSound: 6/10.

The author just drew over pictures he took 20 years ago. No widescreen. Has its own charm. 'NEW' sprites look alright, nicely drawn but lack a lot of impact the ones added by the patch have.\nStory: 9/10 (unaffected by patch)\nTotal score: Still buy it even if you are computer illteriate, cannot google 'higurashi voice patch' and don't know how to press 'install' on the program and wait a few minutes.", "timestamp_created": 1496077866, "timestamp_updated": 1496077866, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 48, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.825435", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32011347": {"recommendationid": "32011347", "author": {"steamid": "76561198390215587", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 38, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497633132}, "language": "english", "review": "I have played the games before and they are probably the best visual novels out there.

Most of them begin with a carefree slice of life high school scenario that eventually shifts into a sadistic, terrifying murder mystery. I'll review the series as a whole here. \nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=912786807&fileuploadsuccess=1\n[b]Plot[/b]\nThere's over 50 hours of plot twists and reading to swallow, peppered with mystery staggered across the first four books and answers trickling slowly in the latter four. The story by itself is so brilliant that it spawned an anime, manga, and several subsequent adaptations. I was so compelled that I ended up reading for 11 days straight. \n\n[b]Visual[/b]\nThe hilariously bad character art has been redrawn and updated specifically for this release. While the new art is excellent, many of the backgrounds and still images didn't get transferred over from the recent PS3 release. Luckily you can mod most of the content back in, but if you go in unaware then you'll be missing out. Check out the steam guides to fix these shortcomings. \n\n[b]Sound[/b]\nIt almost hurts to not give this category a higher score. When the sound was ported the audio mixer failed to accommodate for capping the volume, so certain songs will nauseatingly pop and crack. Luckily the sound (like the art) can be modified and you can port in proper music or even the recreated tracks released from other editions. \n\n[b]Difficulty[/b]\nNot a conventional game--not conventionally difficult. The challenge is in figuring out the answers and making predictions. It's almost spitefully impossible to crack the mystery during the first four books. \n\n[b]Spectacle[/b]\nMind crushingly terrifying. The slice of life bits give you a break and acclimate you to normalcy. Then everything gets shattered like this.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=906851423\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nNo decisions, no routes, just lean back in your chair or lie in bed while you click away.\n\n[b]Four and a half stars out of five[/b]\nNeeding to mod the game to patch the sound quality and insert lost art assets keeps this game from getting a full five stars.

The term onikakushi means \"spirited away\" or literally \"taken away by demons\". Starting with this first game, Higurashi series are known to be the best examples of horror/mystery thriller in Visual Novel genre with extensive use of sound effects, high quality horror narrative and well elaborated story revelation. I've had my eyes on this VN series for a while now, hearing high praises and exclamations of disbelief, like \"I can't believe you haven't play that one yet. It is really creepy!\". Completing this prologue, I can see why. This is by far, the best thriller narrative that I've come across in this genre.\n\nHere we are taking the role of Keiichi Maebara, a young boy who just moved into silent village of Hinamizawa, far away from any big city. With its natural beauty and eerie isolation, Hinamizawa is the perfect setting of any Stephen King novel already. But Keiichi's life here starts funny, light hearted and perfectly amusing. He befriends a band of cheerful young girls, all with quirky characters and joins their gaming club. They keep each other company and go through many heartwarming experiences. Well, this is the first part of the game, presenting a feel of the core setting and most of the characters involved anyhow. Taking a closer look, this warm setting sits upon a gruesome mystery which Keiichi accidentally comes into contact with. Through sheer coincidence, he learns that there has been a violent murder within the village following an issue with a dam building project. Whenever he tries to ask his friends about the issue, they gleefully change the subject and pretend that there has never been anything suspicious within the town. After the annual Watanagashi festival, celebrating the local god - Oyashiro-sama - things get a quick turn from heartwarming to ominous, and eventually to daunting and downright psychotically creepy in the end.\n\nAt the end of this first game, you'll be presented more questions rather than answers, so don't be discouraged. Higurashi series mainly consist of 8 core games - 4 question arcs, and 4 answer arcs. Starting with this one, all first four games intend to present you with mysteries concerning this silent village and many characters who inhabit the place. Next four will gradually reveal the answers to those mysteries. Speaking of answers, all question arcs are here on steam already and the 5th game - first answer arc - will soon be here on Steam too. So, brace yourselves! Higurashi is a long ride, and I am more than convinced that it's gonna be worthy of both the time and the budget you'll spare for.\n\nThe game is a kinetic visual novel, in which you won't be presented with any choice options. You'll go ahead and witness a story - and a well written one at that too. For this specific series, the term \"sound novel\" is used though, even though there isn't any voiceover. The reason for the term is that the atmosphere within the series heavily relies on background music and various sound effects, starting with the trademark sound of higurashi - the evening cicada - dominating the village with their ominous, monotonous buzzing throughout the series. The written narrative is exceedingly good, with top-notch translation, presenting a grasping atmosphere whether it be lazy, competitive, thrilling or... deadly.\n\nAgain, I must note that the starting mood of the game shouldn't fool you. This is NOT a family friendly story, especially after its first half. At the end of each chapter, you'll reveal some hints concerning the true nature of events and as you complete the story, you'll be presented with a \"all-cast\" commentary about the events. Will they reveal anything? Nope, but they'll steer you towards the most probable path. This is a long running mystery with seriously well-arranged interrelation.\n\nIn this Steam version, all character artworks are updated, and presented as a bit more esthetic spirits compared to their original, cutesy versions. Yet, visuals are not the primary quality of the game. Both narrative and background sounds will engulf you into this uncanny mystery faster than any visual presentation.\n\nMay I recommend this first chapter? Without skipping a heartbeat. It is elaborate, it is relatable, it is mysterious and it is downright gruesome with a grasping narrative. What else I can ask for in this genre? Well, now that I'm done with this one, I'll proceed to play the second chapter. I am already curious about the fate of our characters and the proper way to answer all mysteries revolving around them.

It's cool Rena's speech tick was included (as i've seen too many fan translations omit it)\n\nThere is...ONE THING i do NOT forgive: the goddamn text boxes. \nYes, visual novel promotes the idea of imagery on a story. But visual novels have the power to immerse you into the story even more. A traditional text box would have allowed multiple sprite actions to happen during the text transition. \n\nBasically the sprite is set to change before or after a text box appears as a transition...meaning the displayed emotion goes along with what is said before or after the character is said to express it.\nIt kind of breaks it for me. A traditional text box would allow stacking actions, meaning rather than \"chara:neutral > transition > chara:angry > text\" you could have the character in a neutral state, and when you go to the next line of text, it simultaneously triggers the sprite changing along with the text.\n\nidk. maybe im just a baby.\n\nanyway 10/10 would let frederika bernkastel step on me", "timestamp_created": 1491148906, "timestamp_updated": 1491148906, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30888202": {"recommendationid": "30888202", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165413614", "num_games_owned": 192, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 3605, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514116262}, "language": "english", "review": "First ,this game I rate a 10 out of 10 ,feel free to buy!

He quickly integrated into the friendly team of school club. But, suddenly, he begins to reveal the mystery that is full of not only the village itself, but almost every resident.\n4 years ago the Japanese government created a project for the construction of a dam near the village. But the village was in a zone of prospective flooding. All the villagers offered a reward in exchange for their departure.\nThree of the oldest and most respected families decided to leave the village, no one will, and founded a series of protest rallies. Almost the whole village was on the side of the three families. But there were opponents who were satisfied with a cash fee and they called for an exit from the village. At the head of the last movement were the parents of Satoko.\nSome time later, committed the murder of the superintendent. Police found a dismembered corpse. For four years, the killer was never found. Since then, every holiday Watanagashi one person missing and another is found dead.\n4 years later one of the mug must be subjected to the aggravation of the syndrome Hinamizawa and kills all the others. And at the very end at the altar dies, Furude Rick and history repeats itself.\nLocal God \u2014 Oyashiro-she appears as the protector of the village. For example, in the case of Renai, who left the village for a year, lost his mind because of the hallucinations and, armed with a bat, smashed all the Windows in her new school and beat several people. To punish the girl did not, but she soon returned to the village. Just the year before transfer Keiichi.\nIt is believed that the priestess of the temple of Furude (the title is passed from priestess to priestess) keeps people Syndrome Hinamizawa, until, while alive and resident is close to Ricky.\nAll the characters of the series are karmically linked. The theme of reincarnation and responsibility for what is happening reflects the mentality of the Japanese and allows us to understand their psychology different from the psychology of European mentality, formed a Christian culture.

Disturbing? Chilling? Unnerving? All of the above, I suppose.\n\nOnikakushi is but the first of many in the Higurashi series of VNs. The characters themselves refer to it as a \"prologue\" (in an extra, cast-party type story), and this may very well be.  That said, the story feels \"complete\" in that it does in fact have an ending.  And ending with no shortage of questions and WTF? moments, but an ending none-the-less.\n\nSelf-described as a \"sound novel\", I was at first taken aback by that term considering there is no voice acting.  But, as the story develops further, the use of music and especially sound effects can be intense.

Specifically, it's a kinetic novel, which means that there are no choices to be made; you simply progress for the story itself.  It takes place in the early summer of 1983, and we are introduced to Hinamizawa and its inhabitants through Keiichi's eyes.  Specifically, the characters who make the most appearance time are four of his classmates (Rena, Mion, Satoko, Rika) as well as Tomitake, a freelance photographer, and Ooishi, a detective from a neighboring town.  Keiichi goes about his life, getting acquainted with Hinamizawa and developing friendships with the four girls, and everything seems to be the normal, mundane life until a tragic event takes place and Keiichi starts learning about certain incidents that have happened surrounding Hinamizawa.  He's pulled into this world that he wished that he had stayed ignorant of but it's too late to go back to being ignorant.  As there are four chapters (question arcs) in the series, this first chapter is known as the prologue and focuses on the introduction of Hinamizawa and as you may have guessed, there are specific scenes between Keiichi and Rena.  I believe that the following chapters will focus on other aspects of the story and Keiichi's relationships with the other girls although I have yet to play them.\n\nAs this is a kinetic novel, though, I won't say anything more about it, not wanting to spoil the story.  I will say that, especially in the latter half, there are more horror elements so one should be prepared for that.  As you progress through the story, after each chapter, new tips will be unlocked and reading them will give you more insight as to what's going on (not simply learning about events from Keiichi's point of view).  Also, after you finish Ch.1 in its entirety, you have the option to replay certain days' events as well as a fun after party for the cast in which the characters give their ideas and theories as to what's going on.  These are all unlocked in the Extras section on the main menu that is unlocked after you finish one day in the game (as that's how the game is divided-by days).\n\nAs to my opinion of ch. 1, I totally loved the story.  I felt myself getting drawn in, especially towards the latter half when things start getting crazy.  (I wish I could be more specific but that would be spoiling the story.)  I loved the characters-Rena, the shy, sweet girl; Mion, the tomboy leader; Satoko, the prankster; Rika, the quiet, wise, composed one.  Things are definitely not what they seem and after finishing ch. 1, there isn't an answer as to what happened.  You can only make guesses but I understand that there are chapters called answer arcs that will eventually address these questions.  The story was really well written, the art (newer style) was great, and I loved the music.  The pieces fit in well with specific events and I totally felt creeped out when there were the scary parts.\n\nOverall, I totally loved Higurashi Whey They Cry Hou-Ch. 1 Onikakushi and I'm happy that I got the chance to play it.  I'm really looking forward to Ch. 2 and learning more about what's going on in that world.  ^^", "timestamp_created": 1487567839, "timestamp_updated": 1487567839, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.616959", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29575527": {"recommendationid": "29575527", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041993574", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 725, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511875039}, "language": "english", "review": "Even more marvelous than I expected.

La parte mala de esta versi\u00f3n es que vengan sin voces, al contrario que la versi\u00f3n de Playstation 3, pero por suerte pueden descargarse mods por internet e incluirlas, que lo recomiendo fervientemente para disfrutar por completo de Higurashi.\n\nSi bien la novela visual est\u00e1 dividida en cap\u00edtulos, tiene una duraci\u00f3n m\u00e1s que aceptable (aunque tambi\u00e9n influye esto con el pr\u00f3ximo p\u00e1rrafo), por lo que no tem\u00e1is pagar demasiado para una hora o dos de juego, m\u00e1s bien temed quedaros con la miel en los labios como me ha pasado a m\u00ed.\n\nEl mayor punto negativo (y entre comillas) es que no tenga parche en espa\u00f1ol, as\u00ed que tendremos que tener un m\u00ednimo de nivel en la lengua anglosajona para poder disfrutar de esta novela... pero creedme, merece mucho la pena.\n\n\u00bfRecomiendo Higurashi When They Cry Hou - Ch.1 Onikakushi?\n\nS\u00cd.

I was especially interested in reading the source material, but at the time, did not have the means to access it. So when I saw that the sound novels were being released on Steam, I was very excited!\n\nHaving already watched the anime, nothing really came as a surprise in the novel. What was nice, though, was getting to read the parts of the story that the anime left out. Some of the things that happened made a little more sense. Plus, there was more time to see the characters interacting with each other...mostly mundane stuff, but it developed the characters' relationships more thoroughly, resulting in a stronger emotional connection to them all. And even though I knew what would happen, the novel still managed to get me on the edge of my seat. I had to put it down a couple of times because of how suspenseful it was. And to me, that's a sign of a truly good suspense story.\n\nI love the new art! I also really like that I was given the option to use the original art instead, if I were so inclined. While there's nothing quite like the original art of Higurashi, I really enjoyed the newer, higher quality designs.\n\nDefinitely worth my money.

The ones where the new guy discovers a dark secret, nearly gets killed, and comes back with a horse and a shit ton of ammo? Wait, that's Hot Fuzz. Forget that last part. \n\nSo. Higurashi. As someone who has the old Mangagamer hard copies of both arcs, I was pleased to find that the series was getting a shiny new makeover for Steam. Especially when I head about the improved translation. I'm still hoping to hear that this incarnation will get a new hardcopy release. To those who are familiar with the storyline of the series overall, I won't go into details. If you're interested in skipping ahead, the manga release by Yen Press is still available. To those who haven't played Higurashi yet, here goes.\n\nThis is a 'kinetic' sound novel.  To those uninitiated in the visual novel genre, sound novels rely less on the graphics, and more on the music, sound effects, and atmosphere. As a kinetic novel, you don't make any decisions. Gameplay is just pushing the enter button and advancing the text. In this edition, you can chose between the original sprites, infamous for being cutesy and having boxing glove hands, or more streamlined, professional looking ones. \n\nHinamizawa is a small town in rural Japan. Tradition looms over this place, where the  deity Oyashiro-sama is worshipped by the locals. When Keiichi Maebara moves to this place from Tokyo in 1983, he will make several friends. The ditzy, yet sharp Rena Ryugu. The tomboyish gamer, Mion Sonozaki. The trap master, Satoko Hojo. The serious young shrine maiden, Rika Furude. With their help, Keiichi finds a place in this town. Then he hears a story from several years ago, about a heinous murder that made the news. His friends deny anything happened, but Keiichi finds evidence to the contrary. As Keiichi learns about the yearly death and disappearances that are called Oyashiro-sama's curse, who can he trust? What is happening in Hinamizawa? \n\n\n\nOn a related note, to look into the tradition of protective gods like Oyashiro-sama,, and stories of spiriting away, I strongly suggest reading Richard Dorson's translations of The Legends of Tono and Folk Legends of Tono. \n", "timestamp_created": 1475789565, "timestamp_updated": 1475789565, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25736423": {"recommendationid": "25736423", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027554665", "num_games_owned": 318, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 1193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468108381}, "language": "english", "review": "[i]This review: contains no spoilers[/i]\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[list]\n\t[*][b]Story & atmosphere[/b] --- This chapter's story does an excellent job at familiarizing the reader with the characters while still retaining a subtle atmosphere of unease as more of the village's mysterious past is uncovered.

Higurashi When They Cry is a murder mystery, Junji Ito esq horror story that leaves you confused and terrified throughout. The game tells the story of a young boy who moves to a new town and makes friends with a unique and quirky group of girls in their small school. However, after a community celebration a body is found in a horrifing state and suddenly things aren't as simple in this small community as you thought. Demon's, deaths, curses, and baseball bats are all in store as Higurashi's first chapter unfolds in a story which will take up to ten hours to complete. A story ideal for horror and mystery fans, as well as any player who is open to virtual books and wants a good bloody read.\n\nPros: Higurashi comes with brand new beautiful graphics which make the characters more vibrant and unique. The music and sound effects are both chilling when they need to be, and catchy and lighthearted when they want to. However, the story is where this game really shines. The story takes its sweet time building and building, almost a little too long. But the building of the story adds to the stress and confusion of the player. The descriptions are vast, disgusting, and beautiful in places. The story is touching, tear inducing, and terrifying. This game is a must play at night in the dark to get the full effect. The longer you play, the darker the tale becomes and the more questions you are given. There are also bonus notes at the end of each chapter, which you should read as well to truely enjoy the game fully. There are funny moments, touching moments, scary moments, and downright disturbing moments throughout. It takes a great amount of thought to know what comes next in this first chapter of Higurashi, and even then the curve balls this tale throws are nearly uncatchable.\n\nCons: As stated before, the start can be a little too long. There are a great many early game parts which drag on and seem to have no purpose to the reader. You must have patience to wait for the story to unfold, and it takes its time doing so. Secondly, this game is, obviously, less of a game and more of a reading experience. All the player does is click next to extend the text. There are no games, no controls, and no agency. For someone looking for a game to play, you will not find it here. If you are not a reader you will not enjoy this experience. If story is not your thing in games, this is not the game for you. Also, reading a computer screen may hurt some peoples eyes, if this is your case you may have a hard time playing Higurashi for too long. \n\nOverall: There is very little to critique gameplay wise, because there is no gameplay here. The visuals are solid, the sound is catchy and creepy, and the story is stunning. For fans of visual novels and horror themes you can do no better than Higurashi When They Cry Ch.1. This is a solid opening to a hopefully wonderful series. For the non readers out there, perhaps the anime is more your style. But for those players who can stand to read a game rather than play it, this is one of the best on the market, and is a solid classic.", "timestamp_created": 1473207711, "timestamp_updated": 1473207711, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25361249": {"recommendationid": "25361249", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066695238", "num_games_owned": 519, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 4706, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469864643}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043b\u043b\u0430. \u0412 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0451 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043b \u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0435 \u043f\u043e \u043d\u0435\u0439. \u0418 \u0432 2016 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0443 \u043d\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0446-\u0442\u043e \u0441\u044b\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043b.\n\u0417\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0434\u043a\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0434\u0430\u043d\u044b, \u0437\u0432\u0435\u0437\u0434\u0435\u0446 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b.", "timestamp_created": 1473068971, "timestamp_updated": 1473068971, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498526", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25287489": {"recommendationid": "25287489", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034368650", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432111286}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0411\u043b\u044f \u044f \u043d\u0438\u0445\u0443\u044f \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u044f\u043b, \u043d\u043e \u043b\u0430\u0439\u043a \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044e", "timestamp_created": 1472744326, "timestamp_updated": 1472744326, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476061", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25276835": {"recommendationid": "25276835", "author": {"steamid": "76561198310884778", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 936, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472680450}, "language": "english", "review": "Chapter one of Higurashi When They Cry is only the prologue of a deep mystery.

Little did I know of the compelling story that awaited me.\n\nHigurashi When They Cry is a story about 16-year old Keichi Maebara who moves from the busy city to the isolated village of Hinamizawa. He quickly adjusts to the slower pace of life in Hinamizawa and makes new friends. The story begins slowly, with slife-of-life-esque moments and encounters between Keichi and his new friends in Hinamizawa. There are some funny moments, but others may find this part of the story boring and repetitive. However, as the story progresses and the exposition fades, Keichi slowly learns of the horrors surrounding the village of Hinamizawa. Murder. Brutality. Mystery. Insanity. Conspiracy. As one continues reading, they can only feel magnetized as the story draws them in closer and closer. Higurashi is a story of mystery, and it does it properly.\n\nThere\u2019s more aspects of the novel I could write about. However, I feel it would be too long-winded and, many others have already written about those aspects in their reviews. But I must recommend Higurashi to anyone looking for a great mystery visual novel. If you haven\u2019t watched the anime adaptation of Higurashi, I doubt the visual novel will have the same effect on you as it did with me. This visual novel is my first experience with the Higurashi series and, I am excitedly looking forward to reading the other continuations of the story and uncovering the truth behind the mystery. 9/10.\n", "timestamp_created": 1472082432, "timestamp_updated": 1472082432, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500735", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24942303": {"recommendationid": "24942303", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018056824", "num_games_owned": 2384, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 654, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456603818}, "language": "english", "review": "Don't be fooled by its innocent appearance, Higurashi When They Cry is a very dark mystery/horror visual novel. Typically I don't care for horror VNs, but Higurashi uses the kind that I like: suspenseful psychological horror that does not use jump scares or cheap tactics.\n\nThe first half or so is a slice of life story about moving to a new school in a small town, and honestly I didn't really care for this portion. However, it is necessary for character-building and the second half is well worth trudging through the first. When the real story begins, you'll get sucked into the tale surrounding the town and a series of people who died under suspicious circumstances. Then, all that cheerful tone gets swept under the rug and the rest of the VN is a perfect mix of suspense, mystery and psychological horror that really puts you in the protagonist's shoes. The excellent soundtrack is also worth mentioning here as the music sets the creepy atmosphere very well.\n\nRead it.

Let me first preface this review with two things:\n1: I've never played a true Visual Novel before this\n2: I will gladly be quoted when I say that the Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni series is my favorite set of anime of all time. \nWith that said, let's get right underway with the review. \nHigurashi: When They Cry, is a series made by 07th Expansion and translated to English by MangaGamer. As I understand it, the Visual Novel was the first iteration of this tale, with every other iteration coming afterwards (though I'm not sure if the Drama CD was actually first or not. Can someone please correct me if I'm wrong?). The story follows a laid-back teen named Keiichi Maebara in a small village known as Hinamizawa (based on real-life village Shirakawa-go Village), all set in June of 1983. It starts off laid back and all happy, but eventually starts taking dark turns when some truths start trying to surface. Narrative wise, this is ABSOLUTELY the best way I've received the story. Unfortunately, I'm still not sure I'd wanna call this a game, as there is no player interaction whatsoever. It's more of a glorified book with music and a few sound effects here and there. Oh, and SLIGHTLY interactive visuals, but these are extremely minimalistic. But the lack of gameplay is definitely made up for by this gripping story. The story is told from a first-person perspective of Keiichi, which unfortunately DOES mean we don't get to actually SEE our protagonist in this chapter. The backgrounds are odd in that they're real pictures, probably taken at Shirakawa-go Village, but they've been edited in a way that makes them look like they were done by a concept artist. There's one or two where people's faces are in there that sort of breaks the cartoonish illusion, but for the most part, it's actually very scenic. The music, what little there is, is clever and perfectly timed. Granted, the loops aren't exactly the best, but I enjoyed each track happily. Now since this is only the first arc of the series (only 4 episodes long in the anime), this is by no means the FULL story. In fact, the bonus content even says that this story sort of acts as a prologue for what's to come. But don't let that fool you. The shortest time you'll spend on this VN if you're actually reading it is 8 hours. It's brimming with content, which is something I always appreciate in a story. The Steam edition offers a choice between the original character sprites drawn by the original creator, or new updated sprites that even surpass the anime's art style. If you ask me, the original sprites haven't exactly aged well, and these new ones are almost more alive and believable (it's mainly the hands). Overall, this first chapter of Higurashi: When They Cry gets an 8/10 from me. My only complaint is that it's basically a book with extra additives, but at least it rocks as its own thing. You can download a copy of Higurashi: When They Cry - Chapter 1: Onikakushi-Hen on Steam for $5.99 on PC, Mac, and Linux, or for $0.99 on the AppStore (bearing in mind that the iOS versions do not have the updated sprites, and may possibly not have the updated English translation either).", "timestamp_created": 1470639183, "timestamp_updated": 1470639183, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24772326": {"recommendationid": "24772326", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079921315", "num_games_owned": 238, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 555, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470472005}, "language": "english", "review": "Force yourself to sit through the first half of the game and you shall be rewarded.", "timestamp_created": 1470637479, "timestamp_updated": 1470637479, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24687375": {"recommendationid": "24687375", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068751685", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1274, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432956004}, "language": "english", "review": "Build up took a little while, but boy was this novel intense!

I wanted to read it earlier because I've seen the Anime, and was blown away by the story, but I didn't really like the old character sprites for this game, that's why I bought it just recently.\n\nI can say, it's really worth it. If you already watched the Anime, I think, you will not be disappointed. \nEven though it has no voice acting, the atmosphere is just great. I already watched the Anime, and I sometimes felt really uncomfortable, while I was reading this. I think, it's even more creepy when it has no voice, because your mind will give them their own voices if you have a sort of good imagination. \nThe BGM was used very well. There is no annoying track and every track comes up in the right moment. (The chirping sound of the 'higurashi', too) \nAnd I love the new character sprites, they look even better than in the Anime. If you like it more old school though, you can switch anytime to the old ones by the way. \nThe story is the best part about that game obviously. It's one of the best mystery stories that I've ever read/seen.\nFor people who didn't watch the Anime yet, it will be probably more interesting but on the other site more confusing, too.  The first four chapters belong to the Question Arc-Part of this series. These will give you from time to time more information about the village, the characters and other stuff. There will be no solution in the next time about this puzzle.\nBut I don't want to spoiler that much. \n\nYour money will not be wasted if you like mystery/psychological stuff (and/or Anime-related things) \nAt least for me, it was totally a good investment. \n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1468168306, "timestamp_updated": 1468168551, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.556336", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24190453": {"recommendationid": "24190453", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052073797", "num_games_owned": 352, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 24, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467405639}, "language": "english", "review": "Liar!!!!

It manages to make you feel completely immersed as you spend your first happy days in Hinamizawa and has you hanging onto your seat once you discover the gruesome mysteries that lie within. \n\nIt is rather long, seeing how each chapter takes around 14-16 hours to complete, but is well worth the price for those who don't mind sticking around till the end.", "timestamp_created": 1467515095, "timestamp_updated": 1467515095, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24005261": {"recommendationid": "24005261", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078317683", "num_games_owned": 941, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 1654, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467719491}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u5618\u3060\u30c3\uff01\uff01\uff01\u5618\u3060\u30c3\uff01\uff01\uff01\u5618\u3060\u30c3\uff01\uff01\uff01\u5618\u3060\u30c3\uff01\uff01\uff01\n\n\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u306e\u7acb\u3061\u7d75\u3092\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u3001\u4eca\u98a8\u306b\u5909\u66f4\u3067\u304d\u305f\u306e\u304c\u826f\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3002\n\n\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u7248\u306b\u53ce\u9332\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u30df\u30cb\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u304cSteam\u7248\u306b\u306f\u53ce\u9332\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044\u305f\u3081\u6ce8\u610f\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1467433669, "timestamp_updated": 1467533943, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.559567", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23990352": {"recommendationid": "23990352", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018682357", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 614, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471041253}, "language": "english", "review": "I've read this VN tons of times, and now that's it's finally on steam, I can read it even more.

After a while, those scares lose their impact, and by the time the game is over, I'm not scared, just annoyed.\n\nHigurashi succeeds where I feel a lot of horror games fail, it isn't right up in your face and it isn't always trying to scare you. It's an implicit psychological mystery, with most of the horror coming coming from uncertainty and your own mind.\n\nAlso, I was not a fan of Higurashi prior to playing this, though I didn't dislike it. I did read a lot of info on the series on TVtropes and saw some anime clips, but as I learned playing this, reading about it and actually experiencing it are 2 very different things.\n\nThe basic plot starts with someone killing 2 of his friends, the game then cuts to the events leading up to that. So you already know what's going to happen, it's just a matter of [i]how[/i] it happens.\n\nThe story itself takes place in a rural town called Hinamizawa, where our protagonist Keiichi moved about a month prior to the game's events. It seems like a happy place, his friends are all nice people, if not a little rough when it comes to games and teasing, but nothing looks to be wrong. However, after a certain and [i]very[/i] ambiguous point in the story, Keiichi begins a slow descent into paranoia. I say it's ambiguous because the exact point where it happens is really hard to figure out, which compounds the horror.\n\nThe music and graphics are pretty good. Being a Visual Novel, all of the characters are still images who don't really changes poses much, leaving their faces to do the talking. You can choose between the steam graphics (which are excellent), the original graphics (which look incredibly silly), or if you know how to mod stuff, there's one for the PS3 graphics (which also look excellent). The backgrounds look like real photos that have been heavily photoshopped to look more cartoony (lots of watercolor filters), which doesn't really bother me, though it might bother some. The music isn't what I'd call super memorable, but it does do a good job at giving you the proper mood for every moment of the story where it plays.\n\nThe visual presentation however, is somewhat awkward and takes a bit of getting used to. Instead of having the characters cover a good portion of the screen and have all the dialogue in a neat little box on the bottom of the screen like most Visual and Kinetic Novels, the text covers up the whole screen, including character portraits. This can break some people's immersion, especially when the text has to fade out for a second so the character sprites can change.\n\nThe lack of any choices can also turn some people away who were expecting to be able to actively participate in the games and story events.\n\nStill, I recommend Higurashi for fans of the horror genre, just be ready for a lot of reading.", "timestamp_created": 1467388828, "timestamp_updated": 1467388828, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501151", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23972322": {"recommendationid": "23972322", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084493559", "num_games_owned": 365, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 491, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467578242}, "language": "english", "review": "Colonel Sanders Statue/10\n\nOn a more serious note though, pick this game up.

[/b]\n\n[i] Monsters are real, and ghosts are real, too. They live inside us, and sometimes, they win. [/i]\n~Stephen King\n\n[h1] Introduction [/h1]\n\nI should start by saying that Higurashi is a visual novel, and it comes with all the limitations of the medium: there is absolutely zero gameplay (this is a hardcore novel, so prepare for heavy reading), the pacing can feel weird at times (a long story chopped up into eight pieces and released with half-year gaps will do that), you will probably get frustrated when your viewpoint characters do stupid things (believe me, they will do stupid things), and it is very Japanese (certain anime tropes might turn some off). That being said, these limitations are my only complaints. In terms of fear factor, setting, characters, and themes, Higurashi is one of the best horror stories I have ever experienced.\n\n[h1] Fear Factor [/h1]\n\nIt might seem weird to start with the actual scares when the game is so story-based and seemingly chipper. From the screenshots, you'd expect a harem romantic comedy, or at least something like it. However, Higurashi excels in presenting its scares slowly and tensely. From very early on in Onikakushi, the first chapter, the story gives tiny hints that Hinamizawa is not the arcadian paradise Keiichi Maebara seems to see every day. After the initial hints, the story takes its sweet time to develop the characters and get you attached to them. After a common turning point, all you've come to know and love will slowly crumble around you, and there will be tears of fear and sorrow. Higurashi is also quite creative in its selection of where the scares come from. There are dark gods, mad scientists, conspiracies, and plain old people going crazy. Regardless of the threat, it will be out of your control. This isn't a game with a world or a damsel to save; it's a tragedy of blood where everything can always get worse.\n\n[h1] Setting [/h1]\n\nHigurashi takes place in 1983 in the small, quiet town of Hinamizawa, a nice place where everybody knows everybody and the days pass by sleepily. Unless you happen to be in the know about certain traditions, that is. Hinamizawa is very, very simlar to the small towns in Stephen King's works: locals of Derry or Castle Rock will feel right at home. Like these other peculiar little towns, Hinamizawa shines in its dual presentation: it is a nice place to live, but it also has a few dark secrets. Hinamizawa has a dark, tragic, and fascinating history, and most of the story's complex mystery centers around the past tragedies of the town. However, you would never know from spending a random day in town. Hinamizawa is a place of youthful adventure as much as a place of tragedy. The sun is usually shining, our heroes are usually goofing off, and the people will stick up for one another. This two-faced nature only highlights the deep extremes the circumstances fall into. Hinamizawa will take you back to your childhood romps while also making you wonder if those campfire stories were really just stories.\n\n[h1] Characters (and a Brief Plot Intro) [/h1]\n\nHigurashi largely centers around the Game Club of Hinamizawa's one-classroom school. They're a rowdy, irreverant bunch of teenagers, but they're closer than family. The newest member (and only boy), Keiichi Maebara, is a city-slicker who has lived in Hinamizawa for a month now. Quick on his feet and good with words, Keiichi has found his crowd. Still, certain events cause him to suspect that his crowd is keeping very big secrets from him, and he starts to reconsider just how safe he is in this new environment. Higurashi features a small cast for a visual novel, but each character is given surprising depth, considering most are initially presented as stereotypes. Characters have tangible virtues and vices that have logical consequences as events unfold. All of this occurs without any player input, so the characters are forced to shoulder all the blame, and they react to this blame as flawed, complex people. Each character has his or her own dark secrets and insecurities, and all act differently when put under intense pressure. By the end of the first chapter, you will be wondering how you can know anyone when you don't even completely know the viewpoint character.\n\n[h1] Themes [/h1]\n\nHigurashi is a horror story in every sense of the phrase. It is crafted to inspire fear, and it is meant to be a story about fear. All of the previously mentioned elements of Higurashi serve to emphasize its main questions: what causes fear, what results from it, and what naturally opposes it? Does fear come by some divine decree, or is Stephen King right about where ghosts come from? Several visual novels place an abstract conflict as their centerpiece (e.g. Danganronpa and hope vs. despair), and Higurashi is no different. Higurashi's central theme is the struggle between fear and faith. Once characters lose their faith (familial, fraternal, religious, or humanist), the tragedy begins, but could they avoid tragedy by shutting out fear? Even if they could, what does that say about the strength of their faith? Is it then better to have no faith at all? Higurashi forces its characters to confront these questions while inviting the reader to do the same, and it doesn't make it easy. This is a series where the ghosts usually win, and victories are few and far between. Ultimately, it's up to you to decide who and what you will believe in.\n\n[h1] Closing Words [/h1]\n\nHigurashi is a horror and a tragedy, and it's quite skilled at both. I've been excited about the remastered Higurashi Hou for a long time now, and I can say that the fresh art, soundtrack, and translations have given new life to a modern classic. Onikakushi is the story's prologue: you'll discover the basic premise and general formula for the series, but be prepared for shakeups and a truckload of unanswered questions by the end of the chapter. As of writing, three of Higurashi's eight core chapters have been released on Steam. I highly recommend diving into this fable of fear, failure, and faith. Don't rush. Take your time. Immerse yourself in the world and invest in the characters.

The first instalment of the cult favourite visual novel which made developers 7th Expansion\u2019s name, Onikakushi is a prologue first and foremost, designed to get fans clamoring for more. It\u2019s purely linear; there are no choices of any kind. It also trades in anime cliches far too often in lieu of real character development, the writing is painfully overdone (as in, multiple paragraphs when one would do), the ending is fairly predictable and the protagonist takes forever to realize things are going badly wrong.\n\nThat said, this is still an engaging and surprisingly disturbing little story. For all the amateur presentation drags it down, and the way it blatantly shills the next chapter (\u201dBuy it or you\u2019ll never find out what\u2019s actually going on!\u201d), it\u2019s not hard to feel hooked. Keiichi, the young protagonist, has moved to the village of Hinamizawa with his parents, a tiny rural idyll where his bohemian father can pursue his painting career. But for all the village kids seem welcoming enough, Keiichi still hasn\u2019t quite adapted to country living, and when he starts asking questions about the area\u2019s tangled history, he swiftly begins to regret it.\n\nA gruesome murder case, and a fabled curse that strikes down any outsider the village\u2019s guardian deity doesn\u2019t care for\u2026 why do his friends seem to know more than they\u2019re letting on? Is he in danger? Not that it\u2019s that difficult to guess; there wouldn\u2019t be that much to get excited about, otherwise. Again, Onikakushi\u2019s biggest weakness is it\u2019s plainly not interested in explicitly detailing \u201cwhy\u201d, favoring atmosphere over anything too cerebral. The scene-setting is fairly thin, too; it reads like an anime fan\u2019s idea of how kids bicker among themselves.\n\nEven so, when the villagers finally drop their masks, it\u2019s scarier than one might expect - for all the gore and blank-eyed cartoon sociopathy, a couple of the scares are subtle enough to be genuinely unnerving, even playing in broad daylight. And though it\u2019s not hard to guess the ending, the journey there and the questions it raises are evocative enough to stick with you, for all the game\u2019s flaws.

Narration is really infantile and there are lenghty descriptions of completely irrelevant things. I get what they're trying to go for by setting that extremely clich\u00e9 anime mood and then revealing, little by little, that life in Hinamizawa isn't all that relaxing and fun, until it gets to a point when it's taken a 180\u00ba curve and turned into the creepy mystery story that people are actually here for. But it still would've been better had they cut some of that snooze-inducing crap at the start and inserted something else, like extra material content or CGs. \n\nAnyway, I still recommend it since the story does turn out to be interesting and somewhat creepy. The writing style near the second half of the game, particularly when describing Keiichi's paranoia, is enticing and has just the right amount of detail.

In terms of gameplay, you have the basic menu options and you also get to choose if you want to play with the old graphics or with the new and updated one. The game crashed a few times so make to save often, there are minor translation errors but nothing too big to affect your experience.\n\n[b]Price: 10/10[/b]\nThey are only asking for \u00a34.79 here, go and pick it up now and read one of the most anticipated horror mystery VN there is. You can also pay \u00a39.99 for both the first and second chapters.

I haven\u2019t finished the entire series yet since I am following the story as they are introduced on Steam, which is currently at its second chapter. However, I feel that the story of this chapter sets the tone perfectly for what the future chapters will be like. \n\nFor those who know what this series is famous for prior to playing this game, you will be surprised to see that it has a slow start. The first half of the game is comparable to a filler episode of a cartoon or anime. But after the first half is finished, it turns into a fast-paced thrill ride that gives you what you came here for.\n\nThe only thing I did not really like about the game is the user interface for the dialogues. It isn\u2019t like other visual novels where the dialogue is separated by the person who is speaking. It just fills the screen with text until there is no more room left. This makes it hard for to tell who is speaking at times. I know there are some user-created patches that adds voices, but I didn\u2019t know about it until after I finished the story.\n\nOverall, if you haven\u2019t bought this, why haven\u2019t you?

They have fully released this series complete in English but from what I heard their translation at the time wasn't good so they gave us a new better translation with new art.

I needed a few attempts to make it through the whole story, cause especially the beginning is really slow with much filling material which I personally disliked a lot. f.e. the chapter in which the hide-and-seek-game-thing-w/e was discribed... normally I like detailed texts more than such fast and illthought-out chucked-somewhere things, but at this passage I was so bored.. well yeah it was funny how rena tricked keiichi but I dunno, I think it was just a bit to excessivly.\n\nNow regarding the awesome things :D since the moment the story slowly starts getting thrilling (believe me - you'll notice that awesome moment) it mounts more and more... the confrontations with the other characters become more and more psychologically horrifying and sometimes you just can't believe what exactly is going on. The Musik fits perfectly in every moment (especially when your brain is already so fucked up because of those... let's call it.. stalking friends of yours). You can also 'hear them cry' nearly continuosly through the complete story - which guarantees that specific higurashi feeling *-*\n\nLike I said before I didn't have any clue what I should expect, I also didn't read any reviews. I just wanted to play that game cause it has to do sth with higurashi.

You're reading an oddly formatted book. I have no idea how this is a game. I have no idea how this is a visual novel either, really. A picture book has more visuals to it than this cheap thing does.\n\nThere are so many versions of these games, and I understand the original version had little content to it design wise, but that was only made by two people. I don't think this one has the same excuse. Why couldn't they at least stick in some cgs from the other versions??? Give us something to look at other than static characters and stock images with a PS filter over them!\n\nThe fact that they updated the character artwork isn't even a plus because it doesn't look that great. The anatomy is... terrible, especially on Mion. The old art has its own anatomical issues, but at least it has some charm to it. The new stuff just feels soulless and stiff.\n\nI'm going to try and play it to completion, but only because I don't want my thirteen bucks to go to total waste. :I\n\nHonestly, you're better off just watching the anime or reading the manga.

Even through it was boring at the begining with same thing it got more exited later on and the Ending made me think. I do belive it was the humans but with a Cult like this it does made me think that it made Keiitchi belive it was the Gods Curse. However when i watched the afterparty they were there and that made me laugh and think WTF!?! I laughed, closed the game, falled down on a floor with no balance and come to think of it.

I personally love to read fantasy books, and enjoy the anime style of drawing, but very few actual animes because they tend to not have any real depth to them. I requested a friend of mine for a suggestion, and he gifted me this. I just downloaded and started it up without getting into any reviews or anything other than reading that it was a \"sound novel,\" which I had no idea what that was nor did I really care.\n\nGetting into the game itself, I was a little confused at the introductory chapter at the funeral, but that tends to happen where you don't fully understand the setup that is occuring. Getting into the second chapter, I got really ticked off really quickly at Rena because she appeared to be your typical \"I can't do anything for myself\" female character, which I can't stand. Thankfully, this was rectified soon after... With a Mike Tyson lightning punch to the face. Not exactly what I was expecting...\n\nContinuing for the rest of the opening chapters, the character development was far better than I was expecting. The characters all mesh well together, and it feels like a bunch of school age friends playing games together. While going throughout a normal day, there a few somewhat quirky things that happen, such as Rena going to the dump to dig out Colonel Sanders, but nothing is jarring. It actually flows pretty well, but these stories of something happening a few years ago being all hush hush seems a bit funny, as well as this Tomitake-san character snapping pictures of people out in the middle of nowhere. Dude's a super creeper for sure.\n\nThe game starts to go into the main plot by starting to hint at what happened in Hinamizawa a few years ago. Some guy got dismembered? Damn, thats kinda scary. One of the perpetrators disappeared and they can't find him? Those police are definitely incompetent. And then the Watanagashi comes, the yearly ritual to praise the diety protecting the city. The anniversary of the dismemberment, where somebody has been killed every year since then. Totally not sketchy. It's obviously been a coincidence every year... Right?\n\nThe next day, everything is normal, everybody is having fun at school doing club activities. We've set up a brilliant plan with Rena to win, we just need a minute to set it up... Wait, there's somebody to see us? What happened last night?!? And my friends might be involved????? Yea, right. I'm going to believe some old guy I've never seen before over my friends. Ha. Cute. But they have been hiding some things from me... Maybe I should be a little leery about this. I'll just go talk with Rena a little bit after class.\n\nIf I had actually had a choice in this matter, it would qualify as the greatest mistake I had ever made. The music up until this point had been nice and fitting for all portions of the game. Walking and talking with Rena a little bit, it just goes dead silent. Rena asks a question, and I dodge it a little bit.\n\nLIAR!\n\nThis is where the demons came out in full force. I don't think I've ever been more scared than I was in that moment. I was terrified every time that the music went silent from here on in, and every time Oyashiro-sama surfaced, I was filled with the sense of dread of what horrors were coming. But I couldn't just leave it there. I had already become so invested in these characters, they meant something to me, I had to know that everything would be okay. They couldn't be involved in these mysterious deaths. They are my friends! This is all a hoax, right? RIGHT?!?!\n\nAnd this is just the prologue chapter of the story. I can't stand the horror genre across all mediums, but there's just something about Higurashi When They Cry that is calling to me. Are the Higurashi trying to tell me something? Are the victims trying to warn me to stay away? All I know is that I must go back to Hinamizawa.

The story arcs can end on a rather confusing note sometimes, but that's what makes you want to continue on into the next arc and eventually find out story answers.\n\nDefinitly a horror/mystery VN classic.", "timestamp_created": 1460359596, "timestamp_updated": 1460359596, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22351642": {"recommendationid": "22351642", "author": {"steamid": "76561198198638338", "num_games_owned": 230, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475162429}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8bb2\u771f\uff0c\u5728steam\u4e0a\u96be\u5f97\u80fd\u89c1\u5230\u4e00\u6b3e\u65e5\u7cfb\u6e38\u620f\u80fd\u652f\u6301\u65e5\u6587\u5b57\u5e55[spoiler]\u5f53\u6211\u73a9\u82b1\u543b\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u770b\u5230\u53ea\u6709\u65e5\u6587\u8bed\u97f3\u82f1\u6587\u5b57\u5e55\u6211\u7684\u5185\u5fc3\u662f\u5d29\u6e83\u7684[/spoiler]\uff0c[strike]\u5f53\u7136\u53ea\u73a9\u8279\u732b\u7684\u5c31\u5f53\u6211\u6ca1\u8bf4[/strike]\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bd2\u8749\u7684\u6b7b\u5fe0\u7c89\uff0c\u53c8\u6709\u4e00\u70b9\u65e5\u6587\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u8bdd\uff0c\u5176\u5b9e\u771f\u7684\u53ef\u4ee5\u8003\u8651\u8d2d\u4e70\u672c\u4f5c\u3002\u53ea\u662f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e48\u591a\u7ae0\u8981\u5206\u5f00\u6162\u6162\u51fa\u771f\u662f\u6025\u6b7b\u4eba\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e00\u7ae0\u8fd8\u90fd\u4e0d\u4fbf\u5b9c\uff0c\u5df2\u7ecf\u53ef\u4ee5\u770b\u89c1\u6ee1\u6ee1\u7684\u6076\u610f\u4e86\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1460346847, "timestamp_updated": 1460346847, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569536", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22344231": {"recommendationid": "22344231", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128485549", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 462, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460400200}, "language": "english", "review": "Cute girls doing not so cute things is a nice change of pace.

About half of the story deals with his daily life, and the other half deals with the mystery. \n\nI personally hated the setting of daily life part of the game. I found most of the main characters annoying/uninteresting (most are along the lines of 'cute anime school girls who do cute things') and I pretty much couldn't connect with any of them other than the MC. \n\nOn the other hand, I found the setting for the mystery part of the game great. I liked the whole 'sleepy village in the hills where strange things are happening' aspect, and I thought the details that went into the background really helped to immerse you in the mystery.\n\nIt is where the two of these parts come together that really didn't work for me. I have heard that for some, the alternation between the daily life and the mystery parts of the story and the gradual merging of the two as the plot builds up is what makes the whole VN work really well. In my case, I found that the contrast was too great and every time the story switched from the mystery to the daily life part, it lost the momentum that had been built up. My experience with this was probably affected in some part because I did not enjoy/connect with the daily life part of the story. The build up of the mystery plot is also slowed because of the division into the two parts, especially at the beginning of the game, and I was tempted to give up early on because of the balance of the two is so heavily skewed (~90:10 early game) towards the daily life part early on to build the overall setting.\n\nArt:\n\nPretty average backdrops for a VN, but they do the job and help to visually flesh out the setting. The use of heavily-filtered photos helps the reader to connect for a mystery VN such as this, in my opinion, and the use of different filters also helps to add atmosphere to the mystery parts of the story. The updated sprites look alright but I thought they were not the most appropriate for the characters as they are portrayed. I saw some of the sprites from the PS3 version of the game and they fit a lot better.\n\nSound:\n\nThe text of the story is accompanied by some decent sound effects and music (at times used to great effect for suspense, etc). Wouldn't say that the soundtrack stood out too much.\n\nOverall:\n\nThe overall experience provided by this VN was alright/good (6/10), but I would not recommend this game as it just did not work for me.

More exactly, what we have here is updated translated version, this one released by MangaGamer in 2015. I will talk about versions a bit later, scroll down if you want to read on them. Original visual novel was also called sound novel for some reason, I didn't find any good reason for that. At least no good reason to keep calling it that.\nHigurashi is divided into 8 chapters: 4 for \"questions\" arc and 4 for \"answers\" arc. And epilogue. And bonuses. Yea, you get only the first chapter of the question mark here. Don't worry, it itself has 12 in-game chapters and is overall a good read. And I heard that all of those chapters basicly restart the main story and do \"what if main hero did something else\". They still recommend to read it in chronological order.\nIt also was released for PS2, PS3, Vita, NDS. Oh, and there was anime. And manga.\n\nThe story follows a Keiichi, a normal guy who transferred into the village Hinamizawa along with his family. There he is going to make new friends four girls and have everyday fun, getting from one anime trope to another, with mixture of silly fun and challenges. Life will be good. Enjoy it while you can.\n\nBecause it's not going to last for long and some crazy dark stuff will start happening halfway through. The first half of it is pretty much a build-up, so don't expect much of interesting going on. Not to say that there are no sinister things rearing it's ugly head in the first half, but you will have to endure through a whole bunch of usual anime harem tropes which go on for a while. Hopefully you enjoy such things. Like I do. Then it will work out even better. More effective.\n\nBecause after the halfpoint, you will get wrapped into things that fall into tags \"mystery\" and \"horror\" and the storyline of the Higurashi novels will want you to keep guessing what is 'actually' happening. Especially since this one can be called as prologue. Don't worry, no big jumpscares. Just maybe music stingers. Or shockers. Whatever you call those. \nOooookay, there are also graphic descriptions of deaths/wounds. Geezes.\n\nNow that I told you that it's awesome, let's see what I found about various versions. Original version was Japanese-only, so somebody had to translate it. Most notably, it had silly minigames in extra. It also has really silly looking character drawing, looking a bit like kids drawings compared to everything else.\nAnd so MangaGamers licensed and translated it around 2009-2010. However, aside from removal mini-games and such, they also had to replace some of the tracks with their own made. Something with licensing issues.\n\nAnd now they are redoing the translation for Steam releases. This time they managed to retain the soundtrack as is. Not only that, but they also drew new character sprites, the ones that can be serious. I mean, when you put male character and female girl together, you can actually see huge difference in their body build and height. Though I noticed how green-haired girl, Mion, has a handbag with what looks like a pistol in one of her outfits in original sprites, while updated don't show it. But this handbag is never mentioned in text, so I don't know what to think. Otherwise, go for updated. Oh, you can switch to original if you want.\n\nTranslation also seems to be funky. They say that it's improved however, over previous MangaGamer release. Like, for some reason they keep saying things like \"-sana\" after name which has no place in proper English translations. One of the sentences even had \"(lol)\" written after it. I also sometimes was confused at what line belongs to what character on screen. There are no voiceover in PC releases, you know. Also, protip: if you see line starting with \"this old geezer\" then it's green-hairer girl, Mion, refering to herself.\nOtherwise, it does the job fairly well.\n\nThough, also should mention that Japanese world of gaming in meanwhile were doing their own things, porting this VN to consoles. Starting with PS2, then Nintendo DS and then over to PS3 and Vita, they brought voiceovers, their own updated art and some neat stuff, like special drawn scenes. Even adding new additional chapters. I even heard that some incorporated all the chapters together to act as interactive novel. Depending on choice, you will go either through one or another chapter. They also had backgrounds changed and updated for widescreen.\nSadly, it all remains untraslated and unpublished in the west.\n\nAnime is also the way that people in the west found out about Higurashi. Though from what I heard it cuts up some parts from VN and instead of suspension and atmospheric build-up focuses on shock and gore. Not to say that novel wasn't descriptive about wound, but gee. No care, sounds a bit like teenager bait if you ask me. Or at least VNs sound preferably.\n\nOverall, this visual novel is hot and cool and Steam version is cool and hot.

Beneath the veneer of a cheesy, run-of-the-mill school-comedy lies a cruel world of madness, terror, and violence. Major characters die routinely; sometimes on-screen, sometimes off, but never in a peaceful manner. Nonetheless, it is a highly compelling experience, and very rewarding if you can endure to the end of the series. If this intrigues you, feel free to read on, but those looking for nothing more than a stereotypical anime-harem-style rom-com would do well to look elsewhere. Higurashi may resemble that on a superficial level, but this is a series that delights in letting the reader think they know what is going on, even as it brings the fa\u00e7ade crumbling down around them. \n\nNow, then..\n\nEach chapter of Higurashi When They Cry is a seemingly self-contained story comprised of three distinct parts. The first is indeed a light-hearted slice-of-life comedy, centered around a mixed-age group of students living in a remote Japanese village in the early 1980s. Made up of four local girls and the protagonist, a boy who just recently moved into town, this group spends their time going to school, playing a variety of games together (usually under the threat of ridiculous and embarrassing penalties for losing), and generally goofing around. This relaxed, easy-going atmosphere \u2013 filled with ruthless card games, lunchtime chopstick duels, and treasure-hunting at an illegal garbage dump \u2013 appears at first glance to be utterly inviolate; a tranquil, serene place where nothing tragic could ever happen.\n\nInevitably, this atmosphere begins to sour, as the locals' carefully hidden secret \u2013 a four year long string of deaths and disappearances \u2013 starts to show through the illusion of a peaceful country village. Seemingly straightforward on the surface, with little reason to believe they may be connected, these incidents nonetheless have some disturbing things in common. The victims have some connection \u2013 albeit increasingly tenuous ones \u2013 to an old, hotly contested dam construction project. And each of these events occurred around the time of an annual religious festival held at the village shrine every June. While most try not to speak of them, particularly to outsiders, or pass them off as sad coincidences, these incidents invariably give rise to rumors of a conspiracy within the village to purge it of those perceived as enemies... Or, among the superstitious, of the curse of an angry god.\n\nFinally, the proverbial dam breaks and events begin to spiral out of control in a sudden, rapidly escalating drama of suspicion, violence, and murder, suffused with a pervasive psychological horror that straddles the line between a supernatural malice and one that is all-too-human in nature. Personal secrets are dredged up and sins exposed, showing characters the reader thought they knew in a very different light, while eerily echoing centuries old regional legends that speak of this place not as a quiet, insular community, but rather as a monstrous village of man-eating demons \u2013 oni, for those into Japanese mythology. Who is at fault? Is anyone at fault? Could the crime have been prevented? Do you even know what the crime is?\n\nAt times switching gears so seamlessly that you hardly notice and at others doing so with a deliberately jarring abruptness, these three elements combine together to gradually build an atmosphere of tension, terror, and inexorably approaching tragedy, even as they challenge the protagonist and reader alike to uncover the truth of what exactly is happening in this tiny mountain village.\n\nHigurashi When They Cry is a \u201cvisual novel\u201d in a stricter sense than most, known as a \u201ckinetic\u201d or \u201clinear\u201d visual novel that lacks player choice, as opposed to the more typical form of visual novel built around branching storylines. Gameplay amounts to the same kind of \u201cplayer interaction\u201d that can be experienced by reading a traditional mystery novel \u2013 gathering clues from the narrative, building and revising a theory, and attempting to reach the correct solution before the author reveals the answers in the end.\n\nAs previously mentioned, each chapter is essentially self-contained: covering roughly the same period of time; utilizing the same pool of characters (regardless of what may have happened to them in a previous chapter); and featuring the same general situation. Yet each story also differs in various ways. Different characters and their backgrounds take on the central roles. New characters are introduced and previously minor ones are expanded upon. Some plot elements are explained away, while others are unveiled for the first time. And ultimately, a new, unique chain of events is brought about, leading to its own distinct conclusion. Later chapters toy with this formula in various fashions, one notable way being by changing the protagonist to tell, or retell, the story from a different character's perspective. All together, this allows the reader \u2013 through repetition, of sorts \u2013 to gradually start to distinguish the events that are fixed, that are certain, from those that can change, what is real from what is illusion, and try to piece together the truth, perhaps even finding the miracle that leads to a happy ending somewhere along the way.\n\nWith each chapter seeming to have no bearing on the events in any of the others, this series can be understandably confusing for new readers, who will have difficulty working out exactly how the disjointed pieces are meant to fit together. In the interest of aiding those not yet \u201cin the know\u201d I will offer this, decidedly non-spoiler, interpretation: consider each chapter as a particular \u201cpath\u201d from a Choose Your Own Adventure book or branching-style visual novel, only written as its own individual story and given to the reader in sequential order. While not entirely accurate, this viewpoint should allow new readers to reconcile the apparent disconnect between chapters until such mysteries begin to be revealed in the series' second half.\n\nHigurashi is also described as a \u201csound novel\u201d, owing to the developer's emphasis on the use of background music and sound effects to help shape the atmosphere of each scene. This is done exceedingly well, although many of the better pieces of music start to appear in the later chapters. At the same time, the developer, 07th Expansion, and the game's author, Ryukishi07, are very much the Japanese equivalent of an indie studio, with Higurashi being their first project. Nowhere does this show through more than in the graphics. The background images are largely ordinary photographs with a filter over them and the original character sprites, while expressive and charming in their own way, are fairly amateur work. The character sprites can be switched out to updated, more professional ones in the options menu, if so desired.\n\nThere are some minor details regarding the translation that could use some polish, but overall it is a thoroughly engaging affair alternately capable of making the reader laugh out loud and sending a chill down their spine. After letting Onikakushi and Watanagashi sit unplayed on my desktop for months due to time constraints, I just recently powered my way through both available chapters, promptly reread the entirety of the manga series, then played Onikakushi through again. I'd have done the same for Watanagashi, but my love for Higurashi's quasi-sequel Umineko has flared up and stolen away my attention for the time being.\n\nAs a long time fan of the When They Cry franchise, my only complaint is that the next chapter isn't out yet. If you have even a moderate tolerance for what one prominent video game critic refers to as \u201cAnime Bull****\u201d, I cannot recommend this series highly enough.\n\nWelcome to Hinamizawa.\n\n...\n\n...Is anyone else hearing footsteps behind them? *absently scratches neck*", "timestamp_created": 1453935393, "timestamp_updated": 1461719146, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 71, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.840787", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20790233": {"recommendationid": "20790233", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057795587", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 778, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1434596206}, "language": "english", "review": "Bought this game to find out when they cry.

But Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni managed to hit exactly the combination of creepy suspense. You start of as a transfer student in a rural village and join a club of all girls that play games. So much for anime tropes. The first part game focuses on introducing the characters and their antics. Then there is a cultural festival (moar tropes) and something bad happens. Gradually you become aware that there is something going on. The village is not what it seems...\nThey know. They know that you know. And they are coming for you!\n\nI knew little beforehand about the Higurashi series only that it was supposed to be one of THE visual novels. I was probably misinformed that it would be gory, but the game instead focuses much more on suspense, mystery and character driven creepyness. \nThe graphics are spartan, but the character sprites serve their purpose well. I liked the new redrawn one much more than the original ones (probably would have quit if there had been only the old ones), but the choice is yours.\nThe music was my personal highlight. There are not many tracks, but they hit the spot every time.\nThe story is well written and believable (for horror games). There are however no choices or alternate routes, so there is not much replayability.\n\nAlll in all, a definite recommendation!

Higurashi takes another path: psychological horror. And that was a wise choice because Ryukishi07 (the original author) knows, what he does.\n\nFirst off the story and characters. They're both great. While this is just the prologue for the series, it introduces the main characters, characterizes them more or less (each chapter is dedicated to one/two) and builds up an incredible atmosphere. The story is set in Hinamizawa, where around 1000 people live, and is a rural area. Not crowded places, but barely crossed streets are  a common thing. The protagonist, Keiichi Maebara, moves into this town. He goes to a school, that has about 20 students, and befriends some of them. Seems like a light atmosphere. But it isn't. An incredible aspect of Higurashi is the sudden turn of mood, that surprises and overwhelms you. You think, you can relax and nothing happens, but in the next moment, you're scared to death. While this may sound exaggerating, if you're focused on the story, you will experience these moments. And this level of writing is on another level. You will experience even more overwhelming developments during the next chapters, but that is another story.\n\nThe mood is supported by the music. While it's not that great, it expresses the mood in a way, that the reader feels like that too. Unfortunately, there is no voice acting even though this is a reworked chapter. That's really disappointing.\n\nThe sprites are another noticeable aspect. In my opinion, they fit the story, aren't too crazy, but aren't too normal as well. Some sprites will even send a chill down your spine (yes, I'm looking at you, Rena).\n\nWhile the chapter will leave you with nothing but questions, the chapter itself is well executed. I can recommend it to every fan of the Higurashi anime series as well as thriller fans. See it for yourself.

The story is set in the small town of Hinamizawa, focusing mostly on the local school and its students. \nThe plot revolves around Maebara Keichi, the only male in his small group of friends, at least half of which have crushes on him. Over the course of this and subsequent chapters, Keichi and co. become involved in all sorts of typical hijinks, while learning more about friendship and the importance of trust. This formula is taken for a slight curve-ball near the end, as they have to take down a cartoonishly evil villain with the help of a character whome I can only assume is based off the main character in Home Alone. \nAs a typical slice-of-life story, this is a perfectly adequate entry into the genre. My only complaints would be that the romance options don't really go anywhere, and the odd shifts in tone when the story detours into what I assume to be dream sequences. Despite this, I found this to be quite enjoyable to wind down with at the end of the day.\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1452333370, "timestamp_updated": 1452333370, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20408022": {"recommendationid": "20408022", "author": {"steamid": "76561198267420770", "num_games_owned": 133, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 625, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452971082}, "language": "english", "review": "I have yet to watch the anime for this series. In fact, this is my first time experiencing the Higurashi series, except for a few short clips that I've seen from the anime. I recently got into reading visual novels (even though this one refers to itself as a \"sound novel\". Even so, I'm pretty sure it counts as a visual novel), and I can say, they won't appeal to everyone, since many just want to play a game that's a game, and a book that's a book. However, I never took that much enjoyment in reading actual novels (I find it hard to pay attention while reading, usually), so a visual novel appeals more to me, since I'm required to click, which helps keep my attention. \n\nThe first 3-5 hours or so features little story, and mainly focuses on anime tropes. I personally didn't mind this section too much, since it got me to know the characters better. However, I can see how someone would take little enjoyment in this section of the \"game\". \n\nThe second half of the visual novel is where the story really gets started. I thought that this section was done very well.  I found myself surprised at how uncomfortable I could feel from mostly words, sounds, and also a few pictures. The atmosphere in this visual novel is done quite well in my opinion. I felt immersed in the village of Hinamizawa, even though all I had to do was click and read. \n\nAs soon as I was reaching near the end of this chapter, I knew that I wanted to read the next. Originally, I thought I would just go on to watch the anime, but now, I'm very curious to read more of the visual novel. \n\nOverall, I highly recommend buying this \"game\" if you are alright with just clicking and reading.

The game refers to itself as a prologue and there is too much left unknown by the end that I don't really feel like I have any sense of closure.  \n\nWith only two parts of the eight parts translated and on STEAM at this time, I'm not sure it would be wise for those on the fence to jump on this now.  I might suggest waiting until more have been released and then trying the game when you can either get a bundle or the first couple on sale.\n\nThe art itself is great, the characters really likeable and interesting and the mystery is an interesting one, but I'm not sure the game knows what genre it wants to be.  The first 2/3's or so is an enjoyable slice of life Visual Novel with the last portion acting as a thriller.  I state thriller here because I went in expecting horror, but it really wasn't as scary as I had hoped or expected (and I'm not exactly the bravest when it comes to horror games).  \n\nOne final piece is that the game isn't really a game in that it does not allow any interactions aside from advanced text and watching some mildly interesting extra scenes called \"TIPS\", so bare that in mind if you prefer something a little more active.

It is a horror/mystery, so there are dark themes in this game - YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!\n\n[h1]STORY:[/h1] - [b]May be Spoilers! - again, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED[/b]\nThe story has a slow start (kind of) but definitely speeds up before the halfway mark.\nIt focuses on Keiichi Maebara, a 16-year old student who has moved to the rural village of Hinamizawa with his parents due to his father's work as an artist. After living there for about a month, Keiichi has gotten used to the life there with his new friends: Rena Ryuugu, Mion Sonozaki, Satoko Houjou, and Rika Furude. While everything appears normal with the village at first, Keiichi learns from a visiting photographer, Tomitake, about some mysterious murders which occur each year. What makes it even stranger is that Rena and Mion, when asked about it, deny the existance of them. Days pass and the anual Cotton Drifting (Watanagashi) festival approaches, and Keiichi finds out from Tomitake and and a friend of his that the murders are supposedly tied to a curse from the village's god, Oyashiro-sama.\n\nFollowing the festival, Keiichi is visited by a police detective, Ooishi, who alerts to him about [spoiler]the death of Tomitake, and the disappearance of his friend[/spoiler]. Keiichi is told that this is a result of the curse, and is warned by Ooishi that he could be next. Although skeptical at first, Keiichi begins to become paranoid about his surroundings, and begins to become suspicious of Rena and Mion, who begin acting strangely. \nWhat will happen to Keiichi? Are Rena and Mion up to something? Is the curse real? Will I stop asking all these questions? Find out the answer to all of them (except the last one) in this chapter!\n\n[h1]ART AND SOUND:[/h1]\nIt is worth mentioning that all the character sprites that appear in the game have been redesigned by MangaGamer, however you can switch between the original and new sprites if you wish. The sprites from the Playstation versions can be used through use of mods, although I personally don't see anything wrong with botht he old and new sprites. All of the backgrounds and music remain the same as the original, and that I find is good, as it helps preserve the feel that the sound novel is supposed to give. \n\nOne part I am disappointed with is that there are no CG images used, unlike most visual novels. Some parts of the game would be better with CG images in my opinion, and it confuses me as to why MangaGamer didn't include any, considering they went through the effort to redesign the character models. If you wish to view CG images, I believe there is a patch that adds in the ones from the Playstation versions, although the game is still good without them.\n\n[h1]OTHER NOTES:[/h1]\nThe story takes roughly 10 hours or so to finish, which is short compared to many visual novels. This is due to that this is only chapter 1 of the game. For the complete story, there are 8 chapters, 4 question arcs and 4 answer arcs. At the time of writing this review, only the first two chapters are released (Onikakushi and Watanagashi), with chapter 3 currently being translated. More games are on their way, although they don't affect the main story.\n\n[h1]RATING:[/h1] Buy and Play. 9.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1451841282, "timestamp_updated": 1451841335, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20262305": {"recommendationid": "20262305", "author": {"steamid": "76561198174763695", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 580, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451873688}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u9996\u5148\u6211\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u82f1\u6587\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0d\u591f\uff0c\u82f1\u6587\u65e5\u6587\u90fd\u73a9\u4e0d\u4e86\u7684\u5bd2\u8749\u8ff7\n\u4f46\u662f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u771f\u7231\u7c89\u80af\u5b9a\u4e70\u4e70\u4e70\uff0c\u62ff\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u6210\u5c31\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u6211\u8fd9\u5c31\u73a9\u6c49\u5316\u7684\u76d7\u7248\u53bb\u4e86\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1451840808, "timestamp_updated": 1451840808, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.593538", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20244982": {"recommendationid": "20244982", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079262397", "num_games_owned": 191, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 897, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455003748}, "language": "english", "review": "I watched the anime first way back when I was in middle school, now 6 or 7 years ago.

There are jokes and club activity scenes that didn't make it into the anime at all.  The story and backstory of Hinamizawa is given way more detail.\n\nIf you've seen the show, or have read the VNs before, on reread, you'll notice so many hints and minor details that clue in at what's actually going on, and it's really satisfying.\n\nIf you're completely new to the series, you'll probably be confused about what's actually going on by the end of the game, but let me assure you that Higurashi is one of the few works I've seen where absolutely every loose-end is tied up by the end of the adventure.  \n\nThe translation is really good, way better than the original localization MG put out years ago, and I'm glad they redid it.  The new sprites are also really pretty, and I actually prefer them to the PS3 versions.  The photo-filtered backgrounds don't bug me, but from what I understand, it's easy enough to patch in the PS3 backgrounds with a little googling. \n\nWhen I first saw that MangaGamer was going to charge $5-10 per part, I was a little skeptical, but since picking up and playing parts 1 and 2, I'm eager to throw my money at them for the rest.", "timestamp_created": 1451033668, "timestamp_updated": 1451033668, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497322", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19918681": {"recommendationid": "19918681", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141448693", "num_games_owned": 329, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 834, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432575687}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Higurashi When They Cry es el inicio a una saga de novelas de suspenso, en el que tu (Keiichi Maebara) inicia su vida en un pueblo distante a la ciudad.

Higurashi is different because it doesn't take \"generic\" horror cliches such as extreme amounts of gore or jump scares. If you've watched the anime or played the VN already, yes, I agree, it does take a while to get to the scary parts. But the build-up and the contrast makes it worth it. If you went into this game blind without even reading the description, you might even start to think it's just another romance visual novel. The lightheartedness of the beginning contrasting with the slowly ascending terror makes reading and continuing addicting. \n\nI played the game with the voice patch installed. However, Higurashi is by origin a sound novel, where just the sounds alone are capable of giving you a great experience. But do yourself a favor and install that voice patch anyway. The voices help bring the characters to life, and it helps set the mood with the cute to evil switches.\n\nIf you've never experienced Higurashi When They Cry before, you're in for a ride. One playthrough won't be able to satisfy all the countless questions going through your head after the ending.

La m\u00fasica de las sagas de preguntas son canciones libres encontradas en Internet, mientras que la m\u00fasica de las sagas de respuestas fueron recibidas por parte de fans que hab\u00edan realizado un d\u014djin.\n\n[h1]Opini\u00f3n personal:[/h1]\n\nHigurashi When They Cry es una novela que definitivamente tienes que leer. Posee una mezcla de momentos divertidos, momentos de tensi\u00f3n, de misterio y de terror.\n\n[h1]Historia[/h1]\n\nDe lo mejor. Hay variedad de personajes muy buenos. La historia tiene muchos detalles, lo cual me ha gustado. El misterio es exelente y este cap\u00edtulo al igual que los pr\u00f3ximos tres, nos ir\u00e1n creando m\u00e1s y m\u00e1s dudas.\n\n[h1]Sonido[/h1]\n\nSu banda sonora es incre\u00edble, simplemente exelente. He disfrutado mucho leyendo con la m\u00fasica de este juego.\nEl punto malo de esto es que no tenga voces como la versi\u00f3n de PS2 o PS3 ( no culpo a MangaGamer, porque licenciarlas es algo muy costoso).\n\n[h1]Gr\u00e1ficos[/h1]\n\nSus \"sprites\" (es decir el dise\u00f1o de personajes) son muy buenos.

None but one of the card games have impact on the story ... at least not in the first chapter.\nThe 2nd half, on ther hand, is brilliant.

(In fact, its the first visual novel i've read in my life as well. Don't ask me why.)\n\n[contains minor spoiler]\nIt's full of twisted horror which is far more gruesome than keiichi getting punished after a card game. The story at first, like everyone said, is just a flow until the day of the festival. From there, the main characters starts to feel suspicious and things start to fall apart as Keiichi attempts to find the truth behind the dam incident.\n\nAs he learns the mystery, the incident somehow points toward his friends who might be involved with the incident. Learning about their background, the story changes from a friendly atmosphere into a nightmare. So much so that Keiichi knew that he will endanger himself for knowing too much about the truth.\n\nExpect the unexpected things, i've tried to predict what is going to happen next, yet the outcome is always unexpected especially towards the end. You will end up asking yourself: What is the main cause of the entire tragedy? Is the curse to be blame or is it's someone behind all this. You'll never know even if you finish reading the first chapter. You'll definitely want to get the next chapter if you want to know more about it. Btw, Rena is scarier although she is very kyute. \n\n[Overall]\nWhat a read! I'm glad i purchased both chapters from the recent Autumn sale, i've already finished reading the first chapter and i definitely going to read the next. Despite the fact that this is just only a prologue, it's pretty much scarier than you can think and always give you a creep when you head for bed.

However, when you start to discover more strange things and went into the long-lasting deep dark secret which is still on Hinamizawa, you will face a totally different feeling. Fear. Feeling afarid from all other people, even the one who can understands you. You try your best to go through life-endangering events, but at last you will face yours or the other's final moment. As the one you beloved tries to kill you , you realized that your own destiny is set already when you moved into this town.\nIn the anime version of this chapter, Keiichi killed Rena and Mion with a bat which was owned by Satoko's brother. Then , he got affected by the \"power\" ( later mentioned as ghost power , alien-power or alien virus ) and killed his own self when he tries to tell the old policeman ( which visited their school for multiple times ) about the secret of Hinamizawa through a public phone.", "timestamp_created": 1449056705, "timestamp_updated": 1479196032, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.666953", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19425559": {"recommendationid": "19425559", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987593024", "num_games_owned": 316, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 581, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464423927}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Esta buena la historia, pero no se si cuenta como \"juego\"", "timestamp_created": 1449012387, "timestamp_updated": 1449012401, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19422706": {"recommendationid": "19422706", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101044214", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 763, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509233977}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this series! this translation is really good and I can't wait for more!", "timestamp_created": 1449003895, "timestamp_updated": 1449003895, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19387846": {"recommendationid": "19387846", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057328775", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 467, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448624472}, "language": "english", "review": "Top 10 Fu*ked Up Anime Deaths", "timestamp_created": 1448889536, "timestamp_updated": 1448889536, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19382002": {"recommendationid": "19382002", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023056666", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 715, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449207222}, "language": "english", "review": "(( Hey all,\n\nWell, I wasn't sure what to expect from \"Higurashi: When They Cry, Chapter 1\", but I saw it was on sale, and figured I would give it a shot.

I can't really say anything, without spoiling the story, but it is well worth the price of admission.  \n\nThe story is solid blend of daily-life, mystery, suspense, murder, horror, macabre, legends, myths, and ghost tales.  While it takes a spot to get used to how the characters \"talk\"(since it isn't voiced), the translation is very well done, and helps give the cast their own, unique personalities.  Chapter 1 focuses mostly on the interaction of three members of the cast, and my understanding is later chapters flesh out the rest of the townsfolk of Hinamizawa.  Music and sound effects are blended into the show to help with the immersion of the story.

casual fan who's popped in and out of the mood for Higurashi goodness and found this incredibly misleading. \"A VN Higurashi game\" Steam said? Well I'll be damned, this sounds like the perfect idea for Higurashi. I bet I could make the right choices for a happy ending with Rena on my first run, I imagined.\n\nBut in truth it's really not a game but a literal visual novel, with no form of interaction, options, endings and so on. While the elite fanatics will argue with me (as if I mocked Jesus Christ himself) that VN's don't have to be games and that I should practically be ashamed of ever wanting a Higurashi game. Just calm your tits people, just because I don't like this approach doesn't mean I dislike the franchise.\n\nListening to the hardcore fans yell at me still makes my neck itch as I had at first asked about the game. Something simple like \"Okay I've read over 2 hours of story, when do I get the options?\" only to get talked down to by uppity folks like a condescending mother talking down a kid. \"Choices? What do you think your playing? Higurashi has no 'options' only story! God, why do these casuals always think a VN is a game?\" Oh I dunno...because most of them are? In anycase I was pretty screwed as I had hit the 2 hour marker and couldn't get a refund. however it wouldn't be lady like of me to complain about wasted money.\n\nIn anycase while the story is great, I just don't like how it's being delivered. If you're like me at all, you'd think given how it is, Higurashi could make for a really awesome Choice making game. Frankly I'd rather just buy the Manga or Anime. More expensive sure but I'll be more satisfied with those.

I love Higurashi, it's an amazing series, but I didn't get what I expected from this and it could have been so much more than what they chose to do with it. That being said I do like the extra character input they give you after your done in extras even though it does break the 4th wall. This isn't a game. You don't get any choices, nothing is different from the anime. All you do is click through hours of dialog that brings nothing new to the table really. They don't even show a picture or anything for the scary parts. Part of what makes Higurashi so scary is the visuals, actually seeing the crazy and watching it happen. I would highly reccomend just watching the anime or if you do like to read, read the manga. This is a poorly transfered novel with a handful of blurred backrounds and character figures placed over that look like they were cut strait out of the anime.

The story is set to a great pace, and they don't just dive into the horror aspects right off the bat, like some games. I recommend this game very much, but there are and will be some gripes in my review, and those are mostly with the backgrounds not being updated and the UI not getting a new look. The backgrounds are from the first sound novel and as such give it a nostalgic value (for those who played the first game), it doesn't clash too badly with the new sprites, but updating them would've been nice, to at least match the updated sprites better. The UI is the same UI as the first game, it doesn't really need to be changed functionality wise more so get a cleaner and more modern look, its simple and effective (which I like) but giving it a newer, more polished and cleaner look would've been great. I have heard of a PS3 patch, but i dont like messing with/modding and possibly breaking the game (a far to common problem with New Vegas and other games, though to a different scale, considering this is a sound novel) and no voices are fine with me, it doesn't take away from any of the characters since i havent listened to their anime voices that much nor any of their updated game voices. No complaints about the sprites, love them. Would do the patch for the updated backgrounds, but then i have to do everything else in the patch, which i don't feel like doing. Glad i grabbed it on sale, but $5 maybe $6 max seems like a good price point for this sound novel series, hoping Mangagamer doesn't get too greedy. There are also very minor translation issues, does not take away from the game, but is a nuance when first seen. I would also now like to point out the weird use of censoring later in the game, not in the tips but in the actual dialogue or Monologue.\nand my time with it is because i keep leaving it open when I sleep xD.", "timestamp_created": 1446337118, "timestamp_updated": 1446378217, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18782212": {"recommendationid": "18782212", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982210063", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1596, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461288664}, "language": "english", "review": "Truly a bone-chilling story that really gets you physiologically connected to the events that are happening over the story.

The story starts off odd, but then has a ncie 'slice of school life' feel to it.   Well,  thats where it sets you up for thinking that this will be a nice, happy story with no horror at all.  But thats where it starts because about half way through, you learn of a few, mysterious events and eventually, certain people die and well, I can't say too much more since it would spoil things and even the ending of Ch 1 leading to Ch2 is a spoiler in itself.     \n\n\nWhat Higurashi does best at, is telling a story that sets things up for future reference and by that, I mean that there are things that are said that might not seem like much, but will later get revealed as having a deeper or darker meaning to it.  I'm struggling to write a good review since I'm very very much a Higurashi fan since I've read all the VN for the main series, watched al the animes, and well yeah.   \n\n\nAnyway, to put it short, Hgiurashi, is an amazing horror and psychological visual novel that is perfect for those who enjoy a good, kind of slow paced story.

When you're fully immersed in a state of mind where your attention is drawn, or rather forced towards a source of fear and terror, the unpleasantness serves to pull your mind away from a life of deadlines, chores and unfulfillment. In that sense, it's a lot like drenching bland food in plenty of hot sauce - sure, your mouth may sting to high heaven, but at least you don't have to taste what you're eating.\n\nIn that sense, Onikakushi drew me in hard. The premise isn't anything that original (an insular country town with a dark history harbours an unpleasant secret that you stumble upon by chance) but the execution is exceptional. The degree to which it pulls you into the psychological state of doubt, terror, helplessness, paranoia and delusion is so extensive that I experienced horrible acid flashbacks at no less than four points in the story. By the time it was over, I felt tangible relief.\n\nThe main plot takes a while to get going - the buildup takes up almost half the story and is composed almost entirely of dumb anime tropes, if that sort of thing might turn you off (personally, I'm fine with it), but the payoff is well worth it.

coming from someone who considered the anime a personal favorite. The Visual Novel is so much better.\n\nFirst, there's the content. If you're a fan of Higurashi, chances are you know there are around 8 arcs in the main story. This one covers the first arc, Onikakushi. While this means you'll have to wait for the other arcs (if they ever get released on Steam), this will eat up a good chunk of hours to finish. This is a lot more compared to the four episodes in the anime, which has around 4 episodes in its first arc. \n\nAlso, almost all of the content serves some purpose, whether its building relationships between characters, or showing the thoughts behind them that tear them apart. The story is pretty well-written, and while it does take some time for things to get serious, when it does, it's really good. I should probably also mention sound design. It contributes really well to the atmosphere, especially during some of the more tense moments. One moment you'll be hearing happy slice-of-life music, and the next, you'll be hearing ominous piano pieces with cicadas in the background. It's kind of hard to get immersed in the more frightening parts without sound, so I recommend not reading it on mute.\n\nUsually when this thing is on sale, it's around a dollar or two off, so there's no big need to wait until a sale hits.

Seeing the story through to the end will keep your interest piqued and waiting anxiously for chapter 2. Despite the dark ending, there is a scene afterwards in the extras section that provides some much needed denouemont.\n\nHigurashi is not so much a game, or even a choose-your-own-story game, but a strictly linear narrative (a Kinetic Novel). That might sound disapointing to some, but it uses surprisingly effective writing, artwork, music, and sound effects to balance both levity and growing tension. It even controls the pace of the dialogue to ensure that jokes and terrifying revelations are delivered at the right moment.\n\nI don't want to describe what's going on because discovery is part of the fun of a good mystery or horror story, so I'll leave you with some of the things I learned from Higurashi: \n\n- A happy childhood is a wonderful thing to have. Cherish it while you have it, or at least help others experience it.\n- Life is like a game you play where the other players don't give you all the rules up front, including the following rule.\n- If your opponents set out to win by any means necessary, you must match them.\n- Even the greatest of fortunes can be reversed instantly.\n- Today's adversaries can become tomorrow's friends, and vice versa.\n- Fight with all your might. \n- Always think outside the box and around the problem.\n- When someone warns you that you are asking too many questions, you just might be. Ask yourself if your life depends on you NOT knowing the answers you seek.\n- Girls are scary when they get mad. DON'T ---- WITH THEM. (or, Hell hath no fury...)\n- Know who your real friends are. Stick by them when they need you. Forgive them when they've hurt you, for your sake as well as your own.\n- If you think either that people are out to get you, that you are cursed by a supernatural force, or that you're simply having a psychotic episode, drop what you're doing and get help. \n\n\n I dare you to play this game late at night, in the dark, when you should be asleep...", "timestamp_created": 1438809852, "timestamp_updated": 1438809930, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528586", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17399667": {"recommendationid": "17399667", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070735462", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 63, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442486618}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u3059\u3070\u3089\u3057\u3044", "timestamp_created": 1438784796, "timestamp_updated": 1438784796, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17381662": {"recommendationid": "17381662", "author": {"steamid": "76561198163279908", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 600, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1438548318}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of the titles that is known to a lot of anime fans. 13 years after it initial publication we can now buy it on Steam. \nAs a first chapter it makes a good job of introducing characters and background information on Hinamizawa. \n\nPros:\n- nice, new character artwork\n- music and sound effects create great atmosphere \n- great beginning to a longer mystery series\n\nCons:\n- it's a sound novel, so no choices to make (just treat it as reading a regular novel)\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1438688420, "timestamp_updated": 1438688420, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17373251": {"recommendationid": "17373251", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068760618", "num_games_owned": 142, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 909, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1438635706}, "language": "czech", "review": "Rozhodn\u011b se vyplat\u00ed si to proj\u00edt.

I recommend this game if you want to get a new experience, a new story to read or just simply try something completely new. 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1437100147, "timestamp_updated": 1437100147, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17083581": {"recommendationid": "17083581", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048394982", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 70, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1437088777}, "language": "english", "review": "play the game, read the manga, watch the show. yes", "timestamp_created": 1437086540, "timestamp_updated": 1437086540, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17060334": {"recommendationid": "17060334", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001650469", "num_games_owned": 2347, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 601, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1435985688}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uad82\uc774 \uc774\uac78 \uc368\uc57c\ub420 \uc774\uc720\uac00 \uc788\uc744\uae4c \uc2f6\uc744\uc815\ub3c4\ub85c,\n\uc54c \uc0ac\ub78c\uc740 \ub2e4 \uc544\ub294 \ubb34\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc9c0\ud558\uac8c \uc720\uba85\ud55c \uc18c\uc124.\n\n\ub0b4\uac00 \uc774\uac78 10\ub144\uc804\uc5d0 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\ud588\ub294\ub370, \uc774\uc81c\uc57c \uc2a4\ud300\uc5d0 \ub728\ub2e4\ub2c8..OTL", "timestamp_created": 1436968013, "timestamp_updated": 1436968013, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506722", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17038539": {"recommendationid": "17038539", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998174935", "num_games_owned": 348, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455478135}, "language": "english", "review": "Higurashi is all about the juxtaposition of those cheerful, carefree moments and the utter isolation of paranoia.

It seemed like a slice of life sort of deal UNTIL the watanagashi. This is the turning point of the story and things start to hit the fan from there. CH.1 starts to sweep some characters under the rug and i was kinda intrested to see how they would play into the whole \"shit hitting fan\" situation..but was sad to see they did not get much mention in the later chapters. The horror was pretty intense and the sounds lended themselves pretty nicely, adding diffrent audio distortions really tingled my spine and the overall mystery of what was going on made me keep reading. I kept reading only to be kinda disapointed by the ending..The ending wasn't bad (its pretty dark but not terrible at all) but it jut didn't answer questions that needed answers! After compleing the story the first time, you unock a little \"cast party\" thing, which was SUPER great to see and was a really nice pallete cleanser to the events that just hit me like a ton of bricks.

I'm an anime person rather than a manga person, because I like listening to Japanese voices and watching the gainaxing, among other things.  I expected a visual novel to be a step down from anime, but maybe a step above manga.  I could not be more wrong; playing Higurashi as a visual novel felt much better than watching the anime!  I don't mind that the anime is kinda low budget compared to other popular animes, and I enjoyed it very much.  However, I enjoyed the visual novel much more.  I got more attached to the characters in the visual novel, which made it much more engaging and feelsy.  Also, it is a very different experience playing as Keiichi, rather than watching everyone in the third person.  Reading his every thought is an important part of Higurashi that wasn't as strong in the anime.

I remember watching the 2nd season when it was currently airing and having an episode be cancelled due to an axe murder in Japan. Nostalgic times. Nice boat\u2013wait, that\u2019s School Days.\n\nHigurashi takes a while to start, but what makes it amusing to me is how cute and innocent it all is in the beginning. Compared to other visual novels, this one is linear with no routes or choices for you to choose, so there is no need to worry about making mistakes. The point of saving is merely to bookmark.\n\nBackgrounds are photographs with filters applied to them, but I recently learned this is quite common with VNs, especially if they\u2019re older such as Higurashi(2002). Those who are bothered by it should install the PS3 mod. I played without it, but wish I knew about it earlier. \n\nThe game is mostly character portraits and text. There aren\u2019t pictured scenes that depict crucial moments in the story, but Higurashi is more of a sound novel than a visual novel, I think. Sound novels rely more on sound effects and text. I think it\u2019s great if you can be spooked just by a description and a sound cue. I have a bit of a guilty pleasure for them. Other sound novels I would recommend are Banshee\u2019s Last Cry(Kamaitachi no Yoru), 999: Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors, and Virtue\u2019s Last Reward. A horror VN I would recommend in general is Saya no Uta, but that has um.. H-scenes.\n\nAnyways some people might not like the story or think it\u2019s over the top ridiculous. That\u2019s fine.

It's perfectly understandable, but its obvious that a lot of things were literally translated, so the structure of certain sentences isn't too good. Keiichi, the protagonist, also tends to ramble on and on in a lot of cases, and his questions about what's happening around him quickly become redundant, and i'd wish the game would move on sooner than it normally does with certain things.\n\nNevertheless, this is a good starting point for Higurashi newbies, just to get a little taste of what's Higurashi about, and maybe it'll encourage you to go and watch more of the story via different sources.

Please uncover the truth. That is my only desire.\n\nThe \"When they cry\" series is not anything new, it has been around for quite a while (over a decade if memory serves).

The Higurashi series is not the most happy one, but it is in my experiences one of the most compelling mystery stories out there. The more you read the deeper you delve into the story the better it gets. It feels a bit slow at first but it picks up.\n\nAs others have mentioned the average person looking into this will see \"Chapter 1\" and think to themselves \"Well I don't know about this\". This is just part one of many in the series and each Chapter isn't exactly short. \n\nAnother thing worth mentioning is that this version of the visual novel lets you choose between updated character art and original character art. The updated character art is very very good, the screenshots show this. \n\nRemember that this is a Visual Novel, you don't get to \"pick your path\" through the story, there are no \"Quick-time events\" or anything such as that.

This was acceptable in 2002 when the sound novel was originally released, but it comes off as extremely lazy in 2015. \n\nAs for what was updated, the new sprites are a mixed bag. There's so much space between everybody's eyes, this causes some character's faces to look very strange (Rika and Mion being hit the hardest by this). On the flip side, Satoko has never looked better (can't wait to backpeddle that statement when Tatarigoroshi comes out..). Rena's artwork is all on point as well (even though she really could have used a sprite with her holding her axe...), which is great, seeing how she has the larger role in this chapter.\n\ntl;dr get the ps3 patch and cry that you're paying MangaGamer $6 for an inferior chapter", "timestamp_created": 1435342099, "timestamp_updated": 1435342099, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 82, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.684804", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16716844": {"recommendationid": "16716844", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120801284", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 318, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1435389786}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u7acb\u7ed8\u5341\u5206\u7684\u68d2!!!\n\u7acb\u7ed8\u5341\u5206\u7684\u68d2!!!\n\u7acb\u7ed8\u5341\u5206\u7684\u68d2!!!\n\u56e0\u4e3a\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\u6240\u4ee5\u8bf4\u4e09\u6b21!!!\n\u7f3a\u70b9\u662f\u65e0CV...\u4f46\u662f\u5df2\u7ecf\u6bd4\u6700\u5f00\u59cb\u7684PC\u7248\u597d\u592a\u591a...\u4e5f\u7b97\u662f\u652f\u630107\u5427...\n\u671f\u5f85\u540e\u7eed\u7684\u4f5c\u54c1=w=~~", "timestamp_created": 1435315010, "timestamp_updated": 1435315010, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583333", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16711119": {"recommendationid": "16711119", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108736354", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 841, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1435281520}, "language": "italian", "review": "[h1]Recensione[/h1]\n[code] Higurashi When They Cry Hou - Ch.1 Onikakushi[/code]\n\nDa grandissimo fan di Umineko, di certo non potevo lasciarmi scappare questa perla uscita da poco su steam.\nInizialmente rilasciato nel 2002 Higurashi: no Naku Koro ni divenne ben presto una delle opere horror/mistery pi\u00f9 conosciute all'interno del mondo delle VN. Pian piano si \u00e8 fatto strada anche attraverso l'universo dell'animazione e dei manga diventando cos\u00ec uno dei piedistalli dell'horror moderno.\nPremetto che, al contrario di Umineko, non avevo mai avuto modo di giocare alla Novel (O anche di leggere il manga, se per questo) e l'esperienza che ho avuto \u00e8 stata, decisamente, incredibile.\n\n\nIniziamo dunque con i miei soliti fattori positivi e negativi riguardati l'opera:\n\n\u2605Fattori Positivi:\n-La trama \u00e8 avvincente ed eccitante, ma sopratutto COINVOLGENTE. Ogni capitolo vi porter\u00e0 a voler leggere quello successivo, alla ricerca di nuove informazioni che possano aiutarvi a decifrare cosa diamine stia succedendo, veramente, in Hinamizawa.\n-I personaggi sono ben strutturati e vi legherete facilmente a loro. Riescono davvero a suscitare alcune emozioni reali all'infuori di voi, sopratutto se siete immersi nella storia.\n-6 euro. Pi\u00f9 o meno 15 ore di gioco. Se aspettate lo sconto ancora meno. Worth 100%.\n-MODDING. Si, esatto, MODDING. Tra le poche recensione negative che ho letto, quasi tutti si lamentavano del fatto che la versione PS2 era decisamente migliore, con le voci, i suoni, e delle CG decisamente migliori. Il tutto \u00e8 facilmente \"fixabile\" grazie ad un gruppo di ragazzi, il quale post trovere nella sezione discussioni del gioco, i quali hanno reso possibile aggiungere tutte queste cose alle versione di steam. Ora, fatemi precisare, qui \u00e8 semplicemente questione di gusto, quindi personale. Volete giocare con le vecchie CG? Potete. Volete giocare con quelle remasterizzate da steam? Potete. Volete giocare con le voci, i suoni e le CG della versione PS2? POTETE.\n\n\u2605Fattori Negativi:\n-La traduzione non \u00e8 proprio perfetta... ma niente di troppo grave.\n-NON ESISTE IN ITALIANO O IN QUALSIASI ALTRA LINGUA, quindi sappiate che \u00e8 tutto in inglese (Non lo considero proprio un fattore negativo, ma vabbeh)\n-Signori e Signore, qui stiamo parlando di Ryukishi, quindi aspettatevi un inizio lento e calmo(Direi all'incirca le prime 3-4 ore) che non sembra avere niente a che fare con l'horror e il mistery (Anche questo non lo considero di per se un fattore negativo, ma un sacco di gente si lamentava proprio di questa cosa... quindi meglio avvertire, no? E poi, se non reggete questo, non provate nemmeno ad iniziare la VN di Umineko... no sul serio, \u00e8 ancora pi\u00f9 lento li)\n\nRiassumendo il tutto.. un incredibile opera che non potr\u00e0 che stupirvi e affascinarvi.\nIl mio giudizio?\n9/10.\nMust buy.\nMi scuso per tutti gli errori grammaticali che avr\u00f2 fatto, ma non sono un gran scrittore x\u00b0\nMa ehi, Nipah~ <3\nAh, se siete come me  e avete un cuore tenero, preparate tanti fazzoletti, perch\u00e8 PIANGERETE.

Onikakushi is the first chapter in the saga.  Set in 1983, the story follows Keiichi Maebara as he and his parents move to the quiet, rural village of Hinamizawa.  As he settles into his new school and befriends his classmates, Keiichi begins to hear of some gruesome murders that happened in the town a few years prior to his arrival and is naturally interested to find out more.  What started out as innocent curiosity leads Keiichi further into a dangerous town conspiracy, and as the paranoia sets in, he soon discovers that those closest to him may be the very ones he should be running from.\n\n[h1]Plot/Writing:[/h1]\nHigurashi When They Cry is praised as one of the best visual novels out there for a reason, and this port does an excellent job of portraying its well-written dialogue to a western audience.  Few visual novels present the genuine sense of paranoia, loneliness and vulnerability that Higurashi does, and fans of psychological horror should look no further since this game acts as a stunning example of the genre and then some.\n\n[h1]Art:[/h1]\nYou have two options when it comes to character portraits; the original art from the game's first release or the brand new art exclusive to this port.  The latter is set as the default and I highly recommend keeping it that way; the art is slick, clean and presents the characters and their emotions well.  I'd even go so far as to say the art is more polished in this version than in the recently released PS3 port of the game.\n\n[h1]Sound:[/h1]\nHigurashi When They Cry and the later-released Umineko When They Cry are both described as 'sound novels' by their creators; meaning that there is a heavy emphasis on the sound effects and background music of each scene.  This is especially true for Higurashi; the ambience of the country village of Hinamizawa is forever set with the constant chirping of the cicadas in almost every scene, and the background music can go from incredibly bouncy to downright chilling in seconds.\n\n[h1]Flaws:[/h1]\nHigurashi When They Cry could be easily criticised for its incredibly slow opening.  Although this serves to simply make the player feel connected to the characters before the horror scenes take place, many people could grow tired and give up reading before it gets good.  Not until midway into the chapter does the pacing pick up to the point where the game becomes too good to put down.  Furthermore, unlike other visual novels, there are no choices to be made, branching paths to discover or multiple endings to see; it is pure reading from start to finish, and although this is essentially what a visual novel is anyway, the complete absence of player interaction could be seen as a flaw.\n\n[h1]TL;DR:[/h1]\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Fantastic writing; easily one of the best visual novels of the genre\n[*]Truly chilling horror scenes are worth waiting for\n[*]Polished, sleek character art that complements the story well\n[*]Sound effects and soundtrack work together well to add to the tension\n[*]10-15 hours of reading content is worth the cost of entry\n[/list]\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Very slow opening could make players lose interest quickly\n[*]Zero player interaction unlike other visual novels could hurt player interest\n[/list]\n\nLet's hope the next chapter releases soon!", "timestamp_created": 1435255920, "timestamp_updated": 1435415835, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.733219", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16701491": {"recommendationid": "16701491", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999263639", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1501, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1435400945}, "language": "english", "review": "Very interesting, and while it was supposed to make me afraid, it mostly made me sad.

I loved the anime, and I loved the game. This is a game that all Visual Novel fans should at least check out.\n\nMeet Keichii (or as I lovingly refer to him as Keichii-Kun!!), keichii has moved to the small village of Hinamizawa and everything is going fine for him. He made friends, He's well liked by the village, and he joined a cool school club. Then everything changes when he hears about an incident four years ago. And a series of events slowely turns the very life that keichii once knew upside down.\n\nThe characters in this story are really well designed in personality (Rena is my favorite :)) and the sound design is pretty good (though there is no fully voice acted characters which honestly would have helped for later scenes involving Rena) there is also plenty of background art too and the new models look very similar to the anime character designs which i consider a plus since its familiar territory.\n\nThat said, there are only two complaints i have and even then the game does a good job at countering them, one was the lack of a indication as to who was talking (name over the dialogue, colored text, etc.), but what saves this is how each character has a certain style to how they talk, making it easier to figure out who was talking.\n\nThe other complaint is the lack of CGI, something to help the audience imagine what had actually happened, but the scenes are described so vividely that they would almost feel out of place. Also, having watched the Anime also kinda helps.\n\nSeriously though, check this game out, it's only six bucks ;D", "timestamp_created": 1434163083, "timestamp_updated": 1434163083, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16329795": {"recommendationid": "16329795", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043976308", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1044, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448592291}, "language": "english", "review": "Read this before on my Kindle Fire, i hope they release the other 7 chapters, awesome sound novel and awesome Anime", "timestamp_created": 1434118397, "timestamp_updated": 1434118397, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16323177": {"recommendationid": "16323177", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999191779", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 911, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1434092928}, "language": "english", "review": "Higurashi is brilliant and creepy. I loved it and I will be thinking about it for a long, long time, but I had to play it in small doses because it was too intense to play for more than a few minutes at a time. If the next chapter ever becomes available, I intend to grab it immediately.\n\nThis is not a game. It's a story, like a novel but with sound and music to enhance the mood, and it is excellently effective. It usually lets you advance the text of the story at whatever pace you choose, but sometimes it takes control and makes you pause in anticipation before revealing the next line. That may sound frustrating, but it is only done rarely and only when it makes the story better. You could never get these sorts of amazing effects from reading a mere novel. I strongly recommend that everyone try Higurashi.\n\nThe art is fine and does what it needs to do. It would be nice if there were more poses and more backgrounds to more closely follow the story, but that's a trivial issue. On the other hand, it would not have been a trivial issue if the art had not been upgraded from the original version of the game. During the game you have the option of flipping between the new art and the original art, and the original art is terribly goofy and unacceptable. If I need to play the next chapter using the original artwork, then it's not worth playing. Fortunately the new art is in a clean and conventional style without huge cartoonish exaggerations.\n\nThe new art takes away Mion's gun. I never understood why Mion wore a gun; it's such a bizarre fashion choice and removing it can only improve the story.\n\nOverall, this is an amazing experience that fixes the serious flaws in the original version and turns it into a masterpiece.", "timestamp_created": 1434094535, "timestamp_updated": 1434094535, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.642567", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16323069": {"recommendationid": "16323069", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983987742", "num_games_owned": 320, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431871806}, "language": "english", "review": "A must have for anyone who just knows the anime TV series!!", "timestamp_created": 1434093963, "timestamp_updated": 1434093963, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16321889": {"recommendationid": "16321889", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037821764", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469257365}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game 5 Moe Psychopaths out of  5.

En pocas palabras: se trata de un libro con im\u00e1genes y sonido. \u00bfY d\u00f3nde est\u00e1 nuestro marcap\u00e1ginas? Guardamos partida donde y cuando nos apetezca descansar la vista para poder retomar la lectura posteriormente. \u00a1Y no tenemos \u00fanicamente un marcap\u00e1ginas, sino que tenemos un amplio abanico de ranuras de guardado! \u00bfTu primo o amigo ha ido a tu casa y quiere empezar a leer Higurashi? \u00a1Ning\u00fan problema con este marcap\u00e1ginas m\u00faltiple!\n\nTodo esto parece muy de color de rosa, pero seguramente estar\u00e1n aquellos que no est\u00e9n muy...convencidos a la hora de leer esta novela. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 deber\u00edan? (Voy a exponer mis puntos de vista, as\u00ed que esto es meramente subjetivo):\n\n-Es una historia original. La conoc\u00ed por el anime, y fue algo que me dej\u00f3 sin palabras. La manera en la que est\u00e1 hecha, el terror y el pavor, sumando la tristeza por esos tiempos mejores que han desaparecido, hacen que mis ojos no puedan dejar de leer. Cierto es que a lo mejor, en un momento, la lectura se puede tornar...algo mon\u00f3tona, pero el hecho de centrarse para ver c\u00f3mo van evolucionando los personajes en la historia a medida que pasan las cosas...Ryu ha hecho un gran trabajo, aun siendo \u00e9ste el cap\u00edtulo uno.\n\n-Es algo diferente. He le\u00eddo libros de terror como \"El resplandor\", \"Dr\u00e1cula\", \"Cuentos de sangre\", creepypastas en general...pero esto es el terror puro. La tensi\u00f3n que se palpa en el ambiente, junto con los rostros de los personajes y el ambiente musical que te proporciona la novela...no tiene parang\u00f3n. Si se sacara una novela visual basada en los relatos del gran Lovecraft; si tuviera este ambiente siniestro, no podr\u00eda dormir por las noches xD.\n\n-Devorar todo lo que encuentras: si eres un lector \u00e1vido que no se ci\u00f1e a un s\u00f3lo g\u00e9nero literario, entonces me comprender\u00e1s. El hecho de leer todo lo que encuentras, ya te aburra el final, te sorprenda el inicio, te guste o te disguste, acostumbras tu manera de ser a ver diferentes cosas, no centrarte en un t\u00f3pico o canon. \u00bfQu\u00e9 ser\u00eda de nosotros si s\u00f3lamente ley\u00e9ramos \"El Quijote\"? \u00bfQu\u00e9 es de la gente que s\u00f3lo se ci\u00f1e a leer libros rom\u00e1nticos? En su derecho est\u00e1n, por supuesto, pero esta novela tiene otra manera de narrar, traducida del japon\u00e9s al ingl\u00e9s. Podemos leer, de primera mano, lo que un oriental, educado e inspirado en su propio ambiente, ha creado con su propio sudor, y desde luego, es una oportunidad que no se debe rechazar.\n\nSin embargo, algunos puntos negativos tienen que destacarse:\n\n-Bajo mi punto de vista, la m\u00fasica deja mucho que desear. El hecho de que se repita una y otra vez hace algo molesta la lectura. El ritmo se te queda en la cabeza como esa serie que nunca te gustaba y recuerdas el opening sin quererlo.\n\n-Las palabras: hay muchas que son coloquiales, y muchas veces vemos la manera de escribir de los americanos: el whadayathin \"what do you think?\" es un puro ejemplo de ello.\n\n-Las novelas visuales tienden a tener chances, oportunidades y elecciones que pueden cambiar el final de la historia. Higurashi, por ahora no tiene este hecho.\n\nEn resumen, por estas cosas y muchas m\u00e1s decid\u00ed adquirir Higurashi When they cry, chapter 1 -Onikakushi.  No niego que todo lo que he le\u00eddo (salvo los reportes adicionales y algunas escenas que no mostraron en el anime) ya lo conoc\u00eda, pero hubiera dado todo lo que fuera para poder olvidar todo lo que sab\u00eda. De ese modo, hubiera disfrutado mucho m\u00e1s de esta experiencia. \u00bfQuieres sentir el miedo? \u00bfQuieres sentir el desconcierto de lo desconocido y los misterios que rodean a una peque\u00f1a pero calmada aldea en medio de las monta\u00f1as? \u00bfQuieres descubrir el mensaje que las cigarras intentan darte? \u00bfA qu\u00e9 esperas?

You expect something interesting with that hook for an opening, but 10 minutes later it feels like you're dragging your feet. The beginning, despite the very opening, is very slow and although I knew this was a big name in the western VN community, I almost put it down. It was a fellow Fuwanovel (a visual novel forum) member who told me to hang in there because it picked up once you got to the festival.\n\nThey were wrong.\n\nIt picked up quite a bit before that. In my opinion the second Mion pulls out a deck of cards and invites Keiichi (our protagonist) to play a game of Old Maid with the girls, all of the little things that had grated me about each girl before washed away. The sharp eye Keiichi held playing the game engrossed me into the scenario long before the festival was held, before the children, and our main character, had to worry about the real genre at heart--a horror story.\n\nThe game ran me about 8-10 hours. There was a little idle time when I got up to go to the bathroom or grab a drink, and I played through the \"Thank you\" after bit for the last achievement, but it was still a good 8-10 hours of gameplay that had me laying in bed --mouse in hand-- as late as 5 am wanting to find out what would happen.\n\nThis game is $6 for more than 8 hours of enjoyment. I don't know how you could not suggest it to anyone. If you think you enjoy Visual Novels, this is a definite classic among western VN fans and you should check it out. If you like anime, manga or reading, AND you like the horror genre, I'd also hands down reccomend this visual novel.\n\nI think the most off-putting, at a glance, feature of this game is that it's only Ch 1. DOn't be fooled I believe it is technically 15 chapters within this single Ch 1 release. Onikakushi comes from the full game Higurashi no Naku Koro ni. The game itself clocks into the \"Long\" range according to VNDB (visual novel database) which is classified as 30-50 hours of gameplay. Ch 1 is part 1 of 4 for this first game compilation so if you were to buy all 4 parts it would be ~$24 dollars, a little less if you follow the series and then pre-order the next 3 games on MangaGamer when they offer it for 10% off. It's only $6 to buy into the series, and if you decide, for whatever reason, you don't like it then it's not much of a loss, if you decide you do VNs for this full length (30-50 hours) normally run you somewhere around $45.

The visual novels themselves have been out since 2002, but the game has seen a lot of fan updates and semi-official updates that have never been put into full effect until now. The best way to describe this is as an unofficial remake for those who had never gotten into the franchise before. In the meantime, the series has had an anime, manga and other merchandise that has made it a household name for those who are very familiar with anime, or just visual novel games in general. For those who haven't heard of this, though, Higurashi When They Cry - Ch.1 Onikakushi, is a great way to start out the series and to get into the franchise at its original source.\n\n07th Expansion originally drew all of the art of the characters of Higurashi and while he did try, they were, quite frankly, awful. But not everyone can draw, and luckily there have been updated sprites that you can switch on and off at your leisure. For anyone who just wants better art, the best mode of action would be to turn on these new sprites rather than dealing with the old ones. The background art is nice and while it is a little blurry because it's just supposed to be the backdrop to where they characters are it is still nice to look at during the very long dialogue sequences.\n\nHigurashi is a visual novel, which means there isn't a lot of gameplay but a lot of reading. This is a niche genre for a reason, not everybody likes to click endlessly through dialogue, but this game is one of the better examples of visual novels, because it does give you some choices and keeps you entertained rather than boring you with mundane conversations all the time. There will be times where you are given fairly relaxed conversations between schoolmates, but those conversations don't always stay the same tone, which means you'll be treated to some humorous moments and general character bonding activities, like eating lunch together or learning math.\n\nWhat makes Higurashi When They Cry - Ch.1 Onikakushi special is the fact that it doesn't stay very nice for very long. You play Keiichi Maebara who just transferred to Hinamizawa from the city, and the first pieces of dialogue he says may turn you completely off his character. The game confusingly starts out in a sort of future past, him recalling what happened before the events of his little monologue which is played over the sound of squishing and cracking body parts in the background.\n\nIn case you didn't know by the description, Higurashi When They Cry - Ch.1 Onikakushi is a horror game and it is the most deceptively packaged horror game you will ever see. After that traumatizing moment you immediately go to the past where Keiichi is just waking up for another day at school. From there we are introduced to his entire group of friends, all of which play a part in the events to come later on in the story. A tale of lies, deceit, gore, murder, body horror, and nightmare fuel inducing stuff all placed under the clever guise of cute girls being friends with a guy who acts like a jerk. The tone of the game shifts constantly, always keeping you on edge. You never know when a conversation will devolve into zany antics or downright sinister threats. You couldn't tell by the art style, and you'd think this was just a silly romance game, but it's not; this game is there to mess with you when you're clicking through the dialogue.\n\n[url=http://www.noobfeed.com/reviews/1146/higurashi-when-they-cry-ch-1-onikakushi] Full Review[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1433254703, "timestamp_updated": 1433254703, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.685712", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16132637": {"recommendationid": "16132637", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072931101", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488630714}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc804\uc124\uc758 \uadc0\ud658", "timestamp_created": 1433251270, "timestamp_updated": 1433251270, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16127794": {"recommendationid": "16127794", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058158323", "num_games_owned": 505, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 856, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454151868}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Higurashi[/h1]\n\n[i]When They Cry[/i] - [b]I cry...[/b]\n\nOne word : [b]Masterpiece.[/b]\n\n\nNote : Can't wait for [h1]Higurashi When They Cry - Ch.2 Watanagashi[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1433220797, "timestamp_updated": 1433232238, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 67, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.605820", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16127073": {"recommendationid": "16127073", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139970478", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2358, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454758132}, "language": "english", "review": "I'VE BEEN REALLY TRYIN BABY\nTRYIN TO HOLD BACK THIS FEELING\n\nFOR SO LONG", "timestamp_created": 1433215661, "timestamp_updated": 1433215661, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16126271": {"recommendationid": "16126271", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012125842", "num_games_owned": 832, "num_reviews": 115, "playtime_forever": 495, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1437103171}, "language": "english", "review": "so much nope!!!\n\nalso see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y47LGmlcJug", "timestamp_created": 1433210485, "timestamp_updated": 1433210485, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.473784", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16117199": {"recommendationid": "16117199", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989055808", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2791, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480103968}, "language": "english", "review": "A really great book with noises.

This game combines a first part which is a funny and endearing school life with friendly characters and than tears it down with a tense thriller of a mystery plot. I haven't played the other games but it is said that the quality remains high. The game also gives \"Tips\" to go over after every chapter and which provide further interesting points about the story. Overall this is a very strong VN with a horror theme which comes recommended even if you do not care for the anime style specifically. \n\nIt is a decent length for a VN. In one sitting, I completed it in five and a half hours; however if one read very carefully so as to consider the plot, and viewed all the tips, it could be rather longer. There are no choices in the game, so it is one story. \n\nThe music was not composed for this game, and can be a little annoying and generic at times.", "timestamp_created": 1432913038,

"english", "review": "TLDR: The thumb is pointing up. That means good.\n\n[h1]Important Information to Know[/h1]\nThis game covers the first arc (Abducted by Demons arc, about 2 manga volumes long) of the story, while it says Ch.1 this game covers the first 4-5 episodes of the show and has something like 12 chapters in the game. This game is a visual novel with about 15 hours of reading. A visual novel is basically a book with relevant background music, sound effects, background art, and character art to enhance the reading experience.\n\n[h1]About the story - mostly spoiler free[/h1]\nHigurashi No Naku Koro Ni (aka Higurashi When They Cry, or just When They Cry) can be described as a Slice of Life Comedy and a Mystery Psychological Horror/Thriller, one of the bloodiest and most disturbing in the genre. Which turns many people away early on, but if you stay with it you learn it's about the human needs for friends, trust, and communication. \nWhile each arc is a completed story it does not complete the overall story of the series. Each arc shows a different version of the Hinamizawa mystery, each time showing you news clues and introducing new characters. If you stick through the entire story you will basically see the same story several times, slightly different each time before ultimately seeing an overall conclusion. It's like playing a game where you have to reach a bunch of Bad Ends before you learn how to win and get a Happy Ending.\n[b]It is also easily one of the most rewarding stories I have ever experienced.[/b]\n\n[h1]Areas for improvement[/h1]\nI found myself wishing the artwork used was more manga-like, namely that characters would be drawn with objects they were holding (not just their apparel changes) and that they drew out certain key scenes.\nExamples (these are all pretty bad spoilers, beware):\n[spoiler] The newer art style for Mion does not show her carrying a gun when in civilian attire. Also I would've liked to have seen the characters holding playing cards when they were playing card games. Rena carrying an axe whenever she was, Mion holding a syringe, Rena with a giant teddy bear after they win it, I could probably do without them holding chopsticks when they were eating but that wouldn't hurt the immersion either. In the later epsiodes there will be times when the characters have blood on them, I'd like to actually see blood on their character art, and I'd like to see the scar on Shion's back when they get to that part.[/spoiler]\n[spoiler] During the Needle scene showing Keiichi's hand with a needle in it would've been great, or showing a picture of a white van when Keiichi gets hit by the van, showing some fingers trapped in the door when Keiichi shuts the door on Rena's fingers, things like this. The later episodes will show torture and murder scenes that I feel should be drawn out for the readers like in the Manga and Anime. [/spoiler]\n[h1]Cost Effectiveness[/h1]\nCompared to other media with the same story- The visual novel costs $6 through steam and covers the first arc of the story, in Manga form (your trading in reading atmosphere for better illustrations) this is about 2 volumes which equate to around $20, in Anime form (your trading in extra content that can't be adequately described through a show, such as thought and feelings of the character for a story with better illustrations and sounds)  this is 4-5 episodes which will cost you like $40 as a DvD. While you can find the Manga and Anime online for free, you could also probably find this game somewhere online for free if you're determined to go that route.\nCompared to other games- This game ($6) has about 15 hours of reading, which is about the amount of time I spent playing Axiom Verge ($20). In my opinion this visual novel was a much more rewarding experience, and while Axiom Verge has immediate replay value, this story will have more replay value a year or 2 from now when I've forgotten about it.", "timestamp_created": 1432829214, "timestamp_updated": 1433191183, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 45, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.781715", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16032695": {"recommendationid": "16032695", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993359473", "num_games_owned": 193, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 603, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474175706}, "language": "english", "review": "First off, it's a visual novel.

All it has are still visuals, music, sfx and the text is written directly on the screen, from top to bottom, instead of the traditional text in a box. It has no choices, no alternate routes or endings. Some people might find that boring, but it isn't. For one, it is very long, It took me 18 hour to finish it and I read very fast. Second, the story is top-notch. You begin a story full of color and joy. Comedy is the main part of the story at the very beginning but all of that changes soon enough. A dark, gritty story emerges and you are plunged into a very in-depth thriller.\n\nIt is one of my favorite anime/manga series and I am glad we finally have the chance to play the original game it came from in English.

C'est le seul mot bizarre de tout le chapitre et je dois l'avoir vu aller... 4 ou 5 fois durant l'\u00e9pisode)... je vous conseille vivement de le prendre.\n\nPourquoi ?\n\nQuand j'ai entendu les fans d'Higurashi dirent que l'anime \u00e9taient trop \"floue\", \"confus\", j'avais pas compris personnellement. J'ai vu les saisons 1 et 2 et \u00e7a me paraissait assez claire.\n\nMais maintenant que j'ai lu l'\u00e9pisode 1... je suis compl\u00e8tement d'accord avec eux (si on regarde que la saison 1). Et je comprend aussi ce qui s'est pass\u00e9 pour le passage \u00e0 l'anime. Il y a des passages super long qu'ils ont voulu raccourcir. Cela a engendr\u00e9 d\u00e9j\u00e0 une perte d'informations.\nPuis ensuite... dans l'anime, nous devenons acteur ext\u00e9rieur. Alors que durant tout le visual novel, nous sommes dans la t\u00eate de Keiichi. Avec sa logique, ses pens\u00e9es... nous avons toute sa version.\n\nEt cela change tout.\n\nJe vous le conseille parce qu'il est nettement plus complet que l'anime. Bien s\u00fbr, ils ont fait ce qu'ils ont pu pour en faire un bon anime, et il reste pour moi une bonne adaptation.\nMais on le dit souvent : l'original est souvent le meilleur.

It introduces an absolute horror classic to folks who think torrenting and hunting down worthwhile patches is a hassle, yet it also offers original Japanese text and Ryukishi's charming art to long-time fans.\n\n\"Onikakushi\" forms the prologue chapter to an episodic horror plot with a basic gist comprised of eight arcs, with a few bonus chapters strewn about throughout various media adaptations. We are introduced to the core cast of the series, with transfer student Keiichi Maebara at the center, and watch his carefree first weeks in the small and isolated village of Hinamizawa take an abrupt sinister turn.\n\nThe storytelling has the remarkable ability of building up the reader's feelings of affection torwards Keiichi's new friends, then holding one's heart in a steel grip that agonizingly, slowly tightens as strange, creepy, then outright horrifying events begin to pile up. I don't speak Japanese, so I can't judge if the translation is accurate, but it certainly does convey the tense atmosphere this VN is so famous for. On top of that, there's nothing to complain about regarding grammar and spelling, and it retains elements of Japanese culture (such as honorifics) while staying comprehensible for non-anime fans.\n\nThe new art struck me as a tad bit too cutesy at first -  Rena looks very, very young - but is easy to get used to. For those who can't stand it, the original game art can be toggled in the options, but I'll say that it is more of an acquired taste than the remake art.

Things are set in motion early on to snowball into the dark terror you likely came to this VN expecting, and when you get there it will (at least, the idea is that it will) carry that much more impact because of the time taken showing you what the characters are like when they aren't bludgeoning each other to death as well as what brought them to that point.\n\nHigurashi is brutal.

The jarring tone shifts from light-hearted goofiness to cold horror are handled excellently in this translation. There are some curious choices in using far too many exclamation marks or ellipses during serious moments though, which can detract from the more horror-focused scenes. The writing is colorful, willing to break usual grammatical rules to carry the mood. While it detracted for me personally, I can't stay mad at the translation for taking exceptions to usual rules for the sake of upholding a playful, often melodramatic atmosphere. Nothing is more subjective than writing in horror, especially with a series as unorthodox as Higurashi.\n\n There were however, a few typos and a rather unnecessary 'lol' used in conversation which did take me right out of the experience. It was brief, but it's definitely a mood-cutter. Fortunately, these typos are getting patched up pretty quickly so by the time you are reading this there is a good chance that this criticism is null by this point. \n\n  Buy this visual novel if you have even the slightest interest in psychological and occult horror. You get two forms of sprites to choose from (updated and the original), and steam trading cards if you're into that kind of thing. Achievements as well, which seems silly but hey, at least they went all the way with this game.\n\n I look forward to the next chapter!", "timestamp_created": 1432357215, "timestamp_updated": 1432357215, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15960196": {"recommendationid": "15960196", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043809785", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461013861}, "language": "english", "review": "I missed these crazy kids.", "timestamp_created": 1432356646, "timestamp_updated": 1432356646, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15959308": {"recommendationid": "15959308", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025356233", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1447016358}, "language": "english", "review": "It's higurashi, enough said!", "timestamp_created": 1432349610, "timestamp_updated": 1432349610, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15959247": {"recommendationid": "15959247", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047447958", "num_games_owned": 549, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432826281}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5c11\u513f\u4e0d\u5b9c", "timestamp_created": 1432349093, "timestamp_updated": 1432349093, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476191", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15940892": {"recommendationid": "15940892", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972827570", "num_games_owned": 953, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 605, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432304168}, "language": "french", "review": "Je pense que commencer par dire que ce Visual Novel est mon tout premier est un bon d\u00e9part pour situer mon niveau dans ce genre de jeux. J'ai beau avoir fait les Danganronpa ou les Phoenix Wright, on est quand m\u00eame en pr\u00e9sence ici d'un pur visual novel sans le moindre choix de tout le jeu. Donc au final, que vaut ce premier chapitre d'Higurashi When They Cry ?\n\nEt bien j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 agr\u00e9ablement surpris. Les premi\u00e8res heures sont assez lentes et sont symptomatiques de ce genre de jeu. A trop vouloir placer le d\u00e9cor, on perd du temps en futilit\u00e9 et certaines sc\u00e8nes auraient gagn\u00e9es \u00e0 \u00eatre plus courtes. Cette partie m'a donc un peu fait peur et je craignais que tout le jeu soit comme \u00e7a. Heureusement, ce n'est pas le cas.\n\nSans spoiler, l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment d\u00e9clancheur du jeu est relativement attendu (personellement, il ne m'a pas surpris le moins du monde). Ce qui est moins attendu c'est ce qui se passe apr\u00e8s. Et si un c\u00f4t\u00e9 du jeu \u00e9volue de mani\u00e8re tr\u00e8\u00e8\u00e8\u00e8s classique, c'est compens\u00e9 par un autre \u00e9l\u00e9ment qui lui par contre r\u00e9ussit \u00e0 faire flipper. Et l\u00e0, je tire mon chapeau. Parce que je ne dirais pas que j'ai eu peur (SIlent Hill reste le seul jeu \u00e0 avoir r\u00e9ussi cet exploit), mais j'ai vraiment \u00e9t\u00e9 mal \u00e0 l'aise devant certaines sc\u00e8nes. Et je ne pensais pas pouvoir ressentir \u00e7a devant un Visual Novel. \n\nDonc au final, si on tiens le coup les deux trois premi\u00e8res heures de jeu, le reste avance plut\u00f4t vite. J'ai fini le jeu en dix heures et j'attends impatiemment la suite. Maintenant le jeu n'est pas exempt de tout reproche. La traduction anglaise est parfois compl\u00e8tement \u00e0 la ramasse, mais le lexique utilis\u00e9 est suffisement vari\u00e9 pour dire qu'un niveau lyc\u00e9e ne suffira pas \u00e0 suivre l'histoire dans sa globalit\u00e9. Les Sprites originaux sont \u00e0 mourir de rire. Heureusement, les nouveaux sont tr\u00e8s bien r\u00e9alis\u00e9s et participent plus \u00e0 l'immersion que pr\u00e9vu (mais c'est le genre qui veut \u00e7a, je ne pense pas que les sprites auraient autant d'impact dans un Visual Novel type simple tranche de vie). On sent qu'il s'agit d'un travail amateur \u00e0 la base, mais il y a un niveau de comp\u00e9tence certains dans l'\u00e9criture globale du jeu.\n\nAu final, si vous n'avez jamais touch\u00e9 de visual novel et que vous voulez vous lancer, vous pouvez tester celui-ci sans trop vous ruiner. Apr\u00e8s, il ne faut pas avoir peur de lire des descriptions sanglantes un peu d\u00e9taill\u00e9es, il faut avoir un bon niveau d'anglais et prendre le jeu pour ce qu'il est (un roman illustr\u00e9). Si vous y arrivez, vous finirez probablement comme moi avec un go\u00fbt amer dans la bouche quand vous finirez le jeu :p", "timestamp_created": 1432304954, "timestamp_updated": 1432304954, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15938531": {"recommendationid": "15938531", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117925981", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1433167461}, "language": "english", "review": "I want to take it home!\u2606 \\(\u2267\u30ee\u2266)/\nLIAR!\nI want to take it home!\u2606 \\(\u2267\u30ee\u2266)/\nKeiichi, I found you~\nI want to take it home!\u2606 \\(\u2267\u30ee\u2266)/\nAH HAHAHAHAHA.\n\n100/10 \nYou will love this story forever.

For me, this is what makes it so interesting to follow as you find yourself coming up with new theories as to what exactly is going on and why things are happening the way they are. The story is presented in a series of arcs (or chapters), with this being the first. Everything is fleshed out such as the setting, the characters and the mystery itself. Higurashi is full of rich detail as the story unravels and events stir within the quiet town of Hinamizawa.\n\nComing from someone who had the anime as one of their all-time favourites, I'm already sold that this is the superior medium for telling the tale. The characters feelings and thought processes are much more fleshed out, allowing the reader to become a lot more engaged and connected with the story. The comedy is enjoyable and not over-done, and the more serious elements of the visual novel hit hard when they happen. This is also heavily backed up by the sound (after all, Higurashi was first known for being a sound novel), which does a great job of immersing the reader.\n\nAnyone who's unsure about reading this, whether it be they've already seen the anime or maybe just not interested in the cutesy look of it, I highly recommend you give this a shot as it may just surprise you. Also it's getting tons of care and support from the developers and community in relation to modding and just improving the overall quality of the script and extras, which is just great to see.\n\nSo go ahead and strap yourself in for for the first chapter of this gripping series!", "timestamp_created": 1432159848, "timestamp_updated": 1432160683, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15918919": {"recommendationid": "15918919", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003961978", "num_games_owned": 1314, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 616, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1436599570}, "language": "english", "review": "Higurashi is a classic VN. It's had anime adaptations, its own manga series, OVAs, live-action films, even a third-person shooter. The cult surrounding this VN undoubtedly made 07th Expansion what it is today. How's the Steam release, then?\n\n[list][*]Returning players will notice that the English translation has been entirely redone. MangaGamer opted to do away with the subpar 2009 official translation and redid all of EP1's script from scratch. The results are satisfying; characters speak naturally, inner monologues don't feel stilted, and wordplay is more sophisticated.\n[*]MangaGamer contracted an artist to create new character art to replace Ryukishi07's original work. Again, the results pay off as the new character sprites look professional and do a great job at conveying the emotions of the characters. I personally prefer the new art to the old, but purists can switch between the two by simply pressing 'P'. \n[*]The Steam version of Higurashi runs on an entirely different engine than the original, an engine which allows the game components to be modded at the players' leisure. Players who wish to use the PS2 character art, PS3 backgrounds, etc. are easily able to modify Higurashi's files to do so. The new engine doesn't interfere with normal gameplay at all, and returning players might not even notice it.\n[/list]\n\nAll of these make the Steam version one of the greatest ways to experience Higurashi, but how's the story itself? Engaging, to say the least; first-time players often find it difficult to stop reading once they've invested time and emotion into the plot and characters. Each chapter ('Onikakushi' being one of eight) is roughly 7-9 hours in length, so you'll definitely not feel cheated for content by the time you finish.\n\nHigurashi has earned its acclaim/notoriety.

Thanks. (There is a TL;DR down below.))\n\nIt's Higurashi yo. It should need no introduction. Originally created by 07th Expansion in 2002, and later went on to get its own anime adaption. The anime especially is pretty well known even in the West, and probably even more so than the original doujin. But I'm not here to talk about that, I'm here to tell you why you should read this.\n\n99% of the people getting this game on steam has probably already at least heard of it before, and many probably just decided to buy it just to support it. As such the plot devices at work are probably know to a majority of the readers. But I won't spoil it for those who don't know, and this is only the first episode, so I'll just give you a very brief introduction. \n\nThe story takes place during June 1983 in a (fictional) rural village named Hinamizawa. It all begins with our protagonist, Maebara Keiichi, having moved to said village. Starting out fairly slow, we get to follow Keiichi as he spends time with his friends as we get to know the characters, their background and some more about the village. Shit starts to go down after the annual Watanagashi Festival, when we learn about the series of murder that have been happening since a few years back. It is said to be the work of the village's god, Oyashiro. But is it really though?\n\nAnd that's more or less the basis for the story. Just know that there is more than at first meets the eye going on. And while I at the time of this writing haven't fully read through this version, the writing of the original doujin was pretty good. (Not perfect by any means, but still good. It is one of Ryukishi07's first big stories. It got better in Umineko.) And I can strongly vouch for the quality of the story. Personally I am not a big fan of MangaGamer, but they seem to have done a good enough job here. Also, you can choose between the original sprites, Japanese/English, different resolutions and so on and so forth. So as far as that goes, it looks promising as hell. I mean, I personally find the original sprites kinda charming, and it is nice to be able to read it in Japanese. So once again, kudos MangaGamer.\n\nSo, in the end. If you are up for a suspenseful mystery story with a big emphasis on horror and tension. I'd say it's worth a shot. It isn't really that expensive, and the first episode should give you a good enough idea about whether this is for you or not. The story plays around with the narrative quite a bit (but not to the extent that Umineko did) and constantly throws curve balls at the reader. \n\nTL;DR Good value for your money, it is (relatively) short but cheap. Suspenseful mystery with good story that keeps you guessing. It focuses on horror, but there is enough there for those who want a good mystery story. If you're interested in a story dealing with the concept of paranoia, this is definitely the story for you. If you're still unsure, I'd say go for it anyways, at least the first episode. Oh, and the music is also great.\n\nI won't give it a score, because scores are shit, but needless to say I like it. Many people do. For a good reason.

Then, as someone who'd never played a visual novel before and didn't know what I was getting into.\n\n[b]Part 1:[/b]\n\nIf you're a fan of the series, you'll find this to be a rather faithful adaptation of Onikakushi-hen (\"Demoned Away Chapter\"), the first story arc from the series. Everything is there exactly as it was in MangaGamer's previous release, albeit with a new translation, new features, and a new presentation (character sprites in particular).\n\nTranslation:\nThe translation of the game is greatly improved over MangaGamer's previous release. The use of honorifics and wordplay is preserved from the original Japanese, and there are only a few minor typographical or grammatical errors that are fairly easy to miss. Character voices are distinct and easy to pick out, even without the use of characters' names as headers to tell you who's talking. For instance, Satoko tries to make herself sound smarter than she is, Rena has very distinct verbal tics, and Ooishi's roundabout way of talking is very distinctive as well. Those few typos aside, I have no complaints about the translation.\n\nFeatures:\nThere's a lot of neat features in this release. Not only can you change the resolution (while the choices are limited, it's still appreciated), but you can also change back and forth between Japanese and English text at any time, or the original sprites and the new, updated ones exclusive to this release (more on those in the next section). That being said, this is just a rerelease of the original Onikakushi-hen. If you've played the console versions of the arc, you won't find any of the extra content (for instance, in the console versions of Onikakushi-hen, you can actually choose how Keiichi responds in certain scenes, which is a small but neat change).\n\nArtwork:\nThe original backgrounds are preserved, but while they have their charm, they clash quite a bit with the new sprites. The sprites, however, are perhaps the most controversial aspect of this release. Having played the game, I can say that overall, they started to grow on me. Yes, certain aspects of the design are quite different from how I'm used to seeing the characters portrayed. For instance, Rika's hair and facial expressions are quite a bit different from how she appears in the original sprites, the anime and manga adaptations, and the visual novel's other versions' sprites. Ooishi is a bit more rotund, too. Others, like Rika and Satoko, look just about how I expected. I wasn't sure if I liked Mion's at first or not, but by the time I finished, it had grown on me. Still, if you prefer the other versions' sprites, there are easy workarounds, but I'd recommend giving the new sprites a spin first, just to see if you get used to them, too.\n\nSo, if you're a fan of the series, does this warrant a buy? For about $5, I have to say yes. A lot of work obviously went into this release.\n\nSo, what about people who aren't sure if they want to play a visual novel about horrible, horrible murder?\n\n[b]Part 2:[/b]\n\nHigurashi When They Cry (Higurashi no Naku Koro ni) is a visual novel, which means that the story is told through a mix of text and static artwork (in this case, sprites against backdrops, with occasional visual effects for mood). Some visual novels (and even different versions of this particular story) occasionally have branching paths, but this is the first of many chapters in the Higurashi series, and this particular release is rather linear aside from supplemental scenes that are unlocked as you progress through the story (called \"TIPS\"). These scenes shed light on aspects of the story, typically from outside from the main character's point of view.\n\nSo, this particular series is psychological horror and involves a series of mysterious deaths and disappearances. There are graphic textual depictions of murder and violence, as well as sound effects to demonstrate these acts, but there is actually very little visual gore (just some blood splatters on the screen occasionally). If a narrative description of fairly brutal violence doesn't bother you but the sight of it does (like is sometimes shown in the anime and manga adaptations), the visual novel shouldn't be too problematic for you. But make no mistake about it: beneath the cute-looking characters is a story written for mature audiences.\n\nThe story doesn't start out violent, though. You learn about the village of Hinamizawa from the eyes of Keiichi, a teenager who's the new resident of the area. Keiichi's new friends are a driving force behind the story, and in this arc, the story focuses on Keiichi, Rena, and Mion. Paranoia, suspicion, distrust, and friendship seem to be the central themes beneath this particular arc.\n\nI never played a graphic novel before Higurashi, but its interesting cast and premise stuck with me. I ended up enjoying it quite a bit despite not being much of a horror fan. If you're curious about visual novels but aren't interested in sexual content, this is a great series to jump into. Also, if you find you have a favorite character: [spoiler]just because something happens to them in this particular chapter doesn't mean they won't be in the next one.[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1432103213, "timestamp_updated": 1432103213, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516008", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15910415": {"recommendationid": "15910415", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060183925", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 781, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1433188390}, "language": "english", "review": "As someone who has watched the anime and read the first four manga volumes, this is still worth the 6 bucks!

The sound effects are great, especially the cry of the cicadas ;) It feels very atmospheric, especially when you play the game on a hot summer afternoon as I did XD\n\nI enjoyed the VN more than the anime, because you know what the main protagonist is thinking and going through. Having his thoughts available to us, really helps understand his predicament. It pulls you in!\n\nThe switch between old and new artwork is a wonderful feature! I'm glad it was upgraded, the new art is very pretty!\n\nThe script is well written and you will not be bored, even if some elements will be predictable, don't let it fool you.

Much.  Content.\n\nThis remastered sound novel contains the first four episodes of the anime.  In rough numbers, this is about an hour and a half of content.  As someone who can read rather fast, this sound novel took me almost nine hours.  This wasn't two hours of good content and seven of boring padding, but rather nine solid hours of enjoyment.  Seeing the thoughts behind Keiichi, the main character, change as the novel progresses, seeing more of the average day life that the cast goes through prior to Watanagashi, and just in general seeing things fleshed out so much more than in the show was wonderful.  The atmosphere was perfect throughout, and the character sprites were much more engaging than I was expecting as someone new to sound novels.  My only real complaint was the total lack of choices throughout.  I know through the friend that got me into this series in the first place that later chapters will have them, but it was surprising to both of us that this one was completely on rails.  This didn't detract from the story, but did feel a little disappointing.\n\nSo, do I recommend this experience?  Whether you've seen the show, or want to see what all the fuss is about before looking at either the rest of the novels or the show, I most certainly do.  For $6, you get a book complete with backgrounds, character sprites, and sounds.  You get a fantastic first chapter of a fantastic story.  You get heartwarming moments, heartbreaking moments, and a few truly creepy moments.

That isn't to say the updated sprites aren't appreciated, of course - I'm actually pleasantly surprised how MangaGamer was able to include it in release!  Nevertheless, Higurashi does not need flashy CG art scenes or voice acting to convey horror.

This series is my favorite anime, VN, and manga (I've also played several games - some fan made, others official, as well as watched the live action movie) that I have had the pleasure of partaking in of all time. I could dork it up quite a bit in here with the knowledge I have of this series, but I'll just limit this to the review of this version of the vn =P.\n\nSo first off lets get the negatives out of the way:\n\nAlthough the character sprites received a visual overhaul, the backgrounds did not. Some are decent, others are just really ugly.\n\nThey did change some text around for this translation (however I feel it's for the better - easier to understand) none of it changes the meaning behind the words. Still this game in particular has very significant meanings behind a lot of the words they use and a lot of subtlety with double meanings and implications behind everything. Not something you want to change around too much.\n\nThe main negative thing not just for the VN but for the series as a whole is that they take a long time to answer your questions - A lot of people will give up before they ever get there due to impatience. \nPERSIST!! It's worth it - I can't stress this enough. Also this is the first chapter - So you won't get any direct answers to your many questions yet.\nHowever if you like to think about it and try to figure out what is happening for yourself - then good because that is the way it is meant to be played.\n\nThis isn't meant for kids, so please don't whine about how your 6 year old played this and had nightmares. 4kids even had this title advertised as \"meant for all ages\"\nno... just no.\n\n\nAlright now lets get to the beauty of this VN.\n\nIf your squeemish about gore (which this series is popular for) You actually don't have to worry too much for the VN of it... the gore is described to you but it's not actually shown. (The anime and manga are totally different about that though)\n\nCompared to other VN's on steam this 1 chapter is still much longer than other VN's on steam - you get more than your money's worth in that regard.\n\nCharacters are freaking fantastic. Even minor characters like Dr Irie get a lot of background information on them and really help you understand each characters motivations for why they do what they do - but ok in this chapter you may not see as much as I'm praising it for - but I'm sort of treating this review as for all chapters, I already know and love what the other chapters have in store.\n\nFor those who like to feel elitist, this VN actually came out even before the manga, and of course long before the anime. So you can feel elitist by saying \"the original source said this\"\n\nI spent 40 bucks on mangagamer on this forever ago and don't regret a single dollar, so for the price steam asks this imo is a no brainer.", "timestamp_created": 1431989731, "timestamp_updated": 1432031964, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471443", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15890715": {"recommendationid": "15890715", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001258363", "num_games_owned": 315, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1439334043}, "language": "english", "review": "The anime is extremely barebone compared to the original work. If you have read the manga is probably the second best option as includes extra arcs (As well the DS, PS2, and Vita ports), but now is your chance to get the real deal.\n\nOnikakushi is probably the best introduction you can get of the series, but be aware that once you get into the answer arcs the story might slightly flop. Most Higurashi arcs start slow but gradually gets momentum and suspense, and that's probably one of their main charms. It might look at first as a silly harem game, but once the jiggles run out each character have their own background covered in the next arcs. Higurashi by default is 8 arcs, but excluding extra arcs in consoles and manga there's 1-2 extra PC arcs to clarify some final points.\n\nIf Higurashi gets supported enough I hope they also localize the superior Umineko (indirect sequel but also adds stuff to Higurashi) and other works like Higanbana and Rose Gun Days (Weaker but still enjoyable).", "timestamp_created": 1431982018, "timestamp_updated": 1431982018, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15889270": {"recommendationid": "15889270", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013005714", "num_games_owned": 5910, "num_reviews": 601, "playtime_forever": 146, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431983356}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4f5c\u4e3a\u540c\u4eba\u754c\u7684\u4e09\u5927\u5947\u8ff9\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u300a\u5bd2\u8749\u300b\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u62e5\u6709\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u7684\u5267\u672c\u5730\u4f4d\u3002\n\u5f53\u65f6PC\u79fb\u690dPSP ONS\u662f\u6211\u4e2a\u4eba\u8d1f\u8d23\u7684\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7b2c\u4e00\u7ae0\u5f00\u5934\u6211\u662f\u770b\u8fc7\u65e0\u6570\u904d\uff0c\u6ca1\u6cd5\u8df3\u8fc7\u7684\u5f00\u5934\u7684\u97f3\u6548\u4e5f\u542c\u8fc7\u65e0\u6570\u904d\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5bd2\u8749\u7ed9\u6211\u7684\u5370\u8c61\u662f\u975e\u5e38\u6df1\u7684\u3002\n\u867d\u7136\u5f53\u521d\u9f99\u9a91\u58eb\u7684\u7acb\u7ed8\u786e\u5b9e\u8ba9\u4eba\u5927\u8dcc\u773c\u955c\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5982\u4eca\u5c45\u7136\u6709\u5fc3\u91cd\u7f6e\u7f8e\u672f\uff0c\u786e\u5b9e\u503c\u5f97\u8d5e\u626c\u3002\n\u5e0c\u671b\u5927\u5bb6\u4e5f\u597d\u597d\u611f\u53d7\u4e00\u4e0b\u672c\u4f5c\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\uff0cenjoy it !\n\n\u5f53\u65f6\u7684PC\u6c49\u5316\u811a\u672c\u5e94\u8be5\u8fd8\u662f\u627e\u5f97\u5230\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u662fSTEAM\u7248\u4e0d\u662fNS\u4e86\uff0c\u662fU3D\uff0c\u6211\u770b\u770b\u80fd\u4e0d\u80fd\u627e\u5230\u65b9\u6cd5\u628a\u6c49\u5316\u6587\u672c\u5bfc\u8fdb\u53bb\uff0c\u8bdd\u8bf4\u5f53\u5e74\u7684\u6c49\u5316\u7ec4\u662f\u54ea\u4e2a\u554a\u2026\u2026\u867d\u7136\u8ddf\u4ed6\u4eec\u804a\u8fc7\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5df2\u7ecf\u5b8c\u5168\u4e0d\u8bb0\u5f97\u4e86\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1431975302, "timestamp_updated": 1431975302, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15888790": {"recommendationid": "15888790", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067186662", "num_games_owned": 350, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 51, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484657230}, "language": "english", "review": "i need a season pass when do i get to murder", "timestamp_created": 1431972927, "timestamp_updated": 1431990860, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.461103", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15888335": {"recommendationid": "15888335", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064662869", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1445551623}, "language": "english", "review": "I think my neck itches...", "timestamp_created": 1431970930, "timestamp_updated": 1431970930, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 57, "votes_funny": 77, "weighted_vote_score": "0.679919", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15887277": {"recommendationid": "15887277", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980449859", "num_games_owned": 592, "num_reviews": 90, "playtime_forever": 473, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431965684}, "language": "english", "review": "Looks can be deceiving, and this game can be absolutely terrifying.

And that was with a translation that, frankly, was on par with taking the lyrics to Keiichi Oishi no Uwasa Jikenbo ABC, running it through google translate and calling it a day. Yes, the original translation was... not the best, to say the least. Still! Higurashi quickly became the franchise I most adored and loved, despite this. Now that this new translation has come out, it feels like reuniting with an old friend.\n\nStill, like meeting an old friend in real life, things (while nostalgic) have changed. Some for the better, some not. To begin, let's look at the good. The translation is better than the old one, but that's like saying being poisoned is better than being dismembered. There's still quite a few typos hanging around, nothing that will break the game (well, besides Rena forgetting to say a VERY plot relevant word at one point, but one can infer what she said easily enough, I suppose...) but it is far better than the old translation. At least I didn't see untranslated kanji hanging around anywhere.\n\nThe sprites? My Oyashiro, I loved the new sprites. They're very polished, very nice. Admittedly, Ooishi was never meant for a more realistic image and, as such, looks uncomfortable but, in the end, all is good. I'm just thankful Rena's hands are no longer indistinguishable from hams. I don't see why anyone would play with the old sprites, but as I'm about to demonstrate, I suppose people can get attached to the strangest things.\n\nAlso, is it just me or is this translation a lot longer than the previous one?\n\nAh well, onto my nitpicks. When redoing a translation, there is a burning question of how much should be kept from the inferior translations \"flavour\". The little detail, the minor word choices... As someone who spent so much of his time reading/watching everything Higurashi repeatedly, these little changes stick out like a cleaver in broad daylight. Ohagi has been changed to mochi, \"hauu\" has become \"hao\", 07th Mart (that one store Keiichi visits that one time) has been changed to  Smart Seven... These little details stood out to me, but they're not the end of the world by any means. In fact, if you're bugged by them you probably have little to no life. So, yeah. I was bugged by them, but that isn't important.\n\nWhat is important is the fact that Rika's \"nipaah\" has been changed to \"yeah\", it seems. This surprised me. It's such a strange change, considering that \"nipaah\" is basically Rika's catchphrase. But again, it won't ruin the game for you. It's just a shame that some of the original flavour has been changed.\n\nSo, overall, Higurashi remains a strong VN. It's wonderful and creating a constantly increasing state of tension and mystery. Pleasantly creepy, disturbing, unnerving... It really does keep you on your toes and jumping at shadows. Which is what it aims to do, so mission accomplished! Similarly, it makes a fantastic use of humour. I'd forgotten that Higurashi can be lighthearted and even hilarious at times (maybe it's just me, but this translations Keiichi seems a lot more sarcastic than usual.) Some of the sound decision in this game is particularly wonderful, especially now that we're dealing with the fantastic original tracks. Areas where sounds and music bleed and blend into eachother until the sound of crying Higurashi embeds itself on your eardrums. Of course, at times, the music cuts to other tracks in uncomfortably sudden ways but it's not the end of the world. We haven't reached that Arc yet.\n\nSo, all in all, whether you're a new transfer to Hinamizawa or a returning villager this game is a must buy! And a great starting VN, if you're looking to jump into the world, if I say so myself (it was one of the VNs that personally got me interested in the medium/style.)\n\nSo, check it out lest you suffer Oyashiro-sama's Curse!", "timestamp_created": 1431861175, "timestamp_updated": 1431861175, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.673002", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15869334": {"recommendationid": "15869334", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108064471", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1069, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500537621}, "language": "english", "review": "The first light novel I've ever started playing, and its impressing me so far.

Like reading a book or short story on a tablet or your computer.\nSome give you the option to make decisions while others are simply telling a story. There are plenty of Visual Novels on other places besides Steam. Some good, bad, serious, funny, all-ages, and the more adult oriented ones.\nIf you'd like you can check out more here [url=https://vndb.org/]Visual Novel Database[/url]\n\n\nTo start things off. I'm still very very VERY new to the VN scene.\nI have been meaning to delve deeper into this genre, but never got around to it.\nMy prior experience with any kind of Visual Novel was Katawa Shoujo, but even with that I never really finished it.\n(To those that have played it. I got to the start of the school festival then suddenly stopped)\nI do have a bit of \"Eroge\" Visual Novels stashed away for a rainy day, but my ability to read Japanese is practically Zero.\n\n\nSo about Higurashi When They Cry Hou - Ch.1 Onikakushi\nIt would be really hard to review the actual Visual Novel without practically sticking in spoilers.\nI've never played previous versions of this VN and have not seen the Anime related to this.\nI had a rough idea of what I was getting into because of the internet, but it never fully prepared me for this.\n\n[b][u]The Character Sprites[/u][/b]:\nThe new character sprites are done really well compared to the older version.\nI tried switching between the two sprites, but always found myself going for the more modern one.\nThe newer ones took up less screen and made the text easier to read and I really liked the emotions each character displayed.\nThe older ones would definitely give some nostalgia points to previous readers, but they ate up a lot of the screen making it hard to read the text and understand what was going on.\nThe way the older ones were drawn also killed my immersion.\nI'm probably spoiled by what Modern Anime looks like today to sway me into keeping the updated character sprites.\n\n[b][u]The Characters[/u][/b]:\nI would love to give a detail into what characters are in the story and their backgrounds, but as I said previously I want to keep that bit hidden so that new readers will go in with an open-mindset.\nI can say that the Characters were well done and their dialogue gave me a few laughs.\n\n[u][b]The Story[/b][/u]:\nThis is all I can really say. Absolutely amazing 8/10\nThe length of finishing this is roughly 8 or 9 hours so make sure you're comfortable.\nAs a bonus if you use a wireless/wired controller then you can use that as some sort of remote to progress through the dialogue.\nGod I wish I could write more on this topic, but it's always best to experience something with an open mind\nGo in without knowing as little as possible and use what you experienced from your playthrough to form an opinion.\n\n\n\n[b]FINAL THOUGHTS[/b]\nI really wish more VN's would release on Steam.\nAnd I really wish that more people would actually review the VN instead of leaving dumb things like \"420/10 WOULD FUG AND WAIFU LMAO\" because it's \"MUH ANUMAY\"\nI get sick of seeing people with less than an hour of playtime reviewing the game and giving it a review similar to that.\"\nPlease try not to be one of those people.\nIt's an Anime related game on Steam.

If you can stomach it, there's power here.\n\nIt's a testament to the power of Higurashi's story that a no-name indie VN with amateur art and processed photos for backgrounds managed to take off at all, let alone spawn regular adaptations, spin-offs, and updated re-releases for the past 13 years.\n\nIf you can read Japanese AND already know the story, get Higurashi Sui.

No tengo apenas palabras para describir mis emociones a lo largo de estas series (Higurashi y Umineko). Es una historia que te va atrapando conforme avanzas, que te deja espacio para cuestionarte lo que est\u00e1 ocurriendo, que te hace llegar a una conclusi\u00f3n para luego ech\u00e1rtela abajo para, posteriormente, hacerte llegar a otra muy diferente. Esta evoluci\u00f3n que sufres como lector hace que sea una experiencia enriquecedora en muchos aspectos ya que, por un lado, empiezas a cuestionarte cosas que antes hubieras pasado por alto y, por otro lado empiezas a formular tus propias respuestas. As\u00ed, hay numerosas razones por la que este juego, manga o anime no se puede comparar con alg\u00fan otro.\n\n[b]Miedo, desesperaci\u00f3n, paranoia[/b]\n\nEncarna la piel de un personaje y explora las sensaciones y pensamientos que rondan por su cabeza.

The Steam version is a remaster of the original Sound Novel which includes the option to switch between the new sprites or the original sprites.\n\nThe story in itself is a solid horror/thriller experience, it throws you in a shoe of Maebara Keiichi, a recent transfer student to Hinamizawa and his experience with his friend. The beginning of the game shows you an all-happy go round group of friends and kyute girls that as they go about doing kyute things. As the story progress, Keiichi discover that there was a bloody murder in Hinamizawa. Confused and curious about what happen, he started asking his kyute friends about the incident but they keep denying it happens, which makes Keiichi starting to doubt his friends. The story starts to get interesting around the end of Watanagashi festival, I won't spoil the rest of the story but expect a crazy ride after that.\n\nIf you have already watched the anime, then you must read this VN (I know I said Higurashi is a Sound Novel, but blame Chunsoft on that one) since the anime butchered a lot of content from the VN. There is no choice to be made since this is a kinetic VN and no it doesn't have voice acting even though it was promoted as Sound Novel (blame Chunsoft). Also this is just the first chapters/arcs of Higurashi so expect to shell out another $6 for Tsumiboroshi, Meakashi, Watanagashi, Matsuribayashi, Tatarigoroshi, Minagoroshi & Himatsubushi. Based corporate :^)\n\nClosing this review, I recommend any oldf*gs out there (like myself ;-;) who have played Higurashi before to play this one not only because of the updated sprite, but also unifying all your Higurashi in one place (Steam) is nice if you didn't have the physical copy of all Higurashi. If you're interested/new to the series, love horror/thriller genre or have watched the anime and still feel that it's lacking, pick this up and sate your horror/thriller need.\n\nAlso, Umineko f*cking when MangaGamer?", "timestamp_created": 1431802820, "timestamp_updated": 1431803283, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 100, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.850952", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15858506": {"recommendationid": "15858506", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061250319", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 860, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432284706}, "language": "english", "review": "CRITIC:\nIts one good Visual Novel with a great story to tell...(If you like this game you should watch the anime OR if you have already seen the anime you should play this game :P) .\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nYou cant do something specific, the only thing you can do is read the story that takes part in first season of the anime(ONLY the 4 first episodes of the anime).You cant take any decision witch will make any deference in to the game.If you finish a Chapter you will be reward with 2 new Tips of the game...\n\n(Those Tips is something like MORE gameplay with the already known Characters like: Rena,Mion,Rika and Satoko.

Since then there's been seven more chapters of the core story, ten chapters of spin-offs and additions, ports to Nintendo DS, PS2, and PS3, a 2-on-2 fighting game, two audio drama CDs, fifty TV and ten direct-to-video episodes of anime, thirty-eight volumes of manga, seventeen books, and two live-action movies.\n\nThis is that original visual novel, with new art in an attempt to make it less goofy-looking.\n\nThere's a lot of reasons why this series blew up into a multimedia juggernaut, but it's one of my favorite stories for a simple reason: I hate it when a series tries to set up some massive, overarching mystery, but they're just making it up as they go along. Seriously, fuck you Lost and Battlestar Galactica. This is the antithesis of that. The first four chapters (of which this is the first) set up a complex, twisted mystery, then the last four chapters solve it. Everything pays off because it was all planned from the start. That guy at the table in Tokyo (who goes by the internet handle Ryukishi07) did a better job than Hollywood usually can.\n\nThe quality of this particular release is a little uneven. I liked how the old, childish art contrasted with the events and tone of the story. The new art feels too slick and maybe a little too sexy. This is a horror story about kids; it's important that they look like kids. On the other hand, at higher resolutions the old art looks like crap, and the new art isn't as bad as I originally feared from the preview images. The big disappointment is the new English translation. The old translation was clunky and had some real groaner lines, but the new translation has issues with stilted and overly literal language and some weird affectations (are they trying to make Satoko sound like a stereotypical southern belle or something? wtf?).\n\nOverall, though, you should buy it, read it, and just put up with the stilted language and Mion's ridiculous boobtastic posture.", "timestamp_created": 1431791859, "timestamp_updated": 1436023273, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.466667", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15855765": {"recommendationid": "15855765", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105599659", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1150, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458383382}, "language": "english", "review": "A classic among visual novels, which let's the viewer experience the relatively isolated village Hinamizawa from the perspective of the MC Maebara Keiichi.

WTC 1&2 being the question and answer arcs of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni while WTC 3&4 gives us a new mystery with Umineko no Naku Koro ni.\n\n\n[b] Welcome to Hinamizawa [/b]\n\nThe first episode of When They Cry 1, Onikakushi-hen takes us to the idyllic quiet town of Hinamizawa where Keiichi (K1) has just arrived with his family to settle into a new life.   Does the usual thing, gets himself friends and starts living his new life in the countryside.  But it doesnt take long for that veneer to shatter and K1 becomes entangled in the mystery of Watanagashi Festival.\n\nEach chapter starts of very care-free and its seemingly innocent characters are enjoying their youth.  Which makes it all the more unnerving and sometimes terrifying when everything goes to hell.  As the story goes on I found myself becoming heavily invested in it's characters and you really feel for them as the situation becomes more and more hopeless and desperate.  \n\n\n[b] Welcome to Rokkenjima [/b]\n\nEven though this is only Episode 1 of WTC1 I cannot write this and not mention Umineko no Naku Koro ni.\n\nIf Steam gets there, it will take us to a new setting with new characters although the world of Umineko & Higurashi do seem connected.  WTC3 Episode 1 takes us to the island of Rokkenjima where Battler, who belongs to the wealthy Ushiromiya family, has just returned for the first time in six years to attend a family conference.  But the island and its inhabitants lie heavily under the influence of the witch Beatrice.\n\nUmineko feels a bit different to Higurashi as things are a bit more fantastical, but personally I found it to be more compelling and I am still invested in its characters and story.  I hope the complete mystery comes out on steam but that may be unlikely as only Higurashi was translated and published by MangaGamer and Umineko never got the the love.  But you can get fansubs at [url=http://witch-hunt.com] Witch Hunt [/url] and a mod to play with PS3 Graphics at  [url=http://uminekofix.wikia.com/wiki/Tweaking_Umineko_Wiki] UminekoFix [/url]\n\n\nIn summary.  When They Cry is not like any other Visual Novel out there and it may be more correct to refer to it as a Sound Novel as 07th Expansion do.  Both Higurashi and Umineko have a great soundtrack which is basically what this is all about (Sound Novel being the hint).  There are no choices,  you just follow the story and try to work out the mystery.   Lots of scary moments, lots of intrigue and lots and lots of feels.\n\nThe community back in the day was awesome and had many competing theories and there was countless doujins and fan arts that kept you going while we all waited for the next episode to be released.

That means that there is no gameplay, the entire thing is just a bunch of text, with pictures of characters and the background to help illustrate it, topped off with sound effects. If you hate reading, kinetic/visual novels are not for you. \n\nHigurashi has a total of 8 main chapters. This is only the first one. The rest are slowing going through the translation process. Some chapters relate to others, so if this is your first experience with Higurashi, I'd almost recommend for you to wait until all 8 are released before you read them all so you won't forget some of the details. \n\nHigurashi is a horror/mystery. The protagonist moves to rural Japan from the city and is adapting to his new life in a town where the population is so small that his school consists of one classroom with students in many different grades. He befriends four of them and they do a bunch of things kids do, but slowly the protagonists hears more and more disturbing rumors about his new village. As if to heighten his fears and paranoia, eventually, people start dying.\n\nHaving read my fair share of Christie and Doyle, I will say that the mystery in Higurashi is top notch. While it's not your typical closed circle murder mystery (which is the theme of the author's second work, Umineko), the author does leave just enough clues here and there for intelligent readers to figure out the truth behind the events in Higurashi. If you're like me and couldn't figure it out despite all the hints, that's ok too. The last few chapters act as an \"answer key\" and reveals the truth for you. \n\nTL;DR: if you enjoy reading mysteries, Higurashi is definitely for you, though I may recommend waiting till all 8 main chapters are translated.", "timestamp_created": 1431763444, "timestamp_updated": 1431764140, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15850192": {"recommendationid": "15850192", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028550505", "num_games_owned": 235, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 31417, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1435245399}, "language": "english", "review": "I wish there were more ways for me to throw money at Ryukishi07", "timestamp_created": 1431762282, "timestamp_updated": 1431762282, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 52, "votes_funny": 28, "weighted_vote_score": "0.616507", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15849928": {"recommendationid": "15849928", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053079084", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431772139}, "language": "english", "review": "In this game, the lolis kills you", "timestamp_created": 1431760433, "timestamp_updated": 1431760433, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15849751": {"recommendationid": "15849751", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034621986", "num_games_owned": 264, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 197, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432157757}, "language": "english", "review": "A must read for every VN fan.", "timestamp_created": 1431759212, "timestamp_updated": 1431759212, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499795", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15849726": {"recommendationid": "15849726", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089315262", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431758922}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "THE BEST JAPANESE GAME ON THE STEAM", "timestamp_created": 1431759060, "timestamp_updated": 1431759060, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15849712": {"recommendationid": "15849712", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979660029", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1788, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455138273}, "language": "english", "review": "A must-read for any mystery fans and visual novel fans out there.

horror anime series ever for good reason. A lot of mystery solving, blood and gore, and yandere. Although originally a visual novel and this being the Steam remake, the Higurashi series is widely known in the anime fan culture, and even on the internet due to some memes being born from it, as well as many scenes of the anime being uploaded on YouTube. The games in the series have been released on PC, PS2, PS3, PS Vita, iOS, Android, and Nintendo DS, as well as the popular anime adaptation and the manga adaptations. I first discovered Higurashi from the clips on YouTube and it has been one of my favorite franchises ever since. This particular arc, Onikakushi-hen is one of my favorites because I own the manga adaptation of it. I have also played [spoiler]Watanagashi-hen and Meakashi-hen.[/spoiler] \n\nThe gameplay of a visual novel game is pretty basic. You click and read the text that's on the screen. Pretty simple, huh? Well, Higurashi is a different case. The story follows the myth of [spoiler] Oyashiro-sama's Curse,[/spoiler] a myth that is linked to consecutive murders that occur every summer in the town of Hinamizawa. With every murder, another person goes missing. Every story arc is like the movie Groundhog Day as you are stuck in a time-loop. There are 4 main Question arcs, and 4 Answer arcs, and many other extra arcs that go deeper into the story. You play the role of [spoiler]Keiichi Maebara,[/spoiler] who recently moves to Hinamizawa. Every story arc is different because in every arc, a different character falls victim to [spoiler]The Hinamizawa Syndrome,[/spoiler] which causes the character to act in strange and violent ways. By reading the story and reading tips that you can unlock, you start to figure out what's going on, who's responsible for the strange acts, and the murders of some of the main characters. The only one who can solve the mystery of Hinamizawa and the \"Curse,\" is you, the player.\n\nI suck at writing reviews, but I highly recommend this game to anyone who's looking for a good mystery to solve, anyone who wants to familiarize themselves with the Higurashi franchise, or anyone who loves the series and has been a longtime fan of it.", "timestamp_created": 1431741758,

That it comes with a completely revamped translation (as MangaGamers old translation was filled with bad grammar and formating) and new sprites is just icing on the cake.\n\nStory: Since Higurashi is a Sound novel the story has to be the most important part of the game and it does that magnificently. While the first hour or so of the game is rather slow it then quickly opens up and becomes one of the most paranoia- and horror-filled experiences I have ever read (perhaps only eclipsed by the first arc of it's spiritual sequel, Umineko no Naku Koro Ni). But a note for those who are used to flag based Visual novels where there are occasionally dialogue options that often effect what happens next and what ending you will receive, Higurashi does not contain any choices. Higurashi is instead what is called a kinetic mystery novel where you, as the player, are supposed to read the story and through the hints provided in this chapter and the the other chapters in the so called questions arc (ch. 1-4 with 5-8 being called the answer arc) try to solve the mystery. So, don't expect any choices but instead, pick up a pen and paper, fire up your brain and try to solve this strange case.\n\nCharacters: Characters have always been the greatest part of Ryukushi's writing and the characters in the Higurashi is no exception. While, in the beginning, the characters look like normal people if slightly strange and eccentric, as the story moves forward you will get a whole new view of them as the darker parts of their backstories and natures are revealed. And while there are many side characters that doesn't get that much development (or even a sprite) almost everyone else receives at least one chocking reveal and many of the villains are also shown to have at least one sympathetic side to them.\n\nArt: In many Visual novels the art is usualy ranging from decent to fantastic, When They Cry usually put itself on the lower part of the curve. The background is just real photographs (taken in the Japanese village Shirakawa-go) with a photoshop filter and the original sprites are very crude. But in my opinion that doesn't really matter as the main focus is the story, and the characters are mostly there to help you get forward, make you care about them, and in a few cases give out a few laughs with how they look. But as I said above this re-release comes with new character-sprites which the MangaGamer team worked on in coordination with 07th Expansion. I think they look really good and captures the original quite well but on the other hand they do contrast a bit against the background and sadly aren't are expressive as the original sprites (compare Rena's new shocked/embarrased sprites with the originals).\n\nMusic: As the name Sound novel implies the music is one of the primary aspects of the game. But while the music in this re-release is better then the one used in the original release (as MG couldn't get permission to use it) it is still rather weak compared to the series from ch. 4 and onward. But that doesn't mean it's bad, it's just not as good as it is later on. The music often fits perfectly with the scenes and the scary scenes are often made even worse by showing that silence is often even more scary than a scare chord, by removing the music during those scenes.\n\nGameplay: As I noted earlier, there is no gameplay at all in this ''game''. The closest is that after every few chapters a couple of TIPS are opened that you can read. But while you can skip them it is strongly suggested that you read them as they are side stories that are either background material, cryptic discussions or contains further hints to the mystery.\n\nFinal thoughts: Of all the stories I have ever read, When They Cry is probably my all time number one and while I consider Umineko to be slightly better, Higurashi is still really good. So if you either want to try out what a Visual novel actually is or just want a good and engaging mystery story with well written characters and a amazing soundtrack in a new and interesting format, pick up this game.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou are invited to solve this strange case.

Despite the cutesy sprite art and generally energetic feel that dominates most of the work, it is solidly a mystery and thriller- or suspense-type visual novel.\n\nThis is a straight port and slight remaster of that original visual novel. It is very much a [i]novel[/i] and essentially reads like one, with time to read depending on how fast you can read. I read through the arcs, which took around 5 - 8 hours per arc. There are no choices, no voice acting, and no branching storyline. There's also no gore to be found here, so if you are squeamish or have heard about the series' reputation, don't let that dissuade you.\n\nUnlike MangaGamer's previous version of this, the original music was restored, and additionally, more \"traditionally animesque\" sprites were added as an alternative to Ryukishi07's (the author).

The anime is a great adaptation in two ways. First, it does not cut out or distort many important plot points, although there are certainly changes. Second, it makes fantastic use of the advantages of the animated medium to create suspense.\n\nThe visual novel, however, explains several key plot points better than the anime does. Most importantly, the visual novel portrays paranoia and confusion far better than anime ever could. The visual novel really gets you thinking like the protagonist thinks, whereas the anime just has you experiencing what the protagonist experiences.\n\nChapter 1, Onikakushi, covers the first four episodes of the anime.\n\n---\n\nTwo main things set Higurashi apart from otherwise similar horror titles.\n\n[h1]Slice of Life Camaraderie[/h1]\n\nHigurashi in its entirety isn't just a story about how bad things happen and a bunch of people die. At its core, it is a story about overcoming adversity (although the first chapter is very much about bad things happening).\n\nHigurashi's early slice of life scenes reinforce this overarching positive theme. They depict a group of friends who participate in cutthroat competitions on a daily basis. They struggle and play dirty to improve themselves and each other. It's very much [b]not[/b] your usual slice of life.\n\n[h1]Paranoia[/h1]\n\nParanoia plays a huge role in the first few chapters of Higurashi. Many characters deeply involved in the series of murders have yet to be revealed. Two main characters have yet to be introduced. The protagonist, and by extension the reader, doesn't know why or even [b]what[/b] is happening. In this way, Higurashi is quite similar to the visual novel Chaos;Head (excuse me, Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd). An unreliable protagonist tries to survive and figure out what the hell is going on.\n\nYou could say that Higurashi is to horror visual novels as Amnesia: The Dark Descent is to horror video games.\n\n---\n\nHigurashi is [b]phenomenal[/b] bang for your buck in terms of both quality and quantity. It is very much enjoyable as a standalone work, but also leads into a greater overarching story.

The complexity is what you make of it. If you decide to not push any operational limit and just go by the book, then it's just a matter of being meticulous.\n\nIf you ever wanted to fly a space ship from within an A-10 cockpit with a lot of switches then this is a game you should have in your library. How would you plan to solve Kerbal problems with flick switches from inside the cockpit?\n\nThe big part of this game is when you are so familiarized with the cockpit that you shift your gaze from the cockpit internals and use this baby to accomplish tasks in the outside world. \n\nThe experience is so flexible that you eventually develop your individual style and habits as a pilot, but that's part of the rewarding experience. \n\nWith all the \"candy crush\" style of space flight \"sims\" out there.

It's a classic styled game with an 8-bit soundtrack and sound effects that make the game feel like an arcade game from the 80's.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\nGameplay is pretty straightfoward. Shoot enemies coming down to the screen for as long as possible until you're satisfied with your score and/or get a game over. Simple as that. It's an addictive game both for old and new players alike. There are certain powerups you can obtain or shoot to make your life a bit more easier in dealing with enemies. There are also a variety of enemies (some may look familiar to you...) that make the game challenging. Game modes include arcade, time attack and a one-hit life. All modes are challenging if you intend to ramp up the difficulty.\n\n[h1] Visuals [/h1]\nVisuals are very colourful and vibrant. They attempt to be arcade-y and retro-y for the nostalgic players. As far as I can tell from my experience, the visuals don't cause any seizures for people ( or myself as I'm not epileptic). The animations are also very smooth and I haven't noticed anything that causes the animations to loop (or something like that). Overall, visuals are a nice and appealing to look at.\n\n[h1] Soundtrack [/h1]\nThe soundtrack is nice and retro-y for the couple of minutes. But players may find it annoying to hear the loop for countless amount times. Surprisingly (or not lol) there's a feature where you can put up to 20 tracks of your own music to the game. It's pretty simple and doesn't take a lot of time. If you're a bit tired of the game's music looping endlessly, adding your own music is an option (Google it. This is a review not a tutorial!!).\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\n1982 throws you back to 1982 (I'm not sorry for the pun lol) with it's colourful visuals, retro-like sounds and music as well with its simplistic, yet addictive gameplay. Since it's free, there's no pain done to your wallet and it's a nice game that goes well in your steam library that doesn't take up a lot of your space.\n\n[h1] Pros [/h1]\n+ Colourful and nostalgic visuals\n+ Simplistic Gameplay\n+ Difficulty ramp if you want to take it up to the next step.\n+ Nice music and music customisation\n\n[h1] Cons [/h1]\n- People with seizures may not find this enjoyable (?)\n- Default music can be repetitive\n- Simplistic gameplay could be boring for some players.\n\n[h1] Rating: [/h1]\n8.5/10\n\nSigned by \n\ud835\udcd0\ud835\udcc8\ud835\udcbd

steam, because lets face it, most of the are poorly made or don't have much effort put into them, 1982 however is the EXACT OPPOSITE of that and is a retro throwback/tribute game/passion project done right with good execution, and I am honestly supprised this game is free, I would gladly pay at least 5 dollars for this game\n\nFor any retro enthusiasts (like me) or for anyone that is looking for a fun but simple time killer, let me break it down for ya\n\n1982 is literally a clusterfuck of many arcade games from the 80's mashed into one in the forms of gameplay elements and references\n\nFrom things like 2084 and Defender popping up as rainbow pixel text (references to Robotron 2084 and Defender respectively) to fighting foes that drop white laser looking things and turn into mushrooms when shot (Centipede) fighting ghosts that dodge your shots (Pac Man) and even powerups that you can shoot to use differently (common in many scrolling schmups) as well  as some formations of ships kamikazing or moving towards you (Galaga, note that this is not all the quote on quote \"stolen\" gameplay elements, and I use that term LIGHTLY because this game is far from a rip off, but this is some of the gameplay elements)\n\nThe refences aren't there just for chuckles or smiles, they actually drive the gameplay in fun and suprisingly creative ways\n\n\nTo top it off the colorful backgrounds reminicscent of the Atari/Intelevision days is a nice touch and the cheesy 80's techno voice and catchy beat is a nice touch\n\nBut the best part is its supprisingly varied modes, you can play modes such as normal (obviously you just try to get the highest score you can) or you can try surival (you die in one hit, the game normally has a health bar which can get refilled via a power up) or time attack, where you have unlimited lives , these varried modes coupled with adjustable diffculty give this game even more replay value than you would expect\n\nHey, even if this review doesn't convince you, download and try it anyway, it's free, so you have no money to spend, however I feel as though this is one of those rare moments when a free game on steam was awesome and worth the time to take downloading (very quickly while on topic) and to be honest, with how suprisingly fun the game is, I feel bad it was free, keep supporting good free games like this and maybe some of these small indie game makers will make an even bigger and better game that deserves your $, not saying that this game is bad, what I'm getting at is these are the kinds of free games that need to be looked at not only froma  game standpoint, but to give small companies like this the positive attention they need\n\nCheck out this game if you like retro arcade schmups or if your looking for something basic and fun yet just a bit in-depth (ie modes and gameplay elements)", "timestamp_created": 1501456007, "timestamp_updated": 1501456007, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0,

We only had GOOD games with REAL challenge and pain...[/h1]\n\nWow, this game came out of nowhere!  Hearing that it got achievements was the right button for the dev to press to get my download!\n\n[i]1982[/i] is a retro-inspired (and styled) game with references going back to Atari oldies like [i]Pac-Man[/i], [i]Centipede[/i], [i]Asteroid[/i], [i]Galaga[/i] and is played like [i]Space Invaders[/i].  You play this game with a mouse, so if you're a keyboard player, you'll unfortunately be out of luck.\n\nThe developer was kind enough to throw in an option to play to your own music if the game's music is irritating you.  This helps in case you want something calmer or more upbeat as you deal with its ever-increasing and maddening difficulty.  That said, the difficulty isn't easy, but is more fair when compared to various danmakus.  (You know which ones I'm talking about.)\n\nThough I never/rarely speak about a game's audio, I feel that it must be addressed that [i]1982[/i] has a nice tune that is welcoming and a bit energetic.  The sound effects utilized seem kinda like stock sounds, but bring more life to this game.  It just makes the game feel more...alive.  It sounds great as it accompanies the gameplay.\n\nThe achievements range from fair to hard, mostly involving an RNG factor which seems to work against you in certain modes.  To this, I feel the developer should look into increasing some spawn rates of certain events to make the achievement goals more attainable.\n\nIf you're looking for a free retro game with achievements that require a bit of effort, consider checking out [i]1982[/i].  Of course, this game is perfect for any retro junkie that wants that old game look with some new game flair (Neo-Retro?).

Bem nost\u00e1lgico.\n\nGr\u00e1fico 8.0 - O gr\u00e1fico... Sim, gr\u00e1ficos de arcade de ''1982'' o estilo retro n\u00e3o \u00e9 de se reclamar!

Um multiplayer seria muito mais legal, jogando sozinho.. O jogo come\u00e7a a ficar repetitivo, e termina enjoando do jogo, os gr\u00e1ficos, gameplay etc.. s\u00e3o muito bons.

1508593848}, "language": "english", "review": "1982 is an old school arcade shooter, and is a shining example of how the genre can still be amazing. It pays homage to the 80s both in its creative blend of Space Invaders (1978) and Centipede (1980), as well as in its references to other great arcade games such as Galaxian (1979), Pacman (1980), and Galaga (1981). Although it starts off like a Space Invaders clone, fans of arcade shooters and SHMUPS will notice it integrating elements of other games, most notably Centipede, Asteroids, and Missile Command.\n\nOne of my favorite things about this game is that it actually allows for some real strategizing rather than just shooting everything. The idea is that there will often be pickups that you can shoot to allow them to break and fall towards you. If you shoot them while they're falling, they'll turn into one of several different kinds of area of effect attacks (blue will shoot missiles in different directions, green causes a sizeable blast where it gets destroyed, red shoots lasers horizontally, etc.). However, if you don't shoot them and instead collect them as they fall to the bottom, you get one of several kinds of pickups (pink gives you extra firepower, green gives you energy, blue gives you a shield, red gives you rockets, etc.). So you'll be in certain situations where you have to think very quickly if the best course of action is to make an area of effect attack or get the power-up. I think this is a very nice addition to what could have been an otherwise generic, by-the-numbers arcade shooter.\n\nIn terms of aesthetics, 1982 has a very captivating art style. The color scheme is bright and vibrant, and all the sounds belong in the world of 80s arcade games. Many of the enemy shapes look like their 1980s counter-parts (for instance, the Pacman ghosts make an appearance). The controls handle extremely well and the game runs flawlessly. It allows control by mouse, keyboard, and gamepad. As usual, there are a few things that I feel could be better. One issue is that the sound of your ship firing is significantly louder than it should be, and if you die when a certain enemy is exploding (it takes a while to explode), the sound will just repeat itself over and over very loudly until you go to the main menu. I am also still a little confused as to the point of certain things. For instance, what is the point of collecting the falling people, and why do hearts come out of pickups since they obviously don't restore your health? The only other thing that felt weird is the point system, which is surprisingly low for an arcade shooter; I mean, getting something like 4 points per enemy in the beginning? I remember Asteroids and other games of that generation awarded something like 100 points per unit. It's an extremely minor nitpick but I think that boosting the score rate would make it feel more retro.\n\nAnyway, 1982 is a great game that doesn't just play its retro card, but rather improves upon a supposedly dead genre that to my knowledge has never been explored much in a creative way since the death of arcades. It's free and it's only 18 MB, so if you're a fan of arcade games, there's no excuse to not pick this up. I will be looking out for other games by this developer.

Im heutigen Test nehmen wir diesen, genauer unter die Lupe.\nGrafik:\nDie Grafik ist im 16 Bit Stiel gehalten, das hei\u00dft aber nicht das sie schlecht aussieht, im Gegenteil alle Grafischen Elemente sind sehr h\u00fcbsch gemacht und sehen sehr Scharf aus. Alles in allem passt der Art Style zum Gameplay und sorgt f\u00fcr gute \u00dcbersicht.\nGameplay:\nEine Story gibt es nicht, w\u00e4re aber auch untypische f\u00fcr das Genre, daf\u00fcr stimmt das Gameplay, ich gebe zu zun\u00e4chst dachte ich mir ohje das kann doch keinen Spa\u00df machen aber falsch gedacht der Epische Sound Track von LSD-Musik.net macht direkt im Haupt Menu Laune auf das Retro Arcade Game. \nDas Spiel wird mit der Zeit sehr schnell und ich als Arcade Noob komme schnell zu einem Punkt an dem ich versage und nicht mehr wirklich wei\u00df was ich da tue. Das Spiel liefert drei Modi, Arcade der klassische Space Invader Modus, Survivor ein Hardcore Modus in dem man selbst nur ein Leben der sich sonst aber kaum vom normalen Arcade Modus unterscheidet und Time Attack bei dem es gilt in 3 Minuten mit unbegrenzter Anzahl an Leben einen m\u00f6glichst hohen Score zu erspielen, dass macht das Ganze Spiel eine Note Kompetitive. Wer Gameplay zu jedem einzelnen Modus sehen m\u00f6chte Klickt jetzt oben Rechts auf die Info Karte oder auf den ersten Link in der Beschreibung, dort k\u00f6nnt ihr euch selbst \u00fcberzeugen. Das Spiel ist vor allem auch f\u00fcr Einsteiger oder Ab und zu Spieler geeignet da man schnell hineinfindet und sich direkt mit anderen Spielern per Scoreboard messen kann.\nAnforderungen:\nDie Anforderungen an euren Computer sind so niedrig, dass das Spiel sogar auf meinem Taschenrechner angetrieben von einem 100 Gram Schwerem Hamster funktionieren w\u00fcrde.

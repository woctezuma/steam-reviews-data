Out of the VR rhythm games I've played Audioshield is best for versatility, allowing you to play with whatever music or YouTube video you can find. It also makes you feel like you're an epic hero saving the world from an alien invasion of bubbles! However, I often find that the generation of bubbles can be... Strange. Sometimes you'll get a stream of red bubbles to the far right immediately followed by a red bubble to the far left. I'm not really sure how anyone is able to hit those. It seems impossible to me. Perhaps it's a flaw with me and not the game but it does make it a little frustrating; it certainly doesn't feel like it's me. The game is also just as repetitive and samey as Audiosurf so it certainly isn't something you spend hours on everyday. I have also found that of all the games I've played, aside from Climbey, Audioshield glitches the most often. However, this could be my set up? I'm not sure. The shield sometimes move out of my hands and the game pauses with a grey screen causing me to miss some bubbles I otherwise wouldn't. This doesn't happen as often in other games. It usually only happens during the first song I play for the session though, maybe the whole machine just needs to warm up lol.\n\nThat being said it is one of my favourite games for a reason. It's fun, energising and a great way of warming up for much more challenging games like BOXVR and Sprint Vector (both of which I also recommend, but they certainly need you to warm up and I always warm up with Audioshield). I tried warming up with Holoball today but because it requires full body movement and I was feeling lazy going into my play session I felt no motivation to chase the ball flying at me.I switched to Audioshield for a couple songs and was immediately in the zone even though I did worse than usual at blocking the bubbles.\n\nAs a relaxing game, a way to listen to music and move at the same time (because you know, we need something to help us with that obviously  lol) and my personal favourite warm up game Audioshield is the best. It's also great to use to just... You know...

AWESOME!\nNarrator: As it turned out, it wasn't awesome.\n\nEnglish isn't my native, please be gentle. \n\nI would say I was pretty hyped to play AUDIOSHIELD, because it's often mentioned when there is a \"TOP 10 GAMES\" of VR. I played Guitar Hero on the Wii so I thought I'd get a similar feeling while playing (reads: to feel as being one with the music), but there is one big issue for it and that's - rhythm.\nThe ONLY thing this game is being expected from is that you, beating the orbs, are in sync with the beat you're listening to, but exactly there, it fails. \n\nMost of the time it felt like I was beating orbs which have nothing to do with the music that currently plays. And that is, mildly speaking, boring. \n\nFirst I tried the two first choices I was presented with and then chose \"This cannot continue\" from the NieR: Automata OST. The last one has some parts with heavy emphasis on the beat and I had expected that this is one of the tracks where the game can shine the most. \nFor example: the singing voice has a few long streched out words, before the last one's are sung with a heavy tonation on each word and it all ends with a final \"HUAH!\" shout (like the last part of the FUS-RO-DAH). The change of tone your hear of these three parts wasn't converged into the orbs flying to me. At all. At least for the last shout you would expact a single big bubble you have to block, but it's merged into one big \"tube\" to block with the rest of before.\nFor the rest, most of the time you beat bubbles out of sync to the music beat.\n\nVisually, it is okay. The bubbles look crappy but the particle effects the moment you block them give you a nice feedback for your success (with the controller rumble).\n\n\nI had no time to play it within two weeks, otherwise I would have refunded it. \n2/10.", "timestamp_created": 1516396434, "timestamp_updated": 1516396434, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.462185", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39463305": {"recommendationid": "39463305", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085401221", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518825212}, "language": "french", "review": "Ce jeu est juste un Must have pour tout utilisateur de VR", "timestamp_created": 1516382944, "timestamp_updated": 1516382944, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39454750": {"recommendationid": "39454750", "author": {"steamid": "76561198285378682", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 453, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516801969}, "language": "english", "review": "Well my friends and I have been playing this game a lot.

In spite of this, I still can't recommend it because it just feels very beta. The UI is finicky and unrefined, the hit detection can be a bit off when the shields are held closer to you, but the big one: the beat generation is pretty bad. This is really noticably when you get in the zone, and start moving with the music more. Often times the beats don't feel aligned with the most impactful movements of the song. Song's got thundering bass? Well we're gonna follow the weak little melody. And then when it does get the beats of the song right, they feel off. The genres I was playing with were modern electronic, as well as some 90s techno.\n\nThe other big one, I think the play testers for this game were all taller than me. I'm short, and hitting some beats can be challenge because they're out of reach of my handspan. THis happens especially often during sections which require you to cross your arms. \n\nI wanted to love this game as much as I did the original Audiosurf, but sadly that didn't happen. Still, it's a nice bit of light cardio, and I'm probably going to keep using it for that.\n\nWith some tender love and care, this game would be worth every penny, but for now, that's not the case.

After putting over 30 hours into the original Audiosurf, I can't not love this game. Hands down, best music fighting VR game out there.\n\nThat being said, the more you play, the more apparent the issues become and I have a few gripes. \nFirst, I don't like that the orbs come from an upwards angle. I'd much prefer a lower, more straight angle for my neck's sake. I've noticed it's different for different songs so I wonder if there's something in the algorithm that decides this (I'm pretty sure it has to do with volume or speed). This isn't terrible once you get used to it but still not my favorite.\n\nSecond, the song accuracy is not quite there yet. I'd say it's probably about 80%. When it works, it's absolutely amazing and there are times where I've hit the perfect groove and it's one of the greatest experience VR has to offer. When it doesn't work, it's confusing and a bit frustrating. A lot of this seems to stem from the difficulty setting, which I'll get into later.\n\nThird, the hit detection doesn't always seem right. It seems the shield has to collide properly with a certain portion of the orb, which causes grief when you actually hit the orb but don't pass that threshold and it counts as a miss. I've also noticed that if I swing and sort of slap an orb, it doesn't usually count. I'm not sure if I'm just not hitting it or if that's not detected properly, but it bothers me.\n\nFourth, I think the difficulties need to be tweaked to provide better challenges. It seem like the game is balanced around the middle difficulty, with that appearing to be the intended way to play and the most in-tune with the algorithm. The lower difficult just has less orbs, and the higher difficult has more orbs (to a fault sometimes). Often the higher difficulty throws hand-crossing orbs in such rapid succession I'm doubtful it's actually physically possible. It also occasionally throws orbs at you from outside your peripheral vision, which is kind of a dick move. The middle difficulty is really the sweet spot, but sometimes I can't help but wish for more orbs, as long as they were fair in in logical patterns.\n\nFifth, the choices for environment and shields are pretty crappy. I picked the top ones when I started and none of the others feel right. This might be just because I've gotten used to the game like that, but honestly the stage and beach environments feel really distracting and off.\n\nSixth, I would love some support for putting together playlists so I can play songs consecutively. I like to use this as a way to get myself active and doing albums is my favorite way to play. If not that, I'd like support for longer songs (I think it caps at about an hour) and support for cue/flac rips.\n\nOverall I loved the game, although it's not perfect and feels a little light (sale price of $10 is fair).

I am an Oculus Rift owner and most of my VR games are from the Oculus store, but not all. I wanted a \"music\" type of game. I think it's important to have a wide variety of games in one's library. So, I chose AUDIOSHIELD to scratch that itch. It looks incredibly easy to play and it is to a point. As soon as you think, \"awe, this too easy\", it changes a bit and throws you a curve. The environments are  engaging and cool. I would like to see more at some time. \n\nIf you don't have the right song, the game seems a little off. But, once you hit the right song, it soars. At first, I just wasn't feeling it, but then I selected a song from my own music library (it lets you do that) and it seemed to come to life. I'll not mention the song title that felt right for me, as I feel it's a personal choice and you'll know when you hit it.\n\nThe song came to life and I was teleported to a place that I had never been before. I was inside the music. I was a part of it and it was a part of me. It was such a feeling of euphoria, that it's hard to describe.\n\nI keep coming back to this game. I've been ripping songs from my CD collection and playing with those. Older tunes work well, too, but not all. Hell, I'm even trying Frank Sinatra and Glenn Miller CD's! The Humble Pie song, \"30 Days In The Hole\", is great in this!

Game is fantastic, but it has its flaws. The primary of them being that interaction with the menu is a pain. An inability to log into your Youtube account and play preselected playlists and that the modified Youtube search that this browser uses is quite obnoxious as song titles have to be rather exact to find what your looking for.\n\nI understand the reason for the later or at least I assume I do. The reason I would assume is so that the leaderboards are more populated and thus I'm rather mixed on this as I really, really like the leaderboards.\n\nIntergration into streaming services would be the best thing that this game could implement. I understand the limitations of it needing to parse the song entirely before beginning and whatnot, but surely there could be a way to work around this by working with these streaming services?\n\nAt least in an ideal world. Unlikely to happen given the all the IP restrictions on music so I won't place much blame on the developer. Just makes me sad at how wonderful it would be. Also would be good for the leaderboards so that there aren't duplicates as there are on Youtube. \n\nI would recommend the game. Even at asking price. If looking for something liesurely to pass the time, maybe not. Especially if you aren't in shape and don't care to get in shape. Game on low difficulties is rather boring. At high difficulties it is tense, fast pace, and unforgiving. Gets your blood pumping and can definitely get a good sweat going. An unfortunate thing with the Vive foam pads as they do soak. I like to run a fan swiveling towards me. \n\nIf looking to get some cardio in though, 30 minutes of this a day cannot be beaten. It will get the heart going and its fun.

Yes, there are some annoyances as a number of reviews have mentioned. Some music patterns make for false misses if you don't hold the shield pretty still -- when the orbs are moving slowly and lurching to the beat -- but knowing this you can work with it.  And the UI could certainly use some love.  However, it's still really really really fun.  And when you can comfortably play on the Elite mode the synchronization to the music becomes quite tight.

However, it is not the best.  I actually think the lesser played and lower rated Soundboxing is better.  They are very similar.  The big difference is player involvement.  Soundboxing is all about social interaction and challenges and player created beatmaps.  Therein lies the problem with Soundboxing.  It relies on humans being good at creating beatmaps.  That's a very iffy proposition when VR is filled with kids who upload no matter their expertise.  \n\nAudioshield takes that problem away by making every beatmap computer generated.  The beatmaps are usually solid.  The problem is that they are never spectacular.  There's never a beatmap where a non-musically challenged person could not say, hey give me time and I can make a better one.  We never get that option.  So we're left with very good, solid experiences.  In the end, that's not exactly a bad thing.  I like Audioshield.  But I like that I didn't pay full price and got it 50% off even more.  \n\nThis game is a good workout.  There's more than just punching.  There's holding the note/punch/beat and there's combos.   If all you want is a nice workout to your favorite music, then this is one of the best titles you can purchase if not the best.  You can also listen to new music that's recommended or trending.  But unlike Soundboxing, there's less of a social connection.  That's not the focus of the game.  I often played songs there just because I knew certain players put out good beatmaps.  You could follow their creations.  That doesn't exist here.  The leaderboard almost doesn't matter.  It feels more solitary, shadowboxing alone.\n\nRating 7/10\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1511855342, "timestamp_updated": 1511855342, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37859321": {"recommendationid": "37859321", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977297459", "num_games_owned": 1431, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 6579, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 117, "last_played": 1520837743}, "language": "english", "review": "I own a Vive FOR this game. \nWhile I really enjoy VR a lot Audioshield is the game I keep coming back to over and over.

Picked up this title as it was recommended as one of the first games you should get.  I debated because I stream all my music and you need to have mp3 or audio files on your harddrive. You can also select from YouTube videos, and not link to Favorites. I remembered I had about 8gb of music on an old flashdrive and uploaded them. Just a bunch of favorites.\nI do have to say this one is my favorite VR game. The trailer on Steam is pretty accurate other that not being able to capture the full aspect of VR. Play is stationary, i.e. you can stand in one area as long as you have the abilty to reach out with your arms in an ~120 degree arc, so not overly wide. A bit of overhead so be careful of ceiling fans.\nGameplay is simple, you hit the incoming blue and orange (red) dots, you get points on accuracy, style, and punch power.

My most played VR game, and for good reason. \n\nThe ability to play your own selection of music means you can easily get lost in the groove, and this obviously adds a lot of variety. The beat detection algorithm isn't perfect, but for the most part is perfectly adequate if the quality of the audio reccording is sufficient - garbage in, garbage out. With a bit of practice, you can soon learn how the algorithm is treating each song and focus on those elements; once you figure this out, you can start throwing some great shapes :) The Youtube integration means you don't even need to have a local copy of the song and can stream any video you find there. Scores are submitted to the global leaderboards, and you can choose to ignore them, or try to get yourself to the top, adding a further layer of replayability. The difficulty levels scale reasonably well, from normal mode where you won't have to cross your arms and can almost stand still, to Elite level where - with the right sort of song - you will be active for every second, with frantic flapping of arms and bouncing around your playspace...\n\nWhilst the ability to play any song adds almost infinite replayability and variety, the lack of arenas makes thigns a bit \"samey\", and if your local music library is not organised very well you will not have fun navigating the interface (though there is a working search function!!), but these are very minor points and in no way impact the actual gameplay which is itself, flawless, in my opinion.\n\nIt's also an excellent demo/introduction to VR; there is no involuntary movement so relatively free from nausea problems, the concept is very easy to understand, the normal mode is very forgiving, and the ability to stream songs from youtube means the new players can try it out on a song they know/love and this really aids in getting comfortable with the VR environment.\n\nIf you own a VR headset and enjoy listening to music, you can do a lot worse than picking this up, sale price or not.

That's annoying as the recent songs and favorites are not saved. So I manually close Audioshield after 4 songs to avoid this.\n- The search in Youtube only delivers a handful of songs and it is hard to find the version of a song you want. It would be great to be able to add Youtube links to the favorites outside VR.\n- For some videos on Youtube the game tells me that the song has to be processed as it is started the first time and it would not happen the next time. It happens every time I start these videos and takes quite a while.\nExample: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVgSuuUTwQ\n\nSo even if the game is really nice and fun to play, the downsides are pretty annoying for me. But I still recommend it, especially if you don't encounter the stuck issue when loading the songs.\nIn a rating I would give it 6,5/10. 8/10 if it would not get stuck that often and the songs really would just have to be processed only once.

I used to love DDR when I was a teenager, and this game is like a VR version for your arms, except it's even better because you aren't limited by song choice. You can play any audio with it, which I absolutely love!! This game has helped me actually enjoy exercising again for the first time in years. Because of that, it is also helping me with my depression and anxiety which is this incredible and unexpected benefit that I cannot thank you guys enough for.\n\nI have been obsessively playing this game almost every day since we got our VR headset at the beginning of this month (and felt ridiculously deprived for the week when we had no headset because we decided to return the VIVE and get the Rift instead.) I'm absolutely in love with this game. Because of that, I have a few suggestions that I really think would make it even better.\n\nFirst, I wish there was a way to adjust the height/width of the playing area and the shoulder level of the game. Sometimes, the red and blue spheres come flying from so high above me that my neck is craned way, way back to the point where it really hurts my neck and shoulders and they start to cramp up. If there were a way to manually set a limiter for that it would be such a relief. It doesn't even need to be adjusted that much; I enjoy that the height changes throughout the song, it just goes too far back for me and it becomes painful. I know I can take a step back behind the shoes on the ground as a sort of \"quick fix\" but it doesn't completely work because then the spheres are flying into the wrong area and then I find myself bending forward in an awkward position instead of it being the fluid dance that it usually is. If we could set our own parameters so that it fits our unique body that would be so nice. Same thing with the horizontal area from left to right. Because the edges of the headset don't allow for as much peripheral vision as we have in real life, I am constantly noticing a sphere here and there wayyyy off to the side that completely escaped my attention and I missed it because it was out of the range of my peripheral vision and I didn't even know it was there. It's not the end of the world, but it's definitely frustrating when you know that you wouldn't have missed it if you had actually been able to see it. I love how the game has a wide playing area, but for me I feel like it just needs to be slightly smaller to be comfortable. I wouldn't mind having the option for the spheres to go lower than they currently do, either.\n\nAnd as a way to make that whole idea even more user friendly, you could also allow us to set multiple profiles within the game so that if multiple people in the household play the game often, they don't have to constantly manually adjust these settings each time they switch. They can just select their profile (shoulder level, playing area size, etc.) and go. And I wish you could switch between steam accounts easily under one game setup. My fiance and I play most of our VR games through his account (this one) because it's just easier. But now all of my high scores are under his account so I don't get bragging rights. It's too much of a pain to switch between steam accounts all the time so I just don't worry about it. Still, though!\n\nOkay, and one more super cool idea. I'm sure everyone keeps telling you that you need more places to play (since there are only currently 3 locations to select from.) Well, what if, rather than having to make a whole bunch of new locations, you just made it compatible with Steam VR Environments?? Then anyone could choose from any environment they love, download directly to the game, and play there! That would really take Audioshield to a whole new level!!!\n\nLast but not least... I think that at some point there needs to be an even harder level than Elite. It is still wonderfully challenging, but some songs are so much better than others (pattern-wise) and there are songs I would love to play but even on elite they are just too slow between spheres. And some songs where there are really challenging parts (usually when the music picks up) but there are still long sections of the song where there are less spheres and it gets a little boring. And then there are songs that are really hard throughout the whole song and I LOVE that. Every time I find a song that is challenging the whole way through I'm like YESSSSS!!! The best part of this game is that it not only challenges your body to keep up, but it also challenges your brain. I'd rather do harder levels, even if I miss more, because my brain stays so focused and entertained in addition to the exercise I'm getting. That's the part that keeps me coming back for more!\n\nThank you again for making this game -- it is absolutely fantastic!! I LOVE IT!\n\nEdit: Yes, please, please, please create a harder level than Elite.

I would say Audioshield is the game with the \u201cmost covenience factor.\u201d\n\nYou can just jump in, find a YouTube song and play. All the beatmaps are created by an algorithm, and if the song was never played by anyone before, Audioshield will scan it and create the beatmap for you. \n\nThe game doesn't require third party programs to access music libraries and it doesn't require people to create beatmaps for you (or it doesn't require you to create one). Sounds good so far and it's the main reason I like Audioshield \u2013 there is little upkeep required.\n\nSince the beatmaps are created by an algorithm you can choose difficulty, so you can start slow and work your way up the difficulty levels, again a good thing about using an algorithm VS user made beatmaps. This also lets you avoid silly beatmap, where the person who created it does something very complicated that it is really not intuitive at all.\n\nWhile I seem to praise Audioshield's algorithm, I didn't really touch on the quality of its beatmaps which greatly varies from song to song. Audioshield seems to work best with classical music (for example try the Star Wars soundtrack), especially when there are no vocals. Volume seems to be the factor that influences beats the most.\n\nAudioshield will always throw you beats that correspond to something in the song, but what it does throw at you changes from attempt to attempt and it can be seemingly random. One time you will have to punch your way through the bass. The next it will be two beats from the base, one from a word it picked on, 1 from the drums, 1 from the guitar. This makes it seem like the beats are not on the rhythm. It is also very apparent that the algorithm can't fully distinguish the various instruments. Sadly, I don't think it's possible to code an algorithm that can do that perfectly, unless the instruments are saved on separate tracks. This is essentially what Holodance does for their story mode songs \u2013 they separate the instruments and then map them.\n\nMovement wise, Audioshield is my favourite. You use more of your virtual canvas than the other two games, certainly more than Soundboxing. You can make very large and sweeping movements, thing which you can do with Holodance, but Audioshield does it to a bigger degree. The bigger canvas however does present the issue of missing some beats because they were out of your field of view. It also presents issues at higher difficulties, where you have to touch to beats on the opposite sides of your \u201ccanvas\u201d with the same hand in a VERY short time. I lost count of the amount of times I yelled, \u201cI don't bend that way!\u201d\n\nAlthough I do lean towards a particular music genre, my taste in music is fairly eclectic, so I find I can't stick to only playing Audioshield because some of the songs I want to play work better in Soundboxing. But when I am tired to play U2, Anastacia or ACDC in Soundboxing, and I want to play Singing In The Rain or the Star Wars Imperial March \u2013 Audioshield is definitely my go to.", "timestamp_created": 1499457640, "timestamp_updated": 1499457640, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33297442": {"recommendationid": "33297442", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987165926", "num_games_owned": 192, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 674, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517100757}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic game!

I rather enjoy the Hard and Elite difficulties, it's a great game to just put on as a warm up or even just to play for an hour or too. As with AS2, the game relies on your own tracks to generate a level for you which is pretty much the best thing about this game as you can find a track that's right for you and just mess with each of the difficulty settings.\n\nThe game basically works by giving you a shield in each hand, left is blue, right is orange and you use them to hit the corresponding colours flying towards you, occasionally bringing the two colours together to make a shield to hit purple orbs.\n\nHonestly the game seems to function more like a work-out routine, a few songs on the higher difficulties and you're already sweating bullets, it's fantastic. Tracking of the headset and controllers is smooth as anything and I've had no major issues with the game aside from the occasional weird shake in the menus and you don't need a large play space either.\n\nI'd definitely recommend giving this game a go, especially if you've got a decent music library of fast/upbeat tracks (although there's an option to use YouTube too!)\n\nOverall, I'd give it an 8/10, a fun experience that could do with a few modes (maybe Workshop content like AS2) and maybe some harder difficulties without needing to mod the game to do so.", "timestamp_created": 1499194251, "timestamp_updated": 1499194251, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33238182": {"recommendationid": "33238182", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999075859", "num_games_owned": 679, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 293, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513511457}, "language": "english", "review": "Easily the best paid VR game I own. . .which is rather sad because it's not very well done on so many levels.

It allows you to pick ANY youtube video and have it convert to notes and have you dance to it. It gives an incredible workout and makes you feel like a total boss climbing up the leaderboard. That said there are a couple complaints. The main being frequent crashes. Sometimes when I am in a game the thing starts to glitch. For some reason some songs are worse than others. I play this one song ([Sukone Tei] Psychotic Love Song) and while it is one of the most amazing songs for audioshield, it tends to crash halfway through. I am able to play for long periods of time but the game gives way to many crashes. A couple days the video searching function didn't work. My only other complaints are the lack of variety and it being easy. Sometimes I put some really intense songs.....only to have the notes go very slow. It ruins the groove and I can't play some songs I otherwise really enjoy. As for the lack of variety, there are only blue notes, red notes, and purple notes. Sometimes you hold them in one spot but that's about it. In a FEW (As in like 3) songs I found spots where the long notes curve and have this little twist. If there were more things like that then the songs would be more interesting. \n\nInteresting ideas:\n-Times where you have to completely freeze (Hopefully matching quiet parts of some intense songs like right before the beat drops)\n-Certain notes that you have to dodge (Whole body if possible)\n-Green notes (maybe another color) that make you have to move your hands in certain patterns\n-Community-made notes that will fit songs. Like, you could go with the actual formula or choose a pattern someone else made\n\nI don't know.

I was a big fan of Audiosurf, mainly because I could select my own music to play. Audioshield is a great new version on Audiosurf. \n\nThere are some things that could be improved upon. \n\nI've noticed that there are a lot of complaints about the game being too easy. From what I've noticed, the better quality audio source, the harder the game is. Many people use the YouTube stream feature for play, where the audio is heavily compressed. It seems that the game does not read each note as precisely as if you use a music file from your computer. I've also noticed that, while using music from your computer, there is a difference in difficulty between bit rates. I have played the same track in 128 kbps MP3, 128 kbps OGG, 350 kbps OGG, and 16 bit WAV. The WAV file had a somewhat steeper difficulty curve compared to the lesser formats. All were significantly harder than anything played from YouTube.\n\nMusical genre has a large impact on the difficulty of the game. A track such as Current Value - Loner played on hardest difficulty will be significantly more challenging that something like Armin Van Buuren - Drowning. I'm not sure if this was an intentional design practice, or something that happened as a result of programming limitations, but either way you spin it, if you want to have the game be more challenging, play faster songs with more complex drum patterns.\n\nAll in all, it's a very fun game.

Use your own songs! This freedom is easily the best part of this game.\n    [*]The stages are abstract and can make it easy to focus on the music.  I personally prefer the type of stages you'd find in Beats Fever, but this is at least less likely to lag.\n    [*]Great optimizations and a professional level polish to the menu UI.  Everything is easy to understand and runs smoothly on both my Phenom II X4 955 and my Ryzen 1600X, though I find that the YouTube streaming hiccups a lot on my older hardware, pausing every 30-45 seconds to buffer.\n    [*]Recommendations seem to be on-point a lot of the time with fast-paced songs and songs which just sound really cool.  When I bought this, I kept telling myself I would use my own mp3 library, but I find it easier to just play the recommended songs from YouTube.  The YouTube songs often come with lyrics, too, which is a nice bonus.\n[/olist]\n\nCons: \n\n[olist]\n    [*]Note orbs often do not fit the music.  Note orbs move eradically, pausing for no particular reason and moving at different speeds to hinder your timing.  I prefer notes move toward you at a constant speed so I can plan ahead.\n    [*]The difficulty levels can be very hard or very easy and often not anywhere inbetween.  I found the game too easy and not fun enough unless I played in Harder or higher difficulty, but some songs aren't as accurate as others and the difficulty settings are there to help alleviate that.\n    [*]I found myself getting worn out trying to swing my arms into the right position to get the right color, because the colors of notes and their position are totally random.\n    [*]You're limited to just 3 stages, and they're mostly abstract scenery, aside from the concert stage, which is decidedly low quality.  I would like to see different levels of quality for each stage and more stages to choose from.  I'd be happy to pay for that as a DLC, too.\n    [*]There's no way to add your own custom note tracks for songs from what I can tell.  It would be really cool to see user-generated tracks for popular songs.\n[/olist]\n\nOverall, this game is great.  Audioshield gives me a lot more replay value than Beats Fever does.

For a rhythm game, it really has a hard time keeping the onscreen obstacles with the rhythm. \n\nI've seen reviews saying it crashes and freezes, I haven't had one issue with it so far, runs perfect for me. I've also seen reviews saying it's a great work out and you'll have sweat running down your face, maybe if you're in very poor shape, like don't normally move around much shape. \n\nThis is a game that is on the highest rated VR games and best sellers, so I maybe put a little too much stock in and set my expiations too high on the \"puts you at the point of impact for every hit in your music\" tag line. So that\u2019s what I was expecting, something that kept time and felt like I was visually playing the music. I tried popular music, recommended music from the game, most popular songs used, my own downloaded music and any every list in the game to see if it got any better. But it\u2019s only accurate when there\u2019s heavy beat with little to no other instruments or music in the song.\n\nWhen the song picks up, the game is just all over the place. Not really throwing the obstacles with the beat or rhythm, just throwing random balls and whatever as what I'm assuming is the software losing track of what's going on. That\u2019s what I\u2019m also assuming about this game, it\u2019s just trying to \u201cguess\u201d what to display on screen based on the song selected. But it seems like the software has a hard time trying to determine what to do most of the time and you just end up hitting random bubbles out of rhythm.\n\nAs most songs pick up you just find yourself playing a whack a mole game to a song you picked instead of an actual rhythm game. Usually in the intro and outro of most songs it keeps the beat and rhythm very well. Though, the game does substitute the lack of accuracy with the bubbles staying on beat with having the speed of them change with the tempo of the music, that's what the game does best in my opinion. \n\nBut the game is fun, even out of rhythm and beat you're often challenged with the left right left left oh right again, nope wrong color game play. As the bubble obstacles zoom in to your position you end up just reacting at times like something is actually coming at you, so the game does a very good job with the depth and feel of it all. \n\nI know it sounds like I\u2019m bashing the game, but don't get me wrong, I really did enjoy playing the game. I was having fun but something seemed off. That does hamper on the \u201cfun\u201d of it as you find yourself just punching randomness to a song you picked instead of going with the rhythm of the song you picked. \n\nDo I recommend this game? Sure\nDo I think it's a bit over rated? Definitely\n\nI'd give it a 7 out 10 for being a rhythm game that can't keep up with the real rhythm. \n", "timestamp_created": 1497656642, "timestamp_updated": 1497656642, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.626274", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32448433": {"recommendationid": "32448433", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079009910", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 119, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492399926}, "language": "english", "review": "A very cool musical experience.", "timestamp_created": 1497552567, "timestamp_updated": 1497552567, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32413921": {"recommendationid": "32413921", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020445786", "num_games_owned": 830, "num_reviews": 137, "playtime_forever": 208, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507841249}, "language": "english", "review": "9 out of 10 (if it was working)\n\nCrashes during every song.

I was disappointed.\nPros:\n - Totally smooth on geforce 1080. Looks good; generous particle effects.\n - When everything syncs up, VR beat dance is a great idea, and fun.\n - Pretty cool that it can import youtube videos, though it takes a while and seems to be only some subset of youtube.\nCons:\n - The automatic beat inference is bad. I tried a bunch of different music, including just some random tunes I like, electronic music that I thought would be \"easy for it\", and the globally most popular tracks (which I figured must be good?). There were certainly moments where I felt the sequence matched the song well, but they didn't last long. Like sometimes you'd get to a point in the song that was obviously symmetric to something you just did, but the dot sequence would just be different.\n - Menus and things seem pretty unpolished. \"Change location\" button just didn't do anything. Post-game report is like an ascii-formatted text file that shows up in a text box. There is no introduction for first-time players; it just throws you into the song browser.\n - Seems like they could easily provide more environments, but there are only three, so I got bored of those pretty fast.\n - It's hard to get perfect scores, but I didn't find the game all that challenging even at the highest level; there's not much negative feedback if you miss hitting dots and you can't \"fail\" a song like in Guitar Hero. I would like to see it directly challenge me some more. It also could use the up/down dimension more on difficult sequences.

I promise that you will not regret it.  The concept of this game may seem too short for $20, but trust me, it's not.  This is probably the most addicting VR game that I own because you can search youtube for literally any song or play one of the popular songs and try to get to the top of the leaderboard.\nTo sum this up (and make this review less tedious to read) here is a list of pros and cons with this game:\n\nPROS:\n-Super fun\n-Infinite new songs to play\n-Really good workout (there has actually been someone who has done a short study on how many calories you burn in vr games and this is one of those games that he did the study on.  Here is the link to the article that I found about it: https://uploadvr.com/best-htc-vive-games-excercise/     )\n-Wide veriety of difficulties: Casual, Normal, Hard, Harder, and Elite for any level of challenged and sweaty you want to be\n-You can rock out to the pokemon theme song along with my personal favorite, \"We Are Number One\"\n-The graphics and effects are really cool\n-There are pvarious types of shields and environments to fit your liking\n-You can search for a song from either in the game or from your computer with ease meaning if someone is trying it out you can set it up for them, or if you are alone and don't want to take your headset off to look at your computer you can just do a youtube search from inside the game\n-You can comete against others and get creative with your movements to earn more points\n\n\nCONS:\n-You can't play for as long as you probably would like to; it gets really tiring and you get really sweaty after a while.\n-As I said, this game can be really tiring if you are playing on a more intense difficulty.  If you hate moving this probably isn't for you, but even though it gets tiring it is so worth it and so fun\n-The sweat. Preare to have waterfalls coming down your nose.  You might have to take off the headset to wipe your face between games if you are playing on a hard dificulty.\n\nI've seen other people say that the notes aren't exactly in line with the song.  This is sortof true because it is auto-generated, so instead of the noted being in line with the lyrics I have noticed that they tend to be more in line with the actual notes, pitch, and volume.  This may sound bad if you havn't played the game, but this didn't really effect the expirience to me.  In fact, it sometimes even made the game more fun and made me feel more badass even thogh I deep down know that I probably look ridiculous in real life.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\nI 100% reccomend this game.  This is probably my favorite vr game, and that's going up against games like vanishing rhealms, the lab, rec room, the blu, and many others that I own and I've only had this game for a day or so! I Havn't found any problems that are too bad so far and I love, love, LOVE this game.\n\n\nPS: The only time I write long reviews is when I really like or dislike something.", "timestamp_created": 1492404278, "timestamp_updated": 1492404278, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.621366", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31184102": {"recommendationid": "31184102", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000136781", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1577, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520431917}, "language": "english", "review": "Audioshield has overtaken our home.  For me and my roommates, this is the Vive killer app, and maybe it will be for you, too.\n\nLet's get the few minor cons out of the way, first:\n[list]\n    [*]As others have noted, in some songs the orbs sometimes sync up poorly with the music, making such songs borderline unenjoyable (i.e., it seems more like a random pattern than any kind of rhythm).\n    [*]I have not experienced this, but some players report that very rarely, the game does not correctly detect an orb being blocked (my roommate, obsessed with getting perfect scores, can attest to how frustrating this can be).\n    [*]The menu interface still has some minor glitches, and certain functions are difficult to navigate to or occasionally decide not to work at all (this does not affect the gameplay at all, though, only the menus).\n    [*]If you go to play a song on YouTube that has never been played before, the game must analyze the entire video before it is ready for you to play (though if someone else did play it at least once already, you can just start right away, which is the case with most popular songs).\n[/list]\n\nOkay, now on to the good stuff:\n[list]\n    [*]THIS GAME IS AMAZING!!  Find yourself some good songs where the orbs match up well (not that hard, I assure you; try some of the popular songs), crank up the difficulty, and jump in.  If you're a fan of rhythm games, you won't want to stop (seriously, as I write this I just finished a three-hour play session)!!\n    [*]Being able to connect to YouTube is a great feature.  Pretty much any song you could possibly think of is there for you to try, so you don't technically even need your own library, and it's easy to get lost in all the possibilities.\n    [*]The leaderboards! If you are even a little competitive, it can be a lot of fun challenging other people's scores.  And even if someone has a perfect score on a song, you can still \"dethrone\" them if you also get a perfect (though since it is possible to set up notifications when you get dethroned, don't think they won't try to take that top spot back).\n    [*]Like DDR before it, you will accidentally be getting a workout just by playing a video game... so this is definitely one game you don't have to feel guilty about getting addicted to.\n    [*]Like similar VR games (e.g. Space Pirate Trainer), this can be really fun to play locally with a group of friends taking turns (and guests can even put their own names in, to better keep track of scores).\n    [*]Lastly, the developer seems to be actively updating the game (adding new features, arenas, and so on), so as far as I can tell this game has a hopeful future ahead of it.\n[/list]\n\nAnd finally some neutral notes (whether these are pros or cons depends on your perspective):\n[list]\n    [*]Each playthrough of a song will be slightly different.  While the exact timing and amount of orbs in a given song never change, the placement (and even orb color) can change from one playthrough to the next (though for those so inclined, there is supposedly a mod that changes this so every playthrough is identical).\n    [*]The game scores you on both your technical ability (i.e., blocking every single orb), as well as your artistic ability (i.e., how much you move around to the music), and the technical score takes precendence on the leaderboards.  This means, for example, that someone with a perfect technical score of 10.00 but a terrible artistic score of 5.00 would still beat someone with an excellent technical score of 9.99 and a perfect artistic score of 10.00. A little unintuitive, I think, and good to be aware of if you want to top the leaderboards.\n    [*]Finally, you need a compatible VR headseat with motion controllers (duh, but... just in case).\n[/list]\n\nIn short, I highly recommend this game to anyone who owns a VR headset and is a fan of rhythm games or working out to music.  Recognize that you may find some duds, but the songs that work really well (and again, there are a lot of them) make it all worth it.\n\nHope to see you on the leaderboards!! \u263a", "timestamp_created": 1492367236, "timestamp_updated": 1492367831, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31150695": {"recommendationid": "31150695", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983452355", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 656, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513800540}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has been superb, the cardio is amazing the music is great because its what ever you want to listen to!

I purchased Audiosurf a few years ago, and liked the aspect of a music-based game using your own music instead of preinstalled or proprietary tracks. It was a cool idea, but not a game I could play for hours on a controller. When I heard the same company created the same idea, but on a VR platform. I couldn't contain my excitement. The game is beautifully put together, and it's incredibly easy to navigate the menus which can be done via your monitor and mouse or the HMD and controllers.\n\nAllowing the usage of Youtube videos is a new feature that was not available in Audiosurf, but for those of you with weaker systems it should be known the youtube video plays in the background along with the orbs coming at your face which can easily put a strain on your GPU. If you've got an extensive library of popular songs though, you'll have no issue finding some competition on their leaderboards which will be visible to you before you launch your song. Once you complete a song, you can see how you compare with others globally, within your region (aka state in the US) or your Steam friends that also play. You can also add your email address which will notify you if you are ever bested in a song by another, and your position in the leaderboard shifts down.\n\nFinally, there are a TON of people claiming the orbs do not sync in time with the song. That is crap. The orbs do sync in time with the song, but they won't always sync on the downbeat or on the part of a song which you would probably anticipate. The algorithm the game uses will often produce orbs on subdivisions of beats. If you are a musician or have any sense of rhythm outside 1-2-3-4, then you'll easily be able to feel the orbs syncing up with the tempo of the song. That being said, if you play something like Merzbow on Audioshield, the algorithm will most likely produce orbs that seem sporadic. The best music I've found to play on Audioshield are things like EDM, dubstep, trap, trance, even bass heavy pop songs. Post-hardcore & screamo music works well, too.\n\nAs stated, this game is awesome, but everyone should know before purchase that this IS AN ACTIVE GAME. You will be moving your arms around A LOT! Especially as you progress into the higher difficulties. If you are into your music like I am,  you will probably even find yourself stepping or jumping in time with the music also. You can easily wear yourself out by getting lost in the music.

Normal just seems to have fewer orbs, which can kind of kill the mood for a song you really like when you aren't getting to hit on all the beats. The Harder difficulty, though it is much fuller, also throws in a lot of orb setups that require you to cross your arms. The jump in coordination required is huge.\n\nI would like it if they could add more arena environments to play in, more shield shapes, and maybe a customization menu that allows you to set the color scheme of the orbs and shields.\n\nI'd also like options that give you a more granular control over the gameplay, such as how often you're required to cross your arms, how wide the spread of orbs is, and maybe even an option to turn on a 360 degree approach of the orbs.\n\nAll criticisms aside, the feeling of playing this game is incredible. It sounds childish, but it just make you feel really cool. It feels like doing fight choreography set to music. It's just absolutely fantastic.\n\nIt's also very physical.

My computer is on the lower end of what's acceptable for VR (i5-2500k @ 4.4GHz and GTX 970) and I don't really have any performance issues.\n- It can be a good workout.  Playing a fast song on the hardest difficulty and going out of your way to 'punch' the orbs instead of just blocking them can work up a sweat.\n- I was incredibly impressed when I tried to load a song that hadn't been previously played.  It played through the song once and then the level was ready to go.  Their algorithm for generating 'levels' is quite good.\n\nCons:\n- Arenas are uninspired.  They're nothing special to look at and you don't usually notice them anyway.\n- YouTube video playing in background is 100% unnecessary.  You never pay attention to the video, so in my case I'd rather have it not there taking up resources.\n- General VR con... your neck can get sore if you play for an extended period of time.

It is from the developers of Audiosurf, and it shows. You can choose any song you have access to locally, from soundcloud, or from Youtube. It also appears that your \"friends favorites\" are from your Youtube friends, not people that have specifically purchased the game. \n\nThe game itself is a simple premise. You choose a song, ball-things appear and you hit them with the correct color shield, blue on the left hand and ORANGE on the right (the game says red, but I see orange dammit). The ball-things have been on beat to the music on the songs I've played so far (from Youtube). There appears to be five levels of difficulty, but two (casual and legacy hard) are separated from the other three. I'm not sure what all changes with the different difficulties, but so far all of them have been a blast. There are also three different shield shapes, with one even being more a backhand shield (I kept having to force myself to hold the controller correctly, instead of cheating).\n\nWhat I wasn't expecting though, was the scoring. There's a \"technical\" and \"artistic\" score. The artistic score seems to entail \"how into the music you are.\" In other words, the more you bob, the stronger your punches (yes this measures punch strength when popping the ball-things), the higher the artisc score.

Im a big fan of DDR, Guitaro Hero, Stepmania, Cytus, Dance Central, Fantasia, and other such music games that bring my enjoyment of the songs to a new level. These kinds of games make the music feel more alive, it makes you feel part of it. So when I first heard of audioshield I knew right away I would be buying it, and It could potentially go beyond and be better than any music game ever. \n\nSad to say, all of the games I mentioned are far better than audioshield. And what do they have that audioshield doesnt? On point beats/rythm. I am not a expert musician or game designer, but you dont have to be in order to realize that the red/blue/purple beats coming at your face is not at all lined up with the songs (at least the majority of the time).\n\nWhen you play other rythm games it makes you kinda dance or put your energy into the beats, it almost energizes you. A good song makes the game funner, and a good stage/level makes the song better. With audioshield though, it makes both feel worse. As I was playing the game I tried to make the color blasts match, I would try punching the blasts with my shield but that doesnt match, and many colors are long rifts which also doesnt match like it should. Then I try just blocking the blasts, which probably is the easiest way to go if you want to be accurate with the game, but this way is even less fun/engaging and it completely changes the game from a music beat type of game, to some bland, bargain bin, color matching game, the music just becomes backround noise if you play it this way.\n\nLong story short, I decided after about 10 different songs that this game sucks, its in a way broken, because it doesnt do what it sets out to do. It shouldnt be called audio shield, it should just be called Music Visualizer VR. And one other thing I must mention. If this game was 5 dollars I would still want my refund, because it is not fun or worth the money. But this game is 20 dollars?! WHY?!\n\nThis is an example of a good idea that was POORLY executed. Hopefully another dev will take this idea and expand upon it in a way that is more accurate to the beat, and better bang for its buck, because this is nothing but a glorified music player visualizer.", "timestamp_created": 1485870826, "timestamp_updated": 1485871020, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498498", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29603679": {"recommendationid": "29603679", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966991994", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1060, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515950677}, "language": "dutch", "review": "Great game for the Vive", "timestamp_created": 1485863187, "timestamp_updated": 1485863187, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29594278": {"recommendationid": "29594278", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072184655", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10761, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 232, "last_played": 1521628603}, "language": "english", "review": "I've had my vive about a month now and thought I would be mainly interested in the slasher/fighting type games.

Half the time I feel like the game has just synced to random noises in the song and are not to the beat at all.  The moves feel un-natural, not to the time of the music.  Because of it, it is very difficult to keep up with the moves because they don't match the natural time of the music.  It feels this way for most songs, I've only found a handful that are perfectly timed, poppy and fun.\n\nIt's very interruptive as well having to wait to start or wait to end, pick a new song takes time and a lot of songs the timing is lagged.  It looks like the song synced well but the beats stutter...  Freeze up and then suddenly come flying at you.

The main issue I mentioned below (bad tracking causing missed notes) is infuriating at upper levels of this game. I've played Sound Boxing quite a bit now as well and it doesn't suffer from this problem, which leads me to believe it's not a problem with the Vive hardware.\n\nFirst off, the scoring system is horrible. The game scores you based on accuracy and 'style', both on a 0-10 scale. Accuracy is the main attribute that will determine where you rank on a leaderboard, and if you're tied for accuracy then it will come down to how the game judges your 'style'. Trying to get/maintain a high score is a very frustrating process when the game fails to track the controllers and it mostly turns into a matter of luck.\n\nSecond, the 'style' is not actually a 0-10 scale as the game would lead you to believe. It's possible to get above a 10, although you have no way to actually tell what the true value is. Trying to beat a high score that is some unknown amount higher than yours is a frustrating process.\n\nI really like the concept behind this game, and love the ability to generate a level based on any song you choose (unlike Sound Boxing, which people have to create levels on). I still get one hell of a workout when I get into it, but trying to get a high score isn't fun.\n\nOld review:\n\nAudioshield is hands-down my favorite game (so far) on the Vive. I was always a sucker for rhythm games and this is tickling that itch while also being a productive workout tool. I actually bought a Fitbit to track heartrate because I was curious how well this was working, and this easily gets me above 100 BPM and up to 150 on some songs (e.g. metal).\n\nI have two complaints with the game, though it's nothing I can't work around:\n\n-If you're punching notes too fast, it's possible to miss. I imagine this is due to controller tracking, but it can be annoying if you care about getting that 100%\n-The game does not handle long tracks very well. By long, I'm talking about one hour or more. Since I'm using this as a workout tool, this is not a crazy scenario for me and I've had to resort to using YouTube videos because local files will just never finish processing. Even YouTube tracks of this length take like 15-20 minutes to load, albeit only the first time. I love using this to workout, but having to change tracks constantly definitely takes away from the experience.\n\nAll-in-all, great game and one of the big ones I show people when I'm trying to get them interested in the Vive.", "timestamp_created": 1483725113, "timestamp_updated": 1495639234, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29063495": {"recommendationid": "29063495", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984291881", "num_games_owned": 1253, "num_reviews": 79, "playtime_forever": 1032, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512913113}, "language": "english", "review": "[u]At this time the Youtube support is broken with no dev response in sight, so that blows.

Some people say this game is too easy, but there are multiple difficulty settings that will definitely keep you busy and challenged for a while. I had a few friends over, and after playing a few different VR titles I've got, this is the one that we had the most fun with as a group.

Waves of orbs fly toward you in time with the beat and you block them with the glowing shields that cover your hands. It adds a sense of urgency to the music while being relaxing at the same time. When things go right and you hit a several orbs perfectly, there is a definite connection with the music and that spark will put a smile on your face. At the end of the song, a global ranking pops up.

In my opinion, it's worth a buy both as a fun diversion (who doesn't love punching music in the face?) and an actual fitness tool.\n\nFirst, the biggest complaint I see people making when they first try the game (and a claim often made in refunds) is that the rhythm at which the blue and orange balls come in doesn't match the song. That's actually true only if you try to \"catch\" the balls - which is not how you're supposed to play. You don't catch the notes in Audioshield - you punch them!\n\nAlthough it's not obvious, the beat track is generated such that it expects you to be punching the note with an extended arm from a standing position, not \"catching it\" a second later. That's why the beat track may seem off if you try to intercept the notes at your chest, rather than punching the note while it approaches. Once you figure *that* out, and you start to time your left/right punches with the beat, all of the sudden the game stops being a diversion and becomes an actual zenlike trance. Your punches match the beat and you start having a really good time.\n\nObviously, as with other rhythm games, the difficulty level you choose will affect how many beats get thrown at you at once. If you start out on the lowest difficulty, this also lends to the feeling that the beat tracks aren't completely synced, as it purposely drops notes so as not to overwhelm you. Once you're ready to tackle Elite difficulty (which I believe is the most fun) you're getting tracks that match your chosen song beat for beat, and give you a good workout besides.\n\nAs far as fitness goes, what makes Audioshield so good is that, once you start punching all the beats as they fly toward you, you start burning calories like nobody's business. Granted, a Fitbit is not a precise tool, but there's been times when I've burned 600 calories in maybe 50 minutes of play. Obviously, YMMV depending on whether you're punching fast or slow songs, and your difficulty level, but the biggest benefit of Audioshield is it keeps me entertained while I work out.\n\nI've tried exercise bikes, treadmills, and other devices for cardio while watching TV, and I get bored quickly. But I can easily punch music in Audioshield for an hour and the time flies by. Honestly, sometimes I have to make myself stop.\n\nAs far as music, anything works, whether local files or right off Youtube. I have a ton of MP3s and prefer those, but I do stream songs off Youtube on occasion without issue. Finally, while Elite difficulty will make any song at least a bit challenging, there are certainly songs that are more fun than others (seriously, play just about anything by Blue Man Group and you'll have a good time). Anything with a strong beat is ideal, as the beat track comes off drums/percussion.\n\nIn summary, I highly recommend this game for people who enjoy listening to music, rhythm games, punching music, or who just want a fun way to burn some calories while punching along to their favorite songs.\n\nRemember!

There are no hand made tracks, menus are as minimal as possible (looking for a specific track is hell, expecially on YouTube), there's a lack of costumization in the challenge and a lack of different \"hazards\" (boosting the difficulty just adds more spheres overall, there are no added challenges like spheres to avoid or to never touch);\n- Hard mode is cheap: most of the times I miss spheres just because they appear out of sight.\n- This is the most common complaint: the spheres basically NEVER follow the rhythm.

The gameplay is simple, and does not require a lot of experience, but you need to have good hand-eye coordination to master this game. The gameplay itself does not use any buttons on the controller. Anyone can pick it up and have a great time, as long as you have songs that you want to play. For this exact reason, it is one of the games I use to demo VR to people with no VR experience.\n\n[h1]Play your own music files (MP3, FLAC, ACC, WMA) and YouTube[/h1]\nBack when it was first released, Audioshield can play local files + SoundCloud streaming. Later SoundCloud was replaced with YouTube. The entire YouTube library! The built in search function can help you find the song you want to play on YouTube. \nHowever, there are some minor issues I had with search. When you click on any of the suggested words on the VR keyboard, it simply puts a newline character in the textbox. Also the keywords are pretty strict. It does not allow typos.\nBut in the end, YouTube streaming works fine. Music beats are perfectly in sync with the YouTube stream.\n\n[h1]BASS generated \"music beats\"[/h1]\nThe game uses the BASS Audio Library to analyze the audio track and generate the beats you have to block with your shields. It is very similar to [i]AudioSurf[/i]. It works wonderfully in most songs, but computers do not fully understand music now, do they? In certain sections of some songs the beats are way off. But it is tolerable, given that this game targets a casual audience, not professional music producers. \n\n[h1]tl;dr[/h1]\nPros\n[olist]\n  [*]Best rhythm game for Vive\n  [*]Play local music files or stream from YouTube\n  [*]Great replayability as long as you have songs to play\n  [*]Beat generation is acceptable in most songs\n  [*]Casual fun, good for a quick workout\n[/olist]\n\nCons\n[olist]\n  [*]SoundCloud streaming was removed in an update\n  [*]Block generation is not good in certain songs\n  [*]Search function works, but can be improved\n[/olist]", "timestamp_created": 1481381498, "timestamp_updated": 1483485425, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540858", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28286141": {"recommendationid": "28286141", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009982179", "num_games_owned": 401, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 53, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515660521}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is essentially a souped-up 'Guitar Hero' on crack.

I played 10+ year on drums, and a little on guitar. I got 200+ hour in guitar hero 3, and i listen a lot of music every day. So this was my #1 VR game on my whislist.\n\nAnd its a reall good concept, but sadly the game itself is pretty .. \"meh\". The idea is 10/10, the graph and other stuffs are a solid  8/10, but the algorithm for the youtube songs is preatty bad, like 3/10 bad (there is some song that actually not bad, but most of the time its just nonsens randomness. By the way i mostly use it for rock/metal so its maybe better on pop/electro). I have programming experience, so I know its hard to write a good algorithm that you can use on every youtube vid, but still it could be a LOT better than this.\n\nWell thats my big concerne, but there are a lot of small things that could be better:\n\n-The shileds hitbox is not 100%. I have an older PC so i only have 45 fps at best so maybe thats the reason, but sometimes the sound blobs just pass through my shield. (like 1% of the time)\n\n-The blobs come way to high. I noticed that the higher the sound the higher the blubs, but it just constant high. It need to start lower, and incrase less for the sound. I cant do more than 1-2 song at the time because my neck start to hurt. Its like watching an IMAX movie from the first line.\n\n-If you start the youtube video instantly after loading in to the \"chamber\" the first 1-2 sec is totally fucked up. So you need to wait like 10 sec every time after loading before you actually can start.\n\n-custom shields and maps would be nice.\n\n-A little less cross boxing would be nice. I play on hard and expert (or whatever its called) and there is a lot of time when you have to box x-cross with your hands. Its not really a good way to incrase difficulty. Give us more and faster blobs, but not this crossboxing thing.\n\n\nI hope they gonna do something with the algorithm. If they do i would never stopp playing it.\n\n(PS: Sory for my grammar.

Scrolling files by pointing Up/down is SUPER inconvenient (there's a \"touch pad scroll wheel\" approach whcih is widely used in VR video players and Steam dashboard itself). It's impossible to add songs/videos to favorites (or at least I didn't found any obvious way).\n- only one game mode. It's fun and all, but sometimes you want some diversity, modificators, etc, to spice up your gameplay\n- only three background environments. They don't mean anything for gameplay, but seing the same background over and over and over again is not fun. And they don't pulse/react to music in any manner.\n- score and all stats can only be seen after the game in a very primitive manner (it looks like a dump of some console command printed on virtual screen)\n- no visible statistics about how you improved the song, where you missed,  grades (YAY, I EARNED S+!) etc.\n\nStill, it's a must have game for Vive owners, I just hope that the author will continue to EVOLVE it.", "timestamp_created": 1480596962, "timestamp_updated": 1480596962, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28112636": {"recommendationid": "28112636", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993457891", "num_games_owned": 496, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 289, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482003558}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm thoroughly enjoying this game.

That's pretty dang important for a game.\n-Lets you listen to any song you want!\n-Works well, didn't encounter too many bugs, if any.\n-A nice physical activity game that doesn't involve TOO much physical activity. You keep active, but it's not as exhausting as something like Dance Dance Revolution (unless of course you play the hard modes in which case you're a maniac). I like to start my day with it from time to time to wake me up and get the blood flowing.\n-Good game that you can just hop into, play for a few minutes, then hop out if you want. Which also makes it good for showing it to friends.\n\nCONS:\n-I'm not sure why but the sprites in this game (The orbs, if you will) are blurry.\n-If you play a song from the internet who's file you don't already have on your computer, and nobody's ever played it before, the game will take a while (as long as the duration of the song, to be percise) to \"Create\" the level for it.\n-The computer generated levels are usually pretty good, but they are random and are based on the computer's understanding of what the song is like. This leaves me sorely wanting a level editor, so that people can make levels based on actual choreography or the flow of the song, rather than just procedurally generated beats and long notes.\nPlus it would help minimize the time when notes sneak on you by hiding behidn other notes, or by showing up on the opposite edge of the play area than where you're facing.\n-No ability to see how well you did previous times on a level.\n-It seems fairly easy to get a score above 9 on normal mode, regardless of how good you are. The actual difference is usually in the numbers after the decimal point.\n-I wanted to record this game for a Youtube video but the desktop display of it is portrait oriented, rather than landscape for some reason. Not easy to record.\n\nFinal verdict: Fun. Simple.

Audioshield is no exception.\n\nThough most will have you believe that the Youtube update killed the game, that's not the case. Though admittedly it did negatively impact it, as I've not even been able to get that part of the game to work, and I definitely miss the days when I could just play something from Soundcloud, it made it a ton easier for those of us in the underground EDM scene, where tracks we like aren't always on Youtube.\n\nHowever, the game still gives you just as much freedom with the ability to load in your own files. If you're a fan of Audiosurf 1 or 2, you'll be familiar with this system, as the interface is identical to Audiosurf 2 (same dev). I'm not sure how much the the algorithm has changed, but I can say it feel very fluid and accurate. Though some songs with a lot of complicated rhythms can be a bit difficult to play, it's still very fun. Me and my family have spent countless hours playing this, laughing at each other's and our own mistakes in the game and trying to beat each other's scores. The game also offers to change who is playing on the PC side, allowing for guests to keep separate scores than the owner of the account. It's very active, and even encourages players to be more so with the \"Physical Activity\" score.\n\nConclusion:\nIf you're looking for a good rhythm game for the Vive, this is about the best there could be (excluding the bad Youtube implementation and removal of Soundcloud).

I was laughing like a little kid on Christmas while playing the enjoyment was so great. I am also very impressed with how professional the menu system is and all the options available. This is my new favorite game and one i know ill return to many many times. I really want the devs to know how much i appreciate all the hard work and love you guys put into this game. It really shows.

You can try new songs over and over by picking from your audio/video collection on your hard drives, or you can even search for a YouTube video and play it. Every time you play the same song, the same orbs will come in the exact same pattern, so you can play songs until you master them, or just pick new songs every time. \n\nThe competitive online aspect of this game is also very high, as any popular song has a leaderboard. The leaderboard is different whether it comes from your hard drive or from YouTube, but there is a leaderboard to compete against on any popular song either way. I even found that some of my favorite songs by relatively unpopular artists (by bands like Opeth, or Infected Mushroom) had one or two people to compete agains on the leaderboards.\n\nOut of all the games I've played for VR since I got my Vive a couple of weeks ago, this one seems to give you the most exercise WITHOUT the chance of hitting objects in your real life space, or tangling/unplugging a cord in the process.\n\nI was skeptical of this game before I purchased it that the orbs wouldn't be in sync enough with the music to enjoy it. I was very wrong. They obviously have a pretty advanced algorithm for making the gameplay match certain notes in the song. The harder the difficulty you choose, the more the orbs go to the song. Of course on easy mode its hard to see how the notes are going to the song, but thats beacause easy mode is there to teach you, not to make you feel like you're part of the song.\n\nAnd the best part about this game is, even when you master a song, and can hit 100% of the notes, you get an 'Artistic' score. I have found that this is based on how you are moving in correlation to the rhythm of the song. When I am jumping around and dancing to the song while blocking the orbs, I get a much higher artistic score than if I were just standing there carefully blocking the orbs as they come.\n\n\nCONS:\n\nThe feeling of personal achievement and progression is very limited with this game. You can compare yourself to other players that just so happened to play the same song from the same source (HDD mp3 ID tag/YouTube), but it ends there. There is no 'campaign' type system in place that you have to beat in order to progress.\n\nThere are no tiers to see how well you scored (like all the good rythym games have in place). A star system (1-5) stars would make this game more endearing, but unfortunately it just has a score for your % of notes hit, and a modifier for Artistic value (If i hit 100% of the notes I get a 10.0, and can only surpass other 10s on the leaderboard by having a higher artistic value)\n\nThere seems to be a bug with some songs that make it almost impossible to hit all the notes at the start because of a bpm change that somehow basically superspeed rush a bunch of notes at you so fast that its impossible to block them. It seems like a bug and I'm sure it will be fixed eventually. \n\n\n----------\n\nWhat I think should be added to this game: \n\n* A campaign mode that the devs made with songs they chose, where you can actually fail a song if you miss too many notes too fast (like GH/RB), and cant continue to the next few songs until you pass 2/3 or 3/4 of the songs in that tier. \n\n* A campaign builder mode where you can make your own setlist (with only YouTube songs, to make it easier to program) and upload it that follows the same rules as the devs campaign; you have to beat the songs in order and not fail, in order to unlock the next songs in the setlist. \n\n* A list of recently played songs (24 hours?) by every Audioshield user. This would encourage people to try out and be expsed to new songs that people have already played, so they're guaranteed to have at least one person to compete against.\n\n* A star power type system that you can get by hitting difficult note streaks that either makes your shields bigger or makes both shields able to block either color note for a short period of time. \n\n* User imported arenas/Arena Builder mode\n\nAnyways, this game is the epitome of fun, and it really allows you to thoroughly enjoy all your favorite music on a whole new level.", "timestamp_created": 1476818047, "timestamp_updated": 1477137621, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26101519": {"recommendationid": "26101519", "author": {"steamid": "76561198310745681", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 438, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513472166}, "language": "japanese", "review": "MOD\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3067\u96e3\u6613\u5ea6\u306e\u8abf\u6574\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u306e\u3067\u3001\u540c\u3058\u66f2\u3067\u3082\u98fd\u304d\u306a\u3044\u3002\n\u6d0b\u697d\u3001\u90a6\u697d\u3068\u308f\u305a\u81ea\u5206\u306e\u6301\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u597d\u304d\u306a\u66f2\u3067\u3067\u304d\u308b\u306e\u304c\u826f\u3044\u306d\u3002\n\u30b5\u30d3\u306e\u3068\u3053\u308d\u3067\u8b5c\u9762\u304c\u30ba\u30ec\u308b\u5834\u5408\u3082\u3042\u308b\u3051\u3069\u3001\u96e3\u6613\u5ea6\u3092\u6319\u3052\u3066\u308b\u3068\u6c17\u306b\u3057\u3066\u3044\u3089\u308c\u306a\u3044\u3002\n\u904b\u52d5\u306b\u3082\u306a\u308b\u3057\u3001\u6b4c\u3044\u306a\u304c\u3089\u3084\u3063\u3066\u308b\u3068\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30b9\u89e3\u6d88\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1476800521, "timestamp_updated": 1476800521, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500624", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26095819": {"recommendationid": "26095819", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026088169", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 805, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516586740}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing update!

Most importantly you have removed Sound Cloud support, which was one of the most compelling aspects of your game. Being able to search for new and unique songs was half the fun. Now we are stuck with a distracting and annoying YouTube video shoved into our faces, while we attempt play the game. The game for me was never about watching a video. It was about the music and the gameplay.  Also I am dissatisfied the trajectory of the orbs on the new epic setting. Maybe I could get used to that, but the orbs terminate at a far too low height for it to be enjoyable. \n\n     The difficulty setting on epic is still not as difficult as I would like to see. Push the bounds and actually test people. That is why I will only play your game with a custom mod for an increased challenge. If its too slow it becomes boring and I lose interest quickly. People should not have to mod the game to be challenged. Your diehard fans want a game that is truly difficult. Not a game where grandma can come over and lazily punch at orbs. Sound Cloud should be reintroduced or at least an option to remove the awful YouTube video from the screen. That is why for now I will only play your game with my own music and a custom mod.

Enter something in wrong? have to fix a one letter typo? The game wipes the text every time you click the search bar, meaning you have to type it all back in again. This gets very frustrating for navigating to songs with a decent length title.\n\nThis leads me to my next point, you can't favorite songs, or create any kind of playlists. If you like a particular song, and it isn't a popular song, you have to type it in every time. The other option is download the song, and keep it in one of the specific locations the game looks at. I keep all my music organized in very specific folders. To get there, I have to navigate from the drives through all the folders in between to finally get to music. It is also very easy to misclick in this menu, and then it is easy to misclick the \"go back to main\" and \"go back one folder\". Which means you will sometimes have to start over clicking through things to get to downloaded music. Overall frustrating experience if you want specific songs that aren't popular.\n\nThe menus are inconsistent. The difficulty screen sorts by recently used. So you might see Hard, Easy, Medium or various other combinations. By default, these difficulties also show different texts for each difficulty in large text and in small text. HARDER-hard, HARD-normal, NORMAL-easy. This would be confusing by itself, but combined with the difficulties shuffling based on which you used last, it is puzzling (especially to people I try to show the game off to who haven't played it yet).\n\nLuckily (and this is a HUGE plus for the game imo), the difficulties are mod-able. After getting used to the hardest difficulty, I started tweaking the game files slowly. Eventually I downloaded pre-made mods online. This also helps with the confusion above. You can edit what the menu items say and differentiate them more. Using the Expert mod turned this into my favorite vive game by far.\n\nDespite the pollish issues, the gameplay is GREAT fun. especially with mods.

Very Tron-esque.\n[*]I didn't have any problems with stability, kept a buttery smooth 90fps during gameplay. I did get some dropped frames when I started tweaking supersampling, but that isn't a fault of the game.\n[*]It's a damn good workout.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Neutral:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]In the grey area between a roomscale and standing experience. Not knocking the game at all here, works fine as is.\n[*]Beats are generated based on an algorithm, the game scans the audio file and generates orbs accordingly. While ususally this works pretty well, there is some definite room for improvement. Understandably a lot of songs don't match up well on base difficulty. Faster paced songs having orbs matched to every beat could easily overwhelm new players on lower difficulty. That being said, some songs even on harder difficulty don't match up like you would hope. The option to play hand keyed music would be great.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Huge lack of quality songs from the default online resource (Soundcloud). You will run into a lot of bad remixes of songs you actual want to play. If you have a well stocked Google Play Music account I would highly recommend [url=https://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/comments/4tbso3/use_audioshield_with_google_play_music_v30/] the Audioshield-PlayMusic mod. [/url] It's a proxy server mod that replaces Soundcloud support with Play Music support. This game would really flourish with support for Spotify, and Play Music out of the box.\n[*]Song selection interface is poop.\n[*]No way to see song length from menu. Would be very nice to know before you start an epic 10 minute+ song. This can be very exhausting on hard/harder difficulties.\n[*]No Workshop support. Game only has 2 stages, and they get very old. Also handkeyed music would be a godsend, as mentioned in the neutral section.\n[*]Searching for songs in-game is a chore, though this is more the fault of the steam virtual keyboard than the game itself. You're going to want to lauch the game and make a playlist at your computer, As opposed to searching for music a song at a time in-game.\n[*]This seems to have gotten better with recent patches, but long songs can take a significant time to load.\n[/list]\n\nRig: Intel Core i7-5930K, 32GB DDR4 2800, (x2) EVGA GTX 980 SC (One card dedicated to PhysX), 500GB Samsung 840 Evo SSD, Win 10.", "timestamp_created": 1470851934, "timestamp_updated": 1470859873, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24803965": {"recommendationid": "24803965", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024003468", "num_games_owned": 505, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 62, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473982635}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is good.

In comparison, the content of this VR experience is light for $20.  The price is acceptable ONLY because the VR game  market is so thin, and filled with so many pitfalls, that this game stands out as somewhat quality in comparison.  That's not really a vote in the plus column for this game as it is a sigh of disappoint for the current state of VR as of writing this review, but there it is...\n\nIn my opinion, Audioshield is more striking just above what I'd consier a minimum bar of quality.  A more fair price point for this game, based on it's mechanics and level of depth, would be about $5.  If this game wasn't VR, and was a trypical \"flat\" game, you'd probably be some free bowser based game with a lot more depth.  Just looking at the game from a mechanic standpoint, you will find it has trouble syncing with a lot of songs, and it's missing some cool obvious features such as letting users create their own modified song syncs to share with friends, etc. \n\nThe graphics are \"ok\", not great, definatley not polished like The Lab.  There are only two scenes to listen / interact music with, when there could easily be more.  There's no kind of actual progression, no co-op, it's really just a bare bones experince.  In my time with the game, it also crahed often, sometimes forcing me to restart SteamVR.  \n\nStill, given the rough state of many VR titles, I'm going to thumb this game up.  With all the negatives above, it is still immersive and fun.  When you load up one your personal favorite music scores, and you get into that virutal world that doens't seem at all that interesting in flat videos on the store poge, you'll find a TOTALLY different world and expereince in VR.  Then kicks in the highs and lows of yoru favorite song, and honestly, you could be in for a surprisingly  emotional experience.  It's prtobably just the music of your favorite track thundering in the background  ...but either way, it's about that time you might think this game was maybe actually worth the $20.  \n\nIt's also worth mentionging this is the kind of game tha draws in non-gamers, such as your mother in-law, etc.  Just load up their favroite song, and watch them be wow'd to the immersion of VR.  The clear excersize / activity you have to extert playing the game is also a fairly good ground for buying it, just for health.  For these reasons, this game really is a worthwhile purchase even at $20.

From what I have read and experienced by playing, the punching of beats is generated randomly. \n\nThis makes for an often very bizzarre experience, that does not line up with the music very well.  \n\nI wish the developers of Audioshield would add a method for the community to custom make punches (Like the Bethesda community), or have the developers create a library of curated songs, the game is just not worth spending time with. \n\nTo recap:\n\nThe pros:\nGreat concept (if it worked)\nAwesome visual effects\nCool left and right shields, feel great and look awesome\n\nThe cons:\n-Most or all of the music is OUT OFSYNC with the beat puching\n-Punching is generated randomly\n-There is not currently a way for the community to create custom beat puches and movements\n\nI would be one of the first people creating beats for the game, I'm sure the game would get much more popularity if the community could have a creative avenue with content generation for the game. \n\nUntil these issues are addressed, I suggest to save your money and wait for the updates.", "timestamp_created": 1469578229, "timestamp_updated": 1469578229, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.588465", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24543560": {"recommendationid": "24543560", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036599304", "num_games_owned": 487, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 9785, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 180, "last_played": 1520729423}, "language": "english", "review": "Best reason to exercise in the morning EVER!

Songs with hard hitting notes that are defined, with percussion that is clear works the best. Music that has a lot of background noise (i.e. Classic Rock) doesn't work as well, and the notes will seem more random. The algorythm could be better in that sense. However, when the system works, with the whole song having the orbs on point, it is very, very fun.\n\nCons:\n-Soundcloud support removed (Although this isnt really the devs fault, as Soundcloud themselves no longer supported the feature that was required for it to work)\n\n\nOverall I find the game very enjoyable, and I can forgive that the orbs aren't always 100% accurate to the notes, but it is good enough for me.

So when I tried it that first time I could pick from a selection of songs that other Audioshield users had \"battled\" their way through, when I came back I couldn't get to that menu and basically had to select songs from my computer's hard drive instead. Of course, since these aren't known to Audioshield, you can never compare your performance against anyone else. (So all the leaderboards stay completely blank.)\n\nIf one of the devs reads this and can suggest what might have gone wrong and how I can get back the global menu / leaderboard, I'd really appreciate it. (Not that I think I'm any good at Audioshield, but it would be fun to see how my performances compare with others around the world...)\n\nAll in all, this is the first game for the Vive that I could see myself playing on a daily basis to get some much needed exercise whilst revisiting my music collection... the latter having not received proper attention in many years due to the advent of podcasts! ;-)", "timestamp_created": 1468624968, "timestamp_updated": 1468624968, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502035", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24337298": {"recommendationid": "24337298", "author": {"steamid": "76561198283164371", "num_games_owned": 344, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 80, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504371120}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u542c\u7740\u81ea\u5df1\u559c\u6b22\u7684\u97f3\u4e50\uff0c\u539f\u672c\u5c31\u662f\u52a0\u5206\u9879\uff0c\u518d\u52a0\u4e0a\u5168\u8eab\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u542c\u6b4c\u3002\u3002\u3002\u597d\u8d5e", "timestamp_created": 1468601937, "timestamp_updated": 1468601937, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24333953": {"recommendationid": "24333953", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991112580", "num_games_owned": 367, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1151, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512875261}, "language": "english", "review": "There's a lot more that can be done with this game, but there hasn't been an update for months. \n\nAlgorithmic beatmatching is wonky, and the UI is barebones and awfully glitchy. \nThere aren't any additional stages aside from the two that are included, and the lack of workshop support is a missed opportunity.\n\nParticle effects are nice, and it runs pretty well, but I can't recommend this seeing as the dev just split without supporting his game.", "timestamp_created": 1468589257, "timestamp_updated": 1468589257, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528174", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24333489": {"recommendationid": "24333489", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016763999", "num_games_owned": 221, "num_reviews": 88, "playtime_forever": 313, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519270017}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5f88\u8010\u73a9\u7684\u97f3\u4e50\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u953b\u70bc\u8eab\u4f53\u795e\u5668\uff0c\u5de6\u53f3\u624b\u63a7\u5236\u4e24\u4e2a\u989c\u8272\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u97f3\u4e50\u8282\u594f\u63a5\u7403\u5c31\u53ef\u4ee5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u97f3\u4e50\u672c\u5730\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u65e0\u635f\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u4eba\u770b\u89c6\u9891\u89c9\u5f97\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u64cd\u4f5c\u8d77\u6765\u8fd8\u662f\u6709\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1468587273, "timestamp_updated": 1468587273, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505327", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24329567": {"recommendationid": "24329567", "author": {"steamid": "76561198309455037", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 7955, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498399418}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6839\u636e\u8282\u594f \u9ad8\u4f4e\u97f3 \u97f3\u7b26\u6765\u589e\u52a0 \u4e50\u611f\u5417\u3001\uff1f\u660e\u660e\u5c31\u662f   \u770b\u4eba\u53cd\u5e94\u901f\u5ea6\u7684", "timestamp_created": 1468568379, "timestamp_updated": 1468568379, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24329121": {"recommendationid": "24329121", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971358653", "num_games_owned": 385, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 429, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482770109}, "language": "english", "review": "I can see myself putting alot of time into this game.

M\u00eame les modes de difficult\u00e9s les plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s ne parviennent pas \u00e0 m'amuser. Ce n'est pas que le jeu soit particuli\u00e8rement facile, j'ai loup\u00e9 quelques boules (quoique pas sufissamment pour avoir commenc\u00e9 direct en difficult\u00e9 max), mais je ne ressent rien en jouant. Moi qui aime les jeux de jeux de rythme, je suis souvent emport\u00e9 par la musique, avec un vrai sentiment d'accomplissement quand je suis bien le rythme, mais l\u00e0 bah rien.\nLa faute surement \u00e0 deux ou trois choses :\n\nLe rythme n'est pas clair ou pas rescpect\u00e9, l'impact des boules sur le bouclier ne se fait pas toujours en rythme, mais avec les contr\u00f4leurs du vive, ce n'est peut-\u00eatre pas si \u00e9tonnant. Ce genre de jeu demandant un certain timing pr\u00e9cis, tout d\u00e9pends d\u00e8s lors de l'endroit o\u00f9 la boule s'\u00e9crase. Selon si on l'arr\u00eate \u00e0 bout de bras ou au plus pr\u00e8s du corps, le timing ne sera pas le m\u00eame. Le seul moyen d'avoir un rythme parfait serait de ne pas bouger et de garder les contr\u00f4leurs toujours \u00e0 la m\u00eame distance. Mais alors dans un cas, \u00e7a ferait tr\u00e8s mal aux bras rapidement, et dans l'autre ce serait tout simplement inint\u00e9ressant.\n\nLe second point, c'est que les vibrations des controlleurs ne sont pas assez puissantes. Ce n'est pas la faute du jeu j'imagine, mais j'aimerais sentir d'avantage l'impact des boules sur les boucliers.\n\nEt le troisi\u00e8me, c'est que la musique n'a pas de \"sur ou sous notes\". J'entends par l\u00e0 que l'on entends pas les notes qui sont r\u00e9ussies, ce qui m'emp\u00eache de \"sentir\" la musique.\n\nAh puis une autre d\u00e9faut assez r\u00e9dhibitoire, c'est que les boules arrivent trop souvent en hauteur, ce qui fait que l'on passe le plus clair de son temps \u00e0 lever la t\u00eate, et le cou finit vite par en souffrir, notamment \u00e0 cause du poids du casque, qui, s'il n'est pas significatif en conditions d'utilisation normale, se fait sentir quand on doit lever les yeux au ciel en permanence. Ajoutez \u00e0 cela le poids d'un casque audio, \u00e7a devient vite d\u00e9sagr\u00e9able.\n\nBref, l'id\u00e9e de base du jeu est honorable, mais je pense honnet\u00eament que ce genre n'est pas adapt\u00e9 \u00e0 la VR, en tout cas pas de cette fa\u00e7on. A la limite si on jouait une batterie virtuelle fa\u00e7on Rock Band, \u00e7a marcherait, les caissons seraient fixes, donc pas de d\u00e9-syncrhonisation espace-rythme.\nSi vous cherchez un bon jeu de rythme, passez votre chemin et attendez un truc plus r\u00e9fl\u00e9chi.", "timestamp_created": 1467332748, "timestamp_updated": 1467332748, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.573317", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23966892": {"recommendationid": "23966892", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060215020", "num_games_owned": 258, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466728804}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a really great idea and I wish I could recommend it but I just can't, mainly because I'm a rhythm game junkie.\n\nEven the songs that aren't from my library or not on the internet radio that they play off of, the notes just aren't in sync.

Videos of people playing don't do it justice.\n\nI completely recommend playing on the hardest setting and really getting into it!  It's a really fun game that requires your whole body, but doesn't take up a lot of space.  I'm pretty in shape and regularly work out, but that didn't stop me from breaking a sweat just two songs in!  I strongly recommend buying this game.  It's one of my favorites so far for my Vive.\n\nPros:\nGood aesthetics.  Not overly complicated, and it stays smooth on my reference R9 290.  Render distance has a bit to be desired, but it isn't bad.\nImmersive.  Play with the volume up, and you feel like you're there.\nGreat use of depth.  Never hurts your eyes to focus on something getting closer or further.\nThe orbs line up with the music!  I'm a drummer, so I was concerned about this before purchasing.  In fact, it lines up very well and catches subtle differences (it will have you hit on the E, And, and UH of a beat, if the songs has an accent there!)\nIt's a workout!  I'm sure this could be used as a workout tool for anybody struggling to get motivation to get to a gym.\nDecent UI and explorer interface.  Not too complicated.  I'd recommend moving it back a little bit from the user though.  It gets annoying to move my whole head just to see a different song.\n\nCons:\nUI is too close when selecting songs.\nMore of a question than a con, but if you're short, do you have to hold your hands up higher, or do the orbs fly to where the headset is located?  May be an issue for short people.\nCould be the vive, and probably is, but every once in a while I get tracking issues.\n\nIn conclusion, try this game out!

Having no sound other than the music makes me feel a bit disconnected from the visuals. (3) Playlists. The ability to select a playlist and go through it without interuption would be great. (4) Track play history in a way that makes it easy to determine visually if I've played a song before. Like a check mark or highlight for tracks I've already played through. (5) An option for turning off the ability to make the purple shield by putting the controllers close together.

I would describe it as a Guitar-hero-esque rhythm game in a catch the missle style.\n\n The game has many many reasons to be bought:\n\n-With a price of 19.99 Euros, it is one of the cheaper VR-titles\n-It runs fine, even on mediocre Pc\u00b4s\n-While playing, the risk of smashing something is rather small, as you do not have to move around a whole lot ( if you aren\u00b4t going batshit crazy when playing the game)\n-The ability to use your own music is a godsent, but even without a huge music collection, you are provided every day with a playlist of popular songs to play\n-The representation of your songs is very often on point, far better than I could ever have imagined! The game is not perfect, as only the most prominent notes are being picked up, even if it isn\u00b4t the melody or the bass-line, which is to be expected.\n-Leaderboards provide a welcome challenge, and the possibility to be notified by mail, when you have been beaten in a song is a funny addition too\n\nHowever, there are also a few ( nitpicky ) downsides which aren\u00b4t to be ignored:\n\n-For me, the sound output which I activated in the VR menu isn\u00b4t being respected, the sound then suddenly coming from my speakers when the game starts, even tho\u00b4 I put the output to the HDMI output. I solved the problem by mirroring the sound output to both my speakers and the HDMI.\n-The game is far too easy. Even when I pick the hardest difficulty, there have been no songs in which I had under 90% of correct notes\n- The music-selection menu gets a bit cluttered, the songs not being separated on pages but one ongoing cluster with all your songs\n\nFurthermore, I have to give the devs credit for fixing reoccuring problems very quickly.\nFor me, the game is a must buy for any VR- or Music-enthusiast.", "timestamp_created": 1466109414, "timestamp_updated": 1466109414, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551282", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23590941": {"recommendationid": "23590941", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995861028", "num_games_owned": 316, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 3416, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520138285}, "language": "english", "review": "Probably my favorite game on Vive so far (I'm maybe too easily entertained). The game is a lot of fun although there are a few things that frustrate me:\n * Impact detection - If you punch the orbs too hard or swing your hands at them, the crash detection misses them a lot of times. Makes it hard to encourage people to increase their artistic score if they are getting penalized for flailing their arms more.\n * Local songs - The game doesn't take advantage of your steam music collection, nor does it go out and pre-scan music collection folders for artists / song names / genre, etc. You are forced to navigate your folder hierarchy to find songs.\n * They don't show you how long your song is. You just have to play it through first. This led my wife to accidentally start 5-10 minutes into a 30 minute song! It also is frustrating when the song ends up being only 20-30 seconds.

But it's way too buggy to recommend right now.[/b][/h1]\n\nI want to like this game; I really do. In fact, when I can actually get to an arena and play a song, I enjoy it greatly. But...\n\n[h1]The bugs.[/h1]\nIt's really buggy. The thing I spend the most time doing is standing around in the featureless void waiting for a song to load, hoping it will work, and eventually taking off the headset to see the \"AudioShield not responding\" message on my monitor. And the waiting! Full disclosure; I have moved my VR computer into a room where I don't have wired network, and the wiki is weak. So it really shows up the programming and design flaws in the interface. Choosing any of my tracks off of my NAS via a network drive is interminable. It takes tens of seconds just to traverse each level of folder; when I settle on a band's folder it takes well over 60 seconds to load the thumbnails. During which time you're stuck in VR limbo -- a lobby would be nice, and maybe some progress indicators, so you can tell how long you're going to wait. When it finally does load some thumbnails, moving the headset produces an astonishing amount of jitter -- they should have used non-blocking code there. Then it usually crashes.\n\n[h1]The beatmapping.[/h1]\nAs others have noted, it doesn't really feel like you're \"playing along\" as you would in Rock Band. Their beat-mapping algorithm seems limited, and it would be really nice to see it improved. But to be honest I haven't gotten sick of that because I can't get to an arena very often (see crashing, above).\n\n[h1]Cannot recommend.[/h1]\nBasically, this is a great pre-release demo that should have been free and a teaser for the finished product, because they clearly haven't finished it yet. So I can't recommend it. But the few times you can get through to actually play a song, and the beats feel like they work? It's a lot of fun.

It's essentially uncharted Guitar Hero in VR. The ability to play music on Soundcloud is a great implementation as you're then able to play songs that you don't own as well as the ability to play your own music. Another nice addition is leaderboards for your own music. if the metadata of the file that you're playing matches other files that were played with the same metadata, you get your own leaderboard for that song, which is a nice touch. The game itself is very enjoyable and probably has the most replay value of any other game I own. You feel very powerful smashing the notes with your shield. It really shows off the power of VR. You're even awarded points for hitting the notes harder, so you're made to work for the highscore. This game is simple, yet a lot of fun. I would absolutely reccomend it for the price but beware - it is VERY buggy at the moment.

That said, it is my most-played VR title so far, and I find myself returning to it again and again for more physical fun.\n\nThe basic premise is that blue and orange orbs, synced* ([i]*to some extent -- see Bad-3 below[/i]) to any music you insert into the program, come flying towards you in the virtual world. You use your two Vive controllers to fend off these orbs; the controllers correspond to shields of the same color in your left and right hands, respectively. On some occasions, a purple 'composite' orb will appear, and you have to combine your two shields into one by putting them together physically or pulling both controllers' triggers.\n\nScores are awarded for number of notes hit (\"Technical\" score) and amount of physical activity done during the song (\"Artistic\" score). Global leaderboards are already filling up with people getting ~9.9X Technical scores (hit 99.X% of notes in the song), with Artistic score serving as the tiebreaker.\n\n[h1][b]The Good:[/b][/h1]\n[olist]\n[*]The fact that you can plug in virtually any song of any genre you want is spectacular. Like its cousins Audiosurfs 1 and 2 (made by the same developer, no less), Audioshield uses a beatmapping algorithm to make 'stages' based entirely on the tempo and sound of the song you choose. If you want an intense, high-speed experience, play a high-tempo EDM song; if you want to just chill out, put on some alt rock or country or something like that.\n[*]Limited Soundcloud integration means that you can often find music to play even if your own library is sparse. The system is currently somewhat broken, though, as only a small selection of songs from Soundcloud are available compared to if you searched for them through a browser.\n[*]There's a decent, if not terribly amazing, variety in the ways to play. Three different shield shapes means three different techniques to learn/use (or pick one that is your favorite and stick with it). Three different difficulty levels (Normal, Hard, and Harder in ascending order of difficulty) provide different levels of orb generation and complexity (amount of \"crossover\" notes requiring you to reach a blue orb on the right side of the play area, for example).\n[/olist]\n[h1][b]The Bad:[/b][/h1]\n[olist]\n[*]The UI is completely broken. There's no SteamVR integration, meaning that you can't pull up the keyboard in game like with other VR games; this means that to look up Soundcloud titles, or leave a message under your scoreboard entry (if any), you need to return to your computer's traditional keyboard. And then, even once you're at your computer, you have to deal with a finicky cursor that doesn't really seem to click on what it's actually pointed at.\n[*]Using songs from Soundcloud is easy enough, but the game has an odd tendency to crash every so often (every other song or so, and that's not even exaggeration) when doing so. I'm guessing this has something to do with downloading the track.\n[*]The algorithm for beatmapping is [i]slightly[/i] better than Audiosurf 2's, but in the end it is still an imperfect product. Unless you use songs with strong, definitive beats, it's hard to get a track where you feel like you're moving [i]with[/i] the song the whole time. And then, the only way to get this feeling is to play on the hardest difficulty setting (Harder).\n[*]The skill ceiling is easily reached, and while some users have created mods to make tracks even more aggressive, I would argue that they are an imperfect solution to what would be better solved with better beatmapping.\n[*]Crashes and instability in general. I don't think I've ever played a game that crashed so often for so long. It'll sometimes crash when restarting a song partway through; it'll sometimes crash when starting a song in the first place. It'll sometimes crash on startup. Of my ~20 hours of playtime as of this review (25 recorded, but I've left the program running while rendering videos), I would estimate about an hour of that total was spent having to go back to my computer and stop the Audioshield process and restart it. That may seem like a small amount of instability, but you can really feel it when you're trying to just play a song (or keep replaying a song for points) and the game spontaneously decides it has no interest in continuing to work anymore.\n[*]Score and points are relatively meaningless. There's no point-tracking in-song, there's no 'perfect hits' where you hit notes JUST when they should be hit, etc., any of the things usually associated with rhythm/music games. Leaderboard battles mainly end up as struggles to edge out people by .1% of a technical score, and if a song's top players are all 10.0s, you have to struggle to get a higher artistic score.\n[*]Also, artistic score is a very vague and poorly-defined/tracked metric. Apparently it can be gamed by waving the remotes around very aggressively whenever you get a 'break' in the song, or at the end of the song.\n[/olist]\n\nYet despite all that... it's a lot of fun. There's a visceral joy in combining grooving to music with a game-type scoring system (even one as barebones as this). It's also an unquestionably physical experience, especially when you use high-powered music that requires a lot of movement (see my YouTube video at the end of this for an idea of what I mean by mentioning the physicality). Despite its flaws, if you enjoy music, or enjoy rhythm games with lots of movement (Just Dance in the modern age, DDR and its ilk a decade ago), this is a perfect fit for your $800 toy.\n\n[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGTMqrfWE0Y][h1]Here is the video I mentioned.[/h1][/url]", "timestamp_created": 1463468657, "timestamp_updated": 1463777019, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.697991", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23032745": {"recommendationid": "23032745", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066194901", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 8517, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 14, "last_played": 1521050237}, "language": "french", "review": "C'est un concept de jeu basic.

I would buy a Vive for this game alone.\n\nThis game absolutely nails the old principle of easy to learn, hard to master. The concept is simple: block the dots with your shields. I found it to be kind of fun and pretty easy on Normal difficulty. Once you increase it to Harder the game really shines. The dots match closer to the music and you have to move quickly. It's great exercise. Not the kind that will make you breathe heavy if you're in shape, the kind where your muscles are sore the day after playing for a few hours. Every genre of music is different so try out different things.\n\nIt's not perfect. As I said, it's pretty easy on Normal and not as immersive because the dots don't match the beat well. Some genres of music are less fun. If all you like is slow, boring music this isn't for you. If music doesn't make you want to move this probably won't be very fun. If you're significantly out of shape and overweight you may find it challenging but it could be a great way to get some exercise.\n\nThe game crashes. A LOT. Sometimes I get lucky when I launch it and it works. Most of the time it crashes a few times before it's stable. It crashes in multiple places, on launch, on song restart, and on song end. Disabling my second monitor seems to make the Vive more stable although I'm not sure if it helps Audioshield's stability.

The devs seem to be AWOL and ignoring all threads on the discussion page. My advice is to skip this for now. Wait for the sequel or at least for a few more updates in case they actually implement mod support and/or some much-needed bug fixes. I'll update this if it changes. \n\nOkay, here are my main gripes: \n\nGripe 1) The music browser is really, really bad. It's nearly unusuable. If you have a lot of music, you will sit for 30 seconds or more at a time waiting for it to refresh whenever you change folders. Finding a song you want will be a long and tedious process. The search function is slow and doesn't work very well. \n\nGripe 2) The mechanic where orbs will speed up and slow down without any warning or indication (presumably to match a beat, though it usually doesn't). That's not really how rhythm games should work. The idea is you're supposed to see the orbs coming and know when they're going to hit based on how far they are. If they stop just out of range and then dash in sporadically and inconsistently, it kind of breaks the rhythm. In some songs it just completely ruins the fun as the orbs are jittering and stuttering and they arrive off the beat instead of when they should. \n\nGripe 3) The algorithm for building tracks isn't very good. It would be a LOT more fun if there were some noticeable rhyme or reason to when orbs appear, where they appear from, and which color they are. As it stands it seems to be just random and scattered all over. There are no patterns, there's no emergent beauty; it's just a bunch of dots coming from all over at varying speeds (not keeping tempo) and then not really arriving on the beat at all. You can see how the game is ALMOST something really special, like with a bit more testing and maybe one more game designer with a sense for music somewhere in the mix, it would have become something really great. \n\nThat really sums up my overall impression of this game. With a few improvements it would be amazing. But as it stands right now, it's a disappointment. \n\nIn addition, the game does crash quite a lot, and it doesn't crash gracefully.

However, what Audioshield offers is magical. I've found myself playing it every day in order to transform myself into the world of music that I'm normally only able to experience with my ears. With Audioshield, I'm thrown into the music and can feel it, and see it. \n\nNot only is Audioshield great exercise, but it's very recommendable to a wide audience. Out of all the games I currently own for HTC Vive, it's certainly one of the three best to demo to friends and family.\n\nIt helps that I can use my own local music. That said, the Soundcloud based streaming provides some great options to diversify the offerings and make the experience less reliant on collecting a library of songs.\n\nAudioshield isn't perfect, though.

The harder the difficulty, the better it syncs up to the chosen song, although do not expect the algorithm to be perfect, it's very much like Audiosurf and does not sync well with every single song. Global, local and friendly leaderboards keep track of who's the best at the game for each song, assuming they're not constantly pausing the game.

Good tracks for Audiosurf's algorithem are ones where the beat of the tracks being translated well into track notes and the pace of the song is transated well into fast and slow track sections.

It does a good job of keeping with the beat of the songs and I am really getting into the songs. This game will likely keep me entertained for many more hours, and is worth the price to me in spite of its flaws.\n\nThere is certainly a wide list of what could be improved with it however, so I really really hope the devs are still working on it.\n\nMy biggest complaint would be to have the orbs to come in at a much shallower angle. After playing 2-3 songs where I'm looking up most of the time, my neck really starts to get sore. To make up for the reduced angle of attack from above, I would recommend also allowing orbs to come from below the horizon as well (this obviously means you will have to remove the floor from in front of you)\n\nI would also like some colorblind support, as I can barely tell the difference between the blue and the purple (at the very least, make the purple much darker so there is more contrast between the two colors.\n\nIt is also a bit buggy. Opening the keyboard will sometimes mess with and disable the pointer on the controllers and you can no longer point and \"click\" on anything in game or in the steam overlay menu until you completely reboot the VR.\nIt also sometimes crashes but no so much as to ruin the experience (only twice in the six hours I played, but that is still two more than any other VR titles I've played). \n\nI really appreciate the option of adding a guest name for score keeping, but I do wish that it would not overwrite the high score of the main steam account if the guest's score is higher. But at least there is a solution by having every user use a guest name.\n\nLastly, I would like for there to be even harder difficulties. While the \"Harder\" difficulty can still be challenging and fun, I want there to be a difficulty where I actually have to struggle to get over 90%.

here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsStC-yKJWc\n\n[b]Room Size Requirements[/b]\nIf you have 180 degrees of space to swing your arms forwards then you're set. No physical movement around the room is required to play\n\n[b]Performance (on minimum specs)[/b]\nRunning on \"Ultra\" settings and 2x anti-aliasing with a GTX970. Performance is perfect, no frame drops.\n\n[b]Level of immersion[/b]\nThis is very dependant on the choice of song. Audioshield allows you to play any music you own, or from online sources such as soundcloud. If you enjoy the music you're playing then you'll easily lose yourself in this world. So if you're not feeling it, try some different songs or genres until you get the ones that fit you. I find high energy songs, or songs with a strong beat work best.\n\n[b]Method of movement[/b]\nMostly standing (or dancing). It's all 1-1 tracked movement, no teleporting or being thrown around.\n\n[b]Comfort[/b]\nOverall very comfortable experience. A washable cover for your HMD would be ideal, as you'll find yourself sweating after high energy songs. Sometimes the notes fly down from very high above you, meaning you have to look up at a steep angle. An option to lower the maximum height of the notes would be ideal to prevent any neck strain. \n\n[b]Interaction[/b]\nThe haptic feedback is what makes this game. Everytime you hit the notes, you get feedback which makes it feel like you've hit something that's physically there. It does wonders for the immersion. The shields are perminately attached to your controllers, so it's super easy, no fiddling around to pick things up.\n\n[b]Social[/b]\nIf you're wearing headphones, it's not fun for everybody else in the room who can't hear the music. So a speaker setup is needed for a social experience, and is fantastic when everybody can enjoy and dance to the music too. \n\nFor a more detailed breakdown, you can watch the video provided at the start of this review.", "timestamp_created": 1460868305, "timestamp_updated": 1460868305, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22460741": {"recommendationid": "22460741", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988661394", "num_games_owned": 554, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 426, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461288998}, "language": "english", "review": "Hands down my favorite Vive game so far.

You just feel powerful. \n\nThe game works best with faster paced, high energy \"simple\" songs. The more layers there are to the music, more likely the balls will not match the song. When the game does not match the song, you feel like you're just punching random balls while the song is playing in the background. This is the game's greatest weakness. I think the developer needs to change the ball making algorithm to use just the lows and highs of a song and kind of leave the mids out of it. \n\nThe game is very buggy for me. It often crashes after 1 or 2 songs.  \n\nI love being able to stream songs from soundcloud since I don't have much of a music collection. The leaderboards keep me coming back. I'm not sure if the leaderboards are actually separated based off difficulty selected or not. \n\nThe game kind of bugs out anytime it loads anything, but you just have to stand still until it's finished loading.

It has some issues and not for everyone but overall it is an exciting experience.\n\nPros:\n1) Gameplay: The gameplay is extremely simple and the variety of shields gives it enough variety to play with. The different shields essentially determine how you will block the notes and has an impact on your physical motions.\n\n2) Visuals: Honestly the game looks extremely basic and unitneresting just based on videos and pictures. I had many people look at the game running on the monitor thinking it was pretty bland but put on the headset and feel overwhelmed and excited. I myself am guilty of this as well. The impact of the notes on your shieds are bot tactile and visually stimulating. There are often times where the explosions can actually distracting and prevent you from seeing the notes directly after.\n\nCons:\n1) The Music: This isn't a huge issue personally but it is enough so that I must mention it. The game lets you play music off of a limited selection off of SoundCloud so there isn't much to pick from to begin with. Fortunately (or unfortunately for some) it allows you to pick songs files on your harddrive. For someone like me who has a lot of music files, I am able to delve into that library and play songs to no end. However, if you do not have such a collection, you might find yourself playing the same few songs over and over again. \n\n2) The Algorithm: The game generates notes by analyzing the file and then spitting it back at you. Unfortunately, it isn't as refined as I would like it to be. There are some songs that work extremely well that will make you feel like you are fighting the music itself. However there are other songs that don't feel well represented by the algorithm. The algorithm works extremely well with clear distinctive snares and beats like electronic music and pop songs. Anything else like rock however seems to not play well. Overall I feel like I'm hitting random notes about 50% of the time.\n\nConclusion/TLDR:\nI would recommend this game for the experience itself as it is truly a fun VR experience. If you have a substantial library of music of your own to play with however, this is an extremely worthwhile game. It has addictive gameplay and the different shields will make the same songs feel like a different experience.

Ultimately, I think this will end up being one of my most played games. That being said, it does have some issues.\n\nCriticism: \n\n1. Near constant crashes. I often have to open this game 4 or 5 times before it will finally open without crashing. I have also experience crashing after songs end, or when selecting a new song. I've seen others posting the same thing, so I know this isn't just me. I have also experienced a few crashes of the computer while playing, but I don't know that it was audioshield's fault as opposed to an overclock, or SteamVR in general. \n\n2. There is a feature that allows you to add a new guest player (awesome), however, at the moment you can only do so with the mouse and keyboard as opposed to in VR. Additionally, it appears to be broken in that it will update the score for the guest account and the main account at once, meaning you cannot compare scores amongst local players. \n\n3. There also appears to be a bug where holding the shields together to form the purple shield works on any color, not just purple. \n\nAll of these criticisms aside, the game is fantastic and you should absolutely pick it up, I just hope the dev sees this and  works on them.", "timestamp_created": 1460485574, "timestamp_updated": 1460485574, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22379785": {"recommendationid": "22379785", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049193684", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 481, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511499390}, "language": "english", "review": "Despite its seamingly simplistic tron like environment, this experience is worth returning to time and again.

It didn't look that entertaining to me. Then after reading that many people were saying how much fun it actually is, I picked it up and goddamn is it a blast! Having spent a fair amount of time in Audiosurf, this feels like the next logical step with the introduction of VR.\n\nIt's quite clich\u00e9d, but watching this game doesn't do it justice, you have to play it. It's challenging and matches the flow of the song pretty well, it's not perfect (ymmv, different genres track better than others), but does it ever get exciting when you see a huge wall of notes flying at you just as the song is about to get intense.\n\nI have noticed some issues where if I play a song that I have a local copy of that is listed on the popular tracks list, that the leaderboard doesn't have the same info on it.

It's designed from the ground up for VR and it shows. \n\nIt's a comfortable game for VR and I can't imagine anyone getting sick from this. It can also be played in a very small space as you stay in a single position. \n\nIt's not a perfect game and I feel like it needs some polish, specifically in the menus which feel unfinished and clunky to navigate. The curation of tracks could also use work. Personally I don't have any audio tracks on local storage as I stream everything from Spotify and have done so for some time, and I suspect many people are the same. There is Youtube integration but for it to really elevate the game there should be some better curation on offer. It could be as simple as pulling data from the trending and most popular tracks on Youtube. That would keep it fresh, offer 'new' content weekly with little further input from the developer once implemented and prevent the 'most popular' Audioshield list from ending up stagnant as it currently stands. Also the beat detection isn't perfect, and you'll quickly find that like in Audiosurf, some songs are just better to play than others, with the best generally being those with a prominent beat. \n\nI recommend this game as it is fun and is unique in its ability to make levels out of any music. However, those looking for a more traditional music rhythm game with tighter, more precise gameplay should take a look at the more polished Airtone", "timestamp_created": 1460037151, "timestamp_updated": 1500798496, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22284517": {"recommendationid": "22284517", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087021631", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 415, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471369863}, "language": "english", "review": "You'll want to add your own music, and it works best with trancey/techno stuff rather than anything lyrical, but this is my easily my favorite VR experience so far.

This is what you get when you apply that to virtual reality. The core gameplay comes down to picking out songs on your local machine or available on Soundcloud and surviving the resulting barrage of blue and orange balls which represent your music in the virtual space.  Audioshield is focused on this mechanic alone with laser precision, and completely nails the execution. To this point, I have not had any desynchronization between my controllers and the shields in the game - every note I miss is my fault.\n\nI didn't get sucked in to Audiosurf, though I did enjoy it. However the sense of presence that it's successor gains from being in virtual reality does a great job selling the experience. It's easy to get in to the rhythm and the music and bring some artistic flair to your one-man shield wall. In fact, more active performances from the players are gauged higher than passive renditions. To keep up on the leaderboards as they shake out in this game, I suspect that maintaining an active playstyle will be crucial towards maintaining top spots on popular songs.\n\nWhat comes hand-in-hand with this Audioshield experience is a break from the sedentary lifestyle from those of us that need it. If you need to trick yourself in to staying a little more active in your day-to-day, it's not hard to work up a sweat in this game and the feedback from the experience will keep you to the routine if you let it.\n\nTo answer a question that has come up a lot on reddit and other places, there is no Spotify integration for this game due to the encrypted nature of offline songs from that service. Similarly, Microsoft Groove songs will show up in your list of playable songs with all the proper metadata however no music makes it to the level when you select it.\n\nI can recommend this game without reservation as an excellent choice for brand new VR libraries if you've got a thing for rhythm games and aren't afraid of sweating.

Man oh man was I wrong. This game puts you in a really cool stage environment your left hand wields a blue shield and your right hand wields a red shield (looks more orange to me). If you put your shields together or pull one of the triggers on the controller, you create a purple shield. Your goal is to block the blue, red, and purple orbs that are coming at you, to the beat of the music, with the according color shield. The game is simple but extremely fun and while not perfect the orbs match the beat of the song extremely well. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Can import any mp3 on your computer.\n[*]Visuals, especially the particle effects flying around your shield, are really fun and good looking.\n[*]Simple, anyone can pick this up making it a great party game. It was easy swap headsets between songs to let everyone try it. \n[/list]\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Not a lot of included songs with the game it really doesn\u2019t shine unless you import your own. The included songs have a lot of variety and are really good though.\n[*]UI is a little weird, I think the difficulty is supposed to be normal, hard, harder but often times I would see the same option twice i.e. Normal, harder, harder. \n[*]Easy, with only three notes (purples are hardly used) it is hard to miss a lot of notes. As far as I know of you can\u2019t fail out of a song like you can in Guitar Hero for missing too many notes. When I would give the headset to someone new they had no trouble playing it on harder without any previous experience with it. \n[/list]\n\n[b]TLDR:[/b]\nFantastic game, buy it. I really didn\u2019t think I would enjoy it as much as I did. It was the favorite at my launch day party and we ended up sinking the most time in to this game.

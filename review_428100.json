You must work together to fight this evil, before being returned to your own time. The plot is very well told, and has a rich cast of characters, some of whom join your party. The game, however, is painfully short, given the broad scope and careful setup of the story.\n\nThe world map is quite extensive, and can be explored for a number of monsters which can be killed as side quests. Prompting from the game's characters, however, strongly urges you along the main story sequence. There are a few, but not many, side quests that involve missions other than monster kills.\n\nEnemies are visible on the map, and most can avoided with some skill, but if you get too close, they will rush at you. Battles are sometimes difficult, and it is sometimes necessary to return to your safety zone for a rest after only one or two battles. At the start of the game, you have four party members, while towards the end you have 7 or 8, but must choose which four to use in battle. You are allowed to switch party members during battles, but this is rarely a strategic advantage.\n\nThere are stores to buy weapons and armour, but unless you go for the side quests, your progress will go much too fast to equip all your characters with all the best stuff, and the game is easy enough to beat without it.\n\nOverall, it's a great game, but very short.", "timestamp_created": 1503355339, "timestamp_updated": 1503355339, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539508", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33051306": {"recommendationid": "33051306", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988359453", "num_games_owned": 238, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 313, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498698791}, "language": "english", "review": "Beyond Reality has an intriguing opening, but doesn't really do anything to impress from there.\n\nThe story set up is cool:  an advanced civilization has ruined their world with pollution.  You play a female scientist trying to find a solution.  Sadly, this whole plot line really isn't developed that much from there.\n\nFrom there, it takes cues from Star Ocean and takes you from a sci-fi world to a fantasy one, where you will be spending most of the rest of the game.  Unfortunately, the plot involved in the fantasy world is pretty much by the books.\n\nMap design is subpar.  There weren't any tilesets I hadn't seen before, and they weren't used in any really interesting ways.  The maps aren't ugly, they're just uninspired.  There's also a few graphics issues, with halves of trees straight up missing and such.  Really just laziness.  Even monster sprites on the maps are just the same blue or red orbs.  The dungeons are pretty linear with a few puzzles sprinkled here and there.  It's serviceable.  Dungeons never felt too long or too confusing.\n\nThe combat is standard RPG Maker stuff.  The layout looks like Phantasy Star which is kinda cool.  Unfortunately, the combat is very easy and strategy boils down to \"use your most powerful attacks and heal every so often.\"  That's it.  That will beat every enemy in the game.  The hunts are cool and I completed them all, but, again, there's no strategy to beating any of them.  \n\nThe game took me 5 hours to beat, I got 20 of 24 achievements, and I beat the game with my characters at level 9.  \n\nI've definitely played worse when it comes to RPG Maker, but there's nothing really to write home about here.

For RPGMaker titles there are some really good, and some really bad, this falls right on the other side of bearable.  It is not horrific, and it did make me smile and intrigued, but overall it felt a little empty.\n\nWarning, semi-spoilers ahead\n\nFirst off the characters themselves both due to the sheer number of playable characters, and people in the story not enough of them got enough characterization to stand water.  But the premise of the story was pretty good.  Very Chrono Trigger-ish but in reverse.  IE you are from the future something happened in the past, but you are forcibly sent back in time and some of your party members stay behind at the end causing the entire future to change from polluted, to clean.\n\nThe combat is shallow, repetitive and leveling is a chore.  There is an achieve for all characters lv 10 which you will get at the final boss whether they are that lv or not.  Which is good since you get a lv 6/7 chara right before said boss.  Virtually any tactic early in the game will work late game.\n\nThe villian feels as if there's no motivation behind him...  He feels shallow as well.

1470611520}, "language": "english", "review": "At this point we all know Aldorlea Games to be an RPGMaker games publisher with some quality and expectation stored for us. Being EternalShadow Studios' first and only game developed so far, [i]Beyond Reality[/i] is a JRPG done right - within the boundaries of RPGMaker nonetheless. This is a short, story driven game with a beautiful setting and an immersive storyline.\n\nIn this technologically advanced little world, the primary problem is the pollution that has already taken an effect over the climate and rendered a major part of the world uninhabitable. As humanity developed, it also consumed and processed natural resources to a degree that mother earth would eventually give up. While bizarre climate changes worry most of the scientist population drastically, Alpha Omega Company researches the causes and consequences of this natural detriment. The day starts as a usual one in the company headquarters... at least until they receive a visitor from the past, demanding aid from the company crew to prevent a war that may very well spell catastrophe for their timeline! So - a bit involuntarily - the crew is snatched from their proper timeline to change the past; thus, maybe achieving a feat [i]Beyond Reality[/i]: changing their own future...\n\nThe environmentalist message aside, [i]Beyond Reality[/i] is a Fantasy JRPG, in which you'll travel into a medieval fantasy world fuelled with magic to manage your party and venture into adventure to discover a conspiracy that would alter the timeline. Story is interesting, but it is genuinely short to speak about a proper world lore. We are given the basics of the geography, the history and the political conflicts since they all are our primary topics, yet we are not given much narrative. Our characters though - not incredibly memorable maybe - are given enough personality to differentiate and enjoy their interactions on the way.\n\nThe main story is pretty much a railroad with decent destination indicators given, and there are some side quests and areas to explore - mostly with a \"go there and kill that boss for me\" quest content. Even though not being incredibly deep or anything, the game doesn't outstay its welcome. It presents you an enjoyable 10-12 hours, and you get done with it with a pleasant smile on the face.\n\nIf we are to speak about environment design, it is surely one of the better examples for the usage of RPGMaker. Maps are designed appropriately, with a decent selection from custom pack items and tiles, resulting in a genuinely enjoyable collage. Soundtrack is fitting: not boring or annoying exactly, even though there'd be a 100th time you'd hear it, especially on the battle interface. It just blends in with the environment to become a part of the setting.\n\nAs for the gameplay, it is really your basic JRPG. You walk around, explore the area and face head on some combats to gather experience. Characters have their different set of combat skills and it takes some expertise to arrange a party efficiently - especially while playing the game in expert or hard difficulties. Your characters are to be upgraded both by leveling up - there is a level cap of 10 - and proper gear so you can face tougher battles as they come. I think low level cap and limited gear options were proper choices for this game, considering its length in hours.\n\nThere are achievements - and most of them work properly, yet there are some problems with the completion achievements such as \"Boss of All\" or \"Rare Defeat\" currently. Developer has been incredibly attentive to the community, offering his aid for every possible way with kind words, gameplay encouragement and hard work. They are working to correct these achievement bugs, so there is a better chance that this won't be an issue soon.\n\nIf you feel like going through a short JRPG with a basic story that would take your mind off some casual problems, look no further. [i]Beyond Reality[/i] is your game.\n\n[b]Update: A patch came out to deal with the achievements issue. Now they all trigger properly.

One of my closest friends is an RPG aficionado who practically begged me to get Aldorlea Games on board. The publisher, he advised, was one of his favorites because they gave indie RPG developers a chance to be noticed as well as developing some of the more popular and better RPGs on Steam. He pointed out the fact that their Millennium series was one of the more popular RPG franchises on the platform. However, it\u2019s just a simple fact that some developers and publishers take a bit longer to get to work with. Sometimes you need to demonstrate a portfolio before a company will take notice. This was the case with Aldorlea Games. We simply had to put up some quality early content and have some positive feedback from developers and publishers that we were working with before they would come on board. However, once they did come on board with Beyond Reality they have been supportive.\n\nInitially it was an older title that I was hoping to work with \u2013 Beyond Reality had yet to be released \u2013 so I was taken aback when they asked if we would provide some exposure to their latest title. They decided to jump in from the deep end with us and for that we\u2019re appreciative. Beyond Reality is one of the best titles that Aldorlea Games have published to date. That it is the first game to be developed by EternalShadows Studio speaks volumes to the talent of their developers. The premise of Beyond Reality has you taking on the crew of  the Alpha Omega Company in a game world where science meets magic. You must find the secrets behind the realities of life that your crew has always known in order to put an end to a war, pollution and to rewrite history.\n\nThe introduction to the game sets a fantastic tone for the entirety of the game. Many RPGMaker games I find can suffer from hideously slow beginnings that provide poor attempts at offering a tutorial at the costly expense of establishing a good story. The developers have found a way to provide both simultaneously. Beginners to RPGMaker games will be able to pick up the whys and the how to\u2019s of the engine very easily while seasoned veterans will be able to immerse themselves into the game play very quickly making it an ideal game for both levels of gamers, a rare treat indeed.\n\nI\u2019ve long been a fan of games that tackle real world issues head on in a way that is not overbearing or out welcoming but hammer home points that they want to make in a succinct and intelligent manner. The game handles the topics of science and pollution with aplomb. I was definitely skeptical at first as to how this would be tackled as the topic of pollution isn\u2019t one that is very often covered in gaming. EternalShadow Studios weaves the important points that they want to make into the story line of the game in a thought provoking and succinct manner that pushes the strengths of the story without ever taking anything away from the game. I appreciate that as a rare feat of excellence.\n\nWhat a pleasant surprise to see a different graphical and artistic style than regular RPGMaker games. From time to time developers will attempt to offer some innovation to the artwork in games and to be different. There is a tremendous amount of risk associated with innovation in gaming and the result much of the time is an unfortunate one. However,  I really do enjoy the artwork in this game. It provides a different tone and level of ambiance than other games do.\n\nI want to take a moment to offer my appreciation for the early option to choose fantasy or modern character names and there are even examples provided of some of the main characters in the game. This was a very nice touch. Often times I find fantasy names to be grating. It was nice to have the choice to play as Blayze instead of Le\u2019tainafae (the latter I made up).\n\nAt full price Beyond Reality sits at $4.99. Until the 16th of January the  game is $3.49. I argue that Aldorlea Games could easily have set a higher price for the game as I consider the game to be a quality purchase even at full price. At the sale price you\u2019re laughing. If you\u2019re in any way an RPG fan then there is much to like about Beyond Reality.\n\nFor more reviews similar to this one and our daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/", "timestamp_created": 1452799917, "timestamp_updated": 1452800204, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529258", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20526760": {"recommendationid": "20526760", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127905666", "num_games_owned": 205, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 449, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452748069}, "language": "english", "review": "If you\u2019re looking for an example of an RPG Maker game done right, you\u2019re going to enjoy this game. \n\nBeyond Reality is one of those games that manages to take a fairly simple set of systems, and do them well enough to stand out. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a challenging game by any means, but there is enough exploring and battling to make it worth a play. \n\nPlot-wise, I was hooked in pretty quickly by the intro, and the rest of the game did a nice job of carrying the story. I always had a pretty good idea of where I was going, and never ran across any problems when I took a little time to explore. A major thing I noticed is that the characters could\u2019ve used a little more development, though. I got enough of a sense of them to understand most of their personalities, but not enough to grow attached to any of them.\n\nAs far as graphics go, this game definitely lands on the better end of what you\u2019ll find in RPG Maker. The mapping, while not always spectacular, was done well, and you can tell there was thought put into each location. There are a lot of little things that enhance the atmosphere, too - footprints in the sand and snow, splashing in the water, etc. - just a few little touches to compliment the scenery. I appreciate that many different packs of graphics were used and combined, so we weren\u2019t stuck staring at the default graphics. The character sprites weren\u2019t anything particularly exciting, but they fit the portraits and settings well.\n\nI had a bit of trouble with battles early on, but that\u2019s on me for not keeping track of equipment upgrades. None of the fights weren\u2019t exactly challenging (I rarely lost a character), but the front-view system was put together well. If things are getting too easy, you also have the option of avoiding enemies or running away, if you want to. I never found the battles tedious enough to run away from, though.\n\nBesides that, the music and sound effects were chosen well, though nothing particularly stood out to me. The attack/battle start sounds do get a bit annoying after a while, but that\u2019s mostly because the same sound is used in a lot of RPG Maker games.\n\n Overall, if you\u2019re looking for a short and sweet RPG, you won\u2019t be disappointed.", "timestamp_created": 1452798033, "timestamp_updated": 1452798033, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.704854", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20516232": {"recommendationid": "20516232", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062309754", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493626803}, "language": "english", "review": "I love the cover art/promotional material for this game, but man...\n\n*PROS*\n- Sleek GUI/Menu\n- Attention to detail (footprints, added effects, etc.)\n- Lovely mapping (for the most part)\n\n*CONS*\n- Poor story progression/character development\n   [i]EXPANSION[/i]: You're thrown into this game - and so many random things happen within the first 15 minutes you're going to have next to no clue what's going on. A bad dream with no relevance really, a girl in a crystal (where that came from I don't even  know), an S-Rank spell that transports you back in time and disingenuous reactions to that situation just made me go \"uh...\" - I mean, it just all seems so poorly fleshed out/cheesy. And why is the \"most powerful mage in the world\" far less powerful than your second recruited mage?\n- Dialogue needs some polishing.\n   [i]EXPANSION[/i]: It's not awful, don't get me wrong - but there's a lot of repetition and name-dropping which makes the dialogue rather boring at times. My advice to the dev is to implement some flavor text/exploration-based text throughout to strengthen the lore/situational awareness (like why Asha was in the crystal...that happened far too quickly).\n- Bugs.

It's thought provoking and while some improvements could be made in character development, it doesn't take too much away from the over all experience\n\nMusic - Now I know this game doesn't have any original pieces but none-the-less, the tracks were well chosen.\n\nRPG Maker - I myself am working on an RPG Maker game, I make this a pro because it's always good to see a decent or good RPG Maker game make it onto steam. Is this the best RPG Maker game? No. But, is it worth the purchase price, sure! You can tell from the mapping and the story that a lot of thought and work went into this title given the engine it was built in.\n\nCons:\nCharacter Development - the game is fairly short, and the orignal was even shorter. The developer did a great job extending the story line for this version of the game but it sometimes feels like the charcters could use more depth and weren't... filler. But, again, not the worst by far out there.\n\nMapping - \"Wait, didn't you mention mapping in your pros?\" Yes, I did. as good as the mapping is in this game, for a commercial product, and I thought hard about this, it could be better. By that I mean, lighting and atmosphere. It lacks in those departments and I know the power of RPG Maker is limited, but there are solutions to this problem. I suggest the developer to consider some broader techniques for his future projects, especially commercial ones. \n\nBattle System: I personally don't like the battle system as much as others, and the animations are pretty copy and paste. I would prefer to see a little more effort in this portion of an RPG. It's no where near as bad as MANY rpg maker games that I've played, but since this is a commercial product, custom animations and a more unique battle system would have been a nice touch.\n\n\n\nOverall, I recommend this game. Having played the orginal and a couple versions of the current copy, it's not a bad game. The asking price is fair for something that can be finished in 5-7 hours. I'd love to see what the dev can make with a newer engine and some custom resourses!", "timestamp_created": 1452715460, "timestamp_updated": 1452715460, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563461", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20508313": {"recommendationid": "20508313", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142039961", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1222, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463923471}, "language": "english", "review": "This is actually a pretty enjoyable RPG! The story was interesting enough to keep me engaged, and the gameplay was quite fun.\n\nThe story has a time-traveling element to it and I always like those. It may be a bit slow after the intro, but after you get through a few dungeons (which are comfortably short enough), it picks up the pace. The game actually gets better the further you play, and I especially like the scenes toward the end of the game.\n\nBattles were quite fun, despite the simple turn based battle system. Most battles don't last very long, so you won't get bored of fighting. Fights are balanced well, a bit on the easy side but it does have its challenging moments.\nThere are also no random encounters, and encounters are placed around the map instead. This gives you a choice whether you want to fight or not. It makes exploring much more comfortable.\n\nThe spacing of the map areas are also nicely done, it doesn't feel like it's tedious to travel. This is also helped by the fact that enemies are on-map and you can try to run around them but they do chase you! (quite a bit effectively IIRC)\nThe scenery is well-done, various climates from snow fields to deserts. I also like the little details such as effects when you step on certain terrain such as sand or shallow water, and you leave footprints and splash the water, respectively.\n\nThere are a few puzzles here and there which are simple enough to understand (you won't get frustrated), and there are sidequests which include hunting for certain monsters, and they drop valuable equipment. They're quite fun to do.\n\nThe character art is great, and the music sounds beautiful and fits well, especially in the final scenes of the game. That was EPIC.\n\nI suggest to play the game using the highest resolution, so you can see the entirety of the maps and have dialogue efficiently placed (it looks much better that way).\n\nOverall, this is a pretty good RPG Maker game.

O jogo n\u00e3o se localiza temporalmente, mas tem um clima que lembra filmes como A Dama de Preto ou Os Outros, podendo se passar no final do Sec XIX ou in\u00edcio do Sec  XX. Um clima sombrio que se passa em uma noite chuvosa. O jogo ainda possui um design bem caprichado, com personagens bem feitos sem o aspecto chibi/caricato tendo propor\u00e7\u00f5es realistas.\nA principio, achei que se tratava de resolver um caso de assassinato dentro de sua fam\u00edlia, mas na verdade, \u00e9 exatamente o contr\u00e1rio, voc\u00ea tem que matar a sua irm\u00e3 sem deixar pistas, fazendo um crime perfeito.\nA fam\u00edlia do protagonista \u00e9 asquerosa, do tipo que judia de seus criados, somente o protagonista tem um lado mais humano (pelo menos at\u00e9 cometer o crime).\nO jogo tem um roteiro bem interessante, porem \u00e9 curto. Se zera em quest\u00e3o de 20 min. Tem uma certa dificuldade da primeira vez, mas jogando de novo, voc\u00ea j\u00e1 sabe exatamente o que fazer.\n\u00c9 um game indie interessante e que est\u00e1 barato na Steam.

It?[/b]\nA short RPGMaker adventure game about a guy trying to get away with murder.  A single play-through takes maybe 10-15 minutes (faster once you know what you're doing.)  The plot is simplistic and to the point, but the amount of player agency is remarkably complex, all things considered.  Overall, fun for what it is.\n\n[b]What's The Best Part?[/b]\nThe game has a surprising variety of choices, considering how short it is.  You can plant fake evidence to throw off pursuit and choose from a number of murder weapons.  All in all, you really get the feeling that you're [i]deciding how to proceed[/i] for yourself, rather than simply solving a puzzle in a game.\n\nI was caught the first time I played it through because I made the classic mistake - I forgot to fully think through what would happen [i]after[/i] I did the deed!  This is where the game shows it's true brilliance; it's not just about killing your target and then escaping the scene.  You also need to get through the police investigation which follows, and that part is surprisingly thorough, so without proper forethought, you'll probably end up getting caught.\n\n[b]What's The Worst Part?[/b]\nThe graphics are pretty bad, honestly, but considering how short the game is, I didn't mind too much.\n\n[b]Will I Like It?[/b]\nAs far as RPGMaker games go, I'd say this is one of the better ones I've played (not that I'm an expert on RPGMaker games or anything.)  It makes you think in unorthodox ways, but it doesn't overstay its welcome.  As such, although its flaws are fairly apparent, they don't get on your nerves because the game is so short.\n\n[b]Why Should I Buy It?[/b]\nWell, for starters it's less than $1.  Given the replayability factor, it's well worth the price.\n\nThis has been a 5TYSK review.

Execpt you are the murder and must hide it at all cost. Then going to prison is unlikly an option for you.\n\nI do like the gamemechanics and the various option you have to commit your crime. Many option leads to a great replay value and the achievement, while easy to optain are promotion, this.\nWell i right now i did achieved all of those and i have to tell that afterwards i couldn\u00b4t stare to play this game for another round.\n\nNo matter what i can prove for that nice price you will have a few hours fun and a game with easy optain achievements.\n\nThe only bad thing is a logical problem. If this would be a real case i belive you will visited prison sooner or later. Because the biggest evidence is a boy visiting his hated home after learning that his father want him to be removed as familiy member and unoptaimable of getting money after dead. Quite irratitng.

Vaihtoehtoja on muuta, murha-aseita on runsaasti ja mahdollisia lopetuksia on useita. Deed ei ole pitk\u00e4 peli. Ensin siin\u00e4 luodaan kuva pelihahmosta keskustelujen muodossa. Vaihtoehtoja on vajaa kourallinen, mutta niidenkin avulla peliin saadaan varsin hyvin vaihtelua. \nKun pelaaja on valinnut murha-aseen ja todisteen jota k\u00e4ytt\u00e4\u00e4 tukemaan kehitt\u00e4m\u00e4\u00e4ns\u00e4 teoriaa siirryt\u00e4\u00e4n pelin parhaaseen puoleen, poliisitutkintaan.

Sitten tulee vain kehitt\u00e4\u00e4 oma idea siit\u00e4, miten kaikki \u201doikeasti\u201d tapahtuu, eli miten rikostutkinta sitten etenee. Ensimm\u00e4isell\u00e4 pelikerralla kaikki on uutta joten tilanteisiin pit\u00e4\u00e4 reagoida kun ne tulevat vastaan. Uusilla pelikerroilla voi sitten kokeilla jotain muuta, kun tiet\u00e4\u00e4 mit\u00e4 tulema pit\u00e4\u00e4, niin siihen voi varautua.\nVaikka pelin pelaa l\u00e4pi viidess\u00e4toista minuutissa ensimm\u00e4isell\u00e4 kerralla ja v\u00e4hemm\u00e4ss\u00e4 ajassa my\u00f6hemmill\u00e4 pelikerroilla, niin se on hintansa arvoinen. Alle euron pelilt\u00e4 nyt ei voi kovin paljoa odottaa, mutta Deed tarjoaa todella hyvin pelattavaa.\n\nDeed on tyylik\u00e4s ajattelupeli. Ensimm\u00e4isell\u00e4 kerralla (Blind) se on tarkkaa miettimist\u00e4 siin\u00e4 mit\u00e4 tekee ja mit\u00e4 sanoo, samalla kun miettii tarkoin ett\u00e4 miten suorittaisi murhan.

une petite review \u00e0 chaud !\n\nJ'ai attendu que ce jeu soit sold\u00e9 pour l'acheter (\u00e0 moins de 50cts, c'\u00e9tait donn\u00e9) car m\u00eame si le concept avait l'air sympa, les graphismes ne m'inspiraient pas trop. C'est vrai que c'est tr\u00e8s old school et pixellis\u00e9, les personnages ne sont pas tr\u00e8s beaux ni d\u00e9taill\u00e9s, mais les artworks des persos quand ils parlent sont plut\u00f4t jolis et bien faits, et c'est l'essentiel dans ce type de jeu. Les d\u00e9cors ne sont pas trop brouillons et les interractions sont clairement indiqu\u00e9es.\n\nLe jeu est court, mais raisonnable pour ce prix. Mon premier run m'a pris une petite 15aine de minutes en ayant parl\u00e9 \u00e0 tous les personnages et fouill\u00e9 tous les objets de la maison, mais le principe de ce jeu est la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition de l'aventure jusqu'\u00e0 avoir le r\u00e9sultat parfait. En tout j'y ai pass\u00e9 environ 2h (une grosse poign\u00e9e de tentatives) pour r\u00e9ussir \u00e0 remplir l'objectif (faire accuser une personne, puis l'autre, jusqu'\u00e0 un r\u00e9sultat satisfaisant).\n\nVous incarnez un homme qui retourne dans son ancienne maison de famille pour les 50ans de son p\u00e8re, tout au long de l'exploration de la maison on apprend le pass\u00e9 chaotique de la famille, c'est assez immersif, l'ambiance est l\u00e0 et l'aspect psychologique des personnages est plut\u00f4t bien exploit\u00e9. L'introduction annonce la couleur directement : vous \u00eates l\u00e0 pour assassiner votre soeur, car votre p\u00e8re a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de vous rayer de son testament.\n\nLe principe est vraiment tr\u00e8s sympa et original, il se passe en 3 phases. Avant le repas, vous devez collecter dans la maison une arme et un indice, qui vous permettront de tuer votre soeur tout en faisant accuser quelqu'un d'autre (ainsi que parler aux diff\u00e9rents personnages, vos r\u00e9ponses influeront sur les suspicions du commissaire). Apr\u00e8s le repas, vous cachez l'indice dans une des pi\u00e8ces (ou pas) et assassinez votre soeur (\u00e0 mains nues ou avec l'arme choisie). Lorsque le crime est d\u00e9couvert commence la troisi\u00e8me phase, l'interrogatoire, o\u00f9 vous devrez r\u00e9pondre de vos choix de dialogues et d'actions de la premi\u00e8re phase, afin d'orienter l'investigation.\n\nUne cin\u00e9matique vous indique l'issue du jeu (qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accus\u00e9), et le run se termine et vous renvoie au menu principal. \n\nLe but ici est de recommencer over and over jusqu'\u00e0 avoir r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 faire accuser les personnes que vous vouliez faire accuser. Je n'ai pas trouv\u00e9 \u00e7a tr\u00e8s r\u00e9barbatif parce que \u00e7a s'encha\u00eene bien et de mani\u00e8re plut\u00f4t fluide, vous n'\u00eates pas oblig\u00e9s de reparler \u00e0 chaque personnage ou revisiter chaque pi\u00e8ce \u00e0 chacun de vos runs, et si vous le faites vous pouvez passer rapidement les dialogues en cliquant, les cin\u00e9matiques et flash backs sont courts (on peut passer l'intro) et on arrive tr\u00e8s rapidement \u00e0 finir une tentative en quelques minutes \u00e0 peine pour pouvoir tester toutes les possibilit\u00e9s (et au passage d\u00e9bloquer tous les succ\u00e8s Steam).\n\nJ'ai bien aim\u00e9 l'ambiance et le c\u00f4t\u00e9 r\u00e9flexion (se creuser les m\u00e9ninges pour savoir quels objets utiliser et quelles r\u00e9ponses donner), \u00e0 petit prix je recommande volontiers.", "timestamp_created": 1511431902, "timestamp_updated": 1511431902, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36971239": {"recommendationid": "36971239", "author": {"steamid": "76561198195669989", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 54, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511424206}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u73b0\u5728\u8fd9\u6837\u826f\u5fc3\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u6e38\u620f\u5df2\u7ecf\u4e0d\u591a\u4e86\uff0c\u63a8\u51fa\u8fd9\u4e48\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u8fd8\u66f4\u65b0\u4e86\u4e2d\u6587\uff0c\u73a9\u6cd5\u591a\u6837\uff0c\u771f\u7684\u5f88\u6709\u610f\u601d\uff0c\u52a0\u6cb9", "timestamp_created": 1511422876, "timestamp_updated": 1511422876, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36963680": {"recommendationid": "36963680", "author": {"steamid": "76561198280747785", "num_games_owned": 266, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501034657}, "language": "spanish", "review": "De los mejores indies que he jugado.", "timestamp_created": 1511420657, "timestamp_updated": 1511420657, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36928832": {"recommendationid": "36928832", "author": {"steamid": "76561198402959632", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 159, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511411205}, "language": "english", "review": "An amazing game to get on sale, perfect for those who love mystery and \"choices and decisions matter\" games :)", "timestamp_created": 1511411164, "timestamp_updated": 1511411164, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36925462": {"recommendationid": "36925462", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996153464", "num_games_owned": 222, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498930314}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ud615\uc0ac\ub294 \ub2f9\uc2e0\uc774 \ud55c \ub9d0\uc744 \uae30\uc5b5\ud560 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "timestamp_created": 1511410291, "timestamp_updated": 1511410291, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36904122": {"recommendationid": "36904122", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983193743", "num_games_owned": 192, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 457, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511552181}, "language": "english", "review": "Simp[e yet complicated.

The very premise is rare and very interesting, and the ideas of the game are presented in a way that's both clear and compelling.\n\nThis is a good game, especially considering its price. Good, but not exceptional.\n\nWhat I did like about it is the writing, the simple premise, the exploration that warrants more than one playthrough. The game is atmospheric for such a little exercise in planning, and thinking through your execution. The endings are a genuine joy to read, as they vary enough to warrant repeated playthroughs.\n\nOn the other hand... I am a little disappointed by the lack of depth of how the game determines the outcome. In the end, the game follows a simple logic of \"if you say A, or plant evidence B, or do C during dinner, then X, Y or Z will happen\". It's not possible, as far as I've been able to determine, to plant convoluted, Agatha Christie style evidence that suggests A found out about B and thus decided to do C, or that one person framed another for murder. The game is too straightforward for this.\n\nOn top of that, while the game allow for some interesting dialogue options if you keep objects on your person, it's not possible to plant weapons (which is understandable) or two pieces of evidence (which is not). I know that with a more complex system the number of possible combinations to plan for, on the game design side, rises exponentially, but the mostly \"one weapon, one piece of evidence\" approach makes the game feel a bit artificial in its constraints.\n\nAnd that's really a pity. A reverse murder mystery absolutely *should* have some convoluted endings and twists and turns and a lot of options to plant evidence in creative ways (what if you plant the mother's journal in the daughter's room, and a love letter from the daughter in the mother's room? Nope, you can't do that. The game doesn't allow it).\n\nAs it is, the game is entertaining enough and I do recommend it (especially as it's dirt-cheap), but it's a simple \"plant evidence to cast suspicion on the corresponding person\" exercise, which leaves me hungry for slightly more.", "timestamp_created": 1510082703, "timestamp_updated": 1510082756, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36324135": {"recommendationid": "36324135", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109030572", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 245, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509984590}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice and fun little game.

You, als the prodigal son, return to the family estate to murder your sister and secure your inheritance.\n\nIt's a somewhat clunky and primitive pixel-art adventure game revolving around an awkward family dinner of 6 people with a lot of baggage. In the dialogue trees, in planting fake evidence and in choosing a murder weapon you have pretty good control over who will take the fall for your crime. And that's basically the game. Your first playthrough might last 25 minutes due to exploration and reading. At the end you'll probably rush through some options in just 3-5 minutes, so expect most of the content to lie in replays gunning for different endings or filling out achievements.\n\nThere is more depth to the game than I expected, with almost every action having some kind of impact during the final investigation of the death and with multiple degrees of suspicion towards every character. There has clearly been put some serious thought into the decision trees!\n\nThe game has a certain morbid charm and decent writing both in terms of characters and dialogue. Sound and music are apropriately atmospheric, but nothing to write home about. Apart from the reset (F12) not working, I had no technical issues with the game. There is content for about 2 hours of playtime, which is also pretty much when you'll be fed up with the game - so in a sense it has the perfect length. I think the (very low) price is pretty adequate for how much enjoyment you can get out of this game (especially considering sales, the bundle with the sequel and what you can recoup from trading cards).

You're not playing a psychotic megalomaniac, you're playing a grown man who has finally made his way into the world, away from his abusive family (mother, father, and sister!), and is only coming back at this point because he heard he was being written out of his father's will in place of his mentally ill sister.  The motive, rather than revenge, which would make me feel somewhat satisfied, is greed.\n\nPlotting murder is great fun, but motive is everything.  This wasn't as fun to me as it could've been.  My recommendation?  Get this for a buck, then get The Deed: Dynasty, or get them together as a package deal.

The time I have spent on the game (a little less than 90 minutes) was enough to 100% it (read: get all achievements).\n\nI got this game during the Summer Sale (I saw it at random and went \"Hey, looks interesting!\")\n\n\"The Deed\" is a game about solving a murder. Except you're the murderer.\nAnd you hate [spoiler]your sister[/spoiler].\nSo we're gonna commit [i]MURDER![/i]\nGood for you!\n\nAs you start the game, you're given some backstory: you're heading back to your old home due to it being your father's birthday. Right as you enter, you're given the option to be a jerk ([spoiler]flirting with the maid[/spoiler]), be polite or come off as well... Off. \n\nAwesome.\n\nSomething I didn't know until my 5th playthrough (each playthrough took me about 5 min) was that you can press and hold the left Shift key to run faster (and fast forward all dialogue). It helps. Trust me. You move VERY slowly otherwise.\nBut as you're reading this, you know that now too! Good for you!\n\nAs you walk around the house and meet the people there, (your parents, your sister, the butler and the maid), you're given two objectives:\nFind a weapon (note that some of them require you to keep your coat on - this causes some suspicion towards you, but it's perfectly possible to pass the game anyway) and a piece of evidence.\nThere's plenty of different kinds of weapons - ranging from [spoiler]your fists[/spoiler] to [spoiler]rat poison which is one of the two most poetic weapons in the game, the other being a mirror shard[/spoiler] you can use to commit the murder.\n\nThe second thing you need is \"evidence\". Obviously evidence meant to frame someone else in the household - be it the butler, the maid or [spoiler]even suicide OH MY[/spoiler].\n\nOnce you have obtained both items, a short dinner sequence is being held. During it, you can further add suspicion onto yourself or the one you intend to frame. \n\nAfter dinner, [spoiler]COMMIT MURDER DO IT DO IT DO DO IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT[/spoiler]. Oh, you're done? Cool!\n\nGet the hell out.\n\nBe warned: you have a timer depending on what kind of weapon you used. The timer ranges from 3 seconds (lots of noise) to 20 seconds (no noise). \n\nOnce the body is found, you'll be interviewed. Tell the truth at all times - the investigator will say that your stories match up with the others in that case. \n\nIf you pulled it off - congratulations, you got away with murder! ...But at what cost?\n\nIf you didn't, you're thrown in jail to rot away for the remainders of your days...\n\n\n\nFor the cheap price I paid for both this and The Deed: Dynasty (sequelish), I'd highly recommend it even at full price. \nThere's plenty of replay value due to the different kinds of ways to commit murder, the indepth story and [spoiler]the damn scream at the end of the game is gonna haunt me until the day I die[/spoiler]!\n\n\n\nTL;DR\nIf you're a fan of detective games (or want a nice twist to it) - I suggest you buy this game!\nPress and hold Left Shift to move faster.", "timestamp_created": 1501882261, "timestamp_updated": 1501882390, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.571429", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33941177": {"recommendationid": "33941177", "author": {"steamid": "76561198259169384", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506014973}, "language": "schinese", "review": "interesting\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1501558202, "timestamp_updated": 1501558202, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33938189": {"recommendationid": "33938189", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144593917", "num_games_owned": 405, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 85, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501545430}, "language": "english", "review": "The game has an interesting premise (try to get away with murder), but it is far too short and simple.

I even had to consult my best friend by asking him regarding the game, 'cause I\u2019m quite curious \u2018bout it. In the end, I still bought it. I\u2019m really fond of Mystery & Thriller games, so this game really caught my attention.\n\nI completed the game, including the achievements (of course, with a guide) in less than three hours and 30 minutes. I\u2019m actually satisfied with the game, and I was having fun all throughout the gameplay.\n\nThe downside of the game for me is that whenever I press the F12 key, my whole game crashes. Nothing too much, but it's still bothering me.\n\nAnyway, if you\u2019re into Mystery & Thriller like me- I suggest buying this game, and let me tell you this; it\u2019s really worth it + it's cheap and affordable.", "timestamp_created": 1501497183, "timestamp_updated": 1501504218, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33918684": {"recommendationid": "33918684", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153305453", "num_games_owned": 154, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494649225}, "language": "english", "review": "A cool murder mystery game about getting away with murder.

hate my sister\" game\t[/h1]\nI was more conflicted wether to give this a positive or a negative review than who I should blame for murder.\n\nYour abusive father has decided to disinherit you from his Will in favour of your sister, whom you never forgave for eating your cookies. \nYou return filled with greed and anger for a happy family reunion, planning to murder your sister while getting away with it and the heritance.  \nFind a weapon, kill your sister, frame someone else and avoid suspicion.\n\n[h1] Thumbs Up\t[/h1]\nA fun and alternative way of using RPGmaker. \n\nLots of murder weapons, people to frame and every action have consequences. \nEvery playthrough takes roughly 10 minutes. \n\nLow price - often on sale. \nIncludes steam cards. \n\nYou can skip the intro, which is great since you highly repeat the game going for achievements.\n\n[h1] Thumbs Down [/h1]\nA great concept, however even if it appears you have all the possibilities of combining any weapon, evidence and frame; you don't. \nThe game is too fixed on a set of combinations to succeed, which applies to the achievements. Frustrating when you make combinations, that really should work. - Predetermined puzzle. \n\nThe game is really repititve, even if it's so short. \nGetting them feels like a burden, unless you only play a few playthroughs once in a while. \n\nIt seems you can only play in a very small window mode, in fullscreen the game doesn't expand, but just gets a dark border.\n\nEasy to click the wrong dialogue choice, while clicking next in a conversation. It should be able to click outside the dialoque box in order not for this to happen. \n\n[h1] Closing Comments\t[/h1]\nWhen that's said: I enjoyed my first few playthroughs a lot. For the price this game exceeded my expectations by far.\nRecommendable if you don't care much for the achievements and like me; torture myself by finishing over 2 days.", "timestamp_created": 1499824400, "timestamp_updated": 1499824537, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544186", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33403795": {"recommendationid": "33403795", "author": {"steamid": "76561198198565407", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499515307}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6e38\u620f\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e0d\u957f\uff0c\u4e00\u5468\u76ee\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u628a\u6240\u6709\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e92\u52a8\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u90fd\u70b9\u4e86\u5e76\u4ed4\u7ec6\u770b\u4e86\u5230\u7ed3\u675f\u4e0d\u8d85\u8fc715\u5206\u949f\uff0c\u5185\u5bb9\u6d41\u7a0b\u5927\u81f4\u4e3a\uff1a\n\n1\u3001\u665a\u996d\u524d\u6536\u96c6\u683d\u8d43\u8bc1\u636e\u548c\u51f6\u5668\uff08\u671f\u95f4\u53ef\u4ee5\u9009\u62e9\u8ddfnpc\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff09\n2\u3001\u665a\u996d\n3\u3001\u665a\u996d\u540e\u683d\u8d43\u8c0b\u6740\n4\u3001\u8b66\u65b9\u8c03\u67e5\u62d8\u6355\n\n\u867d\u7136\u8b66\u957f\u65ad\u6848\u4e0d\u80fd\u7b97\u5f88\u4e25\u8c28\uff0c\u4f46\u8981\u60f3\u683d\u8d43\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0d\u662f\u53ea\u9760\u683d\u8d43\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u548c\u51f6\u5668\u5c31\u591f\u4e86\uff0c\u8fd8\u8981\u5728\u4e4b\u524d\u4e0e\u4f17\u4eba\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u91cc\u6781\u529b\u5c06\u8bdd\u9898\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u8c08\u8bdd\u6c14\u6c1b\u5e26\u5411\u5bf9\u8981\u683d\u8d43\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e0d\u5229\u7684\u4e00\u9762\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u5176\u5acc\u7591\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5f88\u591a\u4f60\u4ee5\u4e3a\u65e0\u4f24\u5927\u96c5\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u9009\u62e9\u90fd\u4f1a\u88ab\u8b66\u957f\u95ee\u5230\uff0c\u5f92\u589e\u81ea\u8eab\u5acc\u7591\u3002\u4e00\u5468\u76ee\u73a9\u4e86\u4e2a\u81ea\u5df1\u88ab\u6293\u7684\u7ed3\u5c40\u4f53\u9a8c\u5f88\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u5c31\u82b1\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c0f\u65f6\u628a\u6240\u6709\u7684\u6210\u5c31\u90fd\u6253\u51fa\u6765\u4e86\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u4e0d\u7ba1\u6700\u540e\u662f\u54ea\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5c40\uff0c\u4e0d\u7ba1\u6700\u540e\u683d\u8d43\u4e86\u51f6\u624b\u662f\u8c01\uff0c\u6709\u6ca1\u6709\u7ee7\u627f\u5230\u9057\u4ea7\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u6545\u4e8b\u7684\u7537\u4e3b\u4eba\u516c\u90fd\u4f1a\u5728\u6bcf\u5929\u751f\u6d3b\u5728\u6050\u614c\u3001\u5fe7\u8651\u4e0e\u7a7a\u865a\u4e4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u8bf4\u867d\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6076\u4eba\u4e3b\u89d2\u7684\u8c0b\u6740\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5ba3\u626c\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u8fd8\u662f\u5f88\u6b63\u7684\uff1f\u6211\u4e00\u76f4\u60f3\u73a9\u51fa\u6765\u4e00\u4e2a\u8ddf\u7f8e\u4e3d\u7684\u5973\u4ec6\u5e78\u798f\u7684\u751f\u6d3b\u5728\u4e00\u8d77\u7684\u7ed3\u5c40\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u597d\u50cf\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709T -

Bundle or something. It's about $1 full price, and it goes on sale a lot. \n\nWhat is this game? It is a very simple murder simulator. You are a mean, nasty horrible person who heard his sister would be inheriting the family fortune, so you are coming to murder her. The game part of it comes in the fact that you can frame other people in the house for the murder, and you can choose other weapons. But you will murder your sister.\n\nA play through takes about 8 minutes, which encourages you to choose different weapons, and dialogue options to try to frame other people. There are three endings [spoiler] (a) don't get caught, but do inherit, (b) don't get caught, but don't inherit, and (c) get caught. [/spoiler] There are achievements for each person you can frame, and each weapon you can use. You could achievement farm the game with a guide in just an hour or two, or you could spend awhile trying to figure it out all by yourself. \n\nThe game is so short and so cheap , it is hard to be hate on the game. In fact, if you sell the card drops, it's probably less than $.50.  But there are very few likeable characters in the game (the butler and maid are ok, but otherwise every character is a terrible person), and I found it hard to care about the outcome. Really, I found achievement farming - how do I frame the maid so I get the achievement? Did that, now how do I frame the butler so I get the achievement? - to be the only reason to play the game.", "timestamp_created": 1498265208, "timestamp_updated": 1498267308, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32695368": {"recommendationid": "32695368", "author": {"steamid": "76561198307291027", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 238, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498183109}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Jogo com historia maneira, o jogo e bem feito pra um estilo rpg maker", "timestamp_created": 1498246953, "timestamp_updated": 1498246953, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32663029": {"recommendationid": "32663029", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040320105", "num_games_owned": 1084, "num_reviews": 231, "playtime_forever": 1149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501250742}, "language": "english", "review": "deed deed beep beep", "timestamp_created": 1498188755, "timestamp_updated": 1498188755, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32660440": {"recommendationid": "32660440", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088861146", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 136, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498164602}, "language": "english", "review": "Interesting short game, if you want to kill someone you have to be creative right?", "timestamp_created": 1498183346, "timestamp_updated": 1498183346, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481752", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32603556": {"recommendationid": "32603556", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043401618", "num_games_owned": 984, "num_reviews": 88, "playtime_forever": 204, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484433083}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] Who killed your sister?\t[/h1]\n\nYou did.\n\nThe decision has been made but the choice is yours.

The choices you make when conversing with the other characters affect the questioning you receive toward the end of the game.  \nYour choice of item to plant and weapon to use also affect the game, from framing another to the possibility of suicide or getting caught yourself.  \nNavigating around the house can be confusing at first.  I was not aware that the doors in a room below your character will open and he will step through them (going south) if you click on them.  Perhaps an arrow pointing downward above those doors would help first time players understand how to get into those rooms.\nThis game does have multiple endings.

While each single playthrough can be very short, the game does offer you different ways to achieve your goal, each with a different result, so the point is to have plenty of playthroughs, kind of like how it goes in Long Live The Queen, for example.\n\nThe gameplay itself is very simple. During the first couple of acts, your job would be to talk to people, trying to lead the conversations in the direction you want, while picking up two items out of the junk scattered around the house. One item should serve as a murder weapon, while the other's function is to be a false, planted evidence, meant to lead the police to suspect the victim you'd like to frame.\n\nAfter doing the deed itself, you'll be interviewed by a police detective, having to answer questions perhaps explain your behavior. Again, just like during the previous phase, the idea is to lead the detective to the conclusion you're interested in. As soon as you're done, you're given the outcome of the game.

Your goal is to commit a murder and get away with it, and the gameplay involves exploring a house and interacting with people, leading up to committing the deed.\n\nThere are a half-dozen people to converse with, including your intended victim. Conversation is varied, includes multiple choices, and may go in any number of directions, all of which may have an affect on the outcome of your playthrough.\n\nExploring the house, you are allowed to pick up two items to be used later. One can be used as the murder weapon, and one may be planted as evidence against someone else in the house.\n\nOnce you have selected two items, dinner is served, during which you must choose whether to speak and how to respond to the various discussions around the table.\n\nAfter dinner, you may again converse with people, and may choose from a number of places to stash your evidence. When you finally enter the room with your intended victim, you commit the murder, and have an amount of time, depending on the circumstances, to flee the scene before the death is discovered.\n\nThe investigator arrives, and questions you and everyone else present, and you must choose answers to his questions. At the end, the investigator announces his findings, giving some insight into how he came to his conclusions, and the ultimate decision of who he believes is the guilty party. A number of different endings are possible.\n\nEverything you say and do, from the start of the game to the finish has the potential to affect the outcome of the game. You can strive to simply cover your own guilt, or you can aim to indict a specific person in the house. The game has enormous replayability.\n\nThe visuals, especially the character portraits, are very high quality, and the sheer diversity of the various scenarios make this a flawless game, and your enjoyment of it will depend solely on whether you are interested in this type of gaming experience.

"language": "english", "review": "  This was a pretty unique game.  It's basically a murder mystery; only you are the murderer, and must create an alibi and plant incriminating evidence in order to get away with it.  There was a lot of fun in exerimenting throughout my different play-throughs: who will I pin this on?  How will I cover my tracks? Etc.  A single play-through can be done in about ten minutes, but all the different scenarios give it a nice replayability.\n  While the characters seemed to go out of their way to be unlikable (including the \"protaganist\"), I think that was the point.  It makes it easier to frame one of them, or if you are caught, that game over screen doesn't feel so bad when you know that \"our hero\" deserved it.  The overtones of the game are very dark, and you know that no one will get out with a happy ending.  Even victory has a bitterness to it.\n  I really only have two complaints, the first being that some of the dialogue choices would get pretty old after seeing them so many times.  Some characters only have a few ways to interact with them, and you figure out which ways are most benificial pretty fast.  My other complaint is in the sound department.  A variety of creepy ambient songs would go a long way, however, since this game is meant to be played multiple times, repetitive music would get old fast.\n  If you see this game on sale, or you just want a dark new experience, give The Deed a try.  I haven't tried the sequal The Deed: Dynasty, but this game sets a high bar for it.", "timestamp_created": 1492547392, "timestamp_updated": 1492547392, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny":

Short, but well thought game based mostly on storyline. Simple idea, talk to your relatives whilst looking around their rooms for the desired murder weapon or false pieces of evidence to later hide to falsely incriminate them.

W zwi\u0105zku z tym, m\u0142odzieniec postanawia wr\u00f3ci\u0107 do domu po latach nieobecno\u015bci i pouk\u0142ada\u0107 rzeczy tak jak powinny wygl\u0105da\u0107. Czyli pozby\u0107 si\u0119 siostry. I najlepiej zrzuci\u0107 win\u0119 na kogo\u015b innego.\n\nI na tym polega ca\u0142a zabawa. Nie jest sztuk\u0105 zabi\u0107 siostr\u0119. Zawsze si\u0119 j\u0105 zabija - jednak ca\u0142ym clou tytu\u0142u jest zabi\u0107 j\u0105 tak, by aresztowany zosta\u0142 inny z domownik\u00f3w. Kt\u00f3ry? To zale\u017cy tylko od tego, jak zostan\u0105 pod\u0142o\u017cone dowody i czym zostanie zabita dziedziczka. Przyk\u0142adowo: tylko lokaj ma klucze do szafki, w kt\u00f3rej schowana jest lina. Akurat zapomnia\u0142 jej zamkn\u0105\u0107... Co najlepsze: niekoniecznie musi zosta\u0107 w tym przypadku uznany winnym (!) - przecie\u017c m\u0142oda dama mog\u0142a pope\u0142ni\u0107 samob\u00f3jstwo. Sposob\u00f3w jest ca\u0142a masa. Dodatkowo, olbrzymi\u0105 rol\u0119 odgrywaj\u0105 same dialogi. Je\u017celi przy obiedzie powiesz, \u017ce lokaj zagl\u0105da w dekolt pani\u0105 przy stole, wtedy detektyw doda do siebie wszystkie fakty a wynik b\u0119dzie taki, jaki chcemy. Proste. 2+2=5. Bo mo\u017cemy. Naprawd\u0119 fajnie zaczyna by\u0107, gdy chce si\u0119 wrobi\u0107 kogo\u015b konkretnego. Bo wbrew pozorom - to wcale nie jest takie \u0142atwe.\n\nPodsumowuj\u0105c: \"The Deed\" stworzone jest do tego, by pr\u00f3bowa\u0107 r\u00f3\u017cnych wariant\u00f3w i szuka\u0107 r\u00f3\u017cnych zako\u0144cze\u0144.

Where most games made in this engine are rather uninteresting this one I have to admit is rather interesting.\n\nThe Deed follows on Arran Bruce. He is traveling to his home for his abusive fathers birthday, but the is also travelling there with a sinister plan, to murder his sister who is stealing his fathers business after he dies.\n\nThe Deed has a very simple premise, once you arrive you have three tasks. Find how you're gonna kill your sister, get the tools and evidence to get away with it and do The Deed.\n\nOnce you arrive you case the mansion getting to know about your sister to find weaknesses such you can use against her. It's all very interesting and it's fun casing around to look for clues and tools to kill your sister. \n\nNow for some of the bad things:\n\nThe graphics and soundtrack are all very bland. I know a lot of these games are built with pre made assets and I get that some games are great, but it's still it's all very bland.\n\nGrammar issues are present. Some words are misspelled and a few are mushed together example He is gonnakill her, stuff like that\n\nThe game is short. It takes 20 minutes to complete a single playthrough. But it has a lot of replay value. Multiple endings, multiple tools to kill your sister and you can blame people to get different endings. So you have at the very least 2 hours of content if you're planning on 100% the game.\n\nOverall The Deed surprised me on how good it was. It's not the best RPG maker game I've seen, but it's not bad and for the price it's quite fun, so get it on sale and have yourself a good time.\n\nFinal Rating:\n7/10\n\nPros:\n+ Interesting Concept\n+ Tons of replay value\n\nCons:\n- Bland graphics and sound effects", "timestamp_created": 1483043637, "timestamp_updated": 1483043637, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.646517", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28755789": {"recommendationid": "28755789", "author": {"steamid": "76561198286200379", "num_games_owned": 1585, "num_reviews": 1465, "playtime_forever": 98, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482942025}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Legalzin \nporem jogo e curto\nai e foda =)\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1482939766, "timestamp_updated": 1482939766, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28727319": {"recommendationid": "28727319", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122195524", "num_games_owned": 280, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479971785}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty simple game, but a great premise - get away with murder.

There are also two mustache characters (the dev should add a dating system so I can date George). \n\nSo since I enjoyed my time with the game, I decided to pick \"Yes.\" But this is a heavily flawed game. I feel many people could feel like even their $1 was wasted on this game, so please read the review if you might want to use your money on another game.\n\nThe concept behind the game is quite clever. Basically, the core of the gameplay revolves around making dialogue choices to uncover things about characters you can use to frame them, as well as choosing two items to use in your deed (generally, an 'evidence' item to plant, and a weapon, though you can choose two evidences or two weapons if you want).\n\nWith many conversation paths and all of the various combinations of evidence, rooms to plant evidence, and weapons to use, there are a lot of different ways the game seemingly can unfold. The main entertainment in the game is from playing repeatedly (the game is only 20 minutes long or so the first couple of times, and you can go as fast as 5 minutes on successive runs if you're not bothering to read all the text you already read before)\n\nBut this is where the first real problem with the game arises. You don't have to be perfect and make every \"right\" choice in order to frame someone, which is good, since there are tons of possible combinations of things to say and item usages. But what's very disappointing is that the solutions are so obvious and loose to success that you once you frame one person, you can pretty much follow the same 'formula' to frame anyone just as easily. There's almost no variety in the solutions, and everything is so obvious you'd have to purposely try to fail. I got an \"unsolved\" case my first game because I was just experimenting with the systems and choosing whatever, but after that I solved everyone on my first try without any effort.\n\nWhich items are connected to which character are so obvious you don't even need to talk to the characters to guess who it should be linked to. Your dad's shotgun is obviously linked to your dad. Your mom's diary is obviously about your mom. The descriptions of the items will usually just tell you almost directly who it will help frame.\n\nThe conversation paths are pretty much the same. Basically just make sure you talk to the person you're wanting to frame, and they'll just reveal something you can abuse as a motive and you're done. There are like one or two cases where you'll have to be careful about what you pick or actually talk to more than one person. But that's rare. You generally will have the option of being extremely rude to the person which will make them not talk to you, or doing literally anything else which will have them reveal a motive for you.\n\nAs for evidence dropping, it seemed to me as long as you dropped the evidence in a certain room, it would always point to the person you're wanting to frame. For every character in the game except one, I dropped the evidence in that room and it worked perfectly.\n\nBy the end of the game, I was starting to become convinced you could use any weapon you wanted and still frame whoever you wanted, too. The solutions seemed loose enough for that. I think you could even shoot her in the back with a shotgun and get it ruled a suicide.\n\nBut if you somehow don't realize the best solution right away, you could play through a few times and still be curious about how to frame someone. Plus, you have a lot of dialogue options to play with, so you can at least try a few different branches to see what they say.\n\nBut that's the biggest problem with the game -- the writing is abysmal. And I don't just mean the fact that it obviously was not proofread. But the author is definitely an amateur. Expect the story quality to be on par with something like the Jeff the Killer creepypasta.\n\nThere's a ton of awkwardness that arises from the story not being thought through well or proofread by another person, from the character knocking on the door to the house when he is expected and the butler is already escorting him, to being able to kill someone with a few whacks with a lightweight broomstick, without them causing any kind of struggle or reaction.\n\nMost of the story revolves around getting to know the characters and the aspects of them you use to frame them. And almost none of the murder motives make any sense. And the conversations all feel a bit rushed and unnatural. Everyone's motive seems to boil down to one character trait about them. \"He has a temper, so obviuosly he would kill someone.\" That kind of thing. Sometimes the \"character flaw\" you're exposing doesn't even make sense as a murder motive. \"He sexually harasses women\" is not a murder motive. \"She's a lesbian\" is not a murder motive.\n\nEven the main character who really is the killer -- I don't really understand why he wants to kill his sister. He hates his family and left them to start his own independent life, where he was apparently doing just fine. But now he decides he is going to go through the trouble of killing his own sister and framing someone for it so that he can get an inheritence... of a family name and property and business that he hates and wants to have no part in?\n\nBut by far the worst part about the writing is that the story attempts to cover a lot of serious themes -- mental illness, suicide, child abuse, sexual harassment, murder motive, etc. -- but the author clearly doesn't know much about these things and did not research any of these topics and handles them all completely inappropriately and unrealistically. These topics are portrayed with ignorance and shallowness. \n\nThe portrayal of a person suffering from mental illness amounts to pretty much how a small child would describe a \"crazy person.\" I realize that in the 1940s, mental health issues were not commonly understood at all, and doctors did indeed just diagnose \"insanity.\" It would make sense for the characters to talk about mental illness in an ignorant way -- but a character who is supposed to actually suffer from a mental illness should, well, actually be written like a person with a real mental health issue, even if it's not understood by the characters themselves. I feel like the author doesn't understand mental illness any more than a 1940s doctor would.\n\nPretty much every serious topic in the game is handled in the same manner. The game is clearly meant to be taken seriously, and it is story-driven, so the story needs to be well-researched, proofread, and developed, but it sorely fails in this area. If I hadn't been playing while talking to everyone on twitch and being able to talk and laugh about it, I may have been extremely frustrated with the poor writing. Instead, my friends and I have some new in-jokes based on some of the ridiculousness (poison turns you green, cunning pixie, etc.)\n\nIf you're wanting an interesting or intriguing story, or gameplay that requires a lot of tough decision making to solve (or rather, commit!) a murder, don't waste your dollar. Stay far away from this game. \n\nIf you're wanting to see a clever idea despite its clunky execution and don't mind that the solutions will be too obvious and the writing may as well contain a Sonic the Hedgehog self-insert OC, go ahead and try it. I had fun for 4 hours with it.\n\nAlthough the game was marred by severe game-wide flaws, I appreciated the idea behind the game and what it was going for, enjoyed the mustaches, had some laughs, and even felt a bit inspired by the concept of the whole thing. Maybe I'll try to make a game with a similar type of concept some day. All of that is worth a dollar. I got this as a gift for my birthday, though, and so I definitely can't complain.

Although this game takes place inside a house and runs a very short time, there are a great deal of weapons and things to choose from, such as but not limited to, a pool cue, a broom handle, a broken mirror, a shotgun and even a fencing sword! The variety in this game is phenominal and you can tell just by looking at it how much love and effort went into creating it - the atmosphere, the characters and everything.\n\nOverall, if I was to give this game a rating out of 10, 1 being terrible and 10 being absolutely groundbreaking - I'd give this game a 7/10 for being a good, simple, and creative way to spend 20 minutes and $0.60. If you have a love for murder mysteries and the like, I highly recommend this game. Seriously, it's so cheap and so much fun, you'd be a fool not to buy it.", "timestamp_created": 1476908973, "timestamp_updated": 1476908973, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26107954": {"recommendationid": "26107954", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108478530", "num_games_owned": 434, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476917225}, "language": "german", "review": "Schulnote 3", "timestamp_created": 1476830318, "timestamp_updated": 1476830318, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26085592": {"recommendationid": "26085592", "author": {"steamid": "76561198216846387", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 533, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483536954}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0442\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f!\n\n\u0412\u043e\u0442 \u0444\u0430\u043a\u0442\u044b \u043f\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043c\u0443 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0442\u043e\u043f:\n\n1) \u0422\u0430\u043c \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0446\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043a, \u0438 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043e\u043e\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043a\u0440\u0443\u0442\u043e, \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0435\u0440\u044c\u0435\u0437\u043d\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0432 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0445 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0446\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043a.\n2) \u0422\u044b \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0448\u044c \u0432\u044b\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0430\u043c, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0447\u0430\u0442\u044c, \u0442\u043e \u0436\u0435 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043a\u0440\u0443\u0442\u043e.\n3) \u041c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043e\u0441\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c, \u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0442\u044c, \u0438 \u0432\u0430\u0449\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0445\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043c.\n4) \u041c\u0430\u043d\u044c\u044f\u044f\u044f\u044f\u044f\u043a :D\n\n\u041c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0441 \u0432 \u0442\u043e\u043c \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0410\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f, \u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0431\u044b\u043b\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043d\u044f\u0442\u044c)\n\n\u0410 \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0440\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u044e :D", "timestamp_created": 1476706595, "timestamp_updated": 1476706595, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503106", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26060287": {"recommendationid": "26060287", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165362312", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476587483}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc77c\ub2e8 \uac00\uaca9\uc774 800\uc6d0\uc774\ub77c\uc11c \uc88b\uace0 \uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\ub3c4 \uad7f \uc815\ub9d0 \ud765\ubbf8\uc9c4\uc9c4\ud55c \uc774\uc57c\uae30\ub97c \ub4e4\uc744\uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc8fc\uc778\uacf5\uc774 \uc5ec\ub3d9\uc0dd\uc744 \uc0b4\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uac8c\uc784\uc774\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uadf8 \ubaa9\uc801\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubaa9\uc801\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc8fc\ud0dd\uc5d0\uc11c \ud55c \uac00\uc871\uc774 \ubc94\uc8c4\ub97c \uc77c\uc5b4\ub098\ub294\ub370 \uac70\uae30\uc5d0 \uc120\ud0dd\uad8c\uc774 \ub2ec\ub77c \uc5ec\ub7ec\uac00\uc9c0 \uc5d4\ub529\uc744 \ubcfc\uc218\uc788\ub2e4. 7/10\uc810", "timestamp_created": 1476582772, "timestamp_updated": 1476582772, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502912", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26032652": {"recommendationid": "26032652", "author": {"steamid": "76561198174771873", "num_games_owned": 229, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476720455}, "language": "english", "review": "1.)

It is split into four main parts after the intro - first, you explore the house, talk to whomever you wish to (planting seeds for pt.3),  find an item to plant as evidence and an item to use as the murder weapon. Part 2 is Dinner, where more conversation is made and more seeds can be planted for part three (good or bad). This is followed by you planting the evidence item, committing the murder and alibi-ing youself by being somewhere else VERY quickly, before the final part in which you are interrogated by the polis. The prep & planning comes in as you decide who you want to frame (you can also get a suicide verdict) and how you want to frame them. You also have to talk about the right things during conversations if you want to really nail that coffin lid down! When you are questioned, you need to remember what you've said and where you've been/were, or it could all come unstuck for you. \n\nWhat I liked about this game was the replayability of it - due to the multiple endings (7 'who'/10 'how') and the brevity of it. There's a fair amount of depth for such a short game, although some of it does become quite repetitive and you can hit the wrong answers by flicking too fast through the dialogue.

This game did none of those things! \n\nWhile you could argue that it sports the same graphics as every RPG maker game (indeed it does) I've always thought that art style was ok when working in a dark setting.\n\nIt does have some humor but it's not random humor or memes like in a lot of other similar games. The humor comes from the laughable dialogue choices and actions that, if used correctly, can be used to your benefit. That's right, you can be a total dick and still win the game if you play your cards right.\n\nInstead of trying to shoe horn in combat or inventory management it opts to nearly completly remove those features to be a game that's a lot less like a typical RPG and more like an adventure game with more than one ending. Each play through is about 30 minutes max which really encourages you to play through the game multiple times to experiment with different outcomes. This is the only game that I have put forth the effort to get all the acheivements and I had fun getting every single one. That rarely happens with me.\n\nOVERALL: Don't be mislead by the RPG Maker tag. If that style of RPG is what you're looking for, this is the wrong place to be.

I wasn't expecting much for a game made in RPG Maker and priced at 49p but I was absolutely shocked by what came out of it.\n\nThe plot of The Deed is that you play a man that hates his family and decides to kill his sister. Your challenge is to carry out this deed by finding weapons around the house and deciding what might be the most appropriate and then you need to find a piece of evidence that might link to the weapon that you use. One thing that I don't like about this game is that it doesn't exactly explain why the d*ckhead of a main character is actually carrying out this deed, and even on his sister, the father I fealt like would have been a more appropriate character to kill as the father is a completely hateable character. What I will praise the game for is the way it's paced and how it punishes you. If you try and rush throught he game as quick as possilbe, choose the first weapon you see and the first evidence you see, it's gonna make sure you get the bad ending. However, if you take your time to converse with the people in the house, look around in the rooms, carefully planning out what you're going to do, I can guarantee you that The Deed will be carried out with success. And yes, this game has 4 different endings (although 1 of them can have around 8 variations but these variations are quite minor.)\n\nThere isn't that much to say about the graphics, it's basically the typical sort of graphics you would expect from an RPG Maker game, bare bones but relatively decent but one thing that I'd like to bring up are the face models on the characters. Some of them sort of look a bit weird and out of place, primarily the main character.\n\nWhen there isn't much to the game, there isn't really much to talk about, is it good, yes but only for the price. Is it worth it for maybe \u00a32 at a push, yes. \u00a35? definately not.\n\nPros\n+ Rewards you for taking your time\n+ You need to carefully plan everything out\n+ Decent graphics\n+ You need to have attention to detail\n\nCons\n- Short\n- Some weird character art\n- A slightly nonsensical plot\n\nFinal verdict: 6/10\n\nMy Steam Curator group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews", "timestamp_created": 1469138710, "timestamp_updated": 1469138784, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.595165", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24435677": {"recommendationid": "24435677", "author": {"steamid": "76561198296646684", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469070567}, "language": "english", "review": "And the brother of the year award goes to...not the main character.", "timestamp_created": 1469070832, "timestamp_updated": 1476501666, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.473373", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24422995": {"recommendationid": "24422995", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991657927", "num_games_owned": 900, "num_reviews": 270, "playtime_forever": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469012651}, "language": "english", "review": "A lot less sinister than it actually sounds; this is THE most original use of RPGMaker I have seen to date. Considering the TINY price (and the fact you can get it with it's sequel for pretty much nothing) It's well worth messing about with even if only to illustrate that you don't have to follow the same tired old formulas to make an enjoyable game. Yes, it's very short no matter how you go about trying to accomplish \"the deed\", but it's also very interesting in that there are so many different approaches and that the real story is an internal one that you have to work out for yourself so that this fosters a rare feeling of true roleplay. When I say \"short\" I mean that a typical playthrough can take about 15 minutes. But that is how it is made to be and the achievements mean that several playthroughs will be both necessary and desirable. A pity that more of the larger dev teams don't factor such fine originality into their offerings and I look forward to giving both this and it's sequel more of my time.

Arran ist das schwarze Schaf der Familie und soll deswegen nach dem Tod der Eltern dabei zusehen, wie deren Verm\u00f6gen an seine ungeliebte Schwester \u00fcbergeht. Diese zu t\u00f6ten ist daher sein Plan - und die Aufgabe des Spielers. \n\nJedoch soll dies m\u00f6glichst nicht auf Arran zur\u00fcck zu f\u00fchren sein, weshalb zun\u00e4chst ein Plan geschmiedet werden muss. Im ganzen Haus finden sich potenzielle Mordwaffen und Beweisst\u00fccke, die, richtig genutzt oder platziert, \u00fcber das Ende der Trag\u00f6die entscheiden, die Dialoge sind nicht weniger relevant. Je nach Vorgehen, eigenen Aussagen und Verhalten im Verh\u00f6r kann der Plan aufgehen oder scheitern.\n\nMehr als 20 Minuten Unterhaltung sind beim einmaligen Durchspielen von The Deed zwar nicht zu erwarten, jedoch bietet das Adventure durch die verschiedenen M\u00f6glichkeiten, Verd\u00e4chtigen, Dialogoptionen und Errungenschaften einen hohen Wiederspielwert.

This time around you're no hero. You play an entitled brat, and almost everyone you interact with during the game is as obnoxious as you are. It's a murder simulator - your only choices are how you will murder your sister and who you will try to frame. I found it a very uncomfortable game to play, since what you are forced to do is so vile, and every conversation is awkward.

Son, Arran, soon to be disinherited (usurped by his sister) with murder on his mind.  Father, Malcolm, violent tempered, oppressive, abusive.  Mother, Gloria, in deep and utter denial of the dysfunctional Bruce family.  Sister, Jennifer, violent, cruel, insane and about to die.  Dunshiel House staff: one butler and one maid/cook.   \nA classic \"who-dun-it\" from the murder's point of view.   \n\nStoryline:  Estranged Arran Bruce returns home for his father's 50th birthday with the sole purpose to murder his sister, Jennifer.  Motive: Money, of course.  The father, Malcolm, is about to disinherit him in favor of his sister.  The question is: How to commit murder and still walk away a free man.  10 murder weapons, and 5 other people who can take the blame, assuming one does not get caught.  Of course, there is always the \"mysterious\" intruder too. (Lizzie Borden will have good company if one manages that.)\n\nOne ending and multiple ways to get there.  \n\nBasic gameplay:\nStart the evening by arriving at Dunshiel House and briefly chat with the maid.  (Remember everything one says to anyone, now and later, can and will be used against them.)  Keep the coat or give it to the maid.  Talk to the family or ignore them.  Talk to the servants or ignore them too.  Relive some memories or not.  Choose the weapon, find the evidence then go to dinner.  Make a scene, be cordial, make pointed observations.  All in preparation for the murderous deed.   \n\nAfter dinner plant the evidence then commit murder.  \nNote: Game mechanics only allows for one murder weapon plus bare hands and one piece of incriminating evidence to be planted somewhere in the house.  However, if the player choses bare hands the \"murder\" weapon will still be on their person.  Nor does evidence have to be planted which also will be found on their person when the Inspector arrives.\n\nDuring the interview, there is a physical search, so if there is a weapon or evidence still on their person there had better be a very good explanation.  After the interview the verdict is handed down, and the player discovers if they got away with murder or not.\n\nTwo brief scenerios from my own gameplay:\nMy favorite scenerio was having both a murder weapon (the fencing sword) and evidence (the tawse) on my person when the interview began and still framing the father for murder.  (I framed the father often and usually inherited everything only for Arran to somehow develope a huge conscious which made everything bleak and despairing.)  (Well murder is wrong and framing someone else even more so, so I guess the developers did not want the player to forget that.)\n\nMy best and most apropos scenerio was the sister's \"suicide\" with a mirror shard.  Reason: unrequited love for the maid.  That was a bit tricky since if done incorrectly the unassuming maid was framed. \n\nHas all the makings of the board game Clue ,,, only in reverse.   A clever game with a clever premise and multiple ways to get away with murder.

You are a disowned son of a wealthy family and you take the opportunity of your arriving to your father's 50th birthday in order to be allowed into the mansion again. As you can tell right off the bat this is a rather grim and serious title with pretty much no humor to be found. The atmosphere of this 1945 era mansion is pretty eerie but in this case you are the monster which is a cool twist to most games. You are given various dialogue choices throughout the game leaving it up to you whether to be a jerk or a seemingly calm, well-mannered person. Be careful though, your choices do have consequences and remember that you are here to pull off a murder so even being too nice is suspicious. Upon entering the house you are able to explore your surroundings and chat with its inhabitants in order to better understand the situation of the house and the tensions between people.\n\nExploring the mansion you will find lots of objects that can be potentially used to murder your sister with like shotguns, glass shards and rope as well as potential evidence like panties or diaries. This is where one of the game's more annoying aspects come into play. Whatever you do don't collect two items as that will automatically teleport you to dinner even if you still need people to talk to or are not ready. This game is separated into three phases, first is the exploration phase afterwards it is the planting evidence and finally the investigation phase. Most of your time will be spent in the exploration phase as that is where you need to figure out the best methods of murder with a two item limit as well as meeting everyone in the house. Everything you do in this phase will have an effect later on even the seemingly meaningless things like what rooms you entered and who you talked to. There is just so much chances to manipulate the situation that is about to occur that you can't help but thinking about all the little flaws that could potentially come back to haunt you, making it a pretty intense and thoughtful experience.\n\nThe second phase is by far the shortest and has you planting your chosen evidence somewhere in the mansion and then murdering your sister afterwards. The final phase has a very observant detective observe the crime scene and you must outsmart him during his interview session with you. All three of these phases combined should take you about 10 to 20 minutes to complete depending on how thoroughly you think things through making this a very short game. The replayability is very high however, since the possibilities of how to evade this murder and gain your inheritance are quite numerous. After completing the game you just can't help but wonder what would have happened if you did things differently or framed someone else that before you know it you are scheming up another plan and restarting the game. It's not randomly generated so it does have a limit to its replayablity since nothing will change if you pick the same options but where the preset items are placed lends to making this house feel lived in and real so random generation may have done more harm than good.\n\nDespite this being a mansion it is really small in game featuring nothing more than a basement and a second story that can very quickly be explored. One small nitpick I have is how far away you are from the doors when entering though that is such a minor detail that you'll stop noticing it in no time. One not so small nitpick is that this game is heavily letter-boxed and most of your screen will be nothing but black while the game itself only takes up a small space in the middle. Some option to stretch to full screen would have been appreciated. Moving on from the technical side of things, your family are all terrible people which is unfortunate since it would have been rather interesting having to murder someone that did you no harm, making you feel like more of a monster. There is no blood or anything of the sort here, when you murder her it just goes to a black screen and a short scream plays out. This is a pretty dark game no doubt and one that really gets you thinking pretty hard on the best way to murder someone which is pretty creepy in itself actually. The Deed was definitely a unique and memorable experience that I'm glad I stumbled upon and at a price point of less than a dollar it is one game I'd recommend to anyone that has the slightest

The game has a really old and musky feel to it, which is great for this particular game. It seems to pull off the atmoshpere that it tries to create, and I really did get involved in the game/\n\nSecondly, there are numerous dialogues in which you choose what to speak, and they seem to offer great choice honestly. I, of course, could not help but make lewd comments at the maid. Which was a lot of fun. The dialogue with the police guy was extremely well done\n\nThirdly, the gameplay itself is entertaining. The characters may look a bit blocky and walk funnily. But overall, with all the various items and murder weapons, the game was great.\n\nThe only con that I can think about is that if I finish the game, and succeed in murdering the protagnist's sister, I probably would not play this game.

It's a novel premise with a lot of potential and a good atmosphere brought by the writing and the graphics (which are simple, but have a very well-realized aesthetic). The characterization is solid, and the tone is dark as it should be.\n\nIt's fun to try the different ways to get away with \"the deed\", and the game uses the choice it gives you in a good way. It's extremely short the first time, but you can try different things for a much longer time until getting bored.

It is a game constructed with the RPG maker and it is downright gorgeous. You are a jung man visiting his family in their estate for your father's birthday. Your sisters mental state has declined to a point where you just want to put her out of her misery. You arrive at the estate with just this simple tought of killing her.\nThis is where the plot starts and you are in control of how to go about your business of doing the deed. There is a vast amount of options you have in reaching your goal with lots of murder weapons and blame going around, including the butler, the house maid, your parents or yourself.

The story revolves around Arran Bruce who recently discovers that his abusive father removed him from his Will in favour of his cruel sister to inherit the family belongins. Furious about this, he decides to eliminate his sister in order to restore his own, rightful, inheritance. \n\nThe gameplay is all about getting away with the murder of Arran\u2019s sister and trying to blame someone else for it. The player has the choice of who to talk to, what topics to discuss in conversations, which evidence to plant, the method of murder and how to handle the interview when interrogated at the end. Consequently, the paths chosen influence the final outcome (e.g. the ending), and that is all there is to its very minimal gameplay. Generally, a single playthrough takes roughly about 20-30 minutes at normal pace with all rooms fully explored and every possible conversation exhausted. In other words, it is all about solving the one single puzzle: getting away with murder. As a result, the game has a replayability value until the player discovers all the possible methods of committing the crime (while being undetected and without people being suspicious) and various endings. Likewise, this is good news for any achievement hunters who want to achieve 100% completion as it is very easy to accomplish it.\n\nAdmittedly, the writing is nothing terrific, and most of it is forgettable anyway, but it is enough to provide context for the puzzle. The very few set-pieces such as the flashblacks are a nice touch since they provide some backstory, aside from simply talking with other people, but that is as deep as the story can get, which is not a lot. Then again, the game\u2019s length is extremely short after all, therefore there is hardly time to expand the story. Ultimately, The Deed is clearly not a purely story-driven game. As mentioned previously, it is all about solving the one puzzle.\n\nThe visuals are on par with what anyone should expect from a RPG Maker game. Thankfully, the game does not bluntly rely on stock assets which makes it stand out amongst the majority of half-hearted RPG Maker games out there, but as a whole it is clearly not as stunning as something like To The Moon, as far as RPG Maker games are concerned. It does a somewhat effective use of the dark tone and browny colour pallet to create at least a creepy atmosphere, even if there is nothing remotely creepy or even scary about it. Furthermore, there is no voice acting (as per usual with most RPG Maker games) and the sound effects used are minimal and rather uninspiring. The soundtrack is unmemorable, much like the writing, but does an adequate job in setting up the mood.\n\nIn conclusion, The Deed has a simple but interestingly fun little concept despite everything about it being fundamentally way too basic. The game has clear shortcomings which could have been easily avoided in the first place. For instance, the length could have been greatly improved through the use of more elaborate ways of committing the crime and the atmosphere could have also been enhanced by using eerier sound effects. Evidently, there has been a missed opportunity on expending the story due to both the writing and length letting it down. However, considering the price tag, all of these shortcomings are tolerable in this case since anyone can easily purchase the game for \u201cfree\u201d by selling any marketable items in their Steam inventory, thus eliminating any notion of a buyer\u2019s remorse. In actual fact, the game should have been (properly) free in the first place. For a fun fact, I bought the game for 7p during a sale by selling a Steam emoticon.\n\nIf you fancy the concept at least and can lower your expectations, I recommend giving The Deed a shot as it can be fun figuring out a way without being caught, but also mainly because of its price tag. Possibly the shortest, yet forgettable, fun you will ever have in a game.", "timestamp_created": 1454711999, "timestamp_updated": 1454719008, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.667206", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20980423": {"recommendationid": "20980423", "author": {"steamid": "76561198149815672", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 238, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454711360}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Da asco el Juego... es malisimo y encima esta en un idioma horrible", "timestamp_created": 1454711696, "timestamp_updated": 1454711696, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.301773", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20978648": {"recommendationid": "20978648", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094321628", "num_games_owned": 929, "num_reviews": 869, "playtime_forever": 239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465365160}, "language": "english", "review": "The screen in very very littel", "timestamp_created": 1454706934, "timestamp_updated": 1454706934, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.368591", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20978435": {"recommendationid": "20978435", "author": {"steamid": "76561198164579093", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 74, "playtime_forever": 217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454801761}, "language": "english", "review": "it's ok", "timestamp_created": 1454706271, "timestamp_updated": 1454706271, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.443413", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20976980": {"recommendationid": "20976980", "author": {"steamid": "76561198280303535", "num_games_owned": 241, "num_reviews": 130, "playtime_forever": 302, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454723276}, "language": "english", "review": "Good Game!", "timestamp_created": 1454702367, "timestamp_updated": 1454702367, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.373819", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20975095": {"recommendationid": "20975095", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020308236", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 80, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458473995}, "language": "english", "review": "Managed 5 different outcomes so far - it's a nice, quick play each time.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1454697113, "timestamp_updated": 1454697113, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499991", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20964161": {"recommendationid": "20964161", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114161521", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 136, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515194146}, "language": "turkish", "review": "\u00c7ok ucuz bir fiyata al\u0131p k\u0131sa bir s\u00fcre i\u00e7inde oynay\u0131p tamamlad\u0131m. \u00d6ncelikle oyun s\u0131k\u0131c\u0131 de\u011fil, oynamas\u0131 gayet keyifli.

Example, the shotgun is your father's. Then there are non-weapons which belong to others too and have their own context. You can only pick two, which when chosen immediately goes to the Dinner section.\n\nThe game has four stages: 1:Pre-Dinner Item Collecting, 2:Dinner, 3:Planting Evidence if you want, and killing sister 4: Post-Mortem interview.\n\nThroughout most stages all taking place in most of the same place you interact and this impacts your game. If you don't tell your father Happy Birthday it's not a huge problem but it is suspicious. Each conversation or lack of has some minor or major impact later. In the interview after you plant evidence if you want, and kill your sister [via weapon or hands] you are interviewed by police.

You play a guy who comes from a rich family and you have major problems with your abusive dad, and your psychotic ( and also abusive ) sister. Your dad cuts you out of the will, so on his fiftieth birthday, you return home to see him and celebrate. Only its a ruse. Since he cut you out, your sister is the one inheriting everything. So your goal in this game is to kill her, and not get caught. Whether you blame it on someone else, make it look like a suicide, or get caught on purpose either for the achievement or just for giggles, is entirely up to you. The actual game is only about 10 minutes long but its worth AT LEAST 3 play throughs for someone who will get bored of it quickly, and close to 3-4 hours for someone who wants to experience everything in it. The only real fault I see in this game is that you cant really get a good ending. It's a story where you're FORCED to kill your sister ( theres talk that you can have her put into an asylum, but I havent done this or seen anyone else do it. just heard you can so i wana mention that ) and no matter which of the endings you get and no matter who you frame your character always ends up sad and miserable. Wouldve liked one additional ending that was really hard to get but you end up happy because of it. He finally got revenge on his abusive sister. And if you frame the dad, He got revenge on him too, AND your mom who let the abuse happen for years, as she dies alone now. Not to mention the fortune and mansion he inherits. But thats really the only negative. For its $0.99 price tag, ( it's $0.66 on sale right now ) This is a damn good game. 8.5/10.", "timestamp_created": 1453864181, "timestamp_updated": 1453871063, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5,

On the night of his father's birthday party, Arran pays a visit to his parents' manor with the mission to kill his heiress sister and inherit the family fortune.\n\nThe player is given access to the entire mansion with the ability to interact with all NPCs and most objects, with the night progressing through four phases: one to find murder weapons/false evidence/NPCs, a second to eat a birthday dinner with your family, a third to plan and carry out the murder, and a last to answer a detective's questions about your actions and \"what you saw\". These gameplay elements come together to present a game bearing features of puzzle, social simulation, and exploratory gameplay, all fleshed out and elusive, encouraging the player to experiment with what they say, where they look, and so on. I will say, though, that I wish the game's achievements showed more ingenuity (and less interface spoilers).\n\n[i]The Deed[/i] also shows commendable ambition in its characters, fairly well-developed for a cheap quasi-whodunit cast. More unique than the standard flat caricatures common to the genre, these characters offer concise, vibrant backstories, as well as hidden vulnerabilities to exploit when attempting to relieve your character of culpability. As a character-focused narrative, the game's story benefits greatly from this depth. [i]The Deed[/i] is distinguished from other games of its ilk in this regard especially. Unfortunately, this ambition is not without its downfalls; the game's many attempts to be subversive can be hit or miss, and the ones that fall flat, fall flat [i]hard[/i]. One prominent example: literally every victorious ending. [spoiler]No matter what the player does, Arran will be haunted by nightmares and feelings of regret for the rest of his life[/spoiler]. Topical? Deep? Maybe. Unsatisfying and pretentious? Definitely.\n\nAll in all, [i]The Deed[/i] pushed the limits of the murder mystery formula, and left a flawed but satisfying taste in my mouth post-completion.

Ostensibly drawn home to celebrate your father's 50th birthday, in actuality you return to settle a score with your family. It would seem that your domineering father has disinherited you, giving all to your mentally unbalanced sister. To set things right, you have decided for  an \"intervention\" to remove your sister from this dysfunctional community, and regain your rightful place as legal heir. All that remains is to set up someone to take the blame for your sister's death. Will your nefarious scheme succeed? If so, will it be the maid, the butler, your mother or your father who spend the rest of their days behind bars? Or will it be a \"suicide\"? \n\nSo far, alas, I have failed to lay firm suspicion upon anyone else but myself!\n\nThe game relies on fairly simple graphics to map out the ground floor, cellar and upstairs of a well-to-do, but by no means extravagant, home in interbellum England. The music and sound effects are artful, evoking at time a nostalgic feeling akin to a BBC-funded detective series, and at other times a discordant melancholy feeling. The maid's scream upon finding the body, and the earlier dinner bell, are used to signal the transition from one set of scenes to the next. \n\nThe mechanics of the murder are simple, yet elegant. Upon arriving at the house, you interact with its five denizens by selecting from branching text responses. While short, these subtly reveal the tension within the family, as well as between the servants. Add to this the various vignettes in each room which conjure up the protaganist's wretched past, and collectively the player understands that the son's motive for murder is for more than just pecuniary gain. \n\nHow is his twisted vengence enacted? Before dinner, you as the son can search the rooms and acquire one clue and one murder weapon (Hint: the clue should be placed before dinner so as to lead suspicion onto one of the five denizens). While it is possible to acquire two clues or two murder weapons, the second clue or murder weapon cannot be discarded, which doesn't look good when the inspector arrives. While I suspect this inability to discard the second clue or murder weapon is an intentional design feature, it prevents more elaborate plots such as love triangles. However, it probably also makes the story branching more manageable, and has the added bonus of disciplining those of us with packrat tendencies in our gaming.\n\nThe game benefits from repeated playthroughs. In this way, it is similar to NEO Scavanger in that repeated failed play-throughs reveal the possibilities for success through a process of elimination.\n\nIf you are somewhat devious, you will love this game.Perfect for a 30 minute break.", "timestamp_created": 1450107412, "timestamp_updated": 1450108698, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513514", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19683413": {"recommendationid": "19683413", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047350663", "num_games_owned": 1015, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452220314}, "language": "english", "review": "The Deed is a short game with an interesting premise. \nThere isn't any variance in the story (no random elements), but there are \"branching\" paths to conviction in framing others murders, allowing for decent replayability. \nI enjoyed the game because of its somewhat novel idea, but it is incredibley short and some mechanics are lacking. \nBuy it if its cheap (which it seems to be).", "timestamp_created": 1450041542, "timestamp_updated": 1450041542, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499991", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19661256": {"recommendationid": "19661256", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042211492", "num_games_owned": 453, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449956194}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Muito bom o jogo. \n\nConsiste em procurar e utilizar objetos em uma mans\u00e3o para assassinar uma pessoa e incriminar outra (que n\u00e3o voc\u00ea).\n\nO jogo \u00e9 extremamente simples e r\u00e1pido, por\u00e9m, pelo pre\u00e7o vale muito a pena!\n\nPrecisa de uma sequ\u00eancia!", "timestamp_created": 1449956366, "timestamp_updated": 1449956366, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.630106", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19660489": {"recommendationid": "19660489", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089468578", "num_games_owned": 221, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 330, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451910896}, "language": "italian", "review": "The Deed \u00e8 un gioco carino, inquietante e psicologico.\nIl gioco dura poco, ma \u00e8 compensato dal suo prezzo e dalla sua grande rigiocabilit\u00e0, a causa sia dalla curiosit\u00e0 sia dai finali e sia dagli archivement.\n\nAlla fine non \u00e8 un giocone,  ma \u00e8 bello.\n\nPs: vi consiglio di prenderlo specialmente quando \u00e8 in saldo", "timestamp_created": 1449954121, "timestamp_updated": 1449954121, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19659736": {"recommendationid": "19659736", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138836202", "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 147, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517513817}, "language": "english", "review": "its okay. it has some replay value (not too much) not very long. but achievements dont unlock. i used the rope to kill her but didnt get that achievement. i would probably have played it A LOT more for the achievements.", "timestamp_created": 1449951693, "timestamp_updated": 1449951693, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499991", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19623545": {"recommendationid": "19623545", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027065244", "num_games_owned": 218, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449807791}, "language": "english", "review": "It's cute and to the point.

Picture a story in your head of how she dies using the items lying around the house, and put it into action. That is defiantly the strongest part of this game, everything is incredibly logical and the game throws no off the wall curve balls at you. Your plan is not going to be sabotaged by some BS variable that seemed irrelevant, but instead by your own clumsiness, or the things you said. Due to the games incredibly short length, getting all of the endings is a very doable task and gives you plenty of room to play around. \n\nThat said the game does have some faults.

Like saying you kept your coat on to stay warm, despite it being drenched by the rain. Or accusing him of asking you a leading question about your behavior, yet when he asks a leading question about your father immediately you play along with it. It makes it kind of obvious that he follows a point system to reach his verdict.\n\nWhile the characters feel realistic for the most part, I did feel the sister's dialog was a little cartoony. I know she has a disorder, but she really showed no redeemable qualities and did not really have a reason to hate you as much as she did.\n\nI also felt the flashbacks were a wasted opportunity, they are kind of interesting at first, but only tell you things you already know.\n\nDespite the few nitpicks I had with the game, I did not regret playing this. The aesthetic reminded me of Clock Tower, and the fact that everything you say and do has consequences is truly impressive, and I will keep an eye peeled on this developer if they should ever construct bigger projects. \n\nAlso the game costs as much as a bag of potato chips, so there really is no excuse not to try it.\n", "timestamp_created": 1448691484, "timestamp_updated": 1448691484, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495115", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19325052": {"recommendationid": "19325052", "author": {"steamid": "76561198206559309", "num_games_owned": 824, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 218, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452957951}, "language": "english", "review": "Very short game, with max replayability.

A combination of the freedom of assassination methods given in Hitman, with game mechanics allowing you to frame other suspects and create false alibis.\n\nThe Deed may not match this lofty fantasy game in my head, but it delivers a satisfying but short experiance.\n\nYou play as the murderer and must murder your sister, whilst framing the other people in the house or making it look like suicide. To do this you have to to interact with the characters to learn new opportunities and plant 'evidence' around the house and choose an appropriate murder weapon.\n\nYou'll be suprised on the details the game picks up on during your first few playthroughs. For example I used a knife in the kitchen as the murder weapon, but I talked to the maid in the kitchen, so the police investigator picked up on that deducing I could've potentially taken the knife. After doing the same and not talking to the maid, the police investigator was oblivious to it, only suspecting the maid. \n\nOnce you've played through it a few times and learnt how to manipulate the events of the game, framing your target and minimising suspicion is simple and satisfying.\n\nSome flaws include repeated dialogue getting tedious during your multiple playthroughs.\n", "timestamp_created": 1448449292, "timestamp_updated": 1448449292, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558367", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19263197": {"recommendationid": "19263197", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031089250", "num_games_owned": 1271, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 52, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448457727}, "language": "english", "review": "*NON SPOILER REVIEW*\nThe Deed is a great example of a simple but fun game, no deep epic storyline with twisting conflicting backstory or characters you're forced to give a damn about. The game sets itself up with the bare essentials and it is up to you, the player, to explore further into the game's story. Now what makes this game stand out is how this is optional and how it feels much like a board game such as Cluedo, or even a choose-your-own-adventure book. You have the characters, the premise, the 'clues' and methods. There's multiple ways to approach each event that takes place throughout the day.\n\nWith this, The Deed indeed gives off a natural fruition of replayability and it's unlikely you will succeed in committing the crime the first couple of tries. You should note who you talk to, when you do and for what reason - but be careful - revealing the truth of why you did to any NPCs can alter your chances of being caught or not as they may seem suspicious of your behaviour. Given the natural conflict you have with your father, even being kind can give your purpose away. It truly, truly feels like your choices have actual, permanent changes to both the NPCs and environment.\n\nIt's amazing how a game less than $1 can offer so much fun, replayability and investment from an immersive and interesting point of view and do so much right more than AAA modurn gaemz (especially from the overrated joke that is Telltale Games and more recently Life is Strange). This game proves you do not need top-tier voice acting, explosions, quest markers and a mini-map to spoon-feed the player into being artificially interested in the game's world.\n\nAs I said, this brings me back to the days of board games and choose-your-own-adventure, not many video games can do that for me nowadays so it's refreshing to see one that does it - and does it right - for a criminally underpriced price. I strongly recommend this game to players who love choice and freedom, board games, RPGs and detective stories. I understand the simplicity in nature, the questionable 2D art style and lack of dudebro shooting will put alot of people off, but I feel given the price of the game it doesn't matter if you don't even like the game as you'll probably just refund it anyway.\n\nA couple of things I want improved however, is perhaps a real-time on-screen inventory system as opposed to the default JRPG-esque inventory menu, more original sound effects to boot and an in-game clock that you can view anytime. Perhaps with the grandfather clock.

Why? Was it worth it at the end?\n\nThere are multiple ways in killing your sister, and a couple of people you can frame. The way you plant false evidence, the weapons you choose, and where you were. Honestly however, the game is quite short, with it only lasting around 10-15 minutes. But with the variety of ways to kill your sister and who to frame, I would say you would be able to squeeze out at most 2 hours. There is minimal dialogue because of this, so you don't really know much about the character and his \"life away from his family\" other than that they are dysfunctional and your sister is \"mentally insane\" (but for it's length it's a lot) which makes it straightfoward; find someone to frame, find an evidence to plant, find a weapon to use to murder, and run to a place.\n\nHowever! The dialogue is actually quite an interesting feature in the game. What I mean is, depending on how you plan to interact with your family, the butler, and the maid, may or may not bite your butt back during the inspection, which can consequently make you suspicious. Most games, tend to overlook this, which would of made the game more unique to you.\n\nPros:\nInteresting genre of a game\nAtmosphere is fitting and nice\nMany ways of doing \"The Deed\" resulting in multiple runs\nDialogue affects outcome\nIt reflects on you at the end, was it worth the inheritance?\n\nCons:\nI have not much to say, other than it being short and maybe a lack of voice acting.\n\nAll in all, the game is an interesting experience, and for a buck for 2 hours is highly worth it.\n\nEdit: Added a gameplay video below\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=562554689", "timestamp_created": 1448438968, "timestamp_updated": 1448503378, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487085", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19262277": {"recommendationid": "19262277", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088460082", "num_games_owned": 217, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 291, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487540065}, "language": "english", "review": "While short, The Deed presents multiple possibilites all with interesting results.

Your sister's murder. It is played as a sort of RPG from a top-down view in which you are given freedom to explore the large house and collect items. However, in the effort of keeping realistic, you are only allowed to pick up two things, and only the sort of items that a person would actually be able to conceal.\n\nIt is a unique scheme that makes for a fun game. Unfortunately, after several playthroughs, it turns out that it's actually pretty easy to get away with murder. You'll discover what types of objects you need to combine to succeed.\n\nFor example, not quite a spoiler but if you want a hint: [spoiler]If you hide a piece of evidence involving another person, and use a weapon relating to them, they will be successfully framed every time. One such choice would be to hide love letters to the maid in her room, and then use glass from her broken mirror to commit the crime.[/spoiler]\n\nI would need to play further to be 100% sure of this, but I do think your dialogue choices matter. In example, I'm pretty sure if you threaten the family then the inspector will make you for the crime regardless of the evidence you plant. However, these dialogue choices are fairly limited and it is usually obvious which one you need to select to seem the least suspicious.\n\nDespite this game being very short, there is definitely a good amount of replay value here. Given that the game is only $0.99, I'd say it is priced quite fairly. I've played many indie games that are just as short as this one and have no replay value, that cost far more. \n\nI recommend it. After all, it's only a buck.

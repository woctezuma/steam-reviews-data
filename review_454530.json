One of the changes I strongly dislike is the impossibility of totally resetting the initial positions and force organisation, that is, the strategic planning of the campaign. That's my favourite part of most wargames, as the actual execution of the plans established by others (historical) feels more like a puzzle or just a playthrough. \n\nAlso, the fact that the AI doesn\u00b4t play by the same rules as the player is something I dislike too. I prefered the supply system in Decisive Campaigns Blitzkrieg, as the one in Barbarossa pretty much prevents the sweeping advances and wide encirclements one associates with early war Germans and that, afaik, happened in real Barbarossa. \n\nSpace is tightly covered by the soviets and one has to grind through the units to get some small encirclements. Of course supplies were an issue. And the soviets fought hard. But the huge victories achieved by Germany in these early stages of the war in the eastern front were precisely due to the wide open spaces their mobile forces could exploit. Disappointingly, that's something I felt much better modeled in Decisive Campaigns Blitzkrieg than in Barbarossa, although in my understanding it should have been something much stronger in the russian plains than in France.\n\nAlas, this title is still great.

I like to complete a game before writing a review but 90 hours in and with my game hours the third highest of all of my games (next to Motorsport Manager as 2 and Pike and Shot Campaigns as 1), I feel happy in making this review. Simply: If there was an award for the \u201cBest Ever wargame made for PC\u201d, I think this would win it hands down.  This is the best WW2 strategy and tactics simulator you will get your hands on (and yes, even looking at you Gary Grigsby).  I don\u2019t choose my words lightly but when you have a wargame that gets 100% positive reviews it makes you sit up and take notice of why it\u2019s so good. Everything is as near to perfect a you will find in a wargame:\n1 \u2013 The roleplaying element is perfect, unique for this type of game and what sets it apart from Gary Grigsby games. Instead of shoving counters around a map, I actually AM the general in command, I have my superiors to keep happy, colleagues of similar rank and subordinates. In this game you don\u2019t just push around counters but you have to care about people (or not). Decisions can include whether to help with propaganda efforts, whether to join the Fuhrer\u2019s party (I didn\u2019t realise until now that most officers are Antis).  You can turn off \u201cmoral\u201d decisions, but if not, you\u2019ll have to choose whether to help or hinder the SS completing \u201cspecial tasks\u201d and you will be considered for war crime trials at the end.  Overall, there\u2019s about 10<15 people to interact with and keep happy.  Making them unhappy will give significant penalties e.g. Artillery won\u2019t show up, maintenance is more \u201cexpensive\u201d, Air Support less effective, etc. etc.\n2 \u2013 The Grand Campaign simulation for WW2 has finally been simplified without losing detail (again, looking at Gary Grigsby here \u2013 you are FAR better starting with this game or transitioning into this system from Gary Grigsby, as I did).  Tutorial is via video in game and you will need to watch them twice to understand the game (perhaps an hour+ effort).  You\u2019ll also panic when first seeing the interface \u2013 \u201cwhy can\u2019t I move my army\u201d \u201chow do I make basic decisions\u201d. Before you realise: The first turn is a decision turn only and all troops have 0 Action Points turn one, and each decision does indeed have around 5 screens per decision (1 to make the decision, 1 to provide a historical background (how many games provide this historical backround?), the rest being view points from affected parties to help you decide a decision).  Although a lot of screen shots show NATO symbols you can play with a more graphical interface (which I do) to instantly see if a Regiment is Infantry or Panzer. Movement and Attacking is so simple \u2013 click a hot key and move, or choose troops to attack.  Don\u2019t over-stack hexes and keep watch on a units Morale and Cohesion.  If it gets too low you can play a \u201ccard\u201d to rest them.\n3 \u2013 The card system is a fantastic idea.  Cards are used to control which units have \u201ccommand focus\u201d (i.e. leaders bonus), how to use air support (very happy air support is represented by cards in this game, and you simply choose where Army Group North/Centre/South airfields are based), to rest units, to deploy artillery or where to deploy reinforcements, etc.  Each card has a Political Point (PP) cost and you need to spend PP on either cards or the roleplaying decisions (of which there could be perhaps 6<15 per turn). You get extra PP for each decision you have to deal with and each city you take.  Your relations dictate how expensive an action is to take in PP cost \u2013 if you have poor relations with a front leader, don\u2019t expect decisions on that front to be \u201ccheap\u201d.  I love the tutorial where the designer says \u201cplay and forget\u201d.  i.e. simply play the cards once and that bonus will continue to be provided until an event means it cannot or you choose to change which unit receives the bonus. \n4 \u2013 The AI is very good and a big challenge (you can change difficultly settings to suit).  It will form defensive lines, complete counter-attacks, withdraw at some points. It\u2019s never easy to get towards the objectives, but highly worth spending your time pondering over things.  Luckily, you do have intelligence reports (should you choose to read them) that will help in gauging a threat in a certain area by giving limited oversight into the fog of war.  In fact, you get a LOT of great reporting in this game (but you DON\u2019T have to be a bean counter and read it all to play this game).\n5 \u2013 The logistics and weather are simulated VERY well. Logistics is via Train and Truck and you have a limited number of both that will automatically move around (don\u2019t permanently lose trucks/trains \u2013 else you\u2019re in BIG trouble!!! Keep them well MAINTAINED).  The player can affect efficiency and wear/tear \u2013 don\u2019t make your trucks run more than 10 hex to a Panzer HQ else they will wear out and spend more oil than the oil being delivered.  In this respect, oil is a HUGE and critical problem.  Your supplies are extremely tight and running a Panzer Group in \u201cBlitzkrieg\u201d posture (gaining attacking bonuses) uses A LOT of fuel. Often my North and South groups ran out of fuel.  If you are out of fuel, you simply cannot move mechanized vehicles \u2013 Panzers, etc.    It gets very hard and restricted to say the least (and when you move your \u201cForward Supply Base\u201d supplies of oil are NOT delivered at all for one turn \u2013 you must use stored oil, that\u2019s IF you have it). Trains will get supplies to your \u201cForward Supply Base\u201d but your engineering staff will need to convert the track to German gauge first (again, an automatic element which depends on the decision cards you take, relationships and whether it is physically possible to extend the track \u2013 is it in enemy territory or not). I have seen mud represented which slows movement up, terrain has an effect on battles by operating troop types at x% effectiveness (shown in the clear display screen if you hover over the terrarin type in the top centre).\n6 \u2013 The graphics/charts are clean and neat, not cluttered at all.  There\u2019s a HUGE number of statistics in this game for people who like to see detail, but you don\u2019t need to read it all.  You can see amount of kills, equipment in use, very detailed battle reports for each engagement, detailed Order of Battle, Daily Reports, reports on most tired units, lowest morale, etc.  \n7 \u2013 The game measures you /5 in all areas such as Strategy/Tactics/Relationships/Ethics, etc. \u2013 all are important.  Tactics are hugely important in this game, you really do want to make sure you attack at the right time with the right units else poor planning will be punished harshly (you make end up with units being disciplined and receiving permanent negative bonuses rather than awards for a great performance).\n8 \u2013 Supplies and replacements are challenging to manage.  You need supplies at the divisional level (e.g. Ammo, etc.) to mount offensive battles, but resources are very limited. So, you can accept the default distribution of supplies, or, toggle supplies to be received by each unit (micromanagement). The same is true of \u201creplacements\u201d to reinforce the units.  You CAN micromanage, or choose to ignore that aspect without a \u201chuge\u201d effect. \nThere\u2019s just \u201ca lot\u201d in this game, but it\u2019s presented in a clean and simple way.  If you fancy getting this game because you are interested in WW2 grand strategy and tactical games (on a huge scale) I would 100% say get this today, give it a go for 2 hours, and once you \u201cget it\u201d and its mechanics, you won\u2019t look back (you will need to re-start the campaign a few times to get the hang of this).  The designer is not just any designer but a master of his genre, very much like Sid Meier is a master of business and strategy games.  When you get a passionate master who works on something, you know the end result is going to be very special indeed.

You also have to properly set in motion advances of supply bases with slow downs on the front. Otherwise assaults are halted due to lack of fuel.\n\nThe other system that makes the game more than just hex wargaming is the political point system. As a result of completeing objectives and making starting choices related to Operation Barbarossa the player is given a wide array of choices to take. You will normally not have the points to make all  the choices you would like and as a result strategic thinking is required. What is more important? Rolling the Suppply FOB closer to the front or altering the Airbase in support of Army Group North?\n\nIf it were not for the political system and logistics requirements I believe I would have already easily bulldozed through Moscow.

Unlike grand strategy games, the number of tanks and men at your disposal are largely fixed. And unlike  tactical level games, combat is taken care of by a detailed simulation.\n\nI had been searching for an enjoyable operational level game when I finally came across DC: Barbarossa. Other games in this niche range from accessible yet cartoonish (Panzer Corps) to serious but micromanagement heavy(War in the East). In the middle lies Command Ops, but that is a game that is light on important decisions for a player to make. And then I finally played Decisive Campaigns. Sitting in the driver's seat was neither boring nor a chore for me- it was exciting! DC lands in the middle of the spectrum, with just the right amount of choices each turn. \n\nThis said, the serious aspects of the game get in the way of accessibility. The interface leaves a lot to be desired. Simple moves can involve awkward sequences of keyboard presses and mouse clicks. Important information is often found buried in a sea of paperwork or on-screen stats. The game plays a bit slow as a result.\n\nThe other weakness in the game is the Russian campaign. While the German side is lovingly crafted, the Russian side lacks the same attention to detail. That said, the German campaign provides more than enough playtime on it's own.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend this game if you're a hardcore fan of wargames.

However, the beauty of this game (or any wargame) is to be played with human opponent through the revolutionary Slitherine PBEM++ system, try it and you will never want to play against AI again. \n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone who is into WW2 strategy game on operational level, this game and GG: War in the East are the best available on steam right now, if you do not own any of them, you are doing wrong (I am looking at you Hearts of Iron fans).", "timestamp_created": 1477212105, "timestamp_updated": 1477226791, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526379", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26170661": {"recommendationid": "26170661", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012952660", "num_games_owned": 360, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 4084, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 921, "last_played": 1516472674}, "language": "english", "review": "First, let's get one thing out of the way : this is a wonderful wargame, right up there in my personal pantheon of strategy games with Flashpoint campaigns : Red Storm, and Unity of Command.\nWhat really sets it apart from anything else I know, is the sheer boldness of its premises : integrate roleplaying and historical reality in the gameplay in order to give it a unique feeling. If you've ever tried to imagined what it must have felt like to take sweeping decisions, juggling between army theaters, then this is the best I've ever seen and played.\nThe AI, even in easy mode, will definitely punish every mistake.\nIf I had to highlight a single flaw of the game, it would be the victory conditions' assessment : as Germany, by early September I got Moscow under control for 5 turns and Leningrad under control for 2 turns, and the game stopped (due to Moscow being held for 5 turns, which I expected), but I ended up getting a draw (with a slight advantage to the Soviets); frankly speaking, I'm sure I would have quietly held all three of the German's objectives by early October, so an option to let the player continue playing wwould have been great.", "timestamp_created": 1477169540, "timestamp_updated": 1477169581, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528786", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25485891": {"recommendationid": "25485891", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032776165", "num_games_owned": 456, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 401, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473268431}, "language": "english", "review": "Summary - One of the best strategy games about the Operation Barbarossa (although there are not many), although it is not easy to master, and definitely not a casual game. It's hard to compare it with Gary Grigsby's game which is actually detailed to single rifles pieces of equipment, and overall is quite different. I won't be comparing it to John Tiller's games as those concentrate on a slightly different scale. \n\nInstead of simple pros and cons I'm going to review it bit by bit.\n\n\n1. Decisions and relationships\n\nWithout this, this game would have been a rather generic strategy game, and I surely wouldn't really recommend it. With all those decisions, tough choices to make (join the Nazi party or not, support Hitler's plans or do something reasonable instead). Also, most of the choices make someone like you more and someone dislike you, which means that it sometimes wise to pick to less beneficial option just to maintain a good relationship with someone.\n\nI also like that your character has a background - some of the leaders and commanders may like you more or less due to your character's actions in the past. Those whom you supported or impressed will like you, and those with whom you disagreed won't. The depiction of the human element really shines. \n\nBefore the game's release I hoped that perhaps you could really be the commander of the whole eastern front - to command through orders and directives instead of moving individual units around like everywhere else. Unfortunately, I was mistaken. \n\n\n2. Little touches\n\nThere are many little touches here and there - Franz Halder's diary (you play as him) or a soldier's diary that is influenced by your action - the soldier can be a hero, survive or die based on you action. Through his eyes you can really see many different shades of the war, and most of them dark.\n\n\n3. Reports\n\nI really like the system of all those reports - including weather reports, supply reports and many other summaries. It really makes you feel like you have aide-de-camps to help you grasp the situation around you.\n\n\n4. Depth and realism\n\nThis is where the game does not shine in my opinion. \n\nFirst of all, equipment. It is very simplified and lacks many different pieces of equipment. Even something as big as Panzer 38(t). This is no Gary Grigsby's War in the East. Combat is simplified compared to GG's and it is hard to compare the two. \n\nThere are no Corps HQs which I don't like at all - in GG's game I disliked that there are no division commanders, but here you won't even get to see Manstein as corps commander. Just army commanders for you. Point for GG again.\n\nSmaller units are not well represented in the game apart from siege guns. \n\n\n5. Graphics \n\nThey're not bad, although I don't really care about them. I still play John Tiller's games and those are quite dated in that regard. Gameplay is what matters in grognard strategy.\n\n\n6. AI\n\nIt is quite capable. Not as capable as a human opponent, but it can provide some challenge. \n\n\n7. Russian side\n\nWithout all those plotting and decision-making, I don't really like it. Stalin's paranoia is not enough to make it unique and immersive. \n\n\n8. Length\n\nThe game covers just the Barbarossa which makes it a bit short compared to Gary Grigsby's, but the time is more immersive because of all the decisions and different events unfolding around you. \n\n\nSummary: The game is good mainly because of its unique decision/relationship system which really puts you in the shoes of the military commander, but its combat system is quite forgettable and rather generic. If you don't want decisions and just want to concentrate on fighting the enemy, try Gary Grigsby's War in the East or one of very deep John Tiller's games.

The amount of depth, complexity and adherence to he facts and statistics is simply astounding. Of great importance, of course, is just how much the game allows you the freedom to divert from the historical facts and play missions on a \u2018what if\u2019 basis for those who desire and do complete the game as authentically as possible. Along with the great Barbarossa campaign being available on Steam are the fantastic Case Blue and The Blitzkrieg from Warsaw to Paris.\n\nThere is no way that my own play time within the game does the game justice. I genuinely believe that the over ten hours that I have played this game is only scratching the very surface of what the game is capable of. I feel that there are hundreds if not thousands of hours of potential game play available within the game. I believe that the amount of playtime you need to put into the game counts against critics at large reviewing this game in the manner in which it thoroughly deserves. You\u2019re going to struggle to find professional reviewers who can afford to drop a couple of hundred hours into the game needed to do so. It\u2019s one of very few games on Steam where those who have poured tens of hours of play into the game feel that they have done enough to properly review it. I believes that this shows the amount of care and love that they have for the game and its developers but also how much work the development team poured into making this one of the truly great strategy games \u2013 video game or otherwise.\n\nStrengths that I have already discovered within the game are the sheer amount of customization you can create within a single mission let alone playing throughout the entire campaign. They are literally endless and each change can change how the game is played in monumental ways. It\u2019s not just change this for minimal effect type things. It is really full on. Obviously this means that your game type, style and strategy will undoubtedly  vary dependent upon the style of game you are after.  Political decisions and effects profoundly effect the status of the game. The choice of whether you play by the code of the Geneva Convention and have a clean war compared to a dirty war also pushes the boundaries of the game one way or the other, etc. the list goes on.\n\nThere is a focus on the relationships and the historical figures within the game unlike many strategy-based games that I have ever played. This is almost the perfect game for a student of the war. You\u2019re going to learn an enormous amount on some of the most important players in global political history through the playing of the game. If you have a thirst for historical knowledge then this will be a real boon for you and easily justifies the full retail costing of the game \u2013 and the other games within the title.\n\nI want to also suggest that the tutorial videos that were intelligently designed and clearly spoken are some of the best tutorial videos that I have ever watched in my life. They are a real blessing for the game as they will educate even the most naive of new players how to play the game and what is expected of the player. This is something that not many video games do well and to see such a niche title do it so perfectly is a real god send. You need to watch the videos even if you\u2019re familiar with the type of game this is and dare I suggest even more so. It will alleviate so much of the potential frustration that you will have otherwise.\n\nThis may be the one time that I\u2019m not even disappointed that the game lacks achievements or trading cards. They just do not matter to the target audience of this game. The only thing that I can remotely criticize the game on and it does take away some of its accessibility is the learning curve. It is a steep one. One of the steepest that I have come across. It has a tendency of making games with notorious learning curves such as Europa Universalis appear like child\u2019s play in comparison and this is even with the fantastic tutorial videos. However, allow me to assure you that the more that I play the more I know that the learning curve will be one worth enduring with.\n\nI think that I will close on this note. Decisive Campaigns is the first franchise that is focused on World War II that I have ever felt truly comfortable playing. My father lost his hearing in the war serving for Australia and if not for an American doctor he would have died at the scene. Instead they saved his life and some thirty five or so years later I was conceived. So World War II has always been a topic of great trepidation for me. However, I love the way in which this game presents everything in such a manner that it makes me want to learn everything about it. It is simply superb and if you have any interest at all in the war it is something that you must have.\n\nFor similar reviews and our popular giveaways (including hardware) please check out [url=http://www.steamified.com]Steamified.com[/url]\n", "timestamp_created": 1468508981, "timestamp_updated": 1468508981, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.687491", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24098355": {"recommendationid": "24098355", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001364809", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 795, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511119617}, "language": "english", "review": "The A.I. in this game is a real jewel.

I love world military history and am a master of Hoi 1,2 &3. I also have played ck2, panzer corps and other games in the multitudes of genres to death. I have stayed away from these Decisive Campaigns because of what I perceived as a limited scope. I said to myself, I don't want to just fight to paris or just to fight the eastern front then have the game be over. This kept me away for years from these types of games and damn I've been cheating myself. \n\nThis game is the perfect mix of strategy, tactical combat and role playing. It is a an excellent addition to any fan of military history, strategy, tactics or lovers of the turn based game. What is so very unique is the multitude of decisions you get to make as the overall commander of operation Barbarosa. I can not stress enough the journey you get to make as both officers above and below you haggle, beg, demand and interfere with how you execute the war. While these games have been around awhile, they are relatively new to steam and this is absolutely a fresh take on ww2 that I'd like to see more of......what this game does absolutely better then another other is put you in the generals chair. \n\nAs far as specific mechanics go.....the learning curve is actually very reasonable as far as strategy games go. Inside the game are 14 approximiately 2-2:30 tutorial videos explaining the mechanics and it is clear, concise and all relevant material. The game has a huge manual is thats your thing but you don't need it, after the videos, play one turn, get the reports from your next turn and it all falls into place.\n\nAnother thing i was concerned with was replay value, this value is different to each person but to me it does that job in two ways. You can play as stalin and control the soviets, which is excellent and because of how each side had to wage the war you really get 2 games in one. Another way they make it replayable is by having some very important option buttons for your game, you can choose to play historial or a more fluid game with more possibilities. You can also choose to have geneva convention rules apply or more realistically where they arent being followed. I applaud them for the historical context and the choices you have to make as commander. \n\nthe tactical game is easy to learn yet mastering it is going to be on your individual ability to handle not only combat, but logistics and juggling priorties since you are in overall command of all 3 theatres or army groups north, south, and center.\n\nIf you like strategy, tactics, turn based gameplay i highly recommend this. If you are a beginner or veteran war gamer that wants a deeper, richer and more immersive experience I highly recommend this game.

was a little worried to begin with,but this just passed as quick,as i started to shove my units around the'board',this game is totally playable from the off,which im happy to say.The built in

more explosions etc and maybe a little movement with the icons ont he top of the counters would have been nicer,but i understand that you dont need top notch graphics for TBS,but i have seen recently i think on matrix games think it was Order of Battles newest title correct me if im wrong,has nice effects as each units makes its moves.\n Only one gripe(See Edit at bottom) and thats just been spotted on the Tutorial video playing behind me is showing a swastika on its german flags which is totally fine by me,and mine only has Nato or politiically correct counters!;) Maybe this tutorial was

as im getting back into hexwar games,played PG to death back in its day,who didnt?,this game is is along the same lines but with so much more included,i was torn between thisDC:B or Gary Grisbys as they both look very similar indeed and after doing my homework i chose to buy this.\n You won't be disapointed if you love Hexwar Games with a bit more than the average,and Perfect if your an Infomation slut!?,it's got stats galore!...great game so far...and it was a nice bonus to get the 20%off \u00a36.00 is a nice discount.-EDIT:My Game now has the rather nice \"Classic\"counters which you can find in that LINK below from Philippe_at_bay.My Counters now have Lovely Artwork on them,this game really is a little Gem.You can modify the pants off it!:)>>If you like this Review and like me went and bought the Game use that link below and it will take you to the Hub where youc an get all sorts of Files to shape the Game how YOU like it!.Enjoy.EDIT:(Since i have managed to put back the original Flags,thats twice now,so i make steam now not update ANY of my games.Im happy this game lets you do this,after we are all adults here and its fine in the UK.This is becoming such that now im making it a point to not purchase world war two games that are with PC symbols,after all how can you tell they are germans?You can't,because with  out symbols they could just as well be Hungarians or even Romanians.Leave the things alone.Fair play to the guys at VR games.:) I will continue to buy your Games.21/11/2016", "timestamp_created": 1462410673, "timestamp_updated": 1479705219, "voted_up":

The last few years no other wargame managed to suck me in like this. Either they were too much on the easy side or to complex. This one is exactly right. The feeling you get managing the Ostfront is unparalelled.\n\nFirst there's the basic hex wargame. I don't have to manage each and every little artillery regiment, special unit or air wing. It's all on the divisional level with a fair amount of abstraction. This makes the game playable. No micromanagement slugfest here.\n\nNote: It's still a hex counter wargame, so complexity is rather high if you're used to RTS games or Risk or something like that. Learning and knowing unit stats, supply behavior and action point costs is a must. Good thing: the guys made help videos, accessible in the game. Grab a beer, coffee or whatever else and take some time watching them - else I predict frustration.\n\nSecond we have the political meta game. This is such a nice, well done thing - I can't praise it high enough. See the tears in my eyes? These are tears of joy. The meta game is what sucked me in. I feel as if I'm actually in a chain of command. I feel that my decisions matter. That's awesome. Having to manage my political  relations with Generals, my Chief of Staff, Hitler, bloated Goering and many others is what makes the game stand miles above any wargame I played in the last 25 years.\n\nI am in my second game vs the AI, turn 3. This turn I mainly brought my armies in position, Army Group Centers and Army Group Norths Panzer Groups stand ready to encircle large contigents of soviet troops next turn. I can't wait to do see my glorious plans come to life. Once I played 2-3 games vs the AI I will look for human enemies. Just you wait! :)\n\nSo, enough talk. You like wargames? You like WW2? You like making hard decisions? You are able to concentrate and read text? You like the feeling of being a commander in the biggest war in history?\n\nGet the game, it's worth every penny - a labor of love.

I suspect newbies to the genre will find this one of the more accessible titles around, though you will still need to do a lot of micromanaging and the sheer amount of units that you need to individually control may be intimidating. Smaller introductory scenarios, maybe limiting you to the role of an army group commander for a single theater (eg. north, central, south) would be a welcome addition.\n\nThe logistics system is one of the most intuitive I've encountered in an operational level wargame. All of the information is straightforward and easily accessible. If you don't have enough fuel, it's easy to pull up information about why. Other than that, veteran grognards won't find much of note in the battle system to write home about. But that's OK, it sticks to a formula and does it well enough. The AI is competent and a worthy challenge. It seems easy at first, but wait...\n\nWhat differentiates this game from other wargames is the decision and staff system; you need to negotiate and compromise to achieve your objectives. I've not actually seen anything like this done properly before, and it's very cool! For example, one of the significant issues that arises is how to proceed with converting Soviet railway lines to be compatible with your German trains. Going for the the \"I don't care, do it was fast as possible\" approach will likely put your supply officers off side and make them less likely to support you in future, while opening you to other potential problems like train breakdowns, partisan attacks, etc. But slowing down to install signals and water towers, provide proper security, etc. will irritate some of your army officers, who want those supplies *now*. And when they don't get enough supplies, they'll be reluctant to push as far as they possibly can. \n\nAnd don't forget Hitler, trying to micromanage everything you do... \n\nAnother interesting aspect to this decision system is that a toggle option in the menu can enable or disable controversial material (disabled by default so as not to cause offence). It's handled intelligently, without glorifying atrocities. It adds an interesting ethical dilemma, though - do you spend significant political capital trying to stop Himmler's Einsatzgruppen, or not bother and focus on winning the war instead, using that political capital on other things? I appreciate that the development team decided not to ignore this; most wargames do. It's an interesting challenge trying to be the good guy fighting on the side of the bad guys.\n\nIn summary, this game makes you feel like you're an actual general as opposed to \"Army God\" (with the caveat that you can turn off all of the above, and play like a traditional wargame if you choose). This aspect alone makes it quite a clever game, and a unique take on what was possibly the most brutal conflict in history. \n\nDefinitely recommended for genre fans looking for a somewhat different take on the formula.", "timestamp_created": 1462112566, "timestamp_updated": 1462112857, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547550", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22735959": {"recommendationid": "22735959", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018460505", "num_games_owned": 517, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 2216, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "last_played": 1515542306}, "language": "english", "review": "An extremely refreshing addition to the Slitherine Catalogue.

Der Gegnerspielzug wird auf meinem 4Kern irgendwas PC in ca. 2-3Minuten berechnet.\n\nWas in diesem Spiel nicht enthalten ist:\n\n-\tDiplomatie\n-\tWirtschaftsimulation (Hearts of Iron z.B.)\n-\tSpionagemanagement \n-\tEinheitenbau \n-\tTaktische K\u00e4mpfe (sie werden ohne M\u00f6glichkeit einzugreifen berechnet)\n\nVon der Komplexit\u00e4t der Inhalte und der Vielseitigkeit des Regelwerkes (wieviel muss ich lernen, wissen und verstehen um zu begreifen was ich da tue) ist es deutlichst \u00fcber Panzer General, leicht \u00fcber Hearts of iron und deutlich unter Gary Grigbys War in the east angesiedelt. Es ist meines Erachtens weniger Komplex in seiner Bedienung und in seinen strategischen M\u00f6glichkeiten als Decisive Campaigns: Fall Blau. \nABER: Die Auswirkungen jeder Entscheidung sind so gravierend, dass jeder Zug \u00e4hnlich dem klassischen Schachspiel bedacht werden muss. Ein Runden wegklicken ala Civilization ist nicht m\u00f6glich. \nDer Schwierigkeitsgrad f\u00fcr Menschen mit meinen kognitiven M\u00f6glichkeiten ist enorm, l\u00e4sst sich aber anpassen. \nWas ist neu, wodurch hebt sich dieses Strategiespiel von anderen ab?\n\nK\u00f6nnen Sie sich an ein Strategiespiel erinnern, in dem Sie eine positive Beziehung zu Adolf Hitler aufbauen konnten und daf\u00fcr vom Spiel nicht bestraft wurden? Ich nicht. Und das ist grunds\u00e4tzlich auch sehr gut so. Wor\u00fcber spreche ich hier?\nSie spielen Franz Halder, operativer Chef des Generalstabes des Oberkommando der Wehrmacht und verantwortlich f\u00fcr den Erfolg oder Misserfolg des \u00dcberfalls auf die Sowjetunion, namentlich bekannt als Operation Barbarossa. \nOder sie spielen Stalin pers\u00f6nlich als oberster Befehlshaber der sowjetischen Truppen. \nVor Beginn eines jeden Spielzuges werden Ihnen Ereignisse in Briefform dargebracht, die Ihnen Entscheidungen abverlangen. Gehen wir ethisch in die vollen:\nEin Herr Himmler (Chef der SS) schreibt Ihnen und bittet um Ihre uneingeschr\u00e4nkte Unterst\u00fctzung f\u00fcr gewisse S\u00e4uberungsaktionen hinter der Front die russische Zivilbev\u00f6lkerung betreffend. Der F\u00fchrer h\u00e4tte sich dahingehend ja klar bei der Einsatzbesprechung ge\u00e4u\u00dfert. Wie werden Sie antworten? ........... Ich erz\u00e4hle Herrn Himmler immer wieder, er m\u00f6chte mich mal am Hintern \u2026. und sollte es zu sp\u00e4teren Zeitpunkt ein Kriegsgericht geben werde ich gegen ihn aussagen. \nDiese Antwort kostet mich enorm viele Politikpunkte. PP\u00b4s sind die W\u00e4hrung die ich einsetzen muss um Entscheidungen zu \u201ebezahlen\u201c. Sie werden niemals genug PP`s auf ihrem Konto haben um nach dem zehnten Zug noch alle Entscheidungen treffen zu k\u00f6nnen. Ein General des Nachschubs wird dann sauer, weil sie sich nicht daf\u00fcr einsetzen, dass er seinen Fuhrpark an Lastwagen f\u00fcr die Heeresgruppe Nord nicht komplett \u00fcberholen kann. G\u00f6ring ist allerdings happy, weil sie nicht genug PP`s hatten um eine Umverteilung von Treibstoff von der Luftwaffe zur 2. Panzergruppe zu erwirken. Sie fallen doch tats\u00e4chlich in der Achtung Brauchitsch\u00b4s weil sie keine Zeit hatten ihm ein Geburtstagsgeschenk zu kaufen.\n \nDie Spielmechanik:\n\nIn welcher Weise sich ihre Divisionen an der Front schlagen, wie schnell ihre Panzergruppen nach Osten vorsto\u00dfen oder wie qualitativ hochwertig die Kampfnahunterst\u00fctzung der ach so glorreichen Luftwaffe sein wird, h\u00e4ngt von den Entscheidungen ab, die Sie morgens am Schreibtisch in der Korrespondenz mit anderen Funktionstr\u00e4gern des gesamten Wehrmachtsapparates treffen. Ihr Adjutant im Generalstab wird sie zur Wei\u00dfglut bringen. Denn der wird Entscheidungen treffen, wenn sie ihre PP`s aufgebraucht haben oder sparen f\u00fcr wirklich wichtige Entscheidungen. Und er versagt auf ganzer Linie, dieses linientreue Nazi-Duckm\u00e4user-Ar\u2026.. .\n\nFazit:\n\nDiese Form der Vernetzung ethischer Entscheidungen, B\u00fcroarbeit und Hardcore-Strategie (unterer Schwierigkeitsgrad) habe ich so vorher noch in keinem Spiel gefunden. Eine Mischung aus Lindenstra\u00dfe, Kindergarten und Operationszentrale. Wenn Sie an den Ereignissen auf ganz hoher Ebene im WW II interessiert sind legen Sie sich dieses Meisterwerk zu. Bitte seien sich aber der Subjektivit\u00e4t meiner Person bewusst. Aber Rezessionen von z.B. Armchair General sind \u00e4hnlich gut ausgefallen.\n\n8/10\n \nEin Wort zur Shoah (Holocaust) in diesem Spiel:\n\nAls linker antirassischtischer Sozialp\u00e4dagoge mit sechs Jahren Dienstzeit in Heer und Marine kann ich es nur schwer aushalten, wenn \u00fcber manche Dinge nicht gesprochen wird. Erst einmal wichtig: Der Mord an Millionen Juden, Homosexuellen, Sinti, Roma und anderen damaligen Staatsfeinden findet im Spiel keine Erw\u00e4hnung. Das ist gut. Ich m\u00f6chte beim Spielen Spa\u00df haben. M\u00f6chte ich mich \u00fcber tats\u00e4chliche Gegebenheiten informieren besuche ich einen H\u00f6rsaal oder lese ein Buch. Daher haben zwar Kriegsverbrechen und auch die NSDAP und sogar eine \u201eArbeitsbeziehung des Protagonisten (Franz Halder) zu Adolf Hitler in das Spiel Einzug gefunden, aber die notwendige und letzte Grenze wurde nicht \u00fcberschritten.

Quindi pur essendo complesso nella gestione d'insieme, non ha la profondit\u00e0 dei Gary Grisby, che non sono dei giochi ma piuttosto dei simulatori per appassionati (il loro obiettivo \u00e8 simulare, il divertimento \u00e8 in secondo piano, chi li compra cerca la fedelt\u00e0 1 a 1, non un videogame in senso stretto). \nEcco, con questo Barbarossa rimaniamo nel campo dei videogame, il gameplay esiste per divertire (occhio che si parla comunque di un gioco che \u00e8 pi\u00f9 simulativo del 99% dei giochi strategici).\nQuesta premessa per dire che pur essendo un Wargame....rimane comunque userfriendly, un po' smussato nelle meccaniche....insomma quei giochi che tanto mi piacciono che sono \"facili\" da comprendere ma difficilissimi da padroneggiare.\n\nSiamo davanti ad un CAPOLAVORO.\nIl gioco ripercorre l'operazione Barbarossa (non l'intera campagna di russia). Per inquadrarlo bene, l'operazione progettata dai tedeschi volta alla caduta della russia PRIMA dell'inverno. L'obiettivo dei tedeschi \u00e8 completare il piano originario, quello dei russi far capitare quello che storicamente \u00e8 successo. Quindi l'arco temporale preso in considerazione dal gioco \u00e8 il giugno 1941 fino al febbraio 1942.\n\nNon voglio focalizzarmi sul gameplay strategico in senso stretto, che in linea di massima \u00e8 quello classico di un wargame, con tutta la gesione logistica, ma con l'aggiunta di alcune carte \"bonus\" che facilitano aspetti che nei veri wargame richiederebbero ore di studio.\n\nCosa introduce di nuovo ?\nLe decisioni politiche.\nPensate alle grandi battaglie della WW2 e alle discussioni da \"conquistatori da poltrona\" che ogni tanto si sentono, se avessero fatto, se non avessero attaccato, che scemi che non hanno pensato all'inverno, perch\u00e9 non hanno tenuto conto di questa problematica ecc.... \nInsomma i grandi errori della WW2 li conosciamo benissimo, ma perch\u00e9 sono stati commessi ? I tedeschi pensavano veramente che non avrebbe fatto freddo ? ....o i russi a inizio battaglia, tenendo la posizione fino all'ultimo uomo, pensavano realmente di fermare un nemico molto pi\u00f9 organizzato ? Non era meglio arretrare e riorganizzarsi e minimizzare le perdite iniziali ? Per i tedeschi non era meglio iniziare la campagna di russia un paio di mesi prima ? La strategia della blitzkrieg cos\u00ec efficace perch\u00e9 non \u00e8 stata sfruttata al meglio ? Perch\u00e9 il piano iniziale era quello di prendere Leningrado e tutta la parte ricca della russia e poi improvvisamente si \u00e8 deciso di puntare su Mosca?...e l'anno dopo invece su stalingrado ? Tutte queste modifiche cosa hanno comportato ?\n\nCi siamo mai chiesi PERCHE' LORO hanno fatto questi errori...e preso quindi decisioni cos\u00ec avventate ? Solo per colpa del \"nein nein nein nein nein di baffetto con la mano sbattuta sul tavolo ?\nLa risposta sono le decisioni politiche....spesso una decisione sbagliata sul piano strategico risolve una situazione politica...\n\nNei videogiochi si gestiscono imperi ed eserciti come se fossimo degli dei della battaglia dove tutti ci ascoltano e ci assecondano alla perfezione, ma nella realt\u00e0 non succede  cos\u00ec, nemmeno nei regimi pi\u00f9 totalitari (come lo erano quello nazista e quello sovietico).\n\nQuindi il gioco non si limita a mettere davanti al giocatore decisione puramente strategiche e gestire la questione bellica, ma dovremo gestire e spesso assecondare tutti i capoccia dell'apparato politico.\n\nDescriver\u00f2 pi\u00f9 nel dettaglio i tedeschi, ma sappiate che giocare coi russi cambia totalmente il gameplay e le regole, come se fossero due razze totalmente differenti di un RTS...(altro elemento che lo differenzia da un \"vero\" wargame)\n\nCoi tedeschi si impersona Franz Halder (il pi\u00f9 grande trollone della storia...si \u00e8 preso due anni di carcere al processo di Norimberga, se ne prendono di pi\u00f9 se si ruba in panetteria). Ad ogni modo nei suoi panni si deve gestire l'operazione barbarossa. Ad inizio gioco avremo un'importante decisione da prendere, assecondare il piano di Hitler, assecondare chi vuole andare dritto su Mosca, oppure pieno controllo all'apparato militare senza rompimenti di coglioni ? \n\nQueste decisioni comportano delle conseguenze, ovviamente pi\u00f9 si fa felice baffetto e meno ci sono le possibilit\u00e0 di essere destituiti, ma bisogna seguire il suo percorso. \nMeno si segue baffetto e pi\u00f9 \u00e8 probabile che capitano cose brutte, ma si pu\u00f2 pianificare strategie senza ingerenze dall'alto...(ma sperate che i vostri piani di battaglia proseguano alla perfezione...). \n\nQuesto per\u00f2 \u00e8 solo la punta dell'iceberg, avremo a che fare con tutta la catena di comando dai superiori (abbandonareil posto di comando per andare a fare il giuramento hitleriano ?...rallentare un'operazione perch\u00e9 goebbels vuole un bel video di propaganda ?...strizzare l'occhio pi\u00f9 ai fanatici piuttosto che a quelli con idee pi\u00f9 moderate ?... Che faccio, insisto con Hitler nel chiedere l'equipaggiamento invernale ? A cosa serve l'equipaggiamento invernale se i piani prevedono la vittoria per l'inizio di novembre ? Gli dico che il piano che stiamo seguendo \u00e8 una merda ?)\n\n...e poi ci sono i vecchi...i grandi generali che seguono i tre fronti, che vengono da idee della WW1, mi daranno mano libera per la blitzkrieg, o per loro \u00e8 troppo moderna ed \u00e8 meglio puntare sulla fanteria ? Se riduco i rifornimenti alla luftwaffe per dare una maggiore spinta ai panzergruppe, Gering si incazza e mi mette il muso ? \nContinuo a dare pi\u00f9 risorse ad un fronte meno importante solo per avere l'appoggio di un generale o li destino a punti pi\u00f9 critici, col rischio che i generali mi mettano il muso e mi vengano bocciate le strategie che hanno reso famosi i nazi...?  \nLe truppe sono stremate, ma chi lo dice ad hitler che c'\u00e8 bisogno di una settimana di stop ? ....oppure dopo essersi dannati a pianificare un attacco decisivo...arriva un dispaccio dall'alto...Hitler ora dice di puntare dritti su Mosca, ogni altra missione \u00e8 revocata...\nInsomma una FIGATA...\nCoi russi invece \u00e8 tutto diverso, si impersona direttamente Stalin e bisogna fare i conti con la paranoia di essere rovesciato, man mano che i nazi avanzano, aumenta il livello di paranoia....magari quel generale tanto bravo che sta facendo bene il compito, forse \u00e8 il caso di segarlo, forse domani mi vorr\u00e0 sostituire...magari \u00e8 anche il caso di incentivare la voglia dei soldati di resistere fino all'ultimo uomo per difendere la madre patria...oppure devo scendere a patti e richiamare in servizio gente che aveva gi\u00e0 il biglietto per la siberia...\nMa non mi voglio pi\u00f9 dilungare...metteteci un comparto grafico gradevole (per un wargame), i diari dei vari personaggi che avanzano con il proseguire della battaglia...decisioni morali circa i crimini di guerra...e il gioco \u00e8 fatto...UN CAPOLAVORO", "timestamp_created": 1462010530, "timestamp_updated": 1462010530, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.686610", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22708525": {"recommendationid": "22708525", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034128939", "num_games_owned": 742, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 11889, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497238281}, "language": "english", "review": "This game simulates the invasion of the Soviet Union from June 22nd, 1941 until the end of January 1942. The Germans code-named the invasion Operation Barbarossa and their intent was to defeat the Soviet Union before winter. Anyone who knows a bit of history knows how that worked out...\n\nAs the German player you are placed in the role of Franz Halder, the Chief of Staff of the eastern Theatre of Operations. You are not Hitler - you are not even the highest ranking German officer! This is VERY important to game play as you navigate a myriad of relationships with superiors (including der Fuhrer) and subordinates (Army Group commanders) who EACH have a bias in favour of (or against) you and an overall \"relationship\" level with you (from say Terrible to Superb and everything in between). This relationship network is variable from game-to-game.\n\nOn the Soviet side, you play as the big guy, Stalin, and get a larger measure of control than Halder, but you are paranoid! If things start to go wrong on the front (losing territory) you have a \"paranoid episode\" and start executing commanders who you perceive to be a threat to you! Needless to say, this grinds the whole Soviet command and control apparatus to a halt for a few days.\n\nAt its core, DC:Barbarossa is a hex and counter wargame but the role-playing aspect outlined above makes this game unbelievably immersive and interesting to play. Casual players will not like having to move and attack with hundreds of divisions while managing supply etc... but for grognards this is no problem. It takes about 30 minutes to do a turn so this is not a \"twitch-fest\". The game is more streamlined than monster games like those of Gary Grigsby, however.\n\nI have played exclusively against human opponents, but according to the forums, 90% of people play against the AI and many have a LOT of trouble winning even against lower levels of difficulty! As a human-human struggle, this is BY FAR the best computer wargame experience I have ever had in over 40 years of board wargaming and computer gaming back to the C64 days.\n\nThe designers are actively tuning the game balance and supporting the fan base's requests for new features but they are also turning their thoughts to a new game using this engine.

It can be played solitaire or against a human opponent, and sports some of the strongest AI in the industry.\n\nThe game combines an easy-to-play but very deep turn-based divisional scale wargame with an extended role-play of command management.  This combination creates a brilliant and unique game system that is as important and revolutionary as the invention of card driven games for board wargames.  After playing Decisive Campaigns: Barbarossa you will never look at another wargame in quite the same way, because without the role-playing command layer something very important will be missing.  \n\nThe German player has to slalom around cranky colleagues, unruly subordinates, and irrational superiors while conducting a demanding military campaign that threatens to come unravelled if you run out of fuel or if too many of your trucks or panzers break down.  The Soviet player gets to be Stalin, wrestling with ineffective subordinates and growing paranoia while trying to keep the military situation from falling apart. \n\nThe game is not an orgy of micromanagement.  Many things appear to be handled abstractly, but appearences can be deceiving. The game focuses on the important decisions an overall theater commander must make and their influence on short-term combat operations. \n\nAnyone who has ever worked in a large organization has at some point taken a proposal to senior management for approval. You may already know the executive who has to sign off on the proposal, and you scan his face while he reads it hoping for advance warning on what is going through his mind. You listen carefully to his questions, trying to understand his thought process. You answer even more carefully, trying to steer him into your way of thinking. And to your delight, the questions that he come back at you with tell you that he is thinking about the proposal the way you want him to. When he summarizes the issues and the decision he has to make, you know that he fully understands why he needs to sign off. And then the unfathomable happens: he turns you down.\n\nDecisive Campaigns: Barbarossa played from the German side puts you into the role of that senior manager. You are constantly being asked to make decisions or delegate the choices to a subordinate, which amounts to pretty much the same thing. It is often painfully clear what the intellectually correct choice should be, and you repeatedly find yourself compelled to make a poor choice, or even the worst choice, with full understanding of what the unpleasant consequences are likely to be. \n\nAny action you take is likely to upset someone. Antagonize a subordinate and he'll be slow to carry out your orders, which won't do wonders for your next performance review. Annoy your peers and your fuel allocation will get diverted to Western Europe, or your supply trucks won't get repaired when they break down. Anger your superiors and count yourself lucky if all that happens is early retirement. Anything you do or don't do comes at a political cost, and you rarely have enough political capital stored up to do what absolutely needs to get done, let alone what you really want to do. So you perform a heart-breaking triage on the decisions you have to make, repeatedly making bad choices so as not to upset the apple cart because you need to keep your political powder dry for the big fight over that one thing you think you absolutely need.\n\nMake no mistake, this is a wargame. There's a big detailed map, with lots of units to move around and lots of places for them to go. But you're playing as theater commander. You sit there looking longingly at the map, thinking of all the brilliant maneuvers you could make and all the clever things you could do, if only you could get your subordinates to follow orders. And then you remember your inbox. It's a big inbox.\n\nSo why do you have to read through all those reports instead of focusing on moving your troops around ? You could delegate to your staff, and you can even ignore your inbox entirely. Many commanders throughout history have done precisely that. But it's part of your job, and sooner or later not understanding fuel consumption, railroad track gauges, and broken down trucks will bite you in the ankle, especially when the weather is starting to freeze over and your troops haven't been supplied with winter coats. \n\nPlayed from the Soviet side the game presents you with a different but equally challenging set of problems. You have to figure out how to get a brain-dead, incompetent, and terrified officer corps to do something (anything) while navigating around Stalin's episodes of paranoia. Less than ten years before the game begins the functional part of the Soviet officer corps had been purged, and the consequences of that purge are still very much in evidence in 1941. You survive in the Red Army by towing the party line and not being too prominent or conspicuous: showing too much competence or initiative was a one-way ticket to Lubyanka prison or the Gulag. In that environment, the natural inclination of a Red Army general with any hope of life expectancy is to do nothing. When he isn't descending into paranoia, Stalin can nudge the Red Army into action by dispatching Zhukov or Khrushchev to keep things under control or restore order. When playing the game from the Soviet side a player will find himself in a constant war with inertia.\n\nPlaying from either side you have the option to remove the management exercise layer from the game before it begins, and what you'll be left with is an engaging division-level wargame in the style of its predecessors in the series, Decisive Campaigns: Blitzkrieg Warsaw to Paris and Decisive Campaigns: Case Blue. But playing with the management layer turned on elevates Decisive Campaigns: Barbarossa to a unique experience that demonstrates at a visceral level that there's a lot more to being a good general than just making the right moves.", "timestamp_created": 1461939794, "timestamp_updated": 1461943493, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 150, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.768928", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 59, "total_negative": 2, "total_reviews": 61}}

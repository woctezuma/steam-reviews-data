Levels are laid out as a square grid. You'll control 1-3 snakes which will each be a certain number of squares long. On levels with multiple snakes, pressing tab will select a different one. Some levels will have fruit. If it has fruit, you must eat the fruit with a snake which will make the snake 1 square bigger. Once all fruit is eaten, the exit to the level opens. If there's no fruit, then the exit begins open and you must navigate your snake(s) to the exit. The trick to the game is that the snakes will fall based on their current shape if they're no longer touching the ground. So you often need to shape your snake a particular way so falling causes it to land on a platform rather than a spike trap or off the bottom of the level. Snakes can also push each other if you ram another one, you'll often need to do this to get another snake to certain spots. At any time, you can reset a level or press backspace to undo moves as far as you want. If you die, the game automatically undoes your last move.\n\nThe music and graphics are fine. The game controls decently well. It starts out fine enough but quickly shows its ugly head.\n\nMinor Quibble: If you're moving your snake around to solve the 'puzzles' and die on a level (and you will die many times) the game backs up 1 turn. If you have multiple snakes, the game selects the snake that died rather than the snake that moved. So once the game undoes your move, you'll go to move the snake you were using only to discover that the game has selected the other snake as the active snake instead. So you've driven that snake somewhere you didn't want it to go and have to undo moves and then select the other snake. This is a minor issue, but it will happen very frequently and is annoying. Why not just leave the active snake as the active snake when the death gets undone? I can't imagine what sort of idiotic reasoning the game designers had for making it this way.\n\nSo the biggest problem this game has is that each level isn't so much a puzzle as it is a brute force method of elimination. Most levels require that your snake(s) be moved in a specific manner. If you do not move in the exact manner the level designer wants you to, you will fail.  Quick example:  You need to move somewhere 4 spaces away, so you could choose to move (up, up, right, right) or (right, right, up up) or (up, right, up, right) or (right, up, right, up).  All viable right?  Well not in Snakebird.  In Snakebird, only one of those choices might allow you to succeed.  Now imagine your Snake is bigger and/or you have multiple snakes, all of which must move in specific manners.  This is what you do every single level.  All you're really doing is making a best guess as to whether a path you're taking is the right one until you either succeed or eliminate every possibility it contains and then do the same for some other path until you finally pick the right pathway. There's never really any moments where you get excited or feel good for figuring something out, you just go \u201cWell, I guessed the correct path that 23rd time\u201d. It feels as though the level designers made the levels starting at the end rather then the beginning, traced a specific path that each snake must make from the end back to a certain point, then set that as the start point, and then designed the levels around the pre-made paths. Levels are designed in a way that you could divide them up into several parts. You might clear 1 or 2 parts only to discover at part 3 that you didn't clear part 1 or 2 in the specific manner you were supposed to.  Have fun going back to part 2 or maybe all the way back to part 1.\n\nAfter brute forcing my way through several levels, I'd had enough. I never felt like I was doing something thoughtful but instead was just punishing myself looking for that 1 and only 1 specific path. It feels like a mindless grind rather than something thought provoking that lead to a solution.\n\nEdit: To further clarify since I've had some comments. I never claimed there's anything wrong with one pathway puzzle games, I enjoy plenty of them. The problem is that this one is a lemon. It offers nothing thoughtful.  Snakebird is a maze variant.  The best strategy for beating a maze?  Start at the end and work backwards, it's the same here in Snakebird.  This is a strategy I figured out for mazes by the age of 5-6.  If you consider tracing paths backwards to be thought provoking and a real brain burner, boy are you in for a treat. Consider this: All you do in the game is move up, left, right, & down and on some levels switch your snakes. Sounds incredibly simple right? We should all be able to beat a game this simple in a few hours right? So, how do you extend the playtime of something this simple? Easy, make it unfair.\n\nPeople seem confused about the brute forcing parts, so I'm going to ELI 8 this for people. Let's look at how you play a maze, there are 2 methods.  1. Draw as you go:  You use a pencil, start at the start point and draw a path until you reach an area where you can go in multiple directions (a decision point).  You then glance at the maze and make a best guess which way to go.  If it leads to another decision point, do the same thing.  If it leads to a dead end, you erase your path back to the decision point, glance at the maze, and make a new best guess.  Repeat until you get to the exit.  2. Trace and then draw:  This works the same exact way as number 1, except you wait to draw your path until you've traced your way to the exit.  It's important to note that it doesn't matter whether you actually drew a path into a dead end or traced your finger into a dead end, you ran into the dead end.  They are the same exact things.  Mazes don't require intelligence to solve.  The best you can do at any given point is make a best guess where you should go and do that over and over and over until it succeeds.  This is brute forcing.  Now let's look at Snakebird.  How can you play Snakebird?  Well, there are 2 ways.  Let's assume we're on a level with 3 fruits.  1. Move as you play:  In this method, you move your Snakebird until you hit a decision point.  You glance at all the fruit and make a best guess as to which one you can get.  You then move your Snakebird to it and attempt to get it.  If you get it, you glance at the remaining fruit and make a new best guess as to which one you can get.  If you fail to get the fruit (either because you're too short, you block yourself out, you fall into the abyss, or fall into a spike), then you undo your moves until you're back at the decision point, glance at the remaining fruit, and make a new best guess.  Repeat until you get all fruit and into the exit.  2: Trace and then move:  This works the same exact way as number 1, except you wait to move your Snakebird until you've successfully traced a working path to a piece of fruit or to all fruits and into the exit.  Again, it's important to note that it doesn't matter whether you moved your Snakebird and fell off a ledge/onto a spike or traced a path where you realized your Snakebird would fall off a ledge/onto a spike, you still died.

Feeling inept at something deceptively simple is rather the point of Snakebird with the kid-friendly exterior masquerading the challenge of wrapping your head around these elaborate solutions. If the puzzles can make you realize what you did wrong, then the puzzles themselves are not at fault; it\u2019s yourself to blame for not understanding them. \n\nHowever, I feel like Snakebird doesn\u2019t do enough to shift the blame entirely on the player for not getting it. The core mechanics as well as the additional challenges are fine and they\u2019re handled with excellent level-design, but the difficulty spikes of more complexity and choice to pick your battles is something that brought me more frustration than satisfaction. As a result, I can only suggest people who like to micromanage solutions in their head more than fiddling with their hands would enjoy Snakebird.\n\n[h1]Is it a Bird? Is it a Snake?[/h1] \n\nA lot of people describe this game as any other puzzle game when I think it\u2019s best described a logic puzzle. As someone who enjoys various puzzle games ranging from The Witness, Grim Fandango, TRI, or Thomas Was Alone, I cannot help but think this distinction is important. There are far more lateral-thinking puzzles based on chess-like preparation and understanding of the pieces you\u2019re playing with rather than understanding the core mechanics and how to use them to solve a given situation/obstacle.\n\nTo describe this situation in a less convoluted way: \u201cPuzzle Games\u201d to me are comparable to Rubik\u2019s cubes; they\u2019re governed by rules, patterns and limitations that doesn\u2019t require understanding the entire problem at once but how to shape the problem, gradually, by observation. \u201cLogic Puzzles\u201d are you given a Rubik cube in one formation and you\u2019re given X amount of moves to solve the problem. The emphasis is placed on knowing how to manipulate the problem by an arbitrary obstacle meant to test your knowledge of the puzzle rather than your observations.  Although both instances use the same core mechanics, the skill you\u2019re tested on is what defines the type of puzzle you are given. \n\nPuzzles in Snakebird range from both types of challenges, though the frequency of these types varies by each area of the game. Some levels will test you more so on understanding the level-gimmicks in \u201csafe-environments\u201d where you don\u2019t have to meticulously plan three moves ahead, which I think these serve as the tutorials for new factors to consider (movable pieces, teleporters, etc.). Some levels attempt to focus your attention on the wonky physics of the Snakebirds like how they can float on fruit, propel one another with another Snakebird, move forward by changing their shape to cross a gap or how the positioning affects their movement. These latter mechanics are the bane of many people who didn\u2019t get Snakebird because the first type of puzzles set different expectations, so often the player will be left with the reaction, \u201cHow was I supposed to figure out that!?\u201d\n\nHowever, what I think is perhaps more aggravating than the shift in focus of puzzles is the open-level design and how it interferes with the player learning the subtleties of Snakebirds.\n\n[h1]Sometimes the Narrower Path Is Best to Travel[/h1]\n\nSometimes offering choice is to the detriment of the player if the open-level layout is not simple enough to guide confused players on the \u201cintended\u201d track of progress. Tutorials are not always the best solution but roadblocks with one intended method of success are far more aggravating for people to deal with if not handled properly.\n\nUnlike in the open-world design of The Witness where there were guideposts from the boat\u2019s map that pointed the player in the designated area of a puzzle type with symbols, Snakebird lacks any simple direction for the player. When you finish a level after the initial three, the game opens up various puzzles to prevent the player from getting stuck on one for an hour and to explore other types of puzzles before coming back to try again. There are even numbers associated with each level that would make one believe there is an intended path of progression, but often puzzles in a higher rating would be easier than lower-ranked puzzles or areas of the map would be far simpler to understand than other areas. Consistency is something the game severely lacks.\n\nPart of the problem is personal preferences; I find level-gimmicks simpler than controlling two or three Snakebirds at once, and when the game does both I often found myself stuck. The other problem is rather a lack of scaling between puzzles that can ramp the previous challenge up or toss in something entirely different but building on the same idea. Asking for more puzzles is not the easiest solution but I think with Snakebird had the game provided better scaling between gimmicks, wonky physics and the amount of characters you control then the puzzles would be far easier to manage for people who don\u2019t catch-on by a single puzzle. Repetition, especially in mastering a puzzle game with so many little things to learn, can be a blessing in disguise. \n\n[h1]Snakebirds: The Uroboros of Puzzle Purgatory[/h1]\n\nAt its core, I like Snakebirds as it\u2019s a charming game with an idea that works surprisingly well when it\u2019s understandable and not so nitpicky for solutions.

You're not solving abstract riddles, you're just helping snakebirds eat some fruit.\n\nDespite that, it's incredibly hard, but also entirely fair. Easier levels introduce mechanics that you'll need to solve more difficult levels. For the majority of the game, you'll always have plenty of levels to pick from and try your wits out on, keeping you from feeling completely stuck, and helping you to come up with new ideas for possible solutions to puzzles you previously had no clue how to solve. Also, there's an undo button that can be used freely.\n\nA wonderful side effect of the game is that it was also very relaxing and calming to me. Maybe it was the cheerful music, maybe it was all the snakebirds falling asleep when you wouldn't actively control them, or maybe it was just my poor brain slowly shutting off on the more difficult puzzles. But it was a really great experience playing the game in bed at night, until I couldn't keep my eyes open anymore. Video games as sleep aid.

Dans chaque niveau, il s'agit de manger tous les fruits (s'il y en a) et de guider un ou plusieurs \"snakebirds\" vers le point de sortie.\n\nEn pratique, le jeu ressemble \u00e0 un jeu de puzzles tr\u00e8s classique, \u00e9pur\u00e9, simple \u00e0 contr\u00f4ler, o\u00f9 l'on d\u00e9bloque l'acc\u00e8s aux puzzles suivants depuis une carte (ce qui permet de jouer dans le d\u00e9sordre en cas de blocage), mais autant le dire tout de suite: le jeu est [i]tr\u00e8s, tr\u00e8s dur,[/i] et s'adresse avant tout aux mordus du jeu de puzzles. On n'est pas du tout ici dans un gentil jeu qui se joue en \"pilotage automatique\" pour se d\u00e9tendre, mais dans un jeu o\u00f9 l'on peut rester longtemps bloqu\u00e9 dans un m\u00eame niveau, et o\u00f9 il vaut donc mieux avoir une solide exp\u00e9rience du genre.\n\nCette difficult\u00e9 est \u00e0 la fois une qualit\u00e9 et un d\u00e9faut: d'un c\u00f4t\u00e9, elle rend \u00e9videmment le jeu m\u00e9morable et int\u00e9ressant (je me suis r\u00e9gal\u00e9), mais de l'autre, elle n'est pas ici tr\u00e8s bien g\u00e9r\u00e9e, les puzzles n'\u00e9tant pas tr\u00e8s progressifs et certains principes pourtant fondamentaux \u00e9tant parfois peu clairs. Le jeu donne aussi peu de prises: d\u00e8s que l'on doit diriger plusieurs snakebirds ou que l'on doit pousser des blocs ou des cong\u00e9n\u00e8res (ce qui est en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 la m\u00e9canique la plus importante du jeu, plus que manger des fruits), la combinatoire devient tr\u00e8s vite \u00e9norme et on se sent un peu perdu sans savoir par o\u00f9 commencer, le jeu pouvant assez facilement d\u00e9courager ou frustrer les non-amateurs.\n\nAu final, le jeu est bon, mais le concept n'est pas aussi original qu'on pourrait le croire (on pousse des blocs, avant tout), il y a assez peu de niveaux (une cinquantaine), l'univers et l'action manquent de personnalit\u00e9, l'action est lente et un peu r\u00e9p\u00e9titive, et surtout, la difficult\u00e9 n'est pas tr\u00e8s bien ma\u00eetris\u00e9e.\n\nJe recommande cependant Snakebird \u00e0 petit prix pour les amateurs, m\u00eame s'il est tr\u00e8s loin des classiques comme Catrap, Fire 'n Ice ou Adventure of Lolo, ou, plus r\u00e9cemment et chez Nintendo, de [url=http://simbabbad.blogspot.fr/2013/09/mario-donkey-kong-minis-on-move-eshop.html]Mario and Donkey Kong: Minis on the Move[/url] ou de la s\u00e9rie des [url=http://simbabbad.blogspot.fr/2013/08/pullblox-fallblox-eshop-3ds-nintendo.html]Pullblox[/url].", "timestamp_created": 1485381281, "timestamp_updated": 1510079685, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29412587": {"recommendationid": "29412587", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051304382", "num_games_owned": 496, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 732, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455593296}, "language": "english", "review": "I first played Snakebird back in 2015 when it first came out. I had heard it would be difficult, but I, even though I hadn't played many puzzle games, had played many logic puzzles for a few years and considered myself \"good\" at puzzles, and so thought this game wouldn't present much of a challenge.\n\nHow wrong I was.\n\nLevel 0? Easy. It teaches you how to move and what the goal of the game is. Eat all the fruits, exit the level via the rainbow spinny portal.\n\nLevel 1? Easy. It does introduce the undo button because almost everyone goes the obvious route (which is quite intended), and that gets them stuck. But the level is still innocent and easy; the developer laughs with you. \"Don't worry man, it's just a small joke, you still got this.\"\n\nLevel 2? This is your first taste of hell. Many people who played this game on iOS rated the game 1 star and accused the developers of not playtesting their game well enough because they thought this level was unsolveable. But it *is* solvable, if only you take the time to reason through things logically, and make sure you don't repeat your mistakes. It's definitely brute-force-able if it comes down to it.\n\nMany of my friends whom I've since introduced Snakebird to have gotten stuck on that level for quite a while. And I'll admit, I too got stuck on that level for a few minutes. You look at the puzzle and you think it's easy. Then you try to solve it and think it's impossible. Then you realize what you've been missing all along (it's not even a new game mechanic; it's just a possibility that you've for some reason excluded from consideration), and you feel humbled and stupid.\n\nDespite its colourful aesthetic, this had been described as \"The Dark Souls of Puzzle Games\" before Stephen's Sausage Roll came out, and it soon became clear why at around level 6. I was in fact playing this game on stream. It took me a whole 15 minutes to figure out how to complete that level, even with a few subtle hints from a watcher. Sebastian, the employee at Noumenon Games who had designed that level, was actually watching me, and when I completed the level, I said \"Right, you need to be given a raise, and fired simultaneously\". Because that describes the sheer amount of awe, frustration, and admiration I have for the level's design. \"Don't worry, it's not a small joke any more. Welcome to the cute fluffy hell of ripping your hair out at colourful snakebirds.\"\n\nAnd it only gets harder from there. Later levels will require you to control two or more snakebirds, all of which must get to the exit; boxes that can be pushed around by your snakebirds, and portals that teleport your snakebirds. Often the snakebirds don't work the way you might naively think they do, but then you think about it a bit more and realize that that's how they've always worked. \n\nEven with all these mechanics, though, each level has a very narrow solution path (or on occasion, two different solution paths). Remember that undo button? Yeah, that has a reason. Without it, this game would be nigh-unplayable. The final level took me over a full hour to work out how to do, even with undos.\n\nYet at each minute I still felt I was making progress.\n\nBecause, like Elya Yelnats, who got stronger as the pig he was carrying got fatter, so did I get better at puzzles as the levels got harder. I was repeating my previous mistakes far less. I was realizing what I needed to do far faster. I was becoming one with the snakebirds, and one with the puzzle.\n\nI came out of this trial by fruit far tougher than I ever was. This game honed my puzzle skills to a far stronger level. It showed me my place in the puzzle hierarchy by stomping me into the dirt, then it forced me to claw my way to the top with tooth and nail and pure brainpower. Without this, I would never have been able to complete any of Stephen's Sausage Roll.\n\nIf you're interested in becoming great at puzzles and you're at an intermediate or even strong beginner level, play this game.

There's no particular order you have to do them in as the available stages are shown to you on a world map so you can basically go to another puzzle even if you've already started one. Stages don't necessarily get harder as you progress either so if say you've been stuck on one puzzle for a while you can hold that off for the time being and move on to another.\n\nThe gist of the gameplay is that you solve puzzles using a Snakebird thing with movements like in that old game, Snake.\nThe tutorial stage will teach you how to play the game and the first few numbered stages after will basically teach you how the physics of the game work through your own experience. After all that the game will start to become noticeably difficult as the rest of the game expects you to basically be an expert in the mechanics and then some as the stages are designed to have you needing to do a a lot of figurative zigs and zags with the solutions to the puzzles. It can get incredibly frustrating with that case possibly encouraging more trial & error scenarios than thought-out ones. There's even an \"Undo\" option that lets you constantly undo the last move you just did all the way from when the puzzle started in case you made a mistake.

The mechanics are actually simple, but together they create some very deep interactions that you will need to fully grasp in order to complete the more challenging later puzzles.\n\nHowever, Snakebird does not start off overwhelming and the basic mechanics are introduced gradually in the first few levels with a nice difficulty curve. Paying close attention to the \"how\" and \"why\" of the solutions of these early puzzles will be invaluable for finding the solutions to future puzzles.\n\nLevels are spaced across a world map with each biome having its own mechanical theme or new puzzle object to interact with in addition to the snakebirds. The world map is laid out in such a way that multiple levels can possibly unlock from completing the previous one. This is incredibly helpful in case you get stuck so that you can go try a different puzzle in the meantime and return to the first one later with a new perspective. \n\nEach puzzle itself is elegant and you rarely, if ever, NOT use everything in a level. Everything involved in a puzzle can be seen on a single screen at all times and there is nothing included to obfuscate the solution like extra objects to interact with that you don't need. There is a clear starting point with only a few pieces to work with, but the process to the goal remains interesting. If you get stuck on a puzzle, there is usually enough space in the level to move the snakebirds around to help generate ideas to yourself about what to do next. Otherwise, undoing your moves or resetting the puzzle altogether is just a push of a button away. It helps to be able to play around with the \"puzzle pieces\" that you're given to reach an ah-ha moment that gives you a new strategy to follow. Some levels will restrict your movement options quite a bit from the start, so deduction will likely play a bigger role in these puzzles.\n\nThe aesthetic charm and polish of Snakebird shouldn't be overlooked either. The colorful environments, relaxing music, and expressive faces of the snakebirds all create a pleasant atmosphere to soothe any pent-up frustration that you may experience while being unable to eat that distant fruit without falling to your demise in the briny sea below! There are also plenty of environmental doodads to click and mouse over should your mind wander.\n\nAnytime I completed a level I had spent a lot of time on, I actually slowly clapped as the little fireworks went off in-game. I clapped not for myself, but for how brilliant the designers/developers were for creating the level!\n\nI got to hand it to Noumenon Games for making such a clever title! o//\n\n**Snakebird has made me think in ways I have not thought before, so for that, I nominate it for Steam's \"WHOOOAAAAAAA, DUDE!\" Award!**", "timestamp_created": 1480396713, "timestamp_updated": 1480401608, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28011045": {"recommendationid": "28011045", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998085952", "num_games_owned": 196, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480381055}, "language": "english", "review": "Have fun with some birds that are also snakes.

You can easily spend half an hour just fiddling the birds around until you have a breakthrough and realize that you have to set one bird up [i]just so[/i], so that it can catch a falling block without the bird becoming trapped or unsaveable. Luckily, after the first few levels you can start skipping over levels, so if you don't reach a breakthrough you can just come back to it later.

The art is done [url=http://noumenongames.com/the-art-of-snakebird/]with an incredible attention to detail[/url] and perfectly reflects the outward simplicity but underlying complexity of the puzzles themselves. Every object in the environment is meticulously designed and work together perfectly to create a cohesive minimalist design.\n\nThe music is done by Carl Karjalainen, and isn't too eye-catching (ear-catching?) - but this is probably a good thing, as if you're planning on completing Snakebird you're going to hear all of the tracks a [i]lot[/i] of times. \n\nBut these are mostly besides the point - I don't know many people who buy a puzzle game for its soundtrack, so you're probably reading the reviews to find out what the puzzles are like. To be extremely blunt: if you don't enjoy feeling stupid, don't buy this game. It is INCREDIBLY difficult, to the point where even 10 levels in (out of slightly more than 50) it's already harder than the final levels of most other popular puzzle games. By the mid-game each step requires 50 steps of planning ahead to make sure you're not going to move yourself into a corner, and there's virtually no room for error with nearly every puzzle requiring nearly exact moves to complete it correctly.\n\nIt should be noted that this difficulty is [b]NOT[/b] arbitrary or forced. The developers aren't making deliberately obtuse or tedious puzzles just to drag out the runtime, and every single puzzle makes complete sense once you work it out, using the relatively limited set of features in extremely clever ways.\n\nPersonally, I think that this game is fantastic, both in its production quality and in its fiendish difficulty, but it's definitely not for everybody. You have to absolutely love difficult puzzles to enjoy this game, and you'll get frustrated extremely quickly if you aren't used to that kind of challenge.

That being said, refer to the Downsides and Caveats below for some things to keep in mind in deciding if you specifically will like it.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nThe mechanics are very simple and (with one or two exceptions) almost completely self-explanatory. There are only a finite number of possible moves at any given position. Yet, from level two or three, you will likely get pretty stuck. Moreover, you will be absolutely baffled at how you got stuck on such a clearly simple level: you know an easy solution must exist, and it's going to be completely obvious in hindsight. (If you don't believe me on this, just watch TotalBiscuit struggle with it on Youtube. He spends 7.5 very painful minutes on level 2. He then spends 6.5 additional painful minutes on level 3 before giving up.)\n\nSo begins a series of excellent, completely solvable, but extremely difficult puzzles. You are lucky if you don't get stuck on almost all of them. They aren't tedious or just a matter of brute force. Rather, as with all of the best puzzle games, you must piece together techniques and strategies you have learned in previous levels to get you through more difficult ones. Each level involves careful planning: working backwards, figuring out what sequences of subgoals might get you to the end, and using process of elimination to rule out impossible sequences until you find one that works. Many levels [i]look[/i] impossible and (another aspect of all great puzzle games) you will feel like a genius when you solve them.\n\n[h1]Playtime[/h1]\n\nThere are over 50 puzzles (I won't say exactly how many to avoid a minor spoiler); I got about 16 hours of playtime although of course it will be more or less depending on how quickly you solve them. That's a little under 20 minutes a puzzle, on average, but the hardest ones must have taken me close to an hour each.\n\nDefinitely worth it for $7 in my opinion, although I got the game for much less in a humble bundle. Note, however, that you can get full game as a mobile app for $4.71 (on Android; probably similar on iphone) if you want to save money that way, and don't mind playing it on a phone.\n\n[h1]Downsides and Caveats[/h1]\n\n[list]\n[*] [b]Aside from the puzzles themselves and the cute graphics and animations there is very little else to this game.[/b] For instance, there is no story at all. To enjoy the game you must be the kind of person who enjoys puzzles for their own sake. That being said, the graphics and clickable background and music are all very pleasant.\n\n[*] [b]This game is very, very difficult.[/b] As such, it is not for everyone. You will get stuck; often there's only one very particular way to solve a puzzle and you have to think through things methodically to find it. When you get stuck, you will also often have no option other than to switch to a different level and come back later.

Many levels don't even have FRUIT. The gameplay is [i]essentially[/i] snake as a platformer with an endgoal.\nSNAKEBIRD remains fun despite repetition like many simple games such as snake and mitosis. It's relatively challenging, and not particularly frustrating even when the puzzles are complicated due to the UNLIMITED UNDO FUNCTION. The music is outright painful after a certain period and you should probably listen to something else while you play.\n\nOn the subject of kids, most of the levels require a bit of forward thinking and trial-and-error. It's a polished little game that would be great for children that like the general experience of soft-cornered gameplay and aren't overly keen on fighting, racing or sports games. It vaguely involves fractions and division since the specific length of the snake in numerical terms needs to be considered on many of the levels.\n\nN.B.

There isn't a great way to explain them with words, but if you watch the video, you'll see the core idea very quickly - it's like the old-school game Snake, except our dear snakebirds are subject to gravity. There are a couple twists on this formula, but they are also very intuitive. The focus is not on throwing mechanics at you, but on puzzles that force you to push those mechanics to their limits.\n\nThis is the hardest puzzle game I've ever played. Not because it's full of cheap tricks, or because of randomness (a la Candy Crush), or because it's complicated - the puzzles are (mostly) fair, they're just brutally hard. It's the Dark Souls of puzzle games. If that sounds good to you, this game is for you!\n\nAlso, although the game is difficult, it never gets too frustrating, because once you solve the first few puzzles, you'll have a bunch of puzzles unlocked at any given time. Which means you can always bang your head against another wall. Plus, the art is delightful! My favorite part is the expressions of the snakebirds. When you leave them hanging next to spikes, their eyes are terrified and imploring; when you leave them next to fruit, they gaze at it desirously; and the rest of the time, they look at you like they're too cool to be in this puzzle.

If your snakebird eats a piece of fruit, its tail will grow one segment longer.\n\nUnlike classic Snake, your snakebirds are not self-driving, they are affected by gravity, and there are sometimes several to control within a single level.\n\nIf there is fruit in a level, you must collect it all to unlock the exit. In addition, you must guide ALL of a level's snakebirds to the exit, not just one. This might not sound like that big of an obstacle until you realize that some levels require your snakebirds to climb on each other to advance.\n\nThese are not easy puzzles. There are a few basic stages to ease you into the rules, but then you're thrown right into the heavy stuff. Thankfully, the game is not purely linear. When you solve one level, the levels adjecent on the world map will be unlocked, regardless of how they are numbered. This is a feature that I worry will be overlooked by a lot of people, and more puzzle games would do well to incorporate it. I couldn't tell you how many times I got frustrated on a puzzle, then left to play a different puzzle, and returned later with success.\n\nAnother great feature: the game remembers every move you make on a given attempt, so instead of having to restart a stage every time you fall offscreen or land on spikes or get yourself trapped, you can hit Undo as many times as you like.\n\nThere are multiple methods of controlling your snakebirds, but my personal recommendation is the skip the mouse during puzzles and use arrow keys to move, Tab to switch between snakebirds, and Backspace to undo.\n\nIf you're looking for a timewaster, you might not have a very good time with this one. If you're looking for actually difficult actual puzzles that require thought and planning, you should strongly consider Snakebird.\n\nGrapes / 10", "timestamp_created": 1452377439, "timestamp_updated": 1452377439, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.664531", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20369932": {"recommendationid": "20369932", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970901170", "num_games_owned": 214, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457302058}, "language": "english", "review": "Great presentation, easy-to-learn but hard-to-master.

Both the art style and the score of the game evoke a very touching, peaceful, and beautifully innocent atmosphere.\n\nHowever, that is nothing but a lie that is surface deep. Once you pass the first few levels which guide you through the mechanics, you are put in a situation where the world map begins to branch out.\n\n\nIt's adorable, isn't it? It's large, but it evokes a very friendly, inviting atmosphere. At first look, this is the kind of game you'd expect to see on your child's iPad or iPod touch, right?\n\nWrong again. This is just the selection of which of the 9 circles of Hell you'd like to traverse through first is.\n\nThe mechanics are fairly simple! You control Snakebirds, moving them around, getting fruit and moving obstacles. Sometimes you get one Snakebird, sometimes you get a few and you have to use them together as teamwork to reach the goal. Once all the fruit is collected, each Snakebird has to get through the colourful portal that opens up to leave the level. Thankfully, there is a button that is an equivalence to a \"ctrl+z\", undoing your last move.\n\n\nYou will make the Snakebirds die. They will literally quiver in fear as they stare down a pitfall, or a spiked block, or spikes in general. If another Snakebird is in danger, and you switch to your other Snakebird, he will glare you down with the force of a thousand suns. A look full of hate.\n\nThe first time I bought this game, I bought it full price. I played it for a while, before nearly tearing my hair out in frustration. I enjoyed a solid 8 hours of gameplay during a week where I had next to no consistent internet - and I hadn't downloaded many other of my games to my new harddrive. By the time I had internet back up reliably, I immediately refunded it. Snakebird had beaten me, beaten me into a bloody pulp. I 3-stock Contra with ease. I've had no issues toppling Miyazaki and co.'s Souls games, nor Bloodborne. Hardcore endgame raiding in MMOs? Been there, done that. Rhythm games? Bring 'em on, I got this. Shmups? I can do it, pass me the arcade stick. Fighting games? I'm slightly better than the average Joe.\n\nSnakebird? Snakebird broke me.\n\nBut I just bought it again in the Steam sale! I mean, it's half off, and I've spent time away from it. Maybe the difficulty was routed in me being frustrated by silly, easy puzzles? \n\nNope. \n\nSnakebird was, and continues to be, ballbustingly hard. I'm tearing my hair out here. Once I finally think I have the level beaten, I realize that there is no way for me to get both of my Snakebirds to the portal, or I've trapped myself to a point where I can't get that last piece of fruit so easily...\n\nAnyways, I'm going back to playing Snakebird until I have a stroke or brain hemorrhage.

Really?).  That is, it went under my radar until I saw a fairly well-known Youtuber try and fail repeatedly to solve one of the first few levels, while I thought about how simple the solution was, and that was that.  I bought the game the next time I jumped on Steam.  Then, just to prove my puzzling prowess, I installed it immediately and sped through the first several levels and then almost as quickly ran into the spiking difficulty curve.\n\nYes, this game is unabashedly hard, and I have since found myself yelling \"How is that even possible?\" at my computer more than once.  However, in today's world, where most puzzles in games can be solved by something as simple as a greedy algorithm or were directly pulled out of one of Sam Loyd's puzzle books, having an original puzzle game of this difficulty is actually quite the treat.  The game unlocks new levels in a nonlinear fashion, so when you get stuck in one puzzle, you can jump to another and work on it, and every so often you'll notice something in one puzzle which leads you to that \"eureka!\" moment in which the solution to THAT ONE LEVEL you've been stuck on for HOURS comes to you!\n\nThe level design itself is simple but good enough.  You move within a discrete 2D grid on the screen, so there's never any confusion about hit boxes of spikes and ledges.  If you fall, it is always obvious why you fell, at least in retrospect, and you can rewind any move if you accidentally move in the wrong direction after setting up a difficult solution.  Additionally, the fact that you can rewind any number of moves means that you don't have to restart the level after every mistake, which I feel is a mistake too many developers make when designing puzzles.\n\nUnless one materializes further into the game, however, this game does not have any real storyline, so if you're someone who is likely to look up the solutions online at the first sign of difficulty, I'd give this game a pass, as there doesn't seem to be anything beyond the joy of solving difficult puzzles here.

You have to figure everything out yourself, and when the game throws new elements you weren't expecting to be interactive, it will just get you confused as to what to do.

In other instances, you may end up kicking yourself for overthinking when you discover how easy a solution to a particular level is.\n\nSnakebird also has a very bubbly soundtrack as well as some of the most adorable sound effects ever.

The presentation oozes charm, and the core mechanic of combining the classic Snake with a variation on traditional Klotski puzzles intrigued me no end.\n\nI was not disappinted! This may very well be the most enjoyable puzzle game I've ever played. You're eased in gently for the first few levels, but the difficulty increases very quickly. Mercifully the game does let up now and then, giving you a couple of easier levels after introducing a new mechanic, such as moveable blocks and portals. Also, while the stages are numbered sequentially, you are not forced to play them as such, so if one particular puzzle is giving you a headache you can move on and come back to it at another time.\n\nThe later levels pose a formidable challenge, and a few took me close to an hour each to figure out. It never feels cheap however - while difficult, the puzzles are fair and after each mistake, I usually felt one step closer to finding the solution. With puzzles such as the aformentioned Klotski, I find my interest wanes and I eventually turn to a guide, but Snakebird engaged me in such a way that I was compelled to persevere, and the feeling of satisifaction at finally cracking some of the trickier stages was palpable.\n\nSnakebird is a prime example of how to do Indie games well. By focussing on one relatively simple core mechanic, Noumenon have been able to craft a finely honed gameplay experience, with far more complexity than you might expect.

By combining everybody\u2019s favourite Nokia game and one of the weirdest looking necks on an animal, Noumenon Games released an unexpectedly thoughtful 2D puzzler that\u2019s receiving criminally low attention. While not everyone might want to trade their scales for feathers, it\u2019s worth finding out why this indie title is even greater than the old cell phone sensation.\n\nOn a first glance Snakebird is deceptively simple, with soft bright colours and shapes giving the game its child-like innocence. Your perception is corrected quickly however, with puzzle designs that are extraordinarily tight and meticulous, and often only have one way to be solved. The mechanics are simple; there\u2019s no real tutorial because the pick-up and play style and the game\u2019s method of subtle teaching doesn\u2019t need it. The objective in each stage is to collect every piece of fruit before successfully reaching the goal portal. Just as in the classic game of Snake each fruit you eat adds an extra unit of length, a mechanic that makes some levels an experiment in discovering which fruit should be eaten first. Players can move in a forward direction with only immediate turns available to them, turning what seems to be a stage that can be easily traversed into an abstract thought exercise. You\u2019ll quickly run into a problem where you can\u2019t back out, it starts to sink in that there\u2019s a lot more to this title. Levels are precisely crafted, there\u2019s no wasted space and everything presented has been a contemplated part of the puzzle. Stages begin with a single Snakebird, but soon players are asked to manage 2 or three at a time, quickly adding layers to the challenge. Later on moveable blocks become staples to puzzles as well, and being able to handle using these objects to interact together effectively is what\u2019s key to success.\n\nFor the amount it stumps you the game hardly induces a serious level of frustration, and when it does it\u2019s often just enough to motivate you to attempt a different tactic. Answers often require out of the box approaches; there\u2019s almost a paradoxical feel to many of the game\u2019s solutions. You\u2019ll discover what needs to be accomplished and spend 10 minutes exploring every way why that\u2019s impossible, only to eventually arrive at a moment where the entire puzzle makes sense. It\u2019s about discovery in little ways, and learning how to test every theory your mind can toss at a problem and then some. Despite the sometimes impossible-feeling difficulty progression never really feels too far away. Upon death you\u2019re replaced where you were just before your last move, and the always available quick reverse option to undo any mistakes you\u2019ve made is a great design choice to make the player want to experiment as much as possible without feeling punished.\n\nThe classic world map layout is a great way to present non-linear stage progression; more skilled players can attempt harder levels after only completing a handful, but most will likely stick to the beaten path and enjoy the gradual rise in difficulty through the well thought-out introductions to new concepts. You\u2019ll start to learn optimal movement patterns and ways to contort your birds just through design and ramping complexity. It\u2019s refreshing how much credit the game gives to the player\u2019s intelligence; puzzles are created in a way as to tempt you into all sorts of traps, but it has enough sense to let you work out what exactly needs to be done about a situation. There\u2019s absolutely no fat to weigh anything down either. A great deal of care has been taken in presenting what\u2019s vital in each stage without distraction, allowing each player to absorb every idea at their own pace. With such simplicity, it manages to teach complex ideas without uttering a word.\n\nThere\u2019s a stark contrast between the feelings brought out by gameplay and what\u2019s experienced through the game\u2019s visual tone. The simple but elegant aesthetic relaxes you even on long sittings of little progress. The fine attention to detail is there too; there are adorable facial expressions on the birds to show their excitement or fear, and various clickable objects to randomly interact with. The multiple control setups allows for great ease of access. Players can engage through keyboard, controller, or even use the mouse to drag Snakebirds around. This control scheme leads us to believe that it wouldn\u2019t be much of a stretch to see this game on the mobile market, and it would be a magnificent addition.\n\nOn the surface it might even look like a game for children, but Snakebird is far from it. With its excruciating difficulty and great feeling of reward upon completion, it deserves to be regarded among more well-known complex indie puzzlers. If you\u2019re ever up for some serious low cost brain-bending just try to feed the Snakebirds.\nSCORE: 8.4\n", "timestamp_created": 1432588638, "timestamp_updated": 1432588638, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505726", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15994087": {"recommendationid": "15994087", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050245585", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1339, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432723536}, "language": "english", "review": "Very clever puzzle game.

You can undo any number of steps.\n\nYou control one snake at a time. You can move it like in the popular game [i]Snake[/i], and eat fruit as well. But what is this? The game takes action in a side view, so the snakes fall like in [i]Tetris[/i]! The \"snake\" remains rigid, never rotates, and falls down only if there is nothing below it. The \"bird\" part, I suppose, refers to the fact that the creatures can slightly lift off the ground, only to fall afterwards.\n\nAnd there is not much more to explain. This concept gives birth to a vast amount of combinations and gameplay possibilities, especially if there are multiple snakes! Of course, some additional gameplay concepts are present, all very natural and intuitive. Spikes, movable blocks, portals and whatnot. Even the level exit portal acts as a gameplay element, because losing a snake often renders the level unsolvable for the other snakes.\n\nThe graphics are immaculate.

It is a very solid puzzle game - and it's a good puzzle game, not just a good game. I know I wanted a puzzle game that wasn't deceptive towards the player and this game does just that - that's why it's a good puzzle game, and not simply a good game.\n\nSnakebird is a difficult puzzle game. Use the Steam achievements to check out the completion rate of this game - that was an instant-buy for me. The art style happens to work wonders to keep players from the verge of frustration. Despite it looking like a children's puzzle game from the outset, it quickly ramps up and its audience changes drastically.\n\nThe game itself has incredibly varied graphics and mechanics, which helps for keeping your mindset changing throughout levels. Despite being abstract, it still manages to be immersive with a pleasant art style and great sound design to go with it. The level progression allows you to visit several individual levels at one point in the game, so a spike in difficulty in one level will not prevent you from playing the rest of the game.\n\nThe only flaws I could recall in the game are that your level progress does not get individually saved (however, if you quit the game during a level, it will save that, but only that). Another \"flaw\" could be the lack of a hint system, but such a feature would be a detraction from the main selling point of the game's challenge.

Dieses Spiel geh\u00f6rt definitiv zu meinen Top 5 aller Zeiten. 53 super durchdachte Levels!\n\nZum Spiel selber:\n\nOptik: 10/10\nSehr nettes Design und Animationen. Bunte, gute Farbabstimmung.\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nSehr einfach zu verstehende Mechaniken. Funktioniert einwandfrei und l\u00e4sst sich leicht bedienen.\n\nLeveldesign: 11/10\nPerfektes Leveldesign. Jedes einzelne Level hat seine eigene L\u00f6sung, seinen eigenen (oder mehrere) Knackpunkt(e). Kein Level gleicht dem anderen. Kompliment an die Game- Designer. Selten erlebt man ein so gut durchdachtes Spiel.\n\nSchwierigkeit:\nDieses Spiel hat einen sehr knackigen Schwierigkeitsgrad! Aber daf\u00fcr ist das Erfolgserlebnis nach Aufl\u00f6sung eines Levels umso h\u00f6her. Das Spiel gibt auch keine Hinweise zur L\u00f6sung des Levels. Ich pers\u00f6nlich finde das sehr gut. Sollte man ein Level nicht l\u00f6sen k\u00f6nnen, kann man derweil ein anderes Level l\u00f6sen, da dieses Spiel nicht linear ist.\n\nSpielzeit: 10/10\nIch brauchte 22 h um die 53 Levels zu l\u00f6sen. Die ersten 10 gingen recht locker von der Hand (ganz einfach waren sie auch nicht), aber bei einigen Levels sp\u00e4ter brauchte ich teilweise 1 h f\u00fcr ein Level (2, 3 Levels besch\u00e4ftigten mich sehr lange).

However hidden behind this charming visual style is a game so difficult that it could possibly put dark souls to shame. \n\nThe concept of the game is present in the name of the game. You control a \"snakebird\" which is simply a mixture between a bird and a snake obviously. The game has a control method very similar to snake. You travel with your snakebird in a grid based pattern. Although you are allowed to touch yourself, unlike in snake, you do often find yourself getting your head trapped between the wall and your body making it impossible to escape. This concept carries through the entirety of the game and makes for very interesting gameplay.\n\nNow this concept may seem to simple to you to be considered a difficult game. Although the trick comes with the implementation of gravity. Your snakebird has to be touching the ground to be able to travel across the air. If not you can end up finding yourself falling. This can put you in some very tricky situations when trying to manouvere across the games obstacles such as water and spikes. \n\nI won't have you believe that I am good at this game though. I am not. So far, over 1 hour in, I have completed 7 of the games 53 levels. These probably took me way longer than they should have done. But although I absolutely love puzzle games, I do completely suck at actually playing them. So maybe my judgement of the exceedingly hard difficulty is clouded  by this factor. \n\nHowever there is one interesting little trick the game uses to help people like me along the way. When completely a level you are not only given one level to continue on with, but a selection of a few of them to try. This means if you get stumped on a level, then you can try out other ones at the same time that you may find easier to figure out. At the current stage of the game that I am at I have access to 5 different levels to try. Not that this helps me at all though because I have managed to get completely stumped on all of them. But that's just me, because remember I suck!\n\nThis game does have a delightfully charming art style to it that made the game very satisfying to play. The art style represents a very simplistic manor with very few shades of colour present. This would usually lead me to dislike the graphics style but in this case it does not. The slow swaying animations of almost every item in the game including trees, snowmen and clouds lead to an impressive visual style that expertly represents the cartoon-like graphics style I believe they were going for. \n\nA beautifully calming soundtrack complements this unique graphics style very well. The soundtrack is equally as simple as the visuals but works perfectly well with it. The calming nature of it manages to keep you sane while attempting the ludicrously hard puzzles. I do have one minor flaw with this soundtrack however. The songs on levels run on a continuous loop. It can get boring after a while and can even get a slight bit annoying to put up with. Couple this with the fact that you sometimes spend a large amount of time on a single level and it can end up getting to be a rather annoying soundtrack.\n\nI also feel since this is a PC game it is customary to mention PC specific parts of the game. There are some key options that are missing in the options menu for the hardcore PC gamer. The current options menu shows a large range of resolution options, fullscreen toggle and sound and music toggles. It also includes a grid option that is specific to the game which is a nice addition. I don't believe the options menu needs to have any kind of graphics options due to the very simplistic nature of the graphics. But it is missing a key option. It needs to have present seperate in game sliders for sound and music. I personally believe this option should be instantly present in every game and it is a flaw to not have it. \n\nOverall I absolutely adored my experience of playing snakebird. Even if it was rather frustrating at times. It was largely satisfying when you finally managed to figure out how to complete a level you have been stuck on for so long. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of hard puzzle games. The game is an absolute steal at the current price of \u00a34.99. Although don't buy it if you get easily frustrated by hard games. This game is not for people wanting a simple experience. \n\n[h1]TheIronicGamers rating system[/h1]\n[list][*] Don't ever buy this game. \n[*]Maybe consider it on a sale. \n[*]An average game.\n[*][b][u]A good game that should definitely be considered.[/u][/b]\n[*]A must play!\n[/list]\n\nDisclaimer: I was provided with a early review key by the developer of the game.", "timestamp_created": 1430861728, "timestamp_updated": 1438381244, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565350", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15703133": {"recommendationid": "15703133", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053348394", "num_games_owned": 1668, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 2142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498445381}, "language": "english", "review": "There are like +50 levels and I'm already stuck on level 13.\n\nGG tough puzzle game", "timestamp_created": 1430853432, "timestamp_updated": 1430853432, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523636", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15702000": {"recommendationid": "15702000", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025072099", "num_games_owned": 192, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1437321608}, "language": "english", "review": "Snakebird is as insanely cute as it is insanely hard.", "timestamp_created": 1430848439, "timestamp_updated": 1430848439, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.585167", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15700132": {"recommendationid": "15700132", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091019640", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 82, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1430847112}, "language": "english", "review": "It's so cute it hurts, it is also secretly the devil pretending to be cute snake birds.", "timestamp_created": 1430840139, "timestamp_updated": 1430847030, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489461", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15694578": {"recommendationid": "15694578", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982055955", "num_games_owned": 203, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 474, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431234812}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is beautiful, well crafted, and clever. \n\nThe animations are squishy and the sound is pleasant making the occasionally-very-hard puzzles go down smoother.

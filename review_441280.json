This was a real gem. Bought it on sale because it looked nice, but some negative reviews almost kept me away. Really glad I decided to check it out. It's a solid platformer with very few things you could really call flaws. It's not ridiculously difficult, but there are a lot of challenging moments and added challenges from achievements. The controls felt a bit stiff at first, but they're fairly standard for this sort of game, and I got used to them easily enough. Graphics, music, writing, all great. Animations in particular were fantastic.\n\nThere are only two things that bothered me. One being that for all the buttons I had on my controller, I only used like... four? You end up with a lot of things you can do, but not a lot of buttons for inputs. In particular, I found dashing to be a problem sometimes, because you have to push attack and jump at the same time, and sometimes you'll just end up attacking or jumping, or when you try to jump and attack quickly, sometimes you'll dash. The second thing is that the boss rush has some very weird bugs going on. It seems like your first attempt at it works fine, but if you try again without completely closing out the game and opening it again, you'll die after getting your final time, and it won't save it. What's even weirder is that one time I was somehow sent to the Japanese version of the game, but it only showed one of the frames from the level select pictures. I eventually figured out that pushing right enough times would bring me back to the English version, but for a second I thought my save was broken, because even restarting didn't fix it. These were the only bugs I encountered though, and I figured them out, so they didn't hurt my experience much, but a fix to that would be nice.\n\nAnyway, I highly recommend this game. Especially right now on sale. If it looks at all appealing to you from the videos, you'll probably love it.

Now they've stumbled into [i]another[/i] curse, and it's not so easy to live with: an immortal pharaoh will kill them at the end of seven days if they don't find a series of magic grails.    \n\nThe gameplay takes a little while to get down, since the physics are on the flloaty side.  I can see this being a big sticking point for some.  You should have a handle on it after the first level, though, so give it a chance; the game is so fun, so weird, and has so many wonderful set pieces that it would be a shame to miss out for such a small thing.

But this game should be talked about more, because besides one really frustrating level, this game is near perfect in its execution of solid Metroidvania combat and exploration.\n\nThe Rabbit-Man Jonathon comes out of the box feeling powerful, with an array of long-range attacks that nullify projectiles and combo into aerials for which you are rewarded with health and mana. While the basic enemies tend to just be obstacles as you plow through the game's hallways, bosses have recognizable but tricky patterns to put your tools to use. As you get upgraded through the game's collectables, every sub-weapon adds welcome tools that cover the weaknesses the basic moveset has, and minor differences in scale - such as increases in attack damage - can be obtained from your treasure hunting. Eventually as you explore previously completed levels, your new movement abilities and gear make you feel godlike. It's a fantastic power fantasy tempered by progressively increasing challenge to keep you feeling accomplished.\n\nDriving this gameplay is a cute story following the archetypal treasure hunt, made more fun by lovable characters and a tongue-in-cheek sense of humor. The banter between Jonathan and his support character Jack and his rival Andre was highly entertaining for me. With that said, the radio conversations constantly pop up within the gameplay, so if the writing fails to appeal to you I could see this as being a detractor. The dialog is skippable through a fast-forward style button press, though there will still be a pause while it's being skipped. To me though, the character interactions are one of the highlights of the game. It contextualizes the gameplay and makes the good moments great.\n\nThe level structure is mission-based, so it's closer to something like Mega Man Zero or Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia rather than Symphony of the Night. While a lot of the game's unlockables require you to return to levels already completed, it captures the spirit of exploration rather than strictly being a matter of backtracking. This is helped by nothing obtained by revisits being completely required for the game's completion (though, especially on the game's hard mode it certainly helps to get them.) And, as I mentioned, I thought it was fun to revisit and tackle old challenges with the power obtained from later in the game.\n\nThe one major complaint I have about Pharaoh Rebirth is in regards to a specific mission that tries to change things up with an on-rails car section. It's bad, and it's required to progress. There isn't enough screen space to really telegraph when you need to jump, so the game uses a sound cue instead. However even knowing that a jump is coming, the timing of when to jump is something that I only mastered through strict trial and error. Since death throws you to continue screen and drops you back in the previous checkpoint this means a lot of replaying sections until either you figure out the rhythm of the sound cue or accomplish the task through rote memorization. In a short burst the vehicle section might not have been terrible, but culminating on its issues, it's long enough to be exhausting. I felt like the missions that followed were totally worth slogging through it, but a slog it was.\n\nBut in spite of that one blight, I think Pharaoh Rebirth + is otherwise an ideal accomplishment of its genre. It certainly deserves attention, and comes highly recommended from me.\n\n4 out of 5.", "timestamp_created": 1511028624, "timestamp_updated": 1511030074, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535865", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36588512": {"recommendationid": "36588512", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116883121", "num_games_owned": 669, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513035800}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]This review is a Work in Progress, and will be subject to change as I play.[/h1]\n\nThis is perhaps one of the best Metroidvanias I have played so far, definately up there with Shadow Complex and SotN thus far.

One thing that does bug me though, and this is a minor niggle is the loading time when you die, it is kind of long. \n\nThis game does not have an autosave feature, instead it relies on manual save points (remember those?), and this actually works well for the game as Autosaves can sometimes mess up a save file (glares at Fallout 3).

I have played most every metroidvania on Steam, and a lot of others, and this is among the best.  It may not have as much of the RPG elements that I enjoy from the Castlevanias, but the action and exploration are excellent.  Many metroidvanias suffer a little bit from pacing and low platforming action, which is where this game shines. The game focuses on learning boss patterns and capitalizing on their vulnerable moments and works as well as classics like Mega Man.\nSome have commented that this game is not a Metroidvania.  I would argue that it definitely is.  The format is similar to Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia or the paintings in Portrait of Ruin.   You choose maps or levels to enter, but they are large and follow the traditional metroidvania format.  You learn skills that give you access to more areas, and the game does a great job of providing incentive to return to past levels to encounter new challenges and find secrets.\nThe sub-weapons are the highlight of the game. There are many to be discovered and all of them are useful in particular situations.  I often found myself stopping as I started a boss fight or challenging room to re-evaluate my strategy with a new sub-weapon. \nI didn't have high expectations for the story in a game with a rabbit as the main character.

Kinda sad, if you think about it.\n\nPharaoh Rebirth is something I would call a quasi-metroidvania style game. It's design and gameplay loop is very much similar to the Shantae and the Pirate's Curse. Yes, it is a platformer with unlockable items that let you get into new places and you are allowed to do some backtracking, but game's world isn't seamless and it is divided into separate levels. It's scope is slightly smaller than those of Shantae's but the core game structure is safe, sound and works reasonably well.\n\nThere is a lot of things to like in the game, even if those aren't always on the highest level of the genre. Combat is very satisfying, with good selection of moves and subweapons at the disposal of sympathetic, bunny-like protagonist. Enemies, bosses and level design also present a great deal of care and they are generally aspects that don't make me point out any immediate nitpicks.\n\nArtstyle is also a strong point of the title, with details and colors reminding me a lot of Cave Story. I would bet that for the Japanesee dev of Pharaoh, that well known, respected title was a source of inspiration. While sprites are amazing, I was a little disappointed by the level tiles and decorations that can get repetive and bland, making some levels boring to lot at. Similarly, music not always sold me on the game, but few tunes are really good and leave a good impression overall.\n\nAs for the major complains I have with the game, I would point out some problems with controls and the story. While combat is satisfying, I believe that jumps and movement of the main character could use some tuning up. Leaps are floaty and not very responsive, which is extremely jarring if you recently came back from 2D platformers with super-snappy controls like Sonic or Freedom Planet. As for the plot: it's not bad in reality, but sometimes there is a Megaman X5 syndrome creeping in, with constant dialog boxes that can hurt the flow of the levels.\n\nGame is short, but I believe it deserves a little bit more love, even if it isn't in the same league as some other indie blockbusters. I really can appreciate a honest effort put here on the display, but I game isn't exactly selling hot and I can get an idea why it is. Nowadays \"Being Good\" isn't enough to gain attention unfortunately. Never less, if this game somehow made you read this review, you can consider buying this for a full price or for a slight sale. Value proposition for Pharaoh Rebirth is on the reasonable level and I assume that this dev would appreciate a helping hand.\n\nPS This game has actual, high quality JoJo\u2019s Bizzare Adventure reference in the form of a certain subweapon.

Games which aren\u2019t just good in terms of graphics, level-design or story, but a great experience overall, like the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/yoj/recommended/345820/]Shantae[/url] series, [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/yoj/recommended/332200/]Axiom Verge[/url] or the genre-defining series of Metroid and Castlevania themselves, are few and far between. This makes discovering Pharaoh Rebirth ever so better.\n\nAll in all, Pharaoh Rebirth closely resembles the games from the Shantae series, which is good thing in my opinion, since those are great metroidvania games, which do many things right. From stylish old-school 2D graphics and great overall art style to an upbeat soundtrack that fits the game to the, from responsive and tight controls to balanced level design with just the right difficulty of platforming, the level of quality throughout all of Pharaoh Rebirth is surprisingly high.\n\nYou play as a renowned treasure hunter Dr. Jonathan Banfield [spoiler]coincidentally he was turned into a rabbit[/spoiler], who is assisted by his hacker friend Jack. While trying to stop your ex-companion Andre Betancourt [spoiler]coincidentally, turned into a turtle[/spoiler] from pillaging a legendary ancient Egypt oasis, you uncover an unknown sarcophagus. Andre\u2019s decision to open it results in you both being placed under pharaoh's curse to die in 7 days, so now both of you scramble to find the seven holy grails, which is the only way to save yourself from the curse. The story might not sound that interesting, but it fits the overall adventure atmosphere of the game just right. It is also greatly augmented by the game having charming and funny characters and quirky humor.\n\nGameplay is top notch, with all of the genre-specific features present and being done right. The game itself is divided into several different locations, each of them represented as a separate interconnected Metroid-style map, which isn\u2019t fully accessible to you right from the get go \u2014 some areas will be hidden off, while other will require having specific abilities to reach. When raiding each location, you\u2019ll find all sorts of treasures, which either boost your stats or unlock new abilities for your character. So it\u2019s always a good idea to go over the areas that you\u2019ve already visited after receiving these new abilities, as there might be more treasures waiting. Overall there are over 80 treasures scattered throughout the game and over 10 sub-weapons [spoiler]which will greatly improve your experience[/spoiler], different items, power-ups and so on. There are plenty of cleverly designed enemies (like Cycads and Totem Poles that blend into environment, or even False Jonathans that mimic your own appearance) and some not too hard boss-fights; at least they won\u2019t be hard when you\u2019ve powered up or have a good strategy for each boss. But bossfights aren't the only highlight, there\u2019s more: there are some on-rails platforming and turret sections to spice things up and break the flow of the game, an additional secret level (if you find all of the map pieces within the game) and a boss rush mode. The enemies also interact with the level in some cool and unexpected ways. For example, you see an exploding enemy. So what? Trigger and walk away. Now imagine the same enemy, but on the train. And the carriage you're standing on has just been decoupled. Pretty tense, huh?\n\nI can honestly say that going in, I didn\u2019t expect Pharaoh Rebirth to be such a great game in its whole, which makes it even sadder, when you look at its sales numbers: SteamSpy estimates sales at around 10k copies sold, which is just asinine, no matter how you look. So, if you\u2019re even slightly interested in such type of games, you should definitely give Pharaoh Rebirth a try.\n\nP.S.

Before this he was responsible for several freeware and doujin games such as [i]Return Of Egypt[/i], which serves as a quasi prequel to [b]Pharao Rebirth+[/b].\n\nFor this game Krobon was definitely inspired by [i]Castlevania: Symphony of the Night[/i] and similar games of the franchise. In other words you have the distinctive level design, the fancy combat mechanics (but rabbit ears instead of a whip), kinda like flying Medua heads, tons of items and upgradeable skills such as double jumps and suchlike.\n\nThe pixel art is adorable and detailed, the music is catchy, there's lighthearted J-humour and the controls respond crisply. From a design and programming perspective there's not much to complain.\n\nIt's also similar to the [i]Shantae[/i] games, so you'll definitely like it if you already played these. But keep in mind that [b]Pharao Rebirth+[/b] is nothing like [i]La-Mulana[/i], another J-game that looks pretty similar on the first glance. It's way less difficult and complex than that, has separate stages instead of a huge dungeon system and is much shorter on top of that.

I honestly couldn't find anything to dislike about it.\n\nFelt like sort of a mix of Metroid & Mega Man. Good amount of content - 7 Stages, a prologue, and a boss rush mode. Always with at least one boss per stage. Boss fights are well balanced and never cheap, and have an arcade-style feel to them. The difficulty level felt just about right on \"hard\" setting, so I'd recommend starting there unless you're completely new to the genre - it's really not very hard, especially with collectibles, powerups, and save points littered all over the place. That setting makes it just difficult enough that you may want to learn the boss moves & think about your approach a bit.\n\nSimilar to the old Metroid games, you'll pass some obvious barriers that require an ability you don't have yet, and will have to return later to explore new areas after gaining those abilities. The backtracking isn't bad and generally only takes a minute or two since you can stage select (and sometimes skip various portions of a stage). I think revisiting old stages is also optional for the most part, and not necessary to progress. \n\nCollectibles are done well and add to the experience rather than being a chore to hunt down - they generally add stats or a new ability, or are used in less obvious ways. They all have some flavor text too.\n\nSome people are hating on the car level, but I didn't find it to be overly jarring or out of place. It will just take a few tries to get through. If you're familiar with the old Donkey Kong Country games, its basically a mine cart level with lots of pits to fall in. And it does at least warn you of upcoming jumps and have several checkpoints mixed in.\n\nBiggest negative I experienced was some slowdown which required me to rework my nVidia settings a bit. For whatever reason, I had to manually enable v-sync and triple buffering in nVidia (and enable v-sync in game settings also) to make things run smoothly. However, I seem to be in the minority with this issue.\n\nOverall: Highly recommended.

The stages offer a good amount of variety, the bosses are for the most part simple but still fun to fight. \n\nThe soundtrack is really nice. \n\nThe story isn't really deep or anything and the humor seems a bit forced at times, it's still enjoyable though. \n\nThe controls work but they could be a little more refined. Jumping sometimes doesn't feel as responsive as it should be and there really is no reason not to use more buttons than are used. \n\nYou only get a single save slot which for this kind of game and in this day and age is not justifiable.\n\nWhat I really dislike about this game is the \"car stage\" (actually the first part of a stage) which you can't skip on revisits and which you have to do to get some of the collectibles. It's really annoying and doesn't fit in with the rest of the game. \n\nOther than that, the game is good and I very much recommend giving it a try!\n\nOne more thing, the amount of challenge you'll get out of this depends on the difficulty setting you choose and how much you beef up yourself by getting all the different collectibles.

The game takes place in Egypt and features a wide variety of Egyptian locations, creatures, and folklore for you to encounter. \n\nThis game is incredibly well polished for an indie title. The sprite-based graphics are fluid and full of little details, the soundtrack is catchy, and good snappy controls (save for a small exception). There\u2019s loads of attention dedicated to minor things like how certain subweapons work underwater or in heavy winds or the number of cleverly hidden secrets and how to reveal them. The story is really good too and has a few surprises in store for the player as well as a bonus level if you find a certain item.\n\nDespite all the pros I mentioned earlier, this game does have its drawbacks. To start, it\u2019s a bit short and the normal mode plays a bit more like easy mode. I highly recommend starting PR+ in hard difficulty to get the real experience and to try and get the secret level to really get your gameplay\u2019s worth.  Also the mapping system is a bit annoying with how it comes up if you hit up twice and I accidentally triggered it a lot as a result.\n\nAll in all, I had an overall positive experience with Pharaoh Rebirth+ even though I had to play it all over again due to a nasty bug (see below) but the game was so good I didn\u2019t even mind. I highly recommend this title to any fan of metroidvanias.\n\nBEWARE: there is a game breaking bug in the 6th stage boss fight. To avoid it: stay near the left side of the area for the entire fight.

"playtime_forever": 485, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478154103}, "language": "english", "review": "Quick and dirty: YOU can play this game; it's not nearly as hard as it seems. If you want a Metroidvania in an Order of Ecclesia style (focusing on shorter levels with tigther design over progression systems and exploration), this is it. It feels great to play. There's a lotta room for player expression with subweapon use. Weirdly engaging plot. But it's a bit of a hesitant recommendation. It's definitely worth the normal asking price, though. If you want it, get it whenever.\n\nIts controls are tight, but not corset-tight (particularly, 1) playing with a joystick causes some awkward hiccups; diagonals are interpreted as 2 keyboard keys; this causes issues with reading signs mid-jump or misalligning shots with a certain weapon, 2) the edges of platforms are almost TOO accurate to the architecture, yet your character's \"feet\" for determining collision with the ground are smaller than the sprite's). \n\nThe Metroidvania progression feels reeeeally forced and hoakey. These aren't gimmicks that get you to look at levels in new lights; there are obvious barriers to progress to single, empty rooms with singular power up items. If you try to go back each time you get a progress power-up, you'll be disappointed. Only breaking boxes and double jumping give you new, fun challenges.\n\nThe looser Metroidvania structure also hurts it as an action-platformer. It feels as if checkpoint placement wasn't considered in a non-linear fashion; this is most obvious in Stage 4, where the placement of enemies along slow, elevator-like grapple chains assumes a vertical or downward ascent based on an optimal level route that isn't clear until completion.\n\nThe game can be suddenly punishing (mine cart level, ahoy!), especially with its long GAME OVER screen, but the lack of difficulty makes a game bursting with personality play like a vanilla wafer. There are many mechanics which are interesting but never required or dramatically helpful. You get a massive iinvincibility-frame dash, an aerial attack that pushes you back up slightly in the air, etc.--but there are no segments that force you to use the dash or platforming using this unique mechanic. If anything, their use trivializes much of the stage and boss design. You CAN finesse boss fights, but brute-forcing them is just as effective.\n\nA lot of the bosses have amazing, well thought-out, varied patterns that interact in surprising ways with your arsenal of subweapons... but you can easily just eat 1 carrot per bossfight (makes you invincible for 10+ seconds and ups your attack power), use your i-frame dash to cheese through their attacks that punish you for staying at close range once it wears off, and rush them down. The reward for succesfully figuring out good sub-weapons to use is often not the difference between survival and defeat, but seeing much less of a great boss than it feels you should.\n\nIt's a game that's less than the sum of its parts. But, it's still neat as hell.\n\nThe aesthetics are on point. The music has an emotional breadth while never failing to raise intrigue in cutscenes or keep you pumped up during levels. The sprites are GORGEOUS--please, play this in windowed mode if you can't get this to scale by whole numbers in fullscreen. Some of the use of paralax bakgrounds and varying visual styles among enemies and bakgrounds--it's this wonderful mash of strict depiction and heavy abstraction at once (just see the main character set up against beautiful, lineless backdrops of palm-trees and the ocean's horizon line).\n\nAnd there are some real feats of creative game design--particularly, check out how the machine gun interacts with chokepoints in the environment or how much enemy interaction changes once you consider the claymore in stage 4... but much of it is just an unchallenging, decompressed action platformer that saves its flair for boss fights and laaate game optional rooms, leaving a lot of unimpressive downtime.\n\nOh, and the story?? Is excellent?? Reminds me of when movies took queues from movies but didn't try to be them--it has punchy little asides between action segments to progress the plot with laugh-out-loud dialogue.

The screenshots and trailer didn't do much for me, but the gifs on the developer's Twitter page (https://twitter.com/krobon) got me interested. The 'behind the scenes' of the game looked so cool! So, based on the quality of those gifs, I bought the game...and I'm SO glad I did. 'Pharaoh Rebirth +' is an exceptionally well made game with a lot of heart. It's also SUPER fun to play. :)\n\nPROS\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n- Likable and well-written characters. I was surprised how much I cared for the characters in this game. Everyone is just so likable and fleshed out. VERY cute and funny dialogue throughout.\n- Excellent gameplay. The game runs at a smooth 60 FPS and feels very responsive. LOTS of polish in gameplay overall. Very well done.\n- Fun abilities. This is a big one. This is a video game that is not afraid to have fun being a video game. (Following is a minor spoiler) One of the abilities allows you to change your ears into a paper airplane to glide across wide gaps. That right there should tell you everything you need to know. It's silly, it's funny, it's unconventional and it was ALWAYS very fun to play. :)\n- There's a metroidvania element, with abilities allowing you to access areas you couldn't previously. However, it has a level-based structure, instead of one big map. This is actually really cool, since it allowed you to just go back to the level where you remember an element was and explore more in that area.\n- GREAT music. It's so good. The soundtrack is on my computer right now. LOVE the music SO MUCH!! \n- When it was over, I got kinda bummed out since I wanted more to play. That (to me) is always a sign of a great game. I've put 12 hours into the game, beaten it - and still go back quite often to play levels. It's just FUN to play.\n- LOTS of abilities and collectibles. If you like to play with new, interesting abilities and find cool collectibles, you'll love this game. ^_^\n\nCONS\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n- There are a couple times where the main gameplay is not platforming. Like, they'll have mini-games, puzzles, driving sections and things like that. While I understand that those sections were there to provide variety, they were also my least liked sections of this game. This game EXCELS in platforming, so I just wanted to spend more time doing that. It didn't feel good to get stuck on a section that gameplay-wise didn't have anything to do with the rest of the game. Thankfully, these moments were brief. Just thought I'd mention them here. \n- I hear that this game launched kinda rough in regards to vsync support and things like that. I think the devs have pretty much fixed all those issues. Again, just mentioning it. \n- The analog controls didn't seem to work 100% of the time for me. The devs patched in a deadzone option, but even with it at the max setting, my character still drifts to the left sometimes. Thus, I ended up playing it with the D-Pad (as opposed to the left analog stick) on a wired Xbox 360 controller. That solved the problem.\n\nOVERALL\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n'Pharaoh Rebirth +' is a fantastic game with a lot of heart. Though there were initially a few technical hangups, the fun of the game overcame those shortcomings and I had a BLAST with this game. SO much fun. Very much looking forward to what the devs work on next! :)\n\nP.S. If you want to see another game that the devs have worked on, you can check out 'Action Mogura'. It's available for free online! :) A bit of warning, though: It's only in Japanese and MUCH more difficult than 'Pharaoh Rebirth +'. I beat it in a few days, though - so it's quite playable. Just letting you know. ^_^\n\nFINAL SCORE\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n9 out of 10", "timestamp_created": 1464151039, "timestamp_updated": 1464151039, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503311", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23052153": {"recommendationid": "23052153", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025387504", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 357, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463561040}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u97f3\u6a02\u3001\u7f8e\u8853\u3001\u52d5\u4f5c\u8ddf\u6d41\u66a2\u5ea6\u90fd\u7121\u8a71\u53ef\u8aaa\uff0c\u5287\u60c5\u8ddf\u5c0d\u8a71\u90fd\u5f88\u6709\u8da3\uff0csteam\u7248\u9644\u5e36\u984d\u5916\u5167\u5bb9\u53ea\u8ce3278\uff0c\u4e0d\u5f97\u4e0d\u8aaa\u9019\u904a\u6232\u6253\u8db4Rabi-Ribi\u5341\u689d\u8857\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1463565629, "timestamp_updated": 1463565629, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454545", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22895165": {"recommendationid": "22895165", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090397967", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463573304}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6e38\u620f\u5f88\u68d2\u3002\n\u4f18\u70b9\uff1a\n1.\u9898\u6750\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u90fd\u5f88\u4e30\u5bcc\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u770b\u51fa\u5236\u4f5c\u4e0b\u4e86\u5f88\u5927\u529f\u592b\u3002\n2.\u6536\u96c6\u8981\u7d20\u5f88\u591a\uff0c\u5730\u56fe\u524d\u540e\u671f\u7684\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e5f\u8ba9\u6e38\u620f\u5f88\u8010\u73a9\u3002\n3.\u624b\u611f\u597d\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u597d\u7684\u624b\u611f\u662f\u8fd9\u7c7b\u6e38\u620f\u6210\u529f\u7684\u4e00\u534a\u3002\n4.\u97f3\u4e50\u867d\u7136\u79f0\u4e0d\u4e0a\u60ca\u8273\uff0c\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bf4\u886c\u6258\u6c1b\u56f4\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u8003\u53e4\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u97f3\u4e50\u628a\u73af\u5883\u6e32\u67d3\u7684\u5f88\u597d\u3002\n\n\u7f3a\u70b9\uff1a\n1.\u6709\u7684\u5730\u65b9\u5f3a\u884c\u5806\u96be\u5ea6\u3002\n\n7.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1462886459, "timestamp_updated": 1462934944, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.995006", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22830506": {"recommendationid": "22830506", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050749286", "num_games_owned": 460, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 510, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462572237}, "language": "english", "review": "Really Really good.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6YxhDtmhzA", "timestamp_created": 1462557893, "timestamp_updated": 1462557893, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482098", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22807148": {"recommendationid": "22807148", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997517073", "num_games_owned": 449, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 414, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462257295}, "language": "english", "review": "[i]Pharaoh Rebirth+[/i] is a really cute Castlevania-lite game that's big on setpieces and dialogue rather than exploration. The lead character has great animation, can attack in multiple directions, and moves pretty fast. I found the amount of chatting between the characters was a bit much for me, but I did appreciate how distinct each character felt in the end. I'm not sure a game like this needs lots of banter but it made me laugh a few times and can be skipped if you don't want to bother.\nWhen I call [i]Pharaoh Rebirth+[/i] a \"Castlevania-lite\" I mean it's more like [i]Order of Ecclesia[/i] than [i]Symphony of the Night[/i]. The game occurs over a series of stages rather than one large level. You can replay stages as much as you like, re-fight bosses if you choose, and once you find an item it's yours forever. A lot of collectibles don't do much though, and many stages have dead-end hallways that make exploration less fun than it should be. There's also a \"driving\" stage which is basically a minecart level and a complete waste of time.\nHowever, the lead character is charming and fun to control. The boss battles are exciting. The story never pays off in interesting ways, but the characters have more personality than they normally do in games like this.

Stages are stand alone stages you can revisit at any time once you complete them. A fun game either way and a bit challenging on Hard for boss fights until you get some super powered items way later or respond incredibly well (or eat all your carrots).\n\nExploration and finding items among backtracking after you find abilities to find more items is really prevalent in this title. A plus or minus for fans of those.\n\nI only found a few of the lines to be funny from all its quirky dialogue. Some of the music was pretty great, too.\n\nThe driving stage is still kind of a pain, though. For the rest, they seem fun enough. More of a pain for achievements. It's easier by difficulty, though.\n\nAs an ending note, leave at least one of all your food items if you want the collector achievement or you can play through it all again..", "timestamp_created":

I still stand by everything I said in my review about the game itself, but this REALLY needs to be fixed. I recommend backing up your saves in case something bad happens (especially do this at the start of the Cairo level), nonetheless, a; big problem to take note of. I suspect it happens specifically for that specific boss because it's not a battle that you can spawn out later; it may also happen to other non-\"Guardian\" bosses that don't re-spawn. So just to be safe, occasionally back-up your saves and/or try to beat bosses instantly once you come across them. I'm conflicted because this is a fantastic game everyone should experience but something really awkward happened while I was playing it. Just... keep your save file safe, and if something similar DOES happen to you too please report it ASAP.\n\n===Original unedited review===\n\nKrobon, a depressingly little-known Japanese indie developer, along with composer Pepo and illustrator Doromizu, made one of the finest indie games I've ever played: treasure-hunting, exploratory platform game with the showmanship and over-the-top, inventive craziness of the best arcade games. Before I continue praising this game though, I'll have to make a little side-note: those expecting the interconnected worlds of traditional \"Metroidvanias\" might be disappointed: this game features a more streamlined, stage-based layout. Don't mistake \"streamlining\" for \"hand-holding\", though; all the hidden passages and invisible walls are for you to discover; the enemies and platforming for you to defeat, as they can and will kill you if you're not paying attention or using your skills effectively (on that note I recommend playing on Hard mode for the best experience). Krobon offers us some absolutely out-there scenarios presented in a suitably exaggerated way, including (I'll try to make this as non-spoilerish as possible by not giving away the context, though feel free to skip the paragraph if you're bothered by even the most minor of spoilers) **********dodging lasers from outer-space while using a Jojo's Bizarre Adventure-like Stand to beat up crazed Egyptian hotel employees. And you can also get drunk off your ass while doing so.***********. Yes, that is a thing that happens.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty much as good as this type of game gets; the controls are spotless, the difficulty curve is near-perfect (maybe the first Guardian boss is a LITTLE too hard given what came before, but that's a massive nitpick), the levels are well-designed and nicely varied... and perhaps best of all, the game doesn't let you ruin its challenge by allowing you to mindlessly grind. The ONLY way to build your stats in this game is by exploring the levels and finding hidden items, which is perfect for the tone of the game. The unlocking of skills and thus areas that were inaccessible in the past is gradual, yet just fast enough to make you feel like you're constantly making progress and getting stronger as you go along on your epic adventure. To avoid any hassle, though, I recommend screencapping the mini-map whenever you uncover a dead end that requires a later skill; or, if you're THAT type of player, drawing your own map using pencil and paper. Some might take issue with the car-driving stage and the somewhat trial-and-error way of collecting all the treasure by making blind jumps. Another minor gripe is the lack of a fast-travel system, which I personally would have liked; but, much like this game's other flaws, it is just that: a minor gripe that shouldn't keep you from playing this game (after all, the stage-based setup is kind of like a fast travel system of its own and the levels become easier to navigate as you unlock more skills). Another such minor gripe includes the lack of specific sliders for music and sound; there's just a simple sound volume slider and that's it.\n\nNarratively, Rebirth does a great job for what it is; the dialogue never felt like it was wasting my time, and if YOU feel like it's wasting yours, you can always skip pretty much every cutscene, even if you haven't gone through it before. I don't recommend it, though; the presentation as a whole actually makes you feel like you're really an archeologist, exploring every nook and cranny of a strange yet often surprisingly serious cartoon world. In fact, the juxtaposition of comedic shenanigans with dramatic moments and even little nuggets of brief yet oddly-fitting sociopolitical commentary make the writing a huge treat, somewhat comparable to an Osamu Tezuka story. The translators also did a great job at making the dialogue have a natural flow to it, which is great because the character interaction is charming and often genuinely funny. The Egyptian atmosphere is nicely complemented by Pepo's tunes, which succeed at giving the game a dynamic action-adventure feeling.\n\nGraphically, Pharaoh Rebirth would have been impressive even if it came from a team of hard-working sprite artists. However, if Krobon's own Twitter account is any indication, he's responsible for absolutely every bit of pixel art and animation in the game, with Doromizu only having the job of drawing the non-pixelated character art and portraits. As someone who's obsessively into animation, this is particularly impressive to me because this is one of *THOSE* 2D sprite-based games; the kind that, instead of simply doing its job to serve the gameplay, genuinely takes into account the principles of animation to make controlling your character and fighting enemies feel particularly lively. It's not quite on the level of games like Metal Slug 3 or Super Tempo in terms of feeling like you're playing a wonderfully made cartoon (the use of color could use some work, for example), but it's still pretty up there and Krobon is a very high-level sprite artist. The animation and believable physics (shooting tennis balls underwater makes them float to the top!) makes navigating the levels and fighting enemies feel fluid and fun.\n\nThe fact that this game has been out for so long while not being covered at all by the gaming press shows just how little hard work and clever, well-executed ideas matter in the anglosphere's indie gaming scene. Along with Krobon's inability to make connections with indie-clique darlings and journos comes the dreary number of only TWO Metacritic reviews of this game. This unfairness is why I only now decided to point out that there is a shareware, untranslated version of the game out there. Beyond the English script, it lacks the extra stage of the Steam version along with the difficulty settings (and likely other stuff; I only played a tiny bit of the shareware version), but I chose to buy this primarily to support an extremely talented underdog developer who put loads of love, care and effort into creating a charming little adventure that should not be forgotten.\n\nAlso, a little hint: there's an item you can ONLY get from right after the first boss battle by doing a specific thing over and over again. Otherwise, say goodbye to 100% completion.\n\n===Edit upon completion===\n\nIf you spend a lot of time exploring, you might end up too powerful and the end bosses will be too easy.

It's not enough for me to say that this is a really good game, and that it's a hidden gem well-deserving of your time. I have to write something that goes above and beyond, so that you come away thinking \"Wow! This is serious! I must play this game immediately!\" This is the difficulty I've run into when writing about games that are really impressive. Aside from having a mediocre vocabulary, I'm too used to discussing what's wrong with games, to really explain what's right with them.\n\nFor example, let's start with the controls. When the controls are thoroughly solid, then there's actually nothing to discuss. In this game, moving the anthropomorphic rabbit around is as natural and easy as turning one's palm. The controls are so good, that you won't notice them. They're like an extension of yourself. As the game progresses, Jonathan (the rabbit) acquires new moves and abilities, and the experience continues to be perfectly seamless. Another aspect that goes un-noticed when it's handled properly is the mechanics. The hit-boxes are great, the game doesn't try your patience with cheap hits, and nothing stands out... poorly. \n\nOft-times with Metroidvanias, there's only so much of an incentive to explore. [i]Pharaoh Rebirth+[/i] strikes a good middle-ground with its plethora of collectible treasures. What makes exploration interesting is that not all of the items are helpful. Some exist solely to fill slots in your collection screen, while others can boost stats or award hidden skills. This adds another layer of mystery to the adventure. Every time you discover a hidden artifact, you gain a sense of anticipation. Whereas in most other similarly-designed games, all you have to look forward to is another heart container, or a slightly larger box to hold more daffodils. When you fight enemies in that other game, are you even using the daffodils? It's a completely meaningless collectible. \n\nThe sub-weapons in this game are not only fun to use, but they're also very helpful. While Jonathan's ears are just as deadly as any whip, the sub-weapons allow you to approach situations and bosses in different ways. Some of them can have other uses as well. There's a certain point very late in the game where you're faced with a spike pit. Over this pit is a floor, but most of the sections are false, and you'll fall to your death if you attempt to cross. The first weapon you obtain is a machine-gun... that fires tennis balls. As they bounce across the ground, they'll helpfully point out which sections of the floor are false, so you can safely pass. It reminds me of [i]Megaman 2[/i].\n\nThese days, it seems like every indie title references classic games from the distant past. Thankfully, [i]Pharaoh Rebirth+[/i] sets itself apart by implementing its references in a clever manner. As far as I can tell, the least subtle reference is one of the characters having the name Belmondo. Just from playing through the game, the Konami influences are pretty clear, but you're not going to get hit over the head with them. It also helps that the character-designs are charming and have their own unique look. The soundtrack is thoroughly fantastic as well.\n\nFor the most part, the level-design is superb. Since every stage is self-contained, there isn't a need to make sure that each location connects to the others. The stages are well-designed, so that the first play-through is sufficiently enthralling. Also, you're welcome to repeat stages to find all of the hidden treasures. In many cases this is required, since the double-jump isn't available until towards the end. When repeating a previously-cleared stage, the pacing is speedy, and you can even take advantage of a few shortcuts.\n\nBut you're probably wondering what I meant when I wrote \"For the most part\". Well, this game has a vehicle-section. In stage 4, you have to drive a jeep. Actually, you don't drive it so much as time jumps to avoid plummeting to your death. To start things off with a positive I can say this much: It could've been a lot worse. There are visual and audio warnings when a jump is coming, and there are four checkpoints, which is pretty generous for a section that should take less than four minutes. \n\nStill, \"driving the jeep\" in [i]Pharaoh Rebirth+[/i] is a textbook example of everything that's wrong with vehicle-sections. Several years ago, I actually wrote an opinion-piece on the subject. Looking back at it now, \"driving the jeep\" covers all of the bases. I played through this game on the normal level of difficulty, and I died more times on the jeep than anywhere else in the game. A sizable number of these deaths can also be attributed to the annoyingly-placed treasures throughout the stage. Also, If I want to 100% complete the game and get all of the achievements, I have to perfect my driving skills. To that I say: No thanks. All that said, the vehicle-section in this game isn't terrible, and it probably won't grind everything to a screeching halt, but I would have gladly traded this section away for a fully-featured stage.\n\nThe only other complaint I have is that you can only have one save-game at a time. I suppose this could be worked around by moving the old save-file to a different folder. I'll have to give it a shot sometime, because I'm really curious about the hard difficulty-setting.\n\nAside from an unfortunate vehicle-section, [i]Pharaoh Rebirth+[/i] is a superb game. It's a reminder that yes, even today there are great 16-bit/32-bit inspired action-platformers getting released. It's a shame I couldn't come up with anything significant to say though. What can I say? Even when I recognize quality, it's tough to put together the words that do it justice.\n\n[i]Disclaimer: For the purpose of this review, a key was provided by the publisher.[/i]\n\n[i]If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Original_Curators_Group#curation]Follow Original Curator Group[/url][/i]", "timestamp_created": 1459402011, "timestamp_updated": 1459454316, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 67, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.815327", "comment_count": "12", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22132675": {"recommendationid": "22132675", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006449608", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 452, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459911295}, "language": "english", "review": "about 50% finish right now. its pretty good so far but the controls do lag behind a bit. also a warning for the new buyers that want to play the game. configure your controls, the defaut is spelunky", "timestamp_created": 1459292663, "timestamp_updated": 1459292663, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22113994": {"recommendationid": "22113994", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008498140", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 8922, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480188570}, "language": "english", "review": "You play as a cute bunni :3", "timestamp_created": 1459204994, "timestamp_updated": 1459204994, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.437666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22113089": {"recommendationid": "22113089", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996138858", "num_games_owned": 392, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459201082}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, i love it, not a TRUE metroidvania, but got a lot of similarity with the items you find.\nHope we ll get more and more game from japan localized in english like this one :)", "timestamp_created": 1459201301, "timestamp_updated": 1459201301, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22110263": {"recommendationid": "22110263", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073088368", "num_games_owned": 369, "num_reviews": 92, "playtime_forever": 258, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509324376}, "language": "english", "review": "I just finished this game and I have a lot to say abot this game.

It's really a shame because there's so much care put into this work that might get overshadowed by tons of pointless \"retro\" platformers which come out every day.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nMechanics-wise, the game is pretty solid. There are various moves that can be executed from the start and others to be unlocked. Overall, combat works as intended and every enemy or boss has a dinstinct pattern that often intersects nicely with the level layouts.\n\nPlayer progression is not based on elements borrowed from RPG's like experience points or equipment, but instead rewards exploring and collecting the different, unique treasures scattered through the ruins and temples of Egypt.\n\nInstead of presenting itself with one, massive area that blocks your progress whenever you don't possess the right ability to get through, the game has a standard, stage-based structure. This helps in limiting both the backtracking factor and the typical \"fake sense of freedom\" of the genre.\n\nI found the level design to be quite clever, as it encourages exploration by showing the player unaccessible routes right from the start, but never requires to backtrack to a previous stage to get to the next. This means freedom of choosing  to get on with the story OR to go back and replay a chapter to get all the extra stuff which could come in handy, without being forced to revisit some old areas to get a mandatory powerup.\n\nThe classic stage-based structure also makes it easier to carry out more action-oriented set pieces, like a helicopter pursuit or a mine car ride.\n\n[h1]Art Direction[/h1]\n\nTechnically speaking, Pharaoh Rebirth+ looks and sounds great. The high-res (640x480) nicely crafted and animated pixel art is matched by an upbeat, memorable soundrack which features an obvious Egyptian vibe. However, digitally painted character portraits that show up during radio chatter fall a bit short, as they look detached from the overall style and don't really match its quality.\n\nI recommend playing the game using its original 4:3 ratio, as stretching 2D art is a crime, especially when it's done so well.\n\n[h1]Technical Issues[/h1]\n\nAs of today, screen resolution selection and VSync have been fixed, so I don't have anything else to report at this time.\n\n[h1]So, should I play it?[/h1]\n\nYES, you should.

And yes, bad opening joke for this review. But Pharaoh Rebirth+ is a solid but not spectular game in the metroidvania genre, specifically harking back to the days of the NES with it's specific yet purposeful enemy placement and level designs. There's a good mixture of combat, platforming, and exploration with not too much backtracking, and a good set of systems that complement each other overall. Good variations of level backgrounds, good change of pace gameplay, there's a lot of good, not great here.  There's a bunch of fun to be had here, I just wish that the game was better implemented, with the 360 controller not working for me at all, and resolutions options that aren't really up to par with modern day systems (and not even any options for the full screen entirely. There are also some inconsistencies in the design, as some of the levels have areas that you're just on the cusp on making the jump, only to realize that you just don't have the ability to actually make it. It's no where near a big problem, but it's more of an annoyance that keeps on showing up over and over again, getting a tiny bit more annoying each time. But regardless, it's a good game that's appropriate for it's price point, and is worth your time if you like the genre.\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]Positives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Nostalgia takes hold with classic Castlevania (NES) gameplay. Rushing through areas will get your ass kick, as enemy placement and damage is purposeful and has a certain rhythm to it.\n[*] Controls work well in giving the preciseness you need to snipe enemies with your whip-ears while not being too loose for the platforming.\n[*] Good difficulty ramp as the game isn't brutal, but again, punishes impatience and expects precision. Some good difficult platforming portions that require skill and challenge. \n[*] Great visual designs complemented with great animation quality. Watching Jonathan eat food in particular was always fun. \n[*] Secondary weapons provide specific purposes and are very useful when busted out in that right situation. Not over powered, but good complements to the whip.\n[*] Great Level Design and enemy placement as a whole. Developers understood their game and it's engine's strengths rather well. \n[/list]\n\n[b]Negatives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] 720p resolution in windowed mode, and not even a resolution option for full screen mode.\n[*] Recording wise, was a nightmare. FRAPS gave performance issues, OBS was like \u201cNope\u201d, and shadowplay while working, recorded at 640x480. \n[*] Missing basic options expected on a PC port, such as music/sound sliders (just one slider for audio in a pre-launcher)\n[*] Some enemies blend too much in the background, not giving enough of a clue of where they are on screen in order to deal with them. \n[*] Some parts have trial and error learning mechanics that don't do a very good job of teaching the player that they can't do the specific event right now. \n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1458241279, "timestamp_updated": 1458313821, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547912", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39501566": {"recommendationid": "39501566", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076721797", "num_games_owned": 673, "num_reviews": 428, "playtime_forever": 694, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 694, "last_played": 1516337166}, "language": "english", "review": "I would definitely consider this a solid and enjoyable metroidvania, though at the same time it's not amazing and not one I'm likely to remember that much or come back to in the future.\n\nThe structure is less of a big open world and more smaller, maze-like levels with lots of secrets tucket away. It does scratch that metroidvania itch in a few levels but there are also several really linear and flat levels as well. Oh, and the car level is just pure trash. Complete waste of a level slot when there's only a total of 9 levels to begin with.\n\nThe combat is pretty good though, there's a lot of subweapons I never used but Jonathan feels good to control and has a lot of different melee attack options - basic attacks, a mid-air spin attack, when you get the double-jump it also functions as an attack (and a reall effective one), slide is an attack and you can even slide in midair (which the game never tells you and is also required for a few of the hidden treasures, ok, bleh). The bosses for the most part (aside from the bonus level boss and the secret boss) are really easy and pattenered though. You might die once or twice but after you see their pattern there's not much that can touch you. Especially if you go back and replay levels to collect treasures you missed or couldn't get the first time.\n\nThe platforming too, it's solid. The game reserves the really tricky platforming stuff for the bonus level but there's still moments of interesting stuff happening in the rest of the levels. Jonathan has maybe a bit slow of a ground speed but other than that he's pretty mobile and the game gives you lots of movement options to play around with. I never found any of the platforming really that hard though, even the stuff with instakills, the combat is clearly where more of the challenge is intended to go.\n\nPresentation-wise I'm not a huge fan of the art style but it looks fine enough in general. The music on the other hand is actually really dang good - personal favorite would be the song for the nile level but there's a lot of good stuff there. The plot's a bit cliche and predictable but it's serviceable enough & kept me interested so, ehh?\n\nOverall this is like. A fun game and a reasonable amount of content for the price too, but I wouldn't ever see myself calling it one of my favorite games of all time, it doesn't really strongly have an identity, just does what it does well enough to remain pretty enjoyable throughout (except the car level. screw that noise.)", "timestamp_created": 1516511499, "timestamp_updated": 1516511499, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39248023": {"recommendationid": "39248023", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993775740", "num_games_owned": 133, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 293, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 293, "last_played": 1515645923}, "language": "english", "review": "I decided to purchase Pharaoh Rebirth+ after thoroughly enjoying Shin Megami Tensei: Synchronicity Prologue (same developer).

In return for saving him Alwen requests his help in taking back her stolen magic - thus begins the adventure of an unlikely duo.\nThe premise is honestly nothing special, but Zwei Zwei easily pulls it off with a great dynamic between the two leads, a fun and quirky supporting cast and an amazing localisation. The story also has its fair share of twists and turns and can be as fun and whimsical as it can be serious and emotional. I teared up at the end.\n\nIt's an ARPG where you play both Ragna and Alwen. Ragna uses his fancy Anchor Gear for melee and Alwen her magic. Both get a variety of upgrades through the course of the game to spice things up. It's not as tight as Ys combat but very fun in it's own right.\nYou can also get a number of pets which you can level up and they help you battle and collect gold and item drops.\n\nLeveling is done by eating food - that's right, you don't earn EXP directly but monsters instead drop food that gives you EXP when eaten. But! You can trade 10 of the same food for 1 better food that gives lots more EXP. And trade 10 of those again, etc. It's a fun system.\n\nCombat is almost exclusively done in dungeons (though that doesn't mean they look boring, there's a huge variety). You get ranked between Bronze and Platinum based on speed, damage taken and destructibles destroyed, there are chests and treasure to find and puzzles to solve.\n\nThere's also a surprisingly big amount of optional content. There's an arena with a bunch of optional bosses, you can collect monster models, there's a snowboarding minigame, collect treasure for the museum, fill the character notes by talking to the NPCs (in typical Falcom fashion the NPCs are very fleshed out and change their dialogue all the time). You can also talk to animals with an accessory you can get early in the beginning of the game. \n\nObviously the music is fantastic too.\n\nAn all around great game.", "timestamp_created": 1514044338, "timestamp_updated": 1514044338, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.619138", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38482503": {"recommendationid": "38482503", "author": {"steamid": "76561198160868511", "num_games_owned": 562, "num_reviews": 338, "playtime_forever": 4996, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 284, "last_played": 1513791165}, "language": "english", "review": "An awesome action RPG/dungeon crawler with endearing characters,cute artstyle,a beautiful soundtrack and a solid action gameplay somewhat reminiscent if the one in the YS games.\nIt also bear mentioning that this pc port is really well done and gives the player control a ton of graphical option to ensure you get the best possible experience and runs well on lower end rigs too.", "timestamp_created": 1513848938, "timestamp_updated": 1513848998, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506887", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38119255": {"recommendationid": "38119255", "author": {"steamid": "76561198292067899", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1360, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513464550}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Adorei o jogo, a hist\u00f3ria, o humor nos dialogos, os personagens, a jogabilidade, a trilha sonora! a unica coisa q senti falta seria o texto em portugu\u00eas, mas tenho certeza que com o apelo dos f\u00e3s a empresa possa fazer uma atualiza\u00e7\u00e3o.", "timestamp_created": 1512616070, "timestamp_updated": 1512616070, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38108726": {"recommendationid": "38108726", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011002622", "num_games_owned": 299, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1632, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512451173}, "language": "english", "review": "You level up by eating food, literally, the american dream.\n\nNow seriously, this game is a blast, plays like a japanese diablo/torchlight (you even have pets) okish story/graphics, nice dialog, lots of secrets, lots of ^^replayability^^, get it, you wont regret!", "timestamp_created": 1512580222, "timestamp_updated": 1512580222, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543680", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38000384": {"recommendationid": "38000384", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970405162", "num_games_owned": 109, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 584, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510504229}, "language": "english", "review": "Perfectly charming.

Gameplay is much like Ys with two controllable characters: one melee and one elemental spellcaster and switching back and fourth between them is both instant and fluid.  In fact you can create large combos in otherwise a simple button mashing experience.  The game doesn't overstay its welcome, getting onto the next plot point or dungeon without making you grind through hundreds of floors first.

About 18 hours later and I can now say that it did indeed meet my expectations, if not exceeded them.\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n[b]Excellent gameplay.[/b] This game was simply just fun to play overall. The dungeons were a lot of fun to explore and I even found myself returning to them later on to grab the treasure and such I may have missed. Doing so can lead to upgrades for the primary weapon, new combo attacks, and treasure just waiting to be appraised at the guild hall in town. Filling up the museum in town, Animal Crossing style, was quite fun, especially because the player actually gets paid to do so, rather than being just strictly donation-based. I actually enjoyed talking to the various people scattered across the game world, filling up character bios and just learning more about the colorful world I found myself in. I never felt that I was too overpowered either, as there were always new enemies with different attacks that I had to learn to work around. The game balanced its difficulty well and kept the experience fresh throughout.\n\n[b]Enemy and boss variety.[/b] The enemy variety here is solid for a JRPG. There are close to 150 different enemies to be found across the game world and several unique bosses to fight. Constantly being introduced to new enemy types had me on my toes, trying to dodge all of the new attacks being thrown my way while also being able to dish out the damage. There were certain enemies that were quite frustrating to run into, but I found that such a challenge was warranted, as it made the game more than just a button-mashing experience that a lot of JRPGs today fall victim to. With such a variety of enemies available, there was never a dull moment going into a new dungeon, it was always an exciting experience.\n\n[b]The food-EXP mechanic.[/b] One of the more interesting changes this game makes on the JRPG formula is that enemies do not drop EXP. The player actually earns health and EXP from eating food. The different types of food dropped by the game\u2019s enemies and found in dungeon chests help to level up the player, with higher-quality food giving more EXP. The player also has the option of exchanging 10 of the same type of food for a single, higher-quality meal that gives much more health and EXP. This was a very interesting mechanic and felt like a fresh take on EXP mechanic.\n\n[b]Good soundtrack.[/b] The Falcom Sound Team has done another great job with the soundtrack for this game. The soundtrack here is just as good as the Ys and Legend of Heroes soundtracks and just as memorable. I had actually already listened to the soundtrack years ago, as this is a re-release of a game that came out in 2008, and was a fan of the soundtrack back then as well. My favorite track is \u201cTown of Artte\u201d.\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n[b]Voiced scenes to unvoiced and back.[/b] The English localization actually adds a plethora of lines that were previously unvoiced in Japanese, which is great, but that just makes the transition between voiced and unvoiced scenes that much more jarring. It seemed that only the really important scenes got voice acting, but I felt that similarly important scenes were skipped over when they should have been voiced as well (such as the scene right before the credits). The game would sometimes jump from voiced scenes to unvoiced scenes then back again. The voice acting was actually pretty decent for the most part, so it was very disappointing to find certain scenes unvoiced. I personally would have loved to have seen the macho man scenes voiced.\n\n[b]Fake 60fps.[/b] When I finally got into the actual gameplay (after a twenty minute introduction segment), I noticed that, while my fps counter read 60, the movement and animations felt like half of that. After some research, I found that this game makes use of frame doubling, so while overlays and such may say that the game is running at 60fps, it is actually just running at 30, with every frame doubled. While I was able to bear with the 30fps until the end, the game would have played so much better had there been true 60fps.\n\n[h1]Overall:[/h1]\n\nZwei: The Ilvard Insurrection does not shake up the JRPG formula too much outside of its unique EXP mechanic, but it does offer a fun dungeon-crawling experience with a good soundtrack to match. There may be a couple technical problems, but it was not enough to cripple the experience. Now I only hope that the original Zwei!! game gets localized as well\u2026\n\nVideo review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUQrI6DkhKU", "timestamp_created": 1511142471, "timestamp_updated": 1511142471, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478375", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36625288": {"recommendationid": "36625288", "author": {"steamid": "76561198335626253", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 60, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511103523}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u65e5\u8bed\u97f3\u9891\u548c\u5b98\u4e2d\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1511103631, "timestamp_updated": 1511103631, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566929", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36587386": {"recommendationid": "36587386", "author": {"steamid": "76561198256905178", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 8823, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1247, "last_played": 1514812699}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u3084\u305f\u3089\u3068\u5c16\u308a\u904e\u304e\u3066\u3082\u3044\u306a\u3044\u3057\u3001\u51f9\u307f\u3082\u5c11\u306a\u304f\u904a\u3073\u3084\u3059\u3044\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u3059\u3002\n\u3057\u304b\u3057\u306a\u304c\u3089\u9aa8\u592a\u3067\u3001\u6975\u3081\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306b\u3082\u7e1b\u308a\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306b\u3082\u3082\u3063\u3066\u3053\u3044\u306a\u9038\u54c1\u3067\u3059\u3002\n\nsteam\u7248\u306b\u306f\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u97f3\u58f0\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\u304c\u3001\u4f55\u304b\u3057\u3089\u306e\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u7248ZWEI2\u3092\u304a\u6301\u3061\u306a\u3089\n\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u7248wav\u30d5\u30a9\u30eb\u30c0\u306e\u4e2d\u8eab\u3092\u3001steam\u7248wav\u30d5\u30a9\u30eb\u30c0\u306e\u4e2d\u306b\u4e0a\u66f8\u304d\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3067\n\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u97f3\u58f0\u306b\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u306d\u3002\n\u305f\u3060\u3057\u305d\u306e\u307e\u307e\u4e0a\u66f8\u304d\u3057\u305f\u306e\u3067\u306f\u3001\u97f3\u58f0\u304c\u65b0\u9332\u3055\u308c\u305f\u90e8\u5206\u3092\u82f1\u8a9e\u3067\u558b\u3063\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3046\u306e\u3067\n\u6c17\u306b\u306a\u308b\u306e\u306a\u3089\u305d\u3082\u305d\u3082wav\u30d5\u30a9\u30eb\u30c0\u81ea\u4f53\u3092\u633f\u3052\u66ff\u3048\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3044\u307e\u3057\u3087\u3046\u3002\n\u307e\u3041\u3001\u3042\u308c\u3084\u3053\u308c\u3084\u3059\u308c\u3070\u97f3\u58f0\u3092\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u306b\u3057\u3066\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306f\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3068\u3044\u3046\u3053\u3068\u3067\u3002\n\n\u30b9\u30d0\u30eb\u304c\u975e\u5e38\u306b\u53ef\u611b\u3044\u3067\u3059\u306d\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1510979193, "timestamp_updated": 1510979193, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528347", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36543950": {"recommendationid": "36543950", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120859331", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2045, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510700040}, "language": "english", "review": "Masterpiece.", "timestamp_created": 1510803427, "timestamp_updated": 1510803427, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36527526": {"recommendationid": "36527526", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090930437", "num_games_owned": 528, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 3391, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511180135}, "language": "english", "review": "Zwei!! is amazing.

The game really brings the people of Ilvard to life and makes them all so memorable, like you'd expect from a Falcom game. The main characters are great, the voice acting is nice, and the game isn't too long nor too short, and I felt like all the optional side-quests/side-dungeons were aplenty if you wanted to further grow your arsenal or expand your experience. As expected of a Falcom game, the world feels lived in and the NPCs have their own lives and story-arcs should to choose to get to know them better. It really helps bring Ilvard to life. Additionally, all the denizens are just so well-done; the wide spectrum of personalities on display always keep things fun and interesting, and the goofiness of some of them is great. \n\nThe controller controls work great too!\n\nWhile the dunegons themselves are realtively easy (the bosses are where the meat of the challenge is) the timed challenges are a fun way to keep improving your runs through the dunegon if you'd like, and since repeating dungeons has the added benefit of more food, it never feels tedious to go back and play through a dungeon again. The food mechanic being both healing items and your only way to gain XP to level up was a super-fun mechanic to play with, and because I did so well in dungeons (and i'm a hoarder in RPGs), I had times where I was underleveled, eventually forcing my hand to eat, haha.\n\nAs expected of a Falcom game, the OST is outstanding, and never failed to deliver.\n\nI really liked the entire cast, and I like how the relationships former between all the characters, especially the main duo of Alwen and Ragna. Their partnership felt earned through the course of the game/story, and I honestly wish I could get another game with them!

OR you can keep the food and upgrade a stack of 10 of them in town for a significantly higher XP gaining food. So it becomes a trade off of needing to heal at any given moment versus converting it to a higher XP giving food so you can level up. \n\nThe art style may appear simple and cute first but the wide variety of facial animation and often time suggestive humor really gives it an identity with a cast of quirky and funny characters throughout the game.\n\nAs always XSEED did not skimp out on localizing and making sure this older PC game works on modern systems. Fantastic script translation as well surprisingly decent voice acting fillls out the higher impact moments. I just wish the Voice Actors were credited in the credits!\n\nOverall if you are looking for a Falcom style Action RPG or are disappointed with the current situation of Ys 8, I'd highly recommend this fantastic game to fill the void that still holds up today.", "timestamp_created": 1510471146, "timestamp_updated": 1510471146, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

The story, characters, setting and music is top notch. To put it simply, it gives me Brave Fencer Musashi vibes. It's a fantastic feeling that I longed for.\n\nGameplay is good as well. It has a simplified Ys vibe going which holds up pretty well. My main gripe with the gameplay though is the late-game where things can get pretty broken in your favor if you dig too deep. It just leads to bland gameplay. With that said, I suggest leaving obvious extra late-game content for after you beat the game. I think that should lead to a better balanced and fun late-game.

If you like jRPGs, put this one in your cart or on your wishlist immediately.\n\nIf you're a fan of Falcom's Trails or Ys series, know that Zwei is of a similar tier of quality. It's an action-RPG dungeon crawler that, through its story and overall aesthetic, brought back a lot of memories of classic RPGs like Lunar and Skies of Arcadia. The action's very slow-paced compared to Ys, but it fits the puzzle-y dungeons well and gives the player a lot of tools to play with as the game progresses.\n\nI could go on about the game's world and its mechanics, but to be honest Zwei doesn't exactly do any single thing exceptionally well to the point of blowing your mind. It's just how everything in the game comes together to make this a genuinely heartfelt package that feels inspired throughout the entire ~20 hour quest (not counting the loads of optional content and objectives I'm still working through). Heck, I hardly ever review Steam games, but I just felt so passionate about this one that I needed to chime in and tell people how good it is.\n\nMy only complaints of real substance are that the camera is a bit awkwardly zoomed in to the point where you're fighting and taking damage from enemies who are off screen at times, and some of the side content can be a bit annoying or vague. And I guess depending on how much you abuse the food system the game might be too easy or lack real tension. I don't know, it's definitely not a perfect game, but all I know is that I sort of impulse bought Zwei out of being a fan of Falcom, and I wound up absolutely hooked on the game despite it not being what I was expecting it to be. File Zwei under the list of \"Steam hidden gems,\" but I can only hope this one eventually gets the recognition it deserves.\n\nSo basically, what I'm trying to say here is that it's pretty good.", "timestamp_created": 1510125716, "timestamp_updated": 1510125716, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523854", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36368785": {"recommendationid": "36368785", "author": {"steamid": "76561198188823559", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3654, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510591615}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u73a9\u5f97\u6700\u723d\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u53ef\u4ee5\u6ca1\u6709\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002\n\u9664\u4e86\u60ef\u4f8b\u7684\u652f\u6301\u5bbd\u5c4f\u548c1080p\u4e4b\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u975e\u5e38\u826f\u5fc3\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u539f\u7248\u6ca1\u6709\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\uff0c\u5f00\u573a\u7537\u5973\u4e3b\u89d2\u5728\u996d\u5e97\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u3001\u6bcf\u573aBOSS\u6218\u524d\u540e\u7684\u5267\u60c5\u90fd\u6709\u8bed\u97f3\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u8fd8\u4e0d\u9519\uff08\u4e0d\u8fc7\u653e\u5965\u4e49\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u5c11\u4e86\u70b9\u65e5\u7248\u71c3\u7206\u7684\u4e2d\u4e8c\u611f\uff09\u3002\u8fd8\u6709\u6210\u5c31\u56fe\u6807\u975e\u5e38\u840c\uff01\n\u9057\u61be\u7684\u662f\u7ed3\u5c40\u6ca1\u6709\u8bed\u97f3\uff0c\u6709\u4e9b\u5730\u65b9\u7684\u8d34\u56fe\u8fd8\u662f\u62c9\u4f38\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1510119519, "timestamp_updated": 1510119519, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36367574": {"recommendationid": "36367574", "author": {"steamid": "76561198173194239", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 420, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510139119}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u9664\u4e86\u6ca1\u4e2d\u6587\u6ca1\u65e5\u6587\uff08\u53cd\u6b63\u662f\u6765\u8865\u7968\u7684\uff09\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u518d\u68d2", "timestamp_created": 1510113373, "timestamp_updated": 1510113373, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36367390": {"recommendationid": "36367390", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146522541", "num_games_owned": 221, "num_reviews": 97, "playtime_forever": 1834, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510164245}, "language": "english", "review": "i will keep this more simple than rest.. mix y's games with the hidden things of trails in the sky and you get this... :P\n\nthe combat system is too familiar for y's players.. actually if like you liked those games.. play this.

Zwei is one of their lesser known titles and only available to PC. The game was originally released in 2008 (asia only).\nThis game combines a serious story with funny characters and simple gameplay. You controll 2 characters at the same time, but gameplaywise it feels like you only play one character. One character is using magic and the other a meleeweapon and you can change between these with the press of one button. \nYou play as Ragna the crashlanded pilot and Alwen the vampire princess, but there are also many npcs with quirky personalities. Overall it\u00b4s a funny game.\n\nI like about this game:\n- Good Soundtrack (a specialty of the developer falcom).\n- Fantasysetting with flying continents, old planes, dragons, magic, demons and a hidden ninja village\n- Half-serious game: The overall story is serious but the many comedy elements and the weird npcs liven up the story. \n- Unusual but well done level up-system: You get Experience AND you heal yourself through eating meals.\n- Fast and simple gameplay like the Ys Series\n- You can replay all bossfights, collect ingame-medals and bossfights\n- There is a quite difficult snowboardlike minigame\n- Likeable maincharacters (1 pilot/treasur hunter and 1 vampire/princess) with good english voiceactors\n\nThe game offers\n- Only partial voice acting\n- 20-40 hours gameplay \n- a new game plus mode\n- much optional content\n\nI don\u00b4t like about this game:\n- At the moment only 30fps graphics (however the controlls are working with 60fps)\n- Can feel to easy because you can use a unlimited amount of healing items in bossfights", "timestamp_created": 1510091332, "timestamp_updated": 1510091332, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500496", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36350450": {"recommendationid": "36350450", "author": {"steamid": "76561198440561882", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1520, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510403812}, "language": "english", "review": "i loved this game too much super fun and good control also,the graphics not that bad if ur a player who loves games like ratchet or maybe crash bandicoot but a bit diffrent then u will love this game .", "timestamp_created": 1510083573, "timestamp_updated": 1510083573, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36335565": {"recommendationid": "36335565", "author": {"steamid": "76561198195216010", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 3367, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511848300}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u867d\u7136\u6ca1\u6709\u4e2d\u6587 \u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709\u65e5\u914d \u4f46\u662f\u5c31\u662f\u5f88\u597d\u73a9\n1.\u6e38\u620f\u5168\u7a0b\u7a33\u5b9a60\u5e27\n2.\u753b\u9762\u7279\u6548\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u8ba9\u4eba\u6ee1\u610f\n3.\u8d85\u8d5e\u7684\u97f3\u4e50\n4.\u4e00\u4e9b\u6ca1\u6709\u914d\u97f3\u7684cg\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u82f1\u8bed\u914d\u97f3 \u53ef\u89c1\u8bda\u610f\n", "timestamp_created": 1510028455, "timestamp_updated": 1510028455, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36333609": {"recommendationid": "36333609", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148536404", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510018454}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u53cc\u661f\u7269\u8bed1\u662f\u7ae5\u5e74\uff0c\u53cc\u661f\u7269\u8bed2\u662f\u5728\u5927\u5b66\u624d\u901a\u7684\u5173\uff0c\u6211\u8d85\u559c\u6b22\u8fd9\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6309\u952e\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u5403\u98df\u7269\u5347\u7ea7\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u4e5f\u5f88\u6709\u8da3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5403\u6210\u80d6\u5b50\u3002\nPS\uff1a\u6211\u8bb0\u5f97\u5973\u4e3b\u7684\u7b80\u4ecb\u91cc\u8fd8\u662f\u5176\u4ed6\u5730\u65b9\u8bf4\u8fc7\u5973\u4e3b\u7684\u8863\u670d\u98ce\u683c\u4e0d\u662f\u54e5\u7279\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1510018476, "timestamp_updated": 1510018476, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36323347": {"recommendationid": "36323347", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093726039", "num_games_owned": 180, "num_reviews": 164, "playtime_forever": 2458, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510049539}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uad6c\ub8e8\ubbfc \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\uc758 \uac8c\uc784. \uc815\ud655\ud788 \uc598\uae30\ud558\uba74 \uc774\uac8c 2\ud3b8\uc774\ub77c\uace0 \ud558\ub2c8 \uad6c\ub8e8\ubbfc\uc774 \ucbd4\ubc14\uc774 1.5\uc815\ub3c4 \uc544\ub2c8\uc5c8\uc744\uae4c....

The attention to detail is also nice. Let me give you example :\n\n~ When you explore the world and visiting a place before the main story advance to that area, there will be a small talk when the game ask you to visit that area again \"Oh, that's the place we've been visiting before\". This might be a small things, but i really appreciate this small detail. It gives more natural sense to the character and story.\n\nThis XSEED localizations also has more voiced lines (English) than the original (Japanese). As for the rest of the positive point, i think other reviewer already cover it.\n\nThe things i dislike from this game is the camera, you cant rotate/adjust the camera like in similar falcom title (Gurumin).\n\nReally recommend this if you are into JRPG, dungeon crawler, game with cutesy artstyle and some funny gag(there's even an intentional cringy dad joke!).", "timestamp_created": 1509937782, "timestamp_updated": 1509937782, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521822", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36306819": {"recommendationid": "36306819", "author": {"steamid": "76561198203412952", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 3510, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511608854}, "language": "english", "review": "Another Falcom title and another great localisation from XSEED. These guys are on a roll with me , ever since I have played Trails in The Sky FC like 5 years ish ago , I have been nothing but satisfied with these games. And for a falcom fan such as me this game was kind of a fanservice considering the stuff this game takes from the other ones in terms of mechanics.\n\nGameplay:\nYou like Ys , Gurumin or Brave Fencer Musashi (that one is a square title) , then you will like the gameplay here. Its fast , combo based and really fun. Also really convinient just like the other falcom titles. You can easily swtich between your weapons whenever , levelling up is not grinding but by using food items and you can upgrade your food items by trading them meaning yeah you can grind or just use healing items when you need to meaning you will level up according to your skill and the duo mechanic is very unique and fun. I love comboing my enemies by switching between these characters. Both of their attacks bring something to the table. Also just like Ys you can teleport to the save points meaning you can use that as a short cut too.\n\nPresentation:\nWhile yes this is an old game I personally think that it has aged rather well. Falcom really knows how to use its budget to make games look good and because of their uniqe art styles the games usually end up aging well.\nThe music......ahem ......COME ON!!! ITS FALCOM WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE!!! .......It is great....\nThe voice acting is also pretty good too. Infact some of the characters I just love seeing purely because of their voices. It only has english dub though (legal reasons) but there are work arounds for that stuff if you are a \"ONLY JAPANESE!!!\" sort of guy. \nThe characters and NPCs are all lovable people and while its no trails in the sky , this game has A LOT of dialogue especially considering what type of gameplay is being used here.\n\nUnlockables:\nHolly......like this is one area this game definitely beats Ys games over , there are A TON of stuff to do in this game. Like seriously. I am still not done yet and I am a fairly competent gamer myself when it comes to Falcom games.\n\n \nSo overall I can easily recommend this game if you are looking for a fun and cute action rpg and if you are already a falcom fan you have probably already bought the game.\nThank you XSEED for bringing this game over and thank you Falcom for making it.

Ever since I played Ys III and Faxanadu decades ago, and renewed when I saw the Ys II Eternal trailer over 15 years ago, I've been helplessly in love with the games this company makes.  I've imported several of their games over the years, but not being able to read Japanese has limited my enjoyment of them.\n\nI imported Zwei II+ 7 years ago and loved the game.  The gameplay, the music, the charm, the weird workout guy, it was the perfect package.  But I had no freaking clue what they were saying!  It was a very straightforward game so I was able to finish it and complete everything, but I was always sad I couldn't enjoy it as much as I should.\n\nThank goodness for XSEED feeding my inner fanboy, as I can finally enjoy Zwei II the way I was supposed to the first time!  Everything that made the game wonderful is still there, but being able to relate to the quirky characters and the story has made it so much more enjoyable.  It was funny to find out that the little trio of fairies are bickering about where to open a tailoring shop! :D\n\nThere are some minor issues that are worth mentioning.  The font isn't perfect, the bottom part of some letters will get cut off.  It doesn't impact the game, but it is a minor annoyance factor (that will hopefully be patched out in the future).  Additionally the framerate performance is not up to what I would expect from a game that released almost a decade ago.  I can play games with complicated 3D graphics like Destiny 2 at relatively high settings, but I have to turn down shadows in this to achieve 30 FPS.  This game wasn't written native to DX9 so it may just be growing pains preventing it from achieving optimal performance.\n\nI love Zwei, and I'm very happy XSEED brought it to English speaking audiences.  The game is amazing, and it's an easy recommendation to make!", "timestamp_created": 1509845389, "timestamp_updated": 1509845389, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0,

English (although the English version has much more voice acting)\n- A little old (graphics, controls, pacing, etc)\n- You can get \"stuck\" once or twice, when the game wouldn't let you leave an area until you poke around and figure it out\n\nI played the original in Japanese when it came out 9 years ago, and loved it although I understood almost nothing.

Combat occurs in real-time, with the red hero jumping and slashing and collecting various bits and bobs that explode out of monsters' bodies when they die. You can switch at any time to another character, who wields a different weapon, with different enemies being more or less vulnerable to different attacks.\n\nIt's pretty much Ys, ya' see?\n\nZwei: The Ilvard Insurrection differentiates itself mostly with how seamless the combat is--even though your playing as two different characters, mechanically it only ever *feels* like one (and they share the same health pool and stats)--and through its innovative, rather transformative leveling system.\n\nTo level up in Zwei (actually Zwei II; don't ask) you need experience, but you can only earn experience by eating food (which heals you). If you don't eat, you don't grow stronger. Furthermore, once you have a stack of 10 food items, you can exchange them for 1 food item of the next tier-up. So, for example, say you have 10 Red Apples that will give you +5 experience each. If you eat them one-at-a-time, that's 50 experience. But you can exchange them for 1 Superior Green Apple that gives 100 experience. This creates an interesting dynamic where the more skilled you are at the game, but more experience you'll be able to accumulate, but consuming items for experience means having fewer healing items at hand, thus encouraging more skilled play.\n\nIt's a really effective system that gives the player a lot of freedom with how difficult combat is, and the diminishing experience rewards imbue many of the harder fights (the bosses) with a great deal of tension.\n\nBeyond that, Zwei is pretty much exactly as good of a game as you'd expect from Falcom, with as good of a localization as you'd expect from XSEED. That is to say it is a very good game with a very good localization (though the default sound mixing leaves a bit to be desired--you'll probably want to turn the BGM waaaaay down before you start). Tonally Zwei is a bit lighter than you might expect--like the Disgaea games, this is a story walking a tightrope between serious and silly, and for the most part it succeeds brilliantly. The music is catchy and memorable, the characters are all quirky and unique (w/ lots of funny dialog), and much like the classic Trails series, every NPC in the game gets new dialog after every major story beat that eventually coaelesce into these fun little miniature character-arcs and stories for those who are willing to seek them out.", "timestamp_created": 1509485989, "timestamp_updated": 1509563180, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 83, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.861414", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36176315": {"recommendationid": "36176315", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111108944", "num_games_owned": 171, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 5347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511764299}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u79d2\u5165 \u53cd\u624b\u6c42ZWEI III\n\n\u627e\u500b\u76dc\u7248\u628aWAV\u6587\u4ef6\u593e\u66ff\u63db\u6389\u61c9\u8a72\u5c31\u662f\u65e5\u8a9e\u8a9e\u97f3\u4e86", "timestamp_created": 1509484184, "timestamp_updated": 1509501353, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.678363", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36172808": {"recommendationid": "36172808", "author": {"steamid": "76561198274600830", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509774282}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u5199\u8bc4\u8bba\uff0c\u732e\u7ed9\u6211\u66fe\u7ecf\u6700\u7231\u7684ZWEI2\u3002\nPS\uff1a30\u5e27\u4e22\u4eba\u554a\u3002\u3002\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1509473482, "timestamp_updated": 1509775130, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36172368": {"recommendationid": "36172368", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057530499", "num_games_owned": 659, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509553273}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6211\u6700\u7231\u7684\u53cc\u661f2\u554a \u8fd8\u662f\u5f3a\u70c8\u63a8\u8350\u8fd9\u6b3e\u795e\u4f5c\u7684\uff0c\u9057\u4e16\u800c\u72ec\u7acb\u3002\n\u82f1\u914d\u7684\u62c9\u683c\u7eb3\u8fd8\u662f\u98ce\u683c\u975e\u5e38\u50cf\u65e5\u914d\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u827e\u5c14\u6e29\u516c\u4e3b\u771f\u7684\u5dee\u65e5\u914d\u5f88\u591a\u3002\u3002\u3002\u3002\n\u7b49\u4e00\u4e2a\u6c49\u5316\u8865\u4e01\u4ee5\u53ca\u65e5\u914d\u8865\u4e01\u3002\n\n\u7ed9\u60f3\u81ea\u5df1\u5236\u4f5c\u65e5\u8bed\u8865\u4e01\u7684\u5927\u4f6c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e2a\u601d\u8def \u539f\u6765\u7684\u65e5\u8bed\u8bed\u97f3\u6587\u4ef6 \u590d\u5236\u8fdb\u73b0\u5728\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u6587\u4ef6\u5939 \u7136\u540e\u64a4\u9500\u590d\u5236 \u5269\u4e0b\u7684\u5c31\u662f\u65b0\u589e\u7684\u82f1\u8bed\u914d\u97f3\u3002\u628a\u4e00\u822c\u5b57\u5e55\u97f3\u6548\u7684\u6587\u4ef6\u6539\u6210\u5269\u4e0b\u6587\u4ef6\u7684\u6587\u4ef6\u540d\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e2a\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u52a0\u5165\u4e00\u5f00\u59cb\u7684\u539f\u7248\u65e5\u8bed\u6587\u4ef6\u3002\u8fd9\u5e94\u8be5\u5c31\u662f\u5b8c\u5168\u7248\u7684\u65e5\u8bed\u8bed\u97f3\u8865\u4e01\u4e86\uff1f", "timestamp_created": 1509472195, "timestamp_updated": 1509938942, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 51, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.787153", "comment_count": "14", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}}

If you aren't a fan of Picross, or don't know what it is, you probably don't want this. Just getting that out of the way.\n\nIf you [i]are[/i] a fan of Picross puzzles, this is [b]the[/b] genre title for your library.\n\nIt's got hundreds of puzzles - to which any seasoned Picross veteran scoffs and says \"Yeah, but how many [i]hard[/i] ones does it have?\"\n\nLoads. I mean it. This game, compared to other collections of Picross puzzles, is [i]freakin' hard[/i]. The demo is free, and it has mostly easy puzzles - but don't let that disappoint you. They blow through the easy ones in the demo so that when you buy the game, you're [i]satisfied[/i]. Those tutorial collections are a joke - the entire paid game ahead is a series of collections of themed puzzles, that get progressively harder (both within each collection, and as you advance). By the time you are a third of the way through, you'll forget what a \"small\" puzzle looks like. Prepare yourself for [i]many[/i] 30x30 or larger puzzles.\n\nTo make things more fun, the Picross gets colorized in the miniature form to depict a pixel art rather than a traditional black-and-white result. This gimmick is common in the genre, and really helps enhance the game experience (as well as provide more leverage in puzzle design) - but Paint It Back really takes the bull by the horns and builds a bit of a storyline around the concept, where you are tasked with \"re-painting\" the contents of artwork that has been scared white by a ghost. The art is well done (for what you can cram into a pixel art, at least) and the actual puzzles are well matched to their colorized results.\n\nThere is also the Mystery Masterpiece challenge, which is basically a random Picross from the collection, [i]without the colorized miniature or hint title[/i]. You're flying blind, but you're solving one you may have already done. There are enough puzzles to confuse your memory, just don't fall back on this mode a lot and you'll be fine. Besides, as if there aren't enough provided puzzles...\n\nThen, there is [i]also[/i] the Workshop support, where people can build, share, play, and rate puzzles (and their associated \"artwork\") through the game.

Aqui no Brasil ficou conhecido como Pic-a-Pix, gra\u00e7as a revista \"Logic Pix\" de passatempos da Coquetel, infelizmente descontinuada. Foi por este meio inclusive que conheci e me viciei neste tipo de puzzle.\n\nNo jogo voc\u00ea \u00e9 um artista ajudando a reconstruir uma galeria de arte que misteriosamente perdeu toda a tinta de suas telas. Esse \u00e9 apenas um pano de fundo para justificar tantos puzzles a serem resolvidos. Todo o jogo segue este conceito de galeria de arte, cada puzzle sendo um quadro, agrupados em s\u00e9ries conceituais (mostras), cada sala com seu artista.\n\nA arte do jogo \u00e9 simples, mas que casa muito bem com o senso de humor leve e quase infantil das obras. Os quadros, na sua maioria brincam com situa\u00e7\u00f5es inusitadas, reveses e paradigmas, al\u00e9m de satirizar algumas obras reais.\n\nA m\u00fasica \u00e9 agrad\u00e1vel mas infelizmente enjoativa, considerando que voc\u00ea ir\u00e1 passar longas horas jogando para poder completar a galeria inteira e a trilha deve contar com umas 4 m\u00fasicas que se repetem aleat\u00f3riamente (muitas vezes a mesma musica se repete na sequ\u00eancia).\n\nO conceito do puzzle basicamente \u00e9, com a ajuda das dicas (sequ\u00eancias de n\u00fameros) apresentadas nas margens esquerda e superior da grade, construir um desenho. Por mais que possa parecer f\u00e1cil, voc\u00ea ir\u00e1 mudar de ideia rapidamente assim que tentar resolver seu primeiro problema. Similar ao Sudoku, este \u00e9 um puzzle que conta com diversas t\u00e9cnicas; t\u00e9cnicas estas que voc\u00ea ir\u00e1 se dar conta de estar descobrindo e aprendendo naturalmente. Isso porque o jogo, com sua dificuldade progressiva, ir\u00e1 fazer voc\u00ea compreender aos poucos como os n\u00fameros se relacionam. Pelo bem de sua experi\u00eancia, n\u00e3o procure na internet sobre t\u00e9cnicas de Nonogram ou muito menos como resolver os puzzles do jogo.\n\nO jogo tem mais de 150 puzzles, que podem ser resolvidos em tr\u00eas dificuldades \"Normal\", \"Pro\" e \"Master\". No Master, a grade \u00e9 sempre apresentada em sua \u00edntegra, podendo chegar at\u00e9 a 40 colunas ou linhas. No modo Normal e Pro, dependendo da dimens\u00e3o do puzzle, o mesmo \u00e9 dividido em sess\u00f5es menores, facilitando sua constru\u00e7\u00e3o. Al\u00e9m disso o jogo conta com a \"m\u00e3ozinha amiga\" que indica imediatamente um erro no desenho; jogar com esta op\u00e7\u00e3o ativa n\u00e3o marca a pintura como restaurada.\n\nCaso isso tudo n\u00e3o seja suficiente ou voc\u00ea queira testar suas habilidades em um modo um pouco mais desafiador, a sala Mystery Masterpiece \u00e9 a op\u00e7\u00e3o. Um puzzle \u00e9 escolhido aleatoriamente para ser resolvido e n\u00e3o \u00e9 apresentada uma pr\u00e9via do resultado. Neste modo voc\u00ea \u00e9 condecorado com medalhas dependendo da dificuldade, do tempo, da quantidade de erros e da quantidade de marca\u00e7\u00f5es de apoio utilizadas.\n\nSe ainda assim voc\u00ea ainda tem sede de puzzles, o jogo tem suporte ao Workshop, onde voc\u00ea pode baixar puzzles criados pela comunidade e desenvolver os seus pr\u00f3prios.\n\nO jogo surpreendentemente ainda conta com suporte a controles; ent\u00e3o, caso voc\u00ea se sinta mais confort\u00e1vel em jogar com um controle do que com um mouse, v\u00e1 em frente!\n\nPaint it Back \u00e9 um jogo que vale muito a pena jogar, muito bem trabalhado, com muito conte\u00fado e feito com carinho para quem gosta de puzzles l\u00f3gicos e principalmente para quem gosta de colocar o c\u00e9rebro pra funcionar.\n\n\u00c9 com muita satisfa\u00e7\u00e3o, sensa\u00e7\u00e3o de dever cumprido e uma pontada de saudades que, ap\u00f3s finalizar o jogo em sua \u00edntegra, obter todos os achievements e deixar esta an\u00e1lise como um agradecimento de despedida, desinstalo o jogo.

It requires you to push yourself to learn the game, as opposed to most games (puzzle or otherwise) where figuring out how to play is often very quick and easy.\n\nI'll admit, the learning curve is an obstacle and not one every gamer will wish to tackle. I know I certainly didn't when I reviewed the demo. That said, if you stick with it, you'll be pleasantly surprised. \n\nThe basic game mechanics are simple: there are numbers on the left and on the top. Those numbers denote how many squares need to be colored in. If there's more than one number on any line, it means there's a space between those two numbers.\n\nWhere this game goes from simple to complex is that unless the number listed corresponds to ALL spaces in any column or row, you won't immediately know where to place a mark. Even more challenging is knowing how many spaces are between multiple numbers.\n\nNow add in paintings that can be huge (especially on harder difficulty levels) and you've got yourself a very daunting task. \n\nFortunately, there is usually some clue somewhere to help you begin and to work off of. What may throw new players is that these clues aren't very recognizable unless you've played this game for a while or similar titles elsewhere. \n\nSo would I recommend Paint It Black? Yes, but do make sure to check out the demo first and try to be in the right mindset to take on a challenging game like this. Don't expect to figure it all out quickly, because that'll just lead to frustration. Take your time and learn it as you go and eventually (likely sooner than later) you'll have that \"aha!\" moment where it all makes sense and the game becomes far more enjoyable.", "timestamp_created": 1472604730, "timestamp_updated": 1472604730, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547777", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25167468": {"recommendationid": "25167468", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996801164", "num_games_owned": 180, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 7162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487621987}, "language": "english", "review": "A really fun game for everyone.

They're all under different Themes too. There are a lot of pictures to do, and a Workshop with a decent amount of puzzles already on it. The music/sound is pretty good, and the controls are simple and easy to use. For the record, there's Keyboard only, Mouse only, and Gamepad only support, so you can use any of these methods or a combination of them.\n\nIt has up to 3 modes of difficulty. I say \"up to\" because at first there's only Normal Difficulty, which breaks up the larger pictures into smaller grids. So for example, there's a 30x30 puzzle, in normal mode it would be broken up into 9 10x10 puzzles that completed will finish the whole puzzle. That's a bit of an extreme example though. Basically, in the beginning there are only smaller puzzles like 5x5 to 8x8. Once you start getting into the 10x10 and above you get the Pro difficulty. And 25x25 and above you get the Master Difficulty.\n\nBasically, the only thing difficulty changes is how much of the grid you're given at once. Having it broken up into pieces to complete DOES make things easier though.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who likes puzzle games, ESPECIALLY those who like Picross, as this is up there with the best digital versions of this game. Also, if you have an Android Device, I recommend NemoNemo Picross, as it's also amazing.

You have to fill in a grid of squares based on numbers at the side that tell you how many squares are filled in each line. Click to fill in a square, right click to place an X to show that you know it's an empty square, pretty simple. This type of game is pretty fun if you're a fan of logic puzzles like Sudoku or Minesweeper.\n\nEDIT -- I originally put that it was frustrating that there was no way to see what row/column you're hovering over, which made big puzzles really tedious. I don't know if it was updated or if I just missed this in the options, but apparently there's an option to turn on highlighting. That's one big issue of mine solved! -- END EDIT\n\nAnother frustrating thing is that you can only save the progress of one puzzle at a time for some reason. I discovered this when I had a 30x30 puzzle saved that was probably a bit more than halfway done, and then tried to save another 30x30 puzzle that was about halfway done. It asked me if I wanted to replace the other one or not save, so I had to give up all the progress I had made on the second one. There is no reason whatsoever that you shouldn't be able to just save all the puzzles you want that are partially complete. With those bigger puzzles especially, sometimes I get tired of staring at the same thing for so long and want to move on to something fresh before coming back to the one I had saved. Now I can't do that, because if I have one saved and start a new puzzle, I have to finish the second puzzle or all the work is wasted, That's really silly.\n\nEDIT -- After discovering the fix to one of my main complaints about this game, I'll restate my overall rating. I originally had it at around a 5.5 or 6/10 because of my issues with the game's design, but after discovering that you can turn on highlighting, it's bumped up to a 7. And then I opened the game the other day and discovered they had added an entire new set of puzzles in an update, so that bumps it up to an 8. If they put in an update that lets you save as many in-progress puzzles as you want, rather than just one, it'll be a 9 (not quite a 10, because while a lot of the largest puzzles are corespondingly difficult, I'll still run across one every once in a while that is just a matter of filling in the painting and doesn't really require any thought). -- END EDIT \n\nSo buy this if you like this type of game and just want more of it.

You fill in (or cross out) spaces in a pixel grid following a simple set of logic rules, and with that information, you fill in more spaces, etc. If your logic is impeccable every step of the way, you have a picture when you're done. If not, well, you'll probably have to start over. :) They're a lot of fun, and serve as a great way to relax and unwind will still engaging your mind.\n\nPaint it Back (I find it almost impossible not to type/say Paint it Black) is an almost perfect implementation of nonograms. There are a lot of puzzles included, at a variety of skill levels, and you can play the harder puzzles at easier skill levels if you prefer, which breaks them down into sub-puzzles for you. There are hinting modes if you need them, the controls are easy to learn and provide both keyboard and mouse-based control, the graphics are good, and the puzzle themes are funny. They've also recently included support for playing puzzles created by other users in the Steam community. Also, if you have a shared family PC, the game supports up to six player accounts so that everybody in the family can play without messing up each other's save games. (I'm not sure how critical this is if you have separate accounts anyway, though.)\n\nIf I have any complaints, they're very minor. There were a small number of puzzles that could only be completed with guess-work, and some may enjoy that (or at least not mind it), but I dislike these. There's a whole user interface element which could be implemented slightly better called \"Marks\" to support this sort of guessing. Given that only 2-3 of the puzzles included required it, I feel like they could have left Marks out entirely and swapped in puzzles that didn't require any guessing and the game would have been improved. Also, at least on my system, the keyboard controls were prone to occasionally repeating when you tapped a key, which made using the cursor to count a bit tricky at times. I would have preferred a delay-before-repeat on the keyboard controls to prevent this. \n\nThis is one of my few Perfect Steam games, because the achievements were actually fun enough to go for even when they required additional play after I'd completed all the puzzles.\n\nOverall, if you like this sort of game, or you think you might, I'd say go for it.", "timestamp_created": 1467114563, "timestamp_updated": 1467114563, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23867564": {"recommendationid": "23867564", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016248213", "num_games_owned": 764, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 8675, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502297691}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0412\u0441\u0435\u043c \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f\u043c \u044f\u043f\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u043a\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0434\u043e\u0432 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0432\u044f\u0449\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f!!! \n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605", "timestamp_created": 1467048080, "timestamp_updated": 1467048080, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.592504", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23825220": {"recommendationid": "23825220", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966750265", "num_games_owned": 4344, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 512, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467451080}, "language": "english", "review": "It's picross.

The puzzles start out simple, teaching you the basic concepts, but also eventually giving you complicated puzzles that can take hours to solve.\n\nGreat game to play while watching something on your second screen!", "timestamp_created": 1463080559, "timestamp_updated": 1463080559, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22833368": {"recommendationid": "22833368", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077147190", "num_games_owned": 933, "num_reviews": 114, "playtime_forever": 1424, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464458892}, "language": "german", "review": "Als ein Fan von Nonogrammen habe ich sofort zugegriffen, als ich das Spiel auf Steam entdeckt habe. Und ich habs nicht bereut. Es gibt zig R\u00e4tsel, unterteilt in verschiedene Themenbereiche. Die R\u00e4tsel sind Schwarz-Wei\u00df. Bei den meisten R\u00e4tseln gibt es drei Schwirigkeitsgrade zur Auswahl. Auf dem schwersten Schwierigkeitsgrad sind die R\u00e4tsel zwar nicht einfach, aber immer noch gut l\u00f6sbar.\n\nZiel des Spiels ist es, alle \"Kunstwerke\" wiederherzustellen, sprich: Die R\u00e4tsel l\u00f6sen. F\u00fcr jedes gel\u00f6ste R\u00e4tsel bekommt man je nach Schwierigkeitsgrad Punkte, mit denen man dann neue Themenbereiche sowie den kurzweiligen \"Mystery\"-Herausforderungsmodus freischaltet. Bei diesem Modus kann man verschiedene Achievements erreichen, indem man z.B. R\u00e4tsel im Zeitfenster l\u00f6st, keine Kreuze macht oder nur wenige Felder korrigieren muss. Auch sonst gibts einige Achievements, wie z.B. das L\u00f6sen einer Anzahl an Master-R\u00e4tseln. Die Achievements sind im Spiel ganz witzig inszeniert.\n\nAm Anfang gibt es ein Tutorial, au\u00dferdem eine Hilfefunktion. Da ich beides nicht benutzt habe, kann ich hierzu leider nichts sagen. Im Workshop kann man anscheinend auch R\u00e4tsel aus der Community laden, hab ich aber auch noch nicht ausprobiert ;-)\n\nAls Kritikpunkt bleibt jedoch die Musikauswahl. Es gibt gef\u00fchlt nur 3-4 St\u00fccke, die sich dementsprechend h\u00e4ufig wiederholen. Aber man kann ja den Ton ausstellen und seine eigene Musik h\u00f6ren...\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1462569454, "timestamp_updated": 1462569454, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22829604": {"recommendationid": "22829604", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995789348", "num_games_owned": 1419, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 733, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468085127}, "language": "english", "review": "Really good.

Look no further, this game is just that. \nYou get numbers on both X & Y axis and need to fill in the corresponding blocks on the grid. Sounds easy enough? It gets harder depending on the grid size. Doesn't really sound that exciting, just like many other puzzle games until you start playing it and then... get hooked. Expect yourself to say - just one more - a lot of times. Puzzles can be saved and continued at a later time, certainly handy for the bigger ones as they can take some time to solve.\nOfcourse it helps if the implementation is well done, and there is no complaining about that here. The playful semi-cubic graphic style fits the game perfectly, as does the simple but effective soundtrack and sound effects. The game itself is funny and contains a lot of humor, pop culture references and sillyness.\nUpdates are still being made, just recently the capability was added to create your own puzzles and share them with other players. As such the replayability could be endless.\nWorks well on Linux/SteamOS and has smooth Steam Controller support, enabling both relaxed play through the Steam Link on the couch or directly on your PC.

The tutorial is LITERALLY amazing. It is hands down the best tutorial in a game ever. of all time. best tutorial ever. Now I came into this game already knowing how to play this type of puzzle game, so I rushed through the tutorial, but for a new player to this type of a puzzle game if they went through the tutorial all the information they need would be in that tutorial. Not only is it jam packed with several techniques and building blocks for other ones, it is very clear and precise. It also has a system to make sure you understand (which I'm very keen of). \n\nAfter playing the tutorial I zoomed by the first gallery and I was sad that this game wouldn't be challenging because the puzzles were so easy (I'm an experienced player so the normal puzzles didnt teach me anything), but once I hit a Pro picture I was like dammmmmmm gurl nice. and then when I hit a Master picture I was like YES BOYS. And while the difficulty spike in my opinion shoots almost straight up, its very very fun. I have only played a few galleries, but I'm presuming the difficulty won't be going down, so I'm sure all of the galleries are really good! For the asking price and the content of this game, and the tutorial. I'd say this is a must buy steam game for puzzle genre lovers. I've even recommended it to friends because I feel like the tutorial is so good even noobs could start playing this game and end up a 'Master' level player. \n\nThe story line is brief, and the characters at the beginning of each gallery are commical for those who know art. I haven't gone past like the fourth or fifth gallery but I was a bit sad to see that you dont actually do the color part of the painting like instead of a row being 5 in a 5x5 board it could be 1121 and each number representing a different color. That would take away from the difficulty but I think it'd be really cool and I hope that I find it later on in the game. If it doesn't show up that's fine the game will still be amazing.  The UI (menu and the board itself) still needs some work to be 5/5, and I'm not the best judge for music, it's fairly good background music for this game(although one of the tracks, not sure which one, has a misleading sound in it aka a sound from another program that notifies sometime, although it's not that prominent). \n\nOverall I'd give this game like a 4.8/5. I wanna give it the five but 5/5 is perfect and realistically the UI is not perfect so it'd be injust if I did so. Highly recommend this game!\n\nThanks to the developer(s) and everyone else involved for creating this! Definitely one of the best puzzle games I've played on steam.

After all at its core it is just a (fairly large) collection of [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram]nonograms[/url], also known as grittlers or hanjies.\n\nIn case you don't know them, in nonograms you are given a grid of boxes and a set of numbers at the edge. The numbers determine how many adjacent boxes are \"filled\" in each row or column. In these puzzles the solution usually is designed to form a recognizable picture. All puzzles in the game have exactly one solution.\n\n[h1]Smooth and casual gameplay[/h1]\n\nThere is a flimsy (but working) back story to motivate using nonograms: a ghost has scared away all the paintings in a gallery. You are tasked to \"paint\" it all back.\n\nThe gallery has over dozen sections with separate themes each with circa ten puzzles of increasing difficulty per section. The puzzles are tiered in 3 difficulty settings pertaining to the size of the grid, from 5x5 (normal) to 40x30 (master).\n\nMouse controls work splendidly: left-click \"paints\", right-click marks a box empty and both marks can be reversed by clicking again. There's also a test mark-up mode that one can use to try out and find conflicts when regular logic fails (essentially required in only a couple of the master-level paintings). A neat detail is that the color picture slowly forms in the corner while you are \"painting\".\n\nThe art is generally good and quirky and every painting is a small surprise, so it's fun to solve the problems.\n\n[h1]Perfect for what it is[/h1]\n\nWhen playing I like to alt+tab every now and then for small pauses. I was happy to note this didn't have any adverse effects on the game. Being a mobile port, there is the slightly redundant (considering Steam Family share) option to create up to 6 profiles for e.g. all family members. Despite this you can unfortunately have only one incomplete painting saved at the time (per profile I presume) although you can work on others, just without saving the progress if you wanted to quit.\n\nFor 100% achievement completion it took me almost 42 hours. I think that's a great amount of content for a game such as this. There's some repetition required for achievement hunters, since about half of the medals (conveniently displayed also in-game) are about the random challenges that require you to complete a random existing painting in a specific way (including quickly, without empty-crosses and/or without \"wasting paint\"). Still, this adds only couple of hours to the whole gametime. The more difficult puzzles can be completed on lower difficulty levels as well (by solving them part-wise as several smaller nonograms) that might add even more content for completionists though it is not required for the achievements.\n\nHowever, it is just a collection of nonograms with no twists except perhaps for the quirky art. I got it for half the price and I was happy with the content but I might have been disappointed had I paid the full price.

There are a variety of paintings and difficulties, and even the biggest paintings (30x40 or 40x30 respectively) can be played on the lowest difficulty if wished. Also, the motives of the paintings are hilarious at times.\nAdditionally, when playing for a bit you will soon unlock the \"Mystery Masterpieces\", which is basically a random mode that's fun even when you already finished all pictures of the gallery.\n\nFor people like me who prefer playing on the highest difficulty (which means you have to puzzle through the whole picture at once, for otherwise the pictures are broken into multiple smaller parts) it certainly is challenging enough - although there were two or three pictures that could not be solved with pure logic and needed the Mark-up mode (which means guessing, something I personally really don't like to do when puzzling).\nStill, besides that one I think the difficulty and logic for this game fit perfectly.\n\nThe only thing I really disliked was the fact that the numbers on the side / at the top already turned grey the second the correct number of black spots was there on the field (as long as it had a direkt connection with blacks and Xs to one of the sides). I usually play Nintendo's Picross games and there they only grey out the numbers when the black spots have an X (or the end of the picture) on [i]both sides[/i].\nSo I would really have preferred an option to either manage it like that or to maybe grey the numbers out manually. That would mean more work for me but as I prefer having 'perfect' scores (as in, no wrongly set black spots ever if possible) this turned out to be really annoying during the mystery masterpiece runs.\n\nBut that's a really minor complain for I still had a lot of fun with this game and I will certainly play it again, for the random mode is fun even if you already have all the achievements.\nDefinitely a very good Picross game - and the best version of it I have encountered on the PC as of yet!", "timestamp_created": 1447521349, "timestamp_updated": 1447521361, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19049303": {"recommendationid": "19049303", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028113674", "num_games_owned": 2032, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3159, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461571574}, "language": "english", "review": "Need moar :) Very good Picross game.

(I think)\n- Same goes for the picture in teh top left which can tell you if you've placed correctly. (I think)\n- There is progression through the game but it doesn't really feel any harder the further you go.\n- The thing that automatically tells if a number next to a row/column (greys it out) is too picky about how much innformation it needs to grey something out. Fx if there is a row with 1 1 9 1 1 and in the middle you painted 9 adjacent tiles and nothing else on the row, I think it should grey out the 9.\n- The menu is made for touch screen but that luckily doesn't do much about the game, I just wish there was a simple keyboard shortcut to switch between Mark On and Mark Off.\n- The whole idea of different difficulties for the same picture is kind of stupid to me.\n\nHaving said this I still recommend it because these are fairly small problems and there are many good things about the game too which have been said in other reviews.\n\nI think (aside from content) this game is a bit better in a lot of ways: http://picture-enigmas.com/ (Plus mode)", "timestamp_created": 1446939179, "timestamp_updated": 1446939179, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18940253": {"recommendationid": "18940253", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009221978", "num_games_owned": 545, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1635, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464541061}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good version of classic nonograms.

But with this game I can paint and erase with the flick of a mouse.  Much easier.\n\nFor those who have never encountered this type of puzzle before I'm gonna quote from wikipedia:\n\n\"Nonograms, also known as Hanjie, Picross or Griddlers, are picture logic puzzles in which cells in a grid must be colored or left blank according to numbers at the side of the grid to reveal a hidden picture.\"\n\nIt's kind of like a binary sudoku.  If you love logic puzzles, you will like this.  I quickly got addicted.\n\nHow does it work:\nYou've got a grid of squares and you are told how many spaces are supposed to be colored in on each row and column.  Use logic to choose what to color in.  When you are finished it forms a picture.  You only use black and white, but there is a colored painting that appears as you work on the puzzle.  You don't actually have to choose colors yourself, it does it automatically.\n\nDifficulty Settings:\nThere are 3 difficulty levels.  The beginning puzzles are only on the easiest difficulty, but as you progress in later galleries you can choose which difficulty level you want for each painting.  And even after you finish a puzzle you can redo it on another difficulty level.   \n\nThe puzzles also come in different sizes.  From 10x10 to 30x30 and other odd sizes.  The easy difficulty splits the large puzzles into sections, so you might have to do 4 sections to complete 1 whole puzzle picture.  The hardest difficulty is just one giant grid.\n\nHow many puzzles:\nPuzzle paintings are organized into Galleries with themes, such as Portraits, Sports of Sorts, Animals, Home Sweet Home, etc.  If forget exactly how many puzzles are in each gallery, maybe about 8-10 or so.  You unlock more galleries as you complete puzzles are get the medals.  You get more medals for solving on higher difficulty.\n\nHelp Tools:\nIf you need help there are some in-game help tools that you can activate, though you might not get a medal for solving that puzzle.\n\nStory:\nYes, a puzzle game with a story!  There is a cute little story scene in the beginning.  And a small one once you complete all the puzzles once on any difficulty.\n\nGraphics:\nCute and colorful.\n\nSound:\nNice effects like paint splat sounds when you mark a puzzle.  The background music has several tracks that loop continously.  \n\nInterface:\nI used a mouse.  No problems.  \n\nReplay value:\nOnce you get pretty far into the puzzles you unlock Mystery mode.  Where you can try to solve a random puzzle (from one of the galleries) only it does not show you the progress in the little picture and doesn't tell you the title, either.  So you have to do it by logic only, no guessing!  You can choose any difficulty level in Mystery mode.\n\nAchievements!  \nAll of the achievements are easily doable, just takes some time.  There aren't any super hard achievements (so far).\n\nA Painter is Never Satisfied with his finished product.\nThe developer listens to the fans and has made updates with new features based on ideas from fans.  It's always nice to see a dev willing to tweek his game if the fans want something.\n\nI can't remember how much it cost but it's well worth it.  And I actually bought my copy, unlike some people who got free review copies.  \n\nThat's all I can think of to say.  Just about the perfect puzzle game.  A little story, nice puzzles, lots of options for difficulty.  Oh and there is humor as well.  Some of the painting titles are puns on famous paintings or pop culture references.  If you like logic puzzles, you can't go wrong with this game.  \n", "timestamp_created": 1446608222, "timestamp_updated": 1446608222, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 39, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.804105", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18851208": {"recommendationid": "18851208", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152887291", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2629, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507359858}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e00\u6b3e\u597d\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u6253\u53d1\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u6709\u70b9\u50cf\u626b\u96f7\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u903b\u8f91\u548c\u8fd0\u6c14\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u97f3\u4e50\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u6709\u70b9\u7f3a\u4e4f\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1446524915, "timestamp_updated": 1446524915, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18821809": {"recommendationid": "18821809", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034199687", "num_games_owned": 683, "num_reviews": 192, "playtime_forever": 626, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1447588424}, "language": "english", "review": "This is like Mario's Picross.\nIt's decently funny and has a lot of content.\nIt's also quiet cheap.\nIf you like Picross puzzles you should get the game.\nAlso there's a demo.", "timestamp_created": 1446402879, "timestamp_updated": 1446402879, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18808130": {"recommendationid": "18808130", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997234388", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 462, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472860233}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm addicted to this game atm.

This, and being able to see the picture being drawn in the top left, lead to situations where it's extremely easy to guess where the squares are meant to go, which kind of ruins the challenge of Picross.

A nonogram is a puzzle where you are given a grid and each row and column has one or more numbers by it which tells you how many consecutive cells need to be filled in in that row or column. You will need to use logical thinking and information from other rows and columns to figure out which cells are the ones that should be filled in and complete the painting.\n\nIt's hard to explain why Paint It Back is so addicting but it is. It is definitely one of those \"one more turn\" type of games. You will sit down to play it for an hour to wind down and it will be past midnight before you know it. I think the main reason why it is so fun and addicting is that it is a very simple game to play but it also requires a lot of logical thinking to complete the paintings.\n\nPaint It Back offers a lot of bang for your buck. At the time of this review, I had put in over 21 hours and I still have a lot of puzzles left to complete. I estimate that it will take me at least 25 total hours to complete all of the puzzles and that's with me focusing on mainly the normal and pro paintings (the master difficulty puzzles are very time consuming).\n\nIf you like puzzle games at all and especially if you like nonograms or similar puzzles like Sudoku you should definitely check out Paint It Back.\n\nNote: I received a free review copy of the game but received no other compensation for this review.\n\n[url=http://www.geekyhobbies.com/paint-it-back-indie-game-review/] Read my full review [/url]", "timestamp_created": 1445038310, "timestamp_updated": 1445038310, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500327", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18513507": {"recommendationid": "18513507", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028118801", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 369, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1445023669}, "language": "english", "review": "I love it.

That\u2019s the thing I keep hearing whenever I see games like this come by. These sorts of games are easily spotted, because of the large squares with numbers on the sides, and a picture of what you\u2019re creating in the corner. I remember having played one or two of them back in the day but to be honest I can\u2019t remember what they were like. Time to find out if there may have been a reason for this\u2026\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe story is quite simple and begins with a ghost wandering around in a museum. It finally manages to scare away all of the paintings and now it\u2019s up to you to paint them back. It\u2019s goofy and it sets the tone immediately. It doesn\u2019t take itself seriously and that\u2019s exactly what it should be like. It\u2019s a casual game at heart, as in anyone can pick it up and play. The difficulty is also targeted at a casual audience and since there\u2019s no time limit you can take your time until you have finally figured out how to paint it properly. However, you can also choose to play a more difficult/advanced version of puzzles and these puzzles then consist of multiple blocks merged together to make it look like one big (wide) puzzle.\n\nGameplay wise it\u2019s relatively simple. Easy to learn, even easy to master, but it does take some brain activity to figure out how to paint the blocks exactly. The game puts a board in front of you and that board can also be seen in the upper left corner, but on a smaller scale. If you paint a block on the big board \u2013 by just clicking on it \u2013 then you will also see that block get painted on the smaller board in the corner. By clicking a block again you can remove the paint and by right-clicking you can choose to disable a block to prevent you from accidentally painting over it. While I felt this was fairly useless at the beginning it became more important later on when the boards get bigger and more complex.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=536135165\nAnyway, there are numbers written on the top and left sides of the board and these tell you how to paint the blocks. By looking at the numbers you can figure out how to paint the blocks properly.\nSo if you have a 10x10 block and on the ninth line (horizontally) is written \u201810\u2019 then you have paint all ten blocks horizontally. It\u2019s not a very good example, but it\u2019s a little hard to explain without actually drawing an example. But just take a look at the screenshots and you\u2019ll see probably understand what I mean.\n\nOnce the painting is complete the smaller board will be enlarged to show you the end result. It\u2019s always a pixel art painting (I always appreciate good pixel art) so don\u2019t go and expect a DaVinci painting or anything, although they do get more complex a few hours into the game.\nAlso, starting from area 3 puzzles become larger and may even consist of several parts. This means that a painting can be divided into, for example, 2, 4 or 6 parts. This doesn\u2019t influence the actual coloring of the blocks but instead of creating just one big painting you\u2019re then painting several parts that ultimately combine into one big painting. You do get to see the entire painting in the corner, by the way, so you always have a clear idea of what the final result will or should look like.\n\nThere are multiple areas to play through, 15 in fact, each with their own theme, but I somehow missed how these paintings exactly relate to these worlds. They seem completely random, but I guess with a little thinking you can see the or some sort of relation between them. It seems farfetched, though, but I assume that\u2019s just part of the goofy style and humor.\n\nOverall the game feels very polished. The only thing I think needs improvement is the audio, of which there is just too little variety. With some added tracks (or at least more rotation) it\u2019s actually pretty much perfect in my opinion.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=536135007\n[h1]Audio & Visuals[/h1]\nSo, thus far there doesn\u2019t seem to be a whole lot of diversity as far the music is concerned. The first hour or so I heard the same song over and over with every painting I created. Then out of nowhere I finally heard another song. There seem to be more songs but they currently repeat a bit too often, which is an absolute shame, even though the focus is not the music per se. But more variety (as in: more tracks, or more rotation) would definitely help add to the immersion of being (or at least feeling like) a painter.\n\nVisually it\u2019s a beautiful game with a great looking cartoony style. The cinematics (although I wouldn\u2019t really call them that) look fabulous in motion and the boards animate nicely whenever you complete a painting. Other than that there\u2019s not much animation. The pixel art shown in the frames looks great, but sometimes it still looks a bit too simple. I personally thought it would\u2019ve been cool if the pixel art would animate upon completing a puzzle. It would give it just a little more personality, but to be totally honest you can\u2019t say that this game lacks any. It bursts with personality actually.\nAnyway, the text is sharp, the use of colors is diverse and the graphics scale nicely: the game makes the screen (not the game itself) less wide or wider based on what is shown. It looks cool, but is a little inconsistent. \n(Please note that I\u2019m playing on a 21:9 monitor and this may therefore not occur on your monitor.)\n\n[h1]Length/Replay Value[/h1]\nThere are 150 paintings to complete in total. Most of them can be completed in just a couple of minutes so if you do the math then it should take you anywhere between 10-15 hours to complete. And this is just for the normal paintings. If you choose to complete more advanced paintings then you can easily add another dozen hours to that number. Plus, there\u2019s an Endless Mode for even MORE replay value. Oh yes, you get plenty of bang for your buck. Guaranteed!\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=536135313 \n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nOkay, so I might not remember the Picross games (maybe due to a lack of interest, or maybe I didn\u2019t have the right age, who knows?) but I [i]will[/i] try to remember Paint It Back this time. It has become a game that anyone can play and have fun with: a relaxing game meant to be played for just a few minutes or a couple of hours. I definitely had fun with it.\nThere aren\u2019t many games like this available on PC (or more specifically: Steam) and so it might not become insanely popular (yet). But let\u2019s make sure it at least gets the attention it deserves.

Since there are no cutscenes other than the initial one, I'm not gonna take this into account.\n\n[h1]GRAPHICS[/h1]\nThe game adopts a very colorful art-style that well suits both the tone of the different rooms full of paintings and the puzzles that you complete. While the paintings get bigger and more complex the more you paint them, most of them are still very simple and lack detail.\n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]\nThe game is essentially a digital version of nonogram:  are picture logic puzzles in which cells in a grid must be colored or left blank according to numbers at the side of the grid to reveal a hidden picture. In this puzzle type, the numbers are a form of discrete tomography that measures how many unbroken lines of filled-in squares there are in any given row or column.\nI had never played this type of puzzle, and it has easily become my favourite: the constant calculation of numbers and the huge satisfaction of seeing a finished work make this game one of the most relaxing and easier to get games of the year.\n\n[h1]CHALLENGE[/h1]\nThe game's puzzles get increasingly difficult, but you can always choose the difficulty of each one (for example, for a 50x50 puzzle you can choose Normal to complete small 10x10 areas). They are never impossible to complete, and usually waiting a couple of minutes to clear your head up helps.\n\n[h1]SOUND[/h1]\nThe soundtrack to the game is quirky and relaxing, making this game one to be picked up when you want to chill for 5 or 10 minutes.\n\n[h1]REPLAYABILITY[/h1]\nThe game features a total of 150 paintings to complete and 20 Steam achievements to unlock, giving you more thane enough content for its cheap price.\n\nOverall, both fans and non-fans of puzzle games (especially nonogram/picross) will enjoy this game thanks to its simplicity, challenge, huge satisfaction and relaxing soundtrack.\n\n[h1]Story: n/a\nGraphics: 7\nGameplay: 8\nChallenge: 9\nSound: 9\nReplayability: 9\n\n[b]ENJOYMENT: 8.5\nFRUSTRATION: 4[/b][/h1]\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\n[url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_VuBkttXIrpbrxwfYL_B-w]Subscribe to my channel[/url]\n[url=http://www.facebook.com/EnjoyTheGaming]Like on Facebook[/url]\n[url=http://nickygra.wix.com/enjoythegaming]Check my official website[/url]\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/EnjoyTheGaming]Join my Steam group[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1444940626, "timestamp_updated": 1444940626, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537680", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18483187": {"recommendationid": "18483187", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976270733", "num_games_owned": 645, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 869, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473868623}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a Picross-like.

It\u2019s a really good and fun game that you can pick up whenever you feel like it.\nIt started out on iOS and is now here on Steam.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nA ghost appeared and literally spooked the paintings away.\nSo it\u2019s now your job to \u2026 [i]Paint it back[/i].\n\nSeriously that\u2019s pretty much it and there\u2019s no need for a fancy storyline.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nIf you\u2019ve played Sudoku then the game\u2019s pretty much self explanatory and in case you haven\u2019t well the tutorial does one fine job explaining it.\nLet\u2019s get into it. You start of by facing a blank 5x5 field and you have to paint the right squares while leaving others blank. Later on in the game you\u2019ll have to repaint bigger like 16x20.\nThe game even tells you not to guess but to think. Sure you could guess your way through the early levels and the smaller painting but good luck with that for the bigger ones.\n\nYour only tool is a brush with black paint. You don\u2019t have to worry about choosing the right color for the right square. All you have to do is to paint the right ones. The other [i]tool[/i] you have is the right click. If you right click a square you\u2019ll cross it out so you know that you have it blank.\nThe game, just like sudoku, gives you some hints so you know where to start and which squares to paint.\nOn the outside of the field of your painting you see certain numbers. Let\u2019s say the upper left row starts, vertically, with a 4. That means that you have to paint 4 squares in this row and so on.\nSome fields have more than one number on the outside. The first number or in this case the outer number\u2019s the same as before and tells you how many squares you have to paint. The second number however tells you that you have to leave some squares blank and then start painting again. Let me demonstrate on a 5x5 field.\nLet\u2019s say the upper left, vertically, row starts with a 2 and the next number is a 2 as well.\nThat would mean that you have to paint two squares, leave one open, and then paint again two.\nSo you see you get the hang of it pretty quickly.\n\nThe game does require a fair amount of brain power though. The beauty of it is that, just as the developers name implies, it\u2019s really a casual game that you can pick up whenever you want.\nYou can even save your progress in your current painting and come back later to it to finish it.\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\nThe game itself has a cartoonish look to it and is quite fitting. The paintings however look great.\nThe pixel art in the game\u2019s pretty fun, good looking and for me easily the best part of the game.\nThe early painting might not look the best but they\u2019ll look better and better in the higher levels and way more complex.\nOverall it\u2019s a fairly nice and sweet looking game and the whole cartoonish art style was a good choice.\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\nThe music just fits and manages to stay in the background while also maintaining presence.\nIt\u2019s not too subtle but at the same time not too intrusive.\nI mean at the end of the day you\u2019ll find yourself paying attention to the music and it will probably hinder you a bit but it\u2019s not too bad.\nThe tracks used however are quite short which I personally actually like since the level that you\u2019re stuck on won\u2019t get too dull too fast.\n\n[h1]What else can I say?[/h1]\nI have been lucky enough to get a Review Key for [i]Paint it Back[/i] in order to write a blunt and honest to God Review. Just as usual.\n\nIt is what it is. It\u2019s a nice game for every now and then when you feel like you need something for your brain. Overall it works pretty good and I haven\u2019t had any problems whatsoever.\nIt\u2019s hard though. Well hard as in some levels are truly complex and require a fair amount of time and you can\u2019t just rush through all of the levels. At the end of the day you\u2019ll probably get a fair amount of gametime out of it if you don\u2019t get too frustrated later on.\n\nThe perfect game for every puzzle lover. Especially for people that just need their fix every now and then.\n\n[i]No drama, [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/justreviews]Just Reviews.[/url][/i]\n\n- Neku", "timestamp_created": 1444841991, "timestamp_updated": 1444842041, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552682", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18472406": {"recommendationid": "18472406", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003910945", "num_games_owned": 7397, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 314, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1444912955}, "language": "english", "review": "I've really been enjoying this game so far.

I love the simplicity of the format and how they can, at times, seem impossible to complete until you find that one tiny, little detail you missed and the rest of the picture comes into play.\n\nPaint it Back is missing a couple of the smaller details that make those Nintendo games special but it includes a ton of puzzles, has much bigger puzzles than any of the Nintendo titles, and presents all of them with a great amount of polish, from snappy menus to configurable control schemes to solid performance. This is a really freaking good Picross game on the PC. If you like Picross games then that should really be enough to convince you. If you want more detail, I have lists.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n[list]\n    [*]The game runs well on Windows 7, 8 and 10, with no noticeable load times or crashes (so far).\n    [*]It works with multiple controllers right out of the gate, including the Xbox One pad, which is how I played most of the time.\n    [*]You can switch between a mouse/keyboard combo and a controller at will, even mid-puzzle, and it only takes the game a second to figure out what you're using.\n    [*]It's very challenging in spots, even more so than the hardest puzzles in Picross DS. Some of the sets are massive, going past 30x30 in size. This is where it's great to have a big screen. My PC is connected to my 40\" TV and it was so nice to play wider puzzles that took up the length of my screen, all while lying on my couch.\n    [*]The bigger puzzles can be broken down into bite-sized pieces, making them easier to digest. Instead of doing a 20x20 puzzle, for instance, you can do four 5x5 ones. You get a different amount of ribbons (the game's way to measure progress) based on whether you tackle the whole thing at once or in parts.\n    [*]There's enough content to last over 20 hours, at the very least, and a good variety of difficulties from easy to moderately challenging to bang-your-head-against-the-wall hard puzzles, all of which you can save and come back to later if you get too burnt out.\n    [*]Columns and rows highlight to help you navigate, which doesn't really matter until you get to the latter puzzles, going past 25x25 or so, but when you do it's super helpful.\n    [*]It's a small download and doesn't require a ton of resources so you can play on a laptop without much of a challenge. I found it just as fun to use the arrows and the z/x button combo as the controller.\n    [*]it's Picross on your PC. That, in and of itself, is an amazing thing. Even if the game wasn't built well I'd still be happy. Fortunately enough, it is really polished.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n[list]\n    [*]There's no mode or option that you can toggle that'll mark when you make a mistake (at least that I could find). Meaning that if you screw up with a fill instead of an X or vice versa, you won't know it until later when things don't add up. Most of the time I didn't mind this, since you're filling in tons of squares and a simple slip of the thumb might happen, but the option, perhaps in a different mode, would have been welcome.\n    [*]For better or worse, not all the achievements have detailed explanations.\n    [*]I would have liked more of the wide puzzles and less of the tall ones, since my TV is widescreen, as most monitors are, and it fits better.\n    [*]The music gets incredibly repetitive after a couple hours.\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1444839338, "timestamp_updated": 1479925132, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 67, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.836231", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}}

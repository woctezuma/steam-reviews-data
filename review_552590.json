You investigate the murders of the various guests attending a masquerade party at the casino mansion, The Sexy Brutale\u2026while they happen. Your job is not only to find out how the masked residents meet their gruesome demises, but also to save them. You play as a masked man, Lufcadio Boone, and are guided in your quest to stop these grisly murders by a mysterious specter, the Bloody Woman. The supernatural and mysterious are abound in the glitzy mansion, but the shine and spectacle hides a sinister plot by the menacing waitstaff.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\n\nThe gameplay of The Sexy Brutale is a refreshing and interesting twist on the genre of point-and-click murder mysteries. You are not simply investigating murders, you investigate them as they are happening, and your goal is more than to find out what happened- it is to find out how to stop it from happening. To accomplish that, The Sexy Brutale has you playing out the premise of Groundhog Day- upon the clock striking 12am time is reset, and you begin the same day anew. But unlike Groundhog Day, you have the additional challenge that [i]you cannot interact with anyone directly[/i]. Attempting to do so will cause time to freeze, with the masks of the guests chasing you out of the room their owner currently stands in. You must learn the routine of the to-be victims, and interact with the surroundings to prevent the murders from being carried out. In this way, you have all the time you could ever need, and yet are racing against the clock to prevent the untimely ends of every guest in the mansion.\nThese mechanics result in a fantastic series of puzzles and thinking ahead, tracking guest and waitstaff movements, and determining not only how the murders were carried out but how to prevent them from occurring.\n\n[b]Storytelling[/b]\n\nThe story of The Sexy Brutale is engaging and intriguing. Discovering the secrets of the casino mansion is exciting, and the plot constantly moves along with twists and turns that keep you wanting to learn more. Who is the ghostly Bloody Woman, and why does she want to help you? Who is the strange man in a gilded mask you keep grabbing glimpses of? Why is the waitstaff on this bloody rampage in the first place? What are all those noises you keep hearing throughout the day? What really is happening at the Sexy Brutale?\n\n[b]Replay-ability[/b]\n\nAdmittedly, the Sexy Brutale does lack much replay-ability. There are 52 playing cards hidden throughout the mansion, and invitations for each ill-fated guest. Outside of these collectables, however, the game ends with the finishing of the tale of the Sexy Brutale- not particularly surprising given the game is a murder mystery.\n\n[b]Visuals[/b]\n\nThe setting of the casino mansion The Sexy Brutale is stunning. The variety of rooms in the sprawling and extravagant manor keep the environments unique and engaging. The level of detail and diversity in all of these rooms is fantastic. Likewise, the character designs are just as fantastical. Each guest is fittingly excessive in their design, and each wear an elaborate mask that hints at their personality, from the clockwork mask of the tinkerer Reginald Sixpence to the macabre skull mask of the gothic Willow Blue. The waitstaff all appear menacingly identical in their matching gas mask and suit attire, and the fiery masks wailing if you approach is a disturbing sight.\nHowever, one of my biggest qualms with the game is a visual one. The animations of the game are rather lackluster given the detail of everything else. Scripted animations feel extremely robotic given their pre-determined nature, and animations occasionally play incorrectly or cut short in such a way that characters often look stiff and unnatural. It\u2019s not a huge issue, but one that bugged me throughout my playthrough.\n\n[b]Level Design[/b]\n\nAs mentioned, the level design is wonderful. The combination of a casino and mansion makes for an outlandish, lavish setting that the story and gameplay fit perfectly into. The enormous number of rooms in the building each have stories to tell, and are packed with character and beauty, from the Pick Your Poison bar to the Main Stage.\n\n[b]Sound Design[/b]\n\nThe sound design of The Sexy Brutale is also exceptional. The main theme alone is fantastic, a jazzy electro swing that sets an antiqued yet lively mood, fitting of a mansion that appears timeless and ancient. The music complements whatever setting your in-haunting, deep scores wear at your nerve as you creep through the basement; upbeat, swinging tracks lead you through the flashy casino, and dramatic, tension-filled pieces ready to explode sound impending doom for the masked guests.\n\n[b]Overall[/b]\n\nOverall, The Sexy Brutale delivers a unique and thrilling murder mystery. Its setting, visuals, and sounds meticulously ensure every second you spend in the Sexy Brutale is full of intrigue, bedazzlement, and tension as you work to save guests from gruesome murder and learn what is truly going on in the dark manor. The gameplay is engaging, unique, and fits the tone and style of the game perfectly. Outside of some minor issues of lag and animation troubles, the only complaint I can really voice about The Sexy Brutale is about it\u2019s length- I need more!\nI highly recommend the Sexy Brutale, but if you\u2019re someone who only values games in the amount of playtime they provide over the quality of that playtime, I would suggest potentially waiting for a sale.\n", "timestamp_created": 1516296368, "timestamp_updated": 1516296368, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39438933": {"recommendationid": "39438933", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025474799", "num_games_owned": 281, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 553, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 324, "last_played": 1516289988}, "language": "swedish", "review": "A really enjoyable game with a great atmosphere!", "timestamp_created": 1516290569, "timestamp_updated": 1516290569, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39427490": {"recommendationid": "39427490", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159653313", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1213, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 957, "last_played": 1515904324}, "language": "english", "review": "Very creative and cool game.

It is interesting learning how the mansion works, in particular learning the schedules of everyone.

Puzzles never get complicated, but later chapters have more than one on the way to finding the murder and how to solve it.\n\nThe game is technically impressive in how each room has time dependent lightning and music. It also doesn't hurt that it looks and sounds good from an artistic perspective too.\n\nHowever the game does have some flaws. Puzzles never get more complicated than one item in your inventory at a time and nearly never overlap. The story of the game is good, but pretty much dumped onto you in the final chapter. Expect no mid game reveals.\n\nThe mask powers you get as you save each guest are an interesting concept. But the powers are unsatisfying. They are shallow and you never need to think about them. You know instantly when to use them, if you even have a choice, and several guests don't offer any due to being saved along with another that does.\n\nYet, despite the flaws it is genuinely interesting wandering about the mansion and learning about it and its inhabitants.

Is it a combination of Brutal and Tale?  Is it a made up word?  Is it an alternate form of the word Brutal? Why is it Sexy? Ultimately these questions don't matter much, yet I still feel I should ask them because I really want to know. \n\nOn the other hand The Sexy Brutale does deliver a solid gameplay experience.  People have called it \"Groundhog's day in video game form.\"  And that works for the most part.  The entire game has the player reliving 12 hours, and trying to \"save\" people.  To do this, the player has to stop their death, which can be as simple as Activating a control panel, to as complex as timing a number of objects and following someone around.   It's a rather great game, that reminds me of classic point and click games. \n\nThere's one big caveat on the game, the player is not allowed to stay in the same room as another person, so rather than being able to directly stop someone from an action, the player must set up rooms to avoid people getting murdered.  A rather interesting system if I do say. \n\nIn addition the player has the ability to watch, listen and track people throughout the house, even listening in to private conversations.  It's actually rather fun to hear the NPCs talking and then trying to figure out how to assist these people avoid death.  I enjoyed the characters, and players quite a bit because they're all pretty unique, and they all have a great story. \n\nThe gameplay itself is rather simplistic but works well, the player is allowed to explore the house at his leisure for 12 hours that takes close to 12 minutes or so.  He's able to look at objects, observe rooms and even spy on adjoining rooms to watch something happen.  All these tools help inform the player of what's happening.   The player can sometimes interact with objects and thus stop the murders. \n\nReally the only problem with this game is there's very few red herrings, if you find all the objects that can be modified, you'll find all the pieces you need to solve the puzzle.  There's only one object that's not used for the story and it's used for a side achievement, and it doesn't feel necessary. \n\nI also didn't have problems with any of the murders except one.   I had the pieces but i tried to make it more complicated than I thought it was, I over thought it and spend half an hour trying to do something far harder than I needed to do.   Once I realize what I missed, everything fell into place. \n\nOn the other hand a lot of times you'll have to listen closely or be in the right place at the right time to make sure you hear a key piece of information.  Sometimes it's required to solve a puzzle as it'll unlock a special door, or location, sometimes you just need to know what has been done that you have to undo to solve it.  So there's a good gameplay loop of trying to figure out what's going on or what's causing someone's death, and then working to fix it. \n\nIn fact out of the 7ish \"sets of murders\" there's only one that I was underwhelmed at which is the last one.   In fact I feel the entire game's ending is weak.  The game tries to be headsy and deep, and the fact is, I liked the game for the simple fun of the gameplay and world, not for the huge story it tries to deliver.   It's not annoying (you don't have to try to prevent every murder in one run which would have been brutal) but the story doesn't develop the overarching story until the final minutes, and by then I didn't care, I felt like I saved people (at least once) and what it tried to deliver was too late to really have the impact they wanted. \n\nBut does it ruin the game?  Nah, of course not, The Sexy Brutale is a great game, it's unique, novel, and wonderful.  Great graphics, great gameplay, and really the only flaw other than the story is length.  I did everything in the game in 8 hours, and the game doesn't really allow more to be done.  The idea of a \"perfect run\" is impossible as the game stops you every time you save someone, so I couldn't even try to do anything more.  Once you finish the game, collect all the collectibles, and use that red herring I mentioned, you're done. \n\nAnd you've probably had a good time doing it too.  So the question should be asked, Do you want a game that leaves you wanting more, or do you want a game that wears out its welcome.  The first is always better, and I think the Sexy Brutale errs on that side.   I want more, I want to see another mansion and another cast.  I want a remix, I want more.   And honestly, that's all good. \n\nSo I recommend this game if you want something new, and unique.  It'll do both of those things very well.  It's a fantastic experience.   It is shortish (8 hours) but at 20 bucks, that might acceptable.  It also does go on sale often, but overall, I think the developer deserves the extra cash for delivering an excellent unique experience and fascinating stories.\n\nIn addition I've created a curator account to gather all my reviews availble here if you are interested: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/31803828-Kinglink-Reviews/", "timestamp_created": 1516050181, "timestamp_updated": 1516320696, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.574288", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39372907": {"recommendationid": "39372907", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038930292", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 538, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 538, "last_played": 1515991283}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun, creative, well worth it.", "timestamp_created": 1516045189, "timestamp_updated": 1516045189, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39365433": {"recommendationid": "39365433", "author": {"steamid": "76561198367741201", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 472, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 472, "last_played": 1516023679}, "language": "english", "review": "You can say that this is a simple puzzle game with a time travelling twist.

A decently intriguing intro mixed with nice graphical choices and great audio. A very strong start and a pretty strong middle too. I'd say my biggest disappointments were the ending and the lack of a real reason for the masks chasing you. The vast majority of the time I'd ignore them and go about my business. The only time they were even a nuisance-and that's what they were, a nuisance-was when I was trying to take a good look at a room I was exploring and they'd bumble in or I wanted to be in a room and they were in there and I couldn't go in cause of it.\n\nAs far as the ending goes, I was worried here and there that the ending was going to be what it was and I knew pretty early on, but like I said the game intro and middle were strong enough to keep that nagging sensation at bay. Until I had to deal with the ending and I was essentially like 'Yes, yes. I have seen this kind of ending before'. Technically there is more than one ending I guess, but they're both pretty cheap.\n\nAnyway, I haven't really talked much about the gameplay. I'd compare this game to a kind of old school graphic adventure game in a way because you kinda have to combine objects, but at the same time a LOT of it is super obvious and you don't have that many items at any one time so it's not really a big hassle. I actually don't usually like this kinda game, but the measure of control I was given was satisfactory enough to bypass the usual annoyances. I really like games that give you direct control of your character rather than pointing and clicking to where they go.\n\nThe big feature to the game is that you keep replaying the same day and you are trying to stop people from dying. This would have a lot more impact if it wasn't for the ending being so predictable, but it's still enjoyable to watch em die in various ways and then try to find out how you're supposed to save them. WITH THAT SAID. I solved two murders (after the first) by bumbling around and exploring. I literally didn't even know I was saving the first pair of people until it gave me a cutscene. Heck I hadn't even seen either of them die at that point either. So in terms of difficulty this game is way down there. You know a game isn't hard when you solve a puzzle without even recognizing that you're being tested.\n\nUsually that would be a huge turn off to me but man, the music for this game is great! I love music that goes along with things, like really good music videos and such or games with soundtracks that match what you're doing and this game does a fantastic job of it! Really the music is strong enough to carry the game and in some ways it does. If the music wasn't in the game, I wouldn't recommend it I promise you.\n\nThe UI elements are nice and clean, but I find scrolling through the 'collectibles' to be a little tedious. I also found reading a lot of the collectibles stuff to be kinda nice, but some of it is a little repetetive and repeats the same stuff others say but say it in a different way...so that's kind of a bummer.\n\nGraphics are nice and I did find MOST of the character designs to be pretty fabulous. The face reveal for the main character was a little lame. I guess mostly due to the anticipation built up to see him finally remove his mask and get someone so...meh relative to the other characters in terms of personality, but it might also be because I swear I have seen someone from some disney movie who looks just like him. I almost feel like it might be a reference to them too cause he also dealt with bombs...weird that I think that and it's from a movie I never even seen either.\n\nLoad times between rooms are sometimes obnoxious. This isn't mentioning that sometimes you'll go into a room and just sit there in a mostly black room waiting for it to load. The controls are good, but not amazing. There was a number of times I found my character getting stuck on something I thought I could pass through or the perspective made me feel like something wasn't there. Still I wish more games could reach this level at the very least. It's a very good spot to get to with a game.\n\nThe story is pretty good up until the end. I came into the game not knowing what to expect, but then quickly got the impression the game was going to end the way it did. Then about 3/4's the way through the game I thought it was about to take an unexpected turn. Then it went right back to where I was expecting and I was disappointed again. If you are younger or more inexperienced with this type of thing then you will probably enjoy the ending. I've seen this stuff in media a lot though. The whole 'It's me! I was the turkey all along!' is a concept I don't really enjoy. Also I question some of the logic behind what the character was doing at the end. I've seen this motive before and for someone like that I have to wonder how they reach the conclusion that they do instead of another one that involves just not being an idiot. Like for real.\n\n\nTo summarize:\n\nDifficulty: C - The puzzles are usually pretty creative, but they're far from difficult. Just a little too easy to be truly satisfying.\nGraphics: 7/10 - Everything is stylized and looks pretty nice. There's a handful of graphical design choices that make me go 'whatever', but overall better than average.\nMusic: Top Tier - The way the music is setup is pretty fuckin good. Not god tier, but really high up there.\nControls: Solid - They work. They're a little chalky from time to time, but they work which is actually quite good when you consider how shitty some games can make controls nowadays.\nOverall Story/Plot: A multi-layer box of cookies with the last two trays already eaten when you get to them - The story starts quite strong. A good start and a good middle. Great characters with pretty awesome personalities. An ending that is yawn worthy.\n\nI'd say this game is a well made game with a smart gimmick attached, but with a few flaws.\n\nAlso, zero replay value. The reason should be obvious, but I will tell you in case you do not know. Spending the entire game replaying small sections of the entire game makes for very poor replayability.", "timestamp_created": 1515839274, "timestamp_updated": 1515839837, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39299543": {"recommendationid": "39299543", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121943037", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 574, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 250, "last_played": 1515857288}, "language": "english", "review": "There is somewhat a good game here.

(I let you convert it to your country's money but, spoiler : it's overpriced)\n\nI will come back on the popular tags used for this game : \n- Adventure : Not really. There is not much thrill or action in this game\n- Puzzle : Not at all, there is only a bit of thinking to do to solve the murders.\n- Mystery : Yes, it's mysterious\n- Time Travel : Not really, you're replaying the same day over and over.\n- Story Rich : Lol, nope\n\nThis game has great ideas. Really, I enjoy the gameplay, following the victims, the murderers, needing to stay hidden, unlocking \"powers\". But it's way to dense : you just the powers one or two times, and it's already the end of the game. I solved some murders by pure luck, not knowing it would solve the actual problem. It looks like a problem to me when you can solve a puzzle without wanting to, when the game is partially based on solving them.\nI encountered some bugs (room being dark for few seconds when I enter them), and the controls with the joypad are sometimes clingy. It may be a problem with the hitboxes, but sometimes I had to try many times to just open a doors, not counting the facts that certains objects near doors activates while you just try to open the said door.\n\n\nThis game is full of good ideas but definitly too short and too easy to discover the full potential.

This one is actually quite easy though in terms of the puzzle solving to be fair. The immediate thing that made this game stand out when I saw a video was the way it looked. It's got a cartoon art style and the characters seem to be bobble headed thunderbirds in the way they move about. It's all set in a beautiful huge gothic style mansion that's great to explore, and doing so actually benefits you as it's full of secret passages. Pretty much every room in the game, even the short hallways, will have at least a couple of points of interest for you to look at. Occasionally this does something to help you with the puzzles but mostly they just have a couple of short lines of flavour text that do well to add to your immersion into the setting. The music is absolutely fantastic too, a different track for each area of the mansion and mostly lively and upbeat jazz tracks to juxtapose with the story. \n\nThe premise of the game is that a masquerade party is being hosted at the mansion and throughout the evening the staff of the mansion are murdering all of the guests one by one so you need to save them. It's not really made obvious who you are but something strange is going on because your first interaction is with a woman who seems to be made of blood and appears through the floor to explain this to you. The masks that all of the guests and staff are wearing react to yours to prevent you from being in the same room as them so you need to go around the mansion looking through keyholes and listening out to the conversations of the guests to work out how to save them without ever actually being in the same room as them. At the end of each day in the game the clock rewinds and you start again with all of the knowledge you gained from the previous day, but none of the items. Each guest you save takes off their mask and you gain it's powers, usually giving you access to areas of the mansion you couldn't go before, along with other benefits.\n\nThe map in this game is superb and not something I've ever seen done before. Not only does it map out the entirety of the mansion that you've seen before, but if you've looked through a keyhole to watch one of the guests/staff in a room it will mark that on the map too. The map then has a clock that you can change the time on so you can scrub through a day looking at the map to trace the movements of people that you've watched previously to help you fill in the gaps.\n\nAs I said before, the puzzle solving in the game isn't exactly challenging, there's way more emphasis on just exploring and learning about the guests and their backstories through listening in to their conversations. Most of the puzzles will be pretty clear to you simply by spending a few days following the characters involved in this particular murder, and you have to do them in a set order, but it is the following them around that I enjoyed rather than the satisfaction of solving a puzzle.

This mechanic is put in the game via a pocketwatch, multiple clocks and windup keys thrown throughout the game.\n\nThe game mainly uses one's mouse to move, and keyboard to interact with the environment. The character himself does not have a life bar, and only one way to die. Due to this, gameplay is more laid back and relaxed.\n\nPuzzles in the game uses in game time, where every one in the game(excluding the player) has a set routine, a set way to die, and a set time to die. As a player, one needs to find a way to prevent these deaths. This is where the time mechanic comes to play. Some items are fixed in the game, others are found only after a certain time when an NPC puts the object there. This itself is interesting as some puzzles require one to be in a specific place at a certain time. There are no enemies in the game, however, one is able to die if stayed in a room with an NPC for too long.\n\nThe setting of the game is beautiful, and the art style compliments this. The character design, along with the environment design stays cohesive as one walks through the corridors and rooms of the game. Characters are design with a 'chibi' artstyle in mind, and are all kept unique on one way or another. The environments are detailed and it's easy to see all the work put in it as the game is played in an isometric -esque way.\n\nThe music in the game is just as good as it looks. The soundtrack mainly sounds akin to something from a jazzier era.\nThey're all very unique and is a treat to listen to as one plays through the game.\n\nThe story itself is a rather odd thing for me as it did leave me a sense of satisfaction, but did fall into cliches at times. It is rather short, and simple but as I've stated, it gave me a satisfied ending.\n\nThe game is not without problems. One of which is that the puzzles are mostly very simple and almost always well telegraphed. They are well designed, no doubt, but once one notices the telegraphs, the puzzles become a breeze. Puzzles are often contained in one area and are compartmentalized. Due to this, the mechanic isn't well used and should have been expanded more. However, I feel that it can be more enjoyable if played while just sitting back, and relaxing with someone as both of them can talk through the solution before actually settling onto one.\n\nAnother problem I find in the game is that there are numerous delays when loading into other areas. This occurs almost always when one tries to go through a door. This is a small problem, but it did get in the way when one has a feeling of urgency, and frustrating when being chased as it halts one completely into one spot.\n\nA third problem in the game is the lack of graphics settings. The game itself runs well enough, but the lack of any adjustable graphics settings is a small bother.\n\nOverall, it was great and I enjoyed it immensely. The game looks and sounds beautiful, puzzles are varied, and the story is engagable, despite its flaws.

The inspiration becomes clearer at the end.\n\nEND SPOILER\n\n\nThe titular Sexy Brutale is a huge mansion in which a plethora of characters from different social classes will gather to have fun and play cards, drink, chat, dance and die. Die horribly, in many ways.\nThe player controls Lafcadio Boone, a gentleman guest just like the others, who appears to have been stunned inside the mansion's inner chapel. From there, with the help of a mysterious, bloodied girl, Laffy will receive a very special power that will grant him the ability to rewind time using a pocket watch. As more sections of the mansion get explored, the player will be able to witness many murders and figure out a way to stop them one by one, rewinding the day over and over again with the ultimate goal of uncovering the mastermind behind this sick game of life and death.\nThe gameplay is very simple, it all controls and feels like a point-and-click adventure, with an inventory and a section for lore \\ collectables. the Z key is used to combine an acquired item with an object in the world, the X key grants Laffy the ability to look into the next room while spying on the keyhole, and the Right Mouse button is used to interact with pretty much everything. Left Mouse button to run around.\n\nAbout halfway through, you will see the pieces of the puzzle coming together if you are used to this type of stories, as it's not too hard to complete and the plot overall takes no more than 10 hours to be unfolded, second runs are optional and add some extra layer of usefulness to your repertoire, but that's only if you are into collecting cards or invitations to the mansion.\n\n\nThe Sexy Brutale is, in the end, \"a tragedy played safe\", with familiar tropes and recognizable inspirations, but nonetheless appreciable, easy on the eyes with its colorful and consistent artstyle, filled with references and very well directed when needed be. The only real problem I have with it, is that there's no option to rebind keys, but that's a minor complaint.

Even though characters are stereotypes of voodoo/goth chick, stupid grunt, smart guy etc., it fits. While at first there might be a lot of questions and it can get somewhat confusing, it is all answered at the end of the game.\nProblem with this game is how short on content it is and lacking puzzle aspect. Game holds your hand for the most time, so there is not much thinking required. You have time constrains, but there are no consequences or anything. It's worse, because game is downright lying by saying something like \"changing one thing might end up being worse\" - I didn't notice a chance to do that, since the game is linear and only opens the whole mansion near the end and you have clear objective you must do. Ending is both good and awful - good, because it gives nice conclusion, but bad from the game perspective, because the game turns into visual novel. As far as I know, there is no auto option for the dialog, so you have to press right mouse button every time speech bubble appears. And there is quite a few of them. What also sucks is the whole confession thing, because you were there, you've seen that, so there is no need to pad out the game even more.\nThe game isn't challenging at all - ever played Neighbours from Hell? It's pretty much the same game deal, only darker. You watch what is happening, and then do whatever you have to do to advance.

The music gives the game a charm unlike no other and never grew dull throughout my experience. Whether it was the lively jazz or the chillingly haunting singer the music never failed to enchant me.\n\nAdditionally the visuals are astonishing. They run well on virtually any graphic setup, and the graphics are beautiful. THe character design is unique and there is heavy visual flavor for all of the characters. The game is striking visually in the setting alone through the variety of locations and perfect detail.\n\nSpecifically the story and puzzles involved are very worth it. This is a mystery game at the heart, but it doesn't take itself too seriously. By making the puzzles not insanely difficult it removes the aspects of hints and hand holding and lets the user discover everything by themselves. Even now, there are still pockets of the game I have yet to discover.\nThere is much to be found in each character's story, but the story of the Sexy Brutale itself is wonderful. \n\nHighly recommend playing the game all the way through, no spoilers, but the ending is definitely worth it.\n\nAll in all, it was a powerful and enabling experience that was euphoria for the eyes. 20 seems like a steep cost for what is relatively a short game, but the content is as grounding as a fantastic book, and about the same price. Amazing job by Cavalier Game Studios, and I'll be watching their work for any other gemstones\n\nHowever I do have some knocks against the game. The lack of straightforward fast travel can make the game a slog near the end, but it is not so bad that you cannot go for 100% on this game(my first full achievement game). Also the lack of progress inventory makes it hard to complete the deck of cards.\n\nPlot Free Spoiler\n[spoiler] Complete the Deck of Cards, it's worth it for the additional and wonderful alt ending[/spoiler]\n\n\nP.S.

In truth I wasn\u2019t paying much attention to the trailer, nor did I read the official Steam description or the popular tags the first time I was on the store page.\n\nThe Sexy Brutale is a very intriguing murder-mystery puzzle game, centred around a mechanic that allows you to bend time in order to save the guests of The Sexy Brutale Casino Mansion from being killed by the mysterious, superbly sarcastic staff. Instead of finding out who killed (or attempts to kill) the guests you witness their deaths first hand and attempt to save them by interacting with the environment and picking up key items. Although you\u2019ll wonder why they\u2019re killing off the guests and who is ordering them to\u2026\n\nThis is an interesting concept with each of the 10 guests\u2019 deaths being unique and eventful in their own way. When I had to solve each death I spent way too long on some. Most of the time I\u2019d forget about interacting with certain items like a fish tank, instrumental in solving one of the murders. Some people will breeze through this game, others will take longer which isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing as the visuals and the music is easily the best part of The Sexy Brutale and have been crafted with a genuine love and care.\n\nIf you enjoy puzzle games there is a lot to love here, but whilst some love it I can appreciate this game not being for everyone. I previously said \u201cSome people will breeze though this game\u201d. It could feel rather short to some players which wouldn\u2019t be a problem if it weren\u2019t for the story. It\u2019s odd addressing one of the best/worst things about the entire game. I\u2019m still on the fence about out. I like aspects about it and it has a HUGE twist towards the end which I found intriguing but  I\u2019ll let you decide if you like it (if you don\u2019t buy/finish the game you could always watch a walkthrough, I\u2019ll link one at the bottom just in case). However I can understand if the story leaves something desired for some. \n\nThank the lord there is a secret ending which is achieved after finishing one of the worst card games ever invented, 52 pickup.\n\nThis game has a lot of charm, wit, humour and soul. From watching videos of the creators talking about it, it\u2019s clear they hit the nail right on the head when it came to setting out what they wanted to achieve with this game. \n\n[h1] Would I recommend you buy this game? [/h1]\n\n I believe a majority of people would enjoy this game, a minority of people would appreciate the artistic elements of this game and I for one will remember this game as one of the best experiences I\u2019ve ever had with a video game although not everyone\u2019s palette is the same.\n\nAlso whoever composed the main theme, have my children.\n\nThank you for reading and I hope I could be of help.\n\n[h1] The Sexy Brutale Walktrhough by Game Shelter: [/h1]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMtRa_dLIPc&list=PLeIlSM6u3xNMEyWe80diQOtTNw2d5ngRx", "timestamp_created": 1514693570, "timestamp_updated": 1514693932, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38886344": {"recommendationid": "38886344", "author": {"steamid": "76561198355055767", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514412322}, "language": "english", "review": "It looks good, it plays good, the music is good, the plot is good,\nThe game is good.

Of course the game is very short, if you have any idea of what you're doing you can finish the game in 4-5 hours without much trouble, though that is to the game's advantage as well. If the game was much longer than that, the relatively simple mechanics would almost certainly have ran their course far too early for most players. While the powers you earn initially seem very interesting and unique, it doesn't take too long for them to ultimately boil down to \"you have this thing, so you can progress past this point\" in a similar fashion to zelda/metroid. That sort of progression is what works in a more adventure/action focused game, and not so much a puzzle game, but given how short the game is, it's not a major issue. \n\nThe story actually manages to tie things up nicely in a fairly short amount of time, and that's far more than what can be said for most titles. Foreshadowing was used to great effect throughout the game, which I personally love to see. The little bits of dialogue you get to eavesdrop on are well in-tune with the music and visuals.

Yet, without a doubt, a few things are certain in my mind: This is a beautiful game with beautiful artwork and an absolutely *beautiful* story. The last thing I thought I would be doing is crying in this game, however I did.\n\nFirst, this game is inherently intriguing because of its concept: You're in this enormous mansion with devilish servants that kill off guests simultaneously. Everything's multi-threaded. You have the ability to rewind back to the beginning of the day. That's interesting and that is potential.\n\nHowever, I do admit that it gets a bit drawn out and overwhelming at times. The mansion is, well, humongous. Finishing one portion of the mansion, feeling proud, then unlocking an entirely new and unknown area can be a bit daunting. I didn't often find myself excited to go exploring this new area. Perhaps it's the bleekness that I'm discovering someone dying, or perhaps it's the dauntingness of starting from scratch in a new area where you don't know the rooms, the layouts, and the players nor their movements. However, it's good casual fun with the servants often giving more than enough hints if you stalk them around and listen into their conversations. \n\nThe real part that surprised me is the story. I ended the game with the revelation that I really, genuinely, cared about the characters and their past and their story. I loved each and every one of their unique personalities, and above all: I love the main character. The antagonist and protagonist colors this story into a heart-wrenching and truly inspirational message in the end. I truly didn't think I'd leave this game having learned life lessons, but I think I did from this game.\n\nTo summarize my opinion: The gameplay is engine revving up for this game: It's unique and quickly gets your attention, yet dries up fairly quickly. The story, however, is the smooth drift onwards. The ending? That's the reward and final destination.

Es una pena porque pod\u00eda ser un juegazo si llegan a confiar un poco m\u00e1s en la inteligencia de los jugadores. A\u00fan as\u00ed, pese a lo que considero sus defectos, lo recomiendo a cualquiera que busque un juego de puzzles original.\n\nThe Sexy Brutale parte de un concepto bastante original: est\u00e1s encerrado en una mansi\u00f3n en la que se repite, una y otra vez, el mismo d\u00eda en el que mueren todos los asistentes a una exc\u00e9ntrica fiesta de m\u00e1scaras. Nosotros somos los \u00fanicos que podemos salvar a las v\u00edctimas y para ello debemos espiar los movimientos de unos y otros para frustrar los asesinatos.  El juego consiste por tanto en una parte de an\u00e1lisis (ir espiando los recorridos y sucesos) y otra de acci\u00f3n (encontrar objetos y usarlos en los lugares correspondientes). No es un juego dif\u00edcil, ni siquiera exigente, porque no te pueden matar y el sistema de control e inventario no da para mucho. Se basa m\u00e1s en disfrutar de la experiencia que en desafiarte. \n\nY con todos estos mimbres ten\u00edan para un juegazo. Pero se ha quedado en bueb juego a secas. Porque hay una decisi\u00f3n de dise\u00f1o que no comprendo: no tienes libertad total para moverte por toda la mansi\u00f3n (que por cierto es bastante grande). En lugar de eso te van llevando de la mano de un asesinato a otro, de forma secuencial, desarroll\u00e1ndose estos en una zona relativamente peque\u00f1a. Y lo peor es que se notan demasiado 'las paredes' para no poder avanzar. Ver como tu personaje se detiene en medio de un pasillo y dice 'una fuerza espectral me impide avanzar' es un corte de rollo inmersivo total. Que s\u00ed, que luego explican el motivo de este impedimento pero, sinceramente, me parece prescindible.\n\nPor la propia estructura de los asesinatos hay un orden l\u00f3gico (porque cada asesinato desbloquea una m\u00e1scara y con ella un poder) por lo que no eran necesarias estas barreras formales. Supongo que lo hicieron as\u00ed para simplificar el juego, para que nadie se sintiera frustrado dando vueltas por la mansi\u00f3n sin saber que asesinato tocaba parar... pero es una pena. Porque repito: el juego es muy f\u00e1cil, demasiado evidente. Precisamente esa peque\u00f1a capa de complejidad lo har\u00eda m\u00e1s divertido, probablemente m\u00e1s largo (en menos de tres horas lo ventilas) y no excesivamente complicado. \n\nOtro punto que me dej\u00f3 poco satisfecho es que en ning\u00fan momento llegu\u00e9 a sentirme parte de la trama. S\u00ed, eres un observador, y vas salvando gente que aparentemente te conoce. Pero no te sientes parte de nada. Quiz\u00e1s eso sea lo que pretend\u00edan los autores pero como jugador lo \u00fanico que me impel\u00eda a salvar a esos tipos era ver que zona de la mansi\u00f3n se abr\u00eda despu\u00e9s. Y en un juego donde quieres que la historia sea parte central eso es un fallo gordo. Parece que como no sab\u00edan como hacer que el giro final fuera menos evidente (que lo es) quisieron enmascararlo todo (sin doble sentido) para que el jugador se sintiera perdido de forma muy artificial. \n\nLeyendo esto parece que no voy a recomendarlo pero ya habr\u00e9is visto el pulgar hacia arriba. S\u00ed que lo recomiendo. Porque pese a esos defectos reconozco que The Sexy Brutale es un juego muy arriesgado. Tequila Works no ha ido a la aventura f\u00e1cil y ha planteado un formato bastante raro, complicado de describir incluso, y lo han dotado de un aspecto visual y sonoro precioso. Se nota buen el buen hacer en esta compa\u00f1\u00eda espa\u00f1ola. \n\nVisualmente la mansi\u00f3n me ha recordado, salvando las \u00e9pocas, a la famosa Abad\u00eda del Crimen, con una arquitectura espectacular (cada una para su \u00e9poca) en formato isom\u00e9trico, muy detallada, con esos personajes que se mueven con las rutinas monacales.", "timestamp_created": 1513693453, "timestamp_updated": 1513716375, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534162", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38410018": {"recommendationid": "38410018", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970479670", "num_games_owned": 923, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 653, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513637988}, "language": "english", "review": "A brilliant take to the adventure game genre, The Sexy Brutale is short but a delightfully bittersweet treat, an excellent mix of sight, sound, lore, and gameplay.  I'm gushing just a bit, true, but they should all be this good.\n\nThe gameplay is simple enough to summarize: from an isometric perspective, you wander a lavish mansion exploring details and finding the occasional thing to pick up and use.  The day repeats on a twelve hour loop (about 1 real life minute to 1 game hour), so you relive the same day, watching the inhabitants go about the same doomed routine that inevitably leads up to their murders, but you cannot be in the same room with them so you have to assist indirectly.  \n\nInterrupt the murder, particulate in a cutscene of the grateful victims, and move on to the next area.  Get to the end, get to the bottom of The Sexy Brutale, find the true mastermind behind the murders, and put an end to it.  Or not.  After all, you have all the time in the world.  Shame the guests keep dying every time you reset the clock, even the ones you have saved, you even get audiably reminded as you wonder around the mansion who is dying from what.  Gallows humor abounds, but sometimes the humor takes a rest, leaving only the gallows.\n\nCritically speaking, the biggest nit to pick is that the puzzles are overly simple.  Resist that urge to reach for a walkthrough, you shouldn't need it, the game will even spell out the answer to you if you're in the right place at the right time.  You might need help to collect all 52 playing cards and the guest invitations, a bit of a monotonous hunt, but that's quite optional, with a payoff no better than simply seeing the story to completion.  Even though the protagonist plods along at an old man's clip, the game is shorter than it first appears, and the sprawling mansion will feel small in the end.  I took my sweet time and I am at just under 11 hours with all achievements unlocked.\n\nYet, obviously the game holds together quite well, or I would not have been gushing over it.  The content is great, I really came to love the characters and the whole story, which was smartly planned, executed, and more than a little significant.

Pese a que la estructura de la mansi\u00f3n nos permitir\u00eda recorrerla de forma libre, el juego est\u00e1 planteado de forma deliberada para que hagamos un recorrido secuencial bien definido, donde cada nuevo intento de asesinato podriamos considerarlo \"un cap\u00edtulo\" dentro de una intrincada trama en la que tendremos no solo que resolver estos asesinatos, sino quien y por qu\u00e9 est\u00e1 detr\u00e1s de estos, y eso es algo que sorprender\u00e1 a los que llegu\u00e9n al final de este t\u00edtulo.\n\nThe Sexy Brutale es un juego que imita mec\u00e1nicas de las aventuras gr\u00e1ficas, en su uso de la investigaci\u00f3n de las distintas habitaciones, y la resoluci\u00f3n de problemas planteados como puzles, o simplemente el abrirnos paso a trav\u00e9s de la mansi\u00f3n usando objetos y habilidades. Precisamente las habilidades ser\u00e1 uno de los puntos interesantes del juego, ya que a medida que rescatemos invitados, adquiriremos m\u00e1scaras que nos har\u00e1n ganar habilidades, y estas abrir\u00e1n nuevas posibilidades jugables, desde ver esp\u00edritus de la mansi\u00f3n a escuchar conversaciones inaudibles, se suman ya a otras mec\u00e1nicas iniciales como ser\u00eda escuchar a trav\u00e9s de paredes o mirar a trav\u00e9s de los ojos de cerradura de las puertas. Estas mec\u00e1nicas son vitales para poder resolver los cr\u00edmenes y anticiparnos a estos en un nuevo bucle. Tendremos que leer patrones de movimiento, calcular el timing con otros personajes..., pero siempre sin que nos vean, ya que si coincidimos con otros personajes en una habitaci\u00f3n, nos veremos en problemas, as\u00ed que hay que andar con mucho sigilo.\n\nEl juego no es muy largo, y aunque ingenioso, tampoco es excesivamente dif\u00edcil, lo que me ha llevado unas 6 horas en completarlo, y aunque tiene m\u00e1s de un final, puede saber a poco a algunos, pero aun as\u00ed, el tiempo que dura no defrauda. El juego est\u00e1 en constante evoluci\u00f3n durante el desarrollo a\u00f1adiendo nuevas mec\u00e1nicas, haciendo acesibles nuevos rincones de la mansi\u00f3n y permiti\u00e9ndonos acceder a nuevos personajes que, como un reloj suizo, repiten d\u00eda tras d\u00eda la misma secuencia de actos con precisi\u00f3n milim\u00e9trica, en un intrincado y elaborado desarrollo sincronizado por parte de todos los personajes.\n\nGr\u00e1ficamente es agradable, colorido, las habitaciones tiene muchos estilos y los entornos se sienten detallados y con estilo, con unos personajes que se estiman de un estilo m\u00e1s caricaturesco aunque a decir verdad, el juego no deja mucho espacio para apreciarlos, pues la acci\u00f3n se siente siempre alejada de estos. A nivel sonoro tiene una gran banda sonora que combina estilos como el jazz, el blue o el swing, y los efectos tienen mucha importancia incluso en la jugabilidad, lo que le da m\u00e1s puntos a este. L\u00e1stima que el rendimiento no est\u00e9 tan bien optimizado como esperar\u00eda de un juego que en ning\u00fan momento deber\u00eda suponer un problema para equipos modernos, pero a veces tarda en cargar habitaciones o el protagonista no reacciona como es debido a nuestras acciones.\n\nAl margen de todo ello, The Sexy Brutale es un gran juego que prima la exploraci\u00f3n, la investigaci\u00f3n y la resoluci\u00f3n de enigmas tirando de ingenio y clase. Un tapado de este 2017 que cierra en breves, y que recomiendo a todo el que quiera una experiencia novedosa, original y que se mantiene interesante de principio a fin.\n\nUn an\u00e1lisis m\u00e1s exhaustivo: https://showmeyourmoves.wordpress.com/2017/12/10/analisis-the-sexy-brutale/\nSi quieres unirte a mi grupo de Steam: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/JoshCell\nSi quieres seguirme como mentor en Steam: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/29569915-Josh-Cell/", "timestamp_created": 1512920058, "timestamp_updated": 1512920058, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561856", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38212548": {"recommendationid": "38212548", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119762555", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 594, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513437195}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u660e\u660e\u7f6a\u5982\u9c9c\u8840\uff0c\u5374\u53c8\u7eaf\u767d\u5982\u96ea\n\n\u6545\u4e8b\u5f88\u7b80\u77ed\uff0c\u4f46\u65e2\u6709\u6e38\u620f\u6027\uff0c\u53c8\u5f88\u4f1a\u8bf4\u6545\u4e8b\uff0c\u603b\u4f53\u65f6\u5e38\u6070\u5230\u597d\u5904\n\n\u8981\u662f\u518d\u589e\u52a0\u4e00\u4e9b\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e0d\u90a3\u4e48\u4f11\u95f2\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u6027\u4f1a\u66f4\u597d", "timestamp_created": 1512918409, "timestamp_updated": 1512949352, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38206403": {"recommendationid": "38206403", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061150104", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512901697}, "language": "english", "review": "I was surprised that this little puzzle-adventure mystery game was as involving as it was.

The Sexy Brutale is nothing short of a fantastic puzzle game. That said, describing the game is actually somewhat difficult, as I'm not really sure what genera of game to call it. Adventure maybe? The idea is that you walk around the beautifully designed and very dense mansion full of flavor text and subtle world building, trying to save other guests without them actually seeing you for story reasons. With a gripping thriller mystery driving the plot, it's genuinely hard to put down, as the story twists and turns leaving you just as confused as our hero. The other brilliant thing about this game is that you rarely feel stuck, I'm awful at puzzle games and even I got through  it just fine. There's plenty of secrets and collectibles in the game too, each revealing what's going on more and more.

Not that Sexy Brutale is not a good game, but it's also rather short and expensive for that and has some gameplay and technical issues. So, ultimately you have to decide if about 5 hours are worth 20 bucks to you.\n\nWhat is TSB? It's a kind of murder solving puzzle game with a time rewind feature. Your task is to save the guests in the mansion, one by one. To do so you'll have to stalk their movements, listen to their monologues/dialogues and find out how/why they die and who the murderer is. These murderers are the household staff, which you can of course also stalk and eavesdrop on. With every piece of information you can in theory get closer to preventing their deaths, as every movement and every room you have explored is cartographed in a map that can be manipulated to show where a certain character will be at a certain time. Once you have enough information, or they have died or your 12 hour day is simply up, you can just restart the day from the beginning and try again. After you have successfully saved a gues you get a new special ability that will be necessary to save the next one. Make no mistake, the game is absolutely linear as far as I know. You can't just go everywhere, because paths will be blocked and guest can't be saved without certain abilities (like talking to ghosts).\n\nMost of these cases aren't terribly difficult and are logical, however, there are a few point in the game where I was simply left clueless as to what I'd even have to do now to continue the game. With enough exploring you can get through usually, but a hint or two here or there wouldn't have been terrible, especially since interactable objects don't always make 100% sense. Who would think about filling an object with water to water a tree? Repeatedly? And some objects are hard to see and especially 1 little detail you've maybe noticed at the start of the game can suddenly be relevant again at the end of it. Only the most important details are noted on the map, but for example what is shatterable glass and what isn't? Well, let's just say there's room for improvement. One puzzle in particular was aggravating, since the area in which it took place was just so enormous, going about it logically seemed really hard to do. For the most part though, the puzzles are fun.\n\nSo far so good, if it weren't for the terrible performance issues. In some rooms the framerate (no graphic options by the way) will simply tank hard and it shows. There's also a real performance issue when transitioning from one room to an unexplored room (on that particular day). It seems the game has to reload the assets with every restart of a day, which leads to severe issues when opening doors or trying to peek through them. The game is simply unresponsive and might even freeze for a while. An SSD MAY alleviate those problems, but frankly, an SSD should NOT be required for this game to work properly.\n\nAnother minor nitpick is the animation length, especially after starting a new day. Most animations just take forever and can't be cancelled or skipped. Yes, it looks neat, but after doing some task for the tenth time I just want my character to get it done. Since there is no running in this game and no quick travel either this can get tiresome after a while.\n\nIn the end TSB is an interesting game with some beauty flaws and no replay value whatsoever, so I'd suggest at least a 50% discount.

However, the earliest report of this bug occurred back in April, when the game was released. So for 9 months this bug has been untouched.

Check out my first impressions video for more in depth thoughts on gameplay. \nhttps://youtu.be/Gw5t6Nlwdz8\nThe detailed, animation-like visuals and charming character designs fit nicely with the upbeat, toe-tapping music, but this can swiftly and smartly turn to macabre and melancholy. The Sexy Brutale has bags of atmosphere and an interesting take on puzzle solving.\n\nIt\u2019s a nice change from the point and click style of puzzle solving which involves rubbing things on things to progress. Having now completed the game I\u2019m a little disappointed in how basic the puzzles are and it\u2019s a little shallow in this regard compared to something like Majora\u2019s Mask. Perhaps giving you alternative solutions to the puzzles would have improved he gameplay as a lot of the rooms in the mansion (in which the game takes place) feel underused, as do the \u2018powers\u2019 you get from the saved guest\u2019s masks.\n\nWhat makes the game memorable is its presentation and story, which you unravel like the puzzles. It was a little predictable towards the end and the characters lacked depth but the presentation made it feel more involving and emotional.\n\nI suffered from an annoying technical issue whilst playing; on opening doors I would often experience slow down or freezing for several seconds which wasn\u2019t game breaking but needs to be fixed.\n\nStill definitely worth checking out for people that like puzzle games with a twist or atmospheric games with nice art styles.", "timestamp_created": 1512408151, "timestamp_updated": 1512554563, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567026", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38061411": {"recommendationid": "38061411", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997661287", "num_games_owned": 612, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 433, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512408168}, "language": "polish", "review": "Zagadkowa i \u0142adna historia, dla niej samej warto zagra\u0107.", "timestamp_created": 1512407920, "timestamp_updated": 1512407920, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.456865", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38059517": {"recommendationid": "38059517", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017855478", "num_games_owned": 593, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 459, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512504832}, "language": "english", "review": "I loved it.

I thoroughly enjoyed the game (enough to 100% it, which is a rarity nowadays).  That takes about 10 hours to do (maybe less, if you catch on quicker than I do).  It's a tad expensive for that, but honestly, these guys deserve it for the great work.\n\nThe mechanics are easy to understand and the puzzle solving is intuitive and the gradual opening up of the mansion as you gain mechanics is very reminscent of survival horror like the early Resident Evil games.  There are a fair share of spooks and the murders are fairly grisly (if not rendered to be so explicitly, it isn't SAW).  The game itself isn't HARD, however, and the challenge is in puzzling out of solutions and executing them at the predetermined times than in any sort of quick reaction or on your feet thinking.  You're not going to die due a botched quick-time event; there's none of that here.\n\nAll and all, the game is fun and rewarding, if a bit slower paced.  It can be repetative when you're trying to figure things out or keep having to redo things in order to figure out exactly what needs to be done at what time, especially later in the game, but honestly, everything is conveyed really well regardless.  My one major complaint would have to be that for lower spec systems, the game hitches really badly when loading new rooms sometimes.  I didn't find it impossible to deal with or have it hurt my enjoyment, but I could see how it could frustrate people, so be wary, the more of the mansion that's revealed, the more the game starts to stutter/chug. \n\nSTILL, all and all a fantastic experience, and I would recommend it for mystery, horror, and puzzle fans wholeheartedly.

You may follow one person, learn their movements and how they get killed, then rewind and follow someone else. You can listen to what the characters say at different moments of the day to get clues to prevent their death. Unlike a typical murder mystery, you don't need to reveal who the killer is, instead you need to prevent the death from happening.\n\nThe game is mostly linear, you prevent the murders in a specific order. When you prevent a murder you gain new powers that unlock a new area of the mansion. When you enter the new area, you have a vision of who you have to save next. You can revisit old areas to search for collectables you missed (or to just explore), but you never need to revisit an old area to prevent any of the deaths (i.e. you don't need to revisit the casino to prevent a death in the guest rooms).\n\nYou must sneak around and remain hidden from everyone, even the guests you are trying to save. You can look through keyholes to see a portion of whats happpening in the next room, or stop and listen for nearby footsteps and talking, You can also hide in a closet, this is similar to looking through a keyhole but you can see and hear the whole room and you don't have to worry if someone enters the room your in (no one ever checks the closets). If someone sees you, you just have to leave the room (your given plenty of time to do so), they don't keep chasing you once you leave. It's possible to quickly pass through areas with people in them (as opposed to waiting for them to leave the room) without any repercussions. I have no idea what happens if you just stay in a room with another character (not sure if your booted to the main menu or the day just restarts). Near the end of the game, remaining hidden can become tedius. I was expecting one of the end-game powers you receive would be invisibility, but no such luck.\n\nThe worst part, for me anyways, was the ending, I wont give away the ending, only that you don't need to peice together whats really going on, You are eventualy told everything without any test to see if you figured it out on your own (your just given few doors you need to unlock and then the antagonist begins walking you through everything), and I don't think it's possible to figure out the big secret on your own either. Once you do know the truth you can go back and see a few small clues (spoiler:[spoiler] You may notice the staff going out of their way to light all the fireplaces [/spoiler]). The ending isn't horrible, but it renders everything that happened to be a bit meaningless, and I would have greatly preferred slowly piecing it all together throughout each prevented death.\n\nAside from my nit-picking of gameplay aspects I would have changed, and the ending, I didn't want to put the game down, and I was left wanting more.\n\nOne last thing: There is no need for the \"Sexual Conent\" tag to be applied to this game, \"The Sexy Brutale\" is the name of the mansion the game takes place in, but I didn't see any sexual content.

The game is simply captivating with its interesting characters, great soundtrack, beautiful art and interesting progression from one \"murder\" to another. \n\nIt's a bit reminiscent of the \"No Naku Koro Ni\" VN/anime series, especially Umineko, where the protagonist is trying to find a serial killer in a large mansion by reliving the events over and over again until the mystery has been solved. Especially here, when you really get attached to these interesting characters, seeing (and hearing) them get murdered over and over again as you reverse time is really interesting and a tad bit unsettling. \n\nIt is a story-centered, medium-length (some would say short) game that, granted, doesn't have huge replay value. Like with most mystery and detective games, once you learn the \"jist\" of the game, in this case \"whodunit\", and solve the simple yet memorable puzzles, you're not likely to go for a second playthrough right away. Yes, it is very difficult to replicate the experience you had the first time, but experiencing the game even once, in my opinion, is worth it. \n\nBiggest pleasant surprises: The soundtrack. Holy moly is it good. I also got really attached to all the characters even though originally I thought they were just some masked party-goers. Only after finishing the game and \"digesting it\" a bit do I realise what a great job the devs did. \n\nMain problem is: I want more. Please let there be more!

I played this game with a mouse and keyboard, and I could not help but to feel the controls are just a little clunky with that. The click and hold to move does not work too well and it probably would fare better if it had a normal point and click format.

This is one of my favourite puzzle games. You play as Lafcadio Boone who is trying to prevent the murders of The Sexy Brutale's guests at the hands of the staff, but there are a few catches. First of all, the day is on a loop. The day's events replay over and over again as everyone does the exact same thing without even realizing it. That is, until you come along of course. The second catch is that you can't directly interfere with the guests or the staff. Thus you have to find more subtle ways of saving the guests' lives. This results in a really fun puzzle game where you have to piece together the day's events while manipulating objects around the mansion in order to change them. You're a bit like a detective, except instead of solving a murder you're trying to stop one. And with each guest saved you gain a new power that adds another tool to your toolbox.\nThe Sexy Brutale is also gorgeous. The character designs are all very distinct with unique personalities. Plus if you like seeing some interesting and appropriately dramatic deaths, then this is the game for you. The music is also worth mentioning, because not only is it fantastic it fits the game perfectly. Each section of The Sexy Brutale has its own song, and because you're trapped in a loop the song syncs with the events of that area. What results is a heart-racing experience as you scramble to save the guest's life in time while the music ramps up in the background.\nThe only downside is that this is a short game. This isn't necessarily a bad thing as it means it doesn't overstay is welcome, but it is something to consider. In my opinion the length is mainly due to the difficulty of the puzzles. While difficulty is subjective, especially for a puzzle game, I didn't think they were very difficult. Overall I think I had more trouble with getting my timing down than I did trying to figure out what to do. My first playthrough took about 5 hours, and I did take my time to explore beyond the main objectives.\nAll that said, I had so much fun with this game. Every second I spent playing was well worth it, and I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a stylish puzzle game that won't have them rage quitting over the difficulty.", "timestamp_created": 1511644097, "timestamp_updated": 1511644097, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37581500": {"recommendationid": "37581500", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996798657", "num_games_owned": 202, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 616, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501985490}, "language": "english", "review": "An all around fun, short game.

I ended up finishing the game in one go.\n\nIt's basically a murder mystery game with a time-travel gimmick and a strangely light and comedic atmosphere, despite the very grim premise. The graphics are colorful, pretty and stylish, the music is perfectly complementary, and the writing is witty and quite good. \n\nAt some points it can be hard to figure out what to do or where to find what you need since you're given minimal direction and you're up against a ticking clock, but I feel that adds to the mystery and the mechanics encourage trial and error.\n\nAs far as replay value goes considering the relatively short length of the game, I have not yet touched it since finishing it the first go but I suppose that for the completionists among us it pays to play it multiple times (e.g. the first playthrough to figure out what to do, the second or maybe third to find all collectables). I suppose much of the dialogue may also find deeper meaning on consequetive playthroughs.\n\nI found it a great little distraction from the more action- and fighting-oriented games. \nI guess the trial and error mechanics and short length also make it quite casual-friendly, so I would also deem it suitable for those that look for a more casual gaming experience.\n\nTl;dr: Not a big game, but a great bang for your buck.\nI definitely recommend it, especially if you can get it on sale.", "timestamp_created": 1511474363, "timestamp_updated": 1511474363, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526627", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37160822": {"recommendationid": "37160822", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967232169", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 478, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509533929}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome game.

He's stuck in a time loop and has to keep repeating the day of the party until he manages to save all of the guests. It's an interesting premise, and the game does many things very well. It's a gorgeous looking game with a very fitting and expressive art style that really sets the tone for an extravagant aristocrat's casino/mansion. It's animated well and the sound compliments the setting perfectly. So why the negative review?\n\nFrankly, the game is trivially easy. Although the mansion is nominally a large, open world to explore, in practice the game is divided into a number of discrete \"levels\" in the sense that you must save the guests one at a time in a particular order before the game will let you enter a new part of the mansion. Once you do move on to a new area you'll very rarely have any reason to return to an old one. Thus, you only ever have one puzzle at a time to solve, and the pieces you need to solve that puzzle will always be nearby. Compounding this problem is the fact that every interactable object in the game is painted with a bright fluorescent circle, so there's no possible way you can overlook an important item. It's literally possible (and happened to me) that you can accidentally prevent several murders just by aimlessly wandering around and clicking when you see a glowing circle, without even understanding what it is you're doing or why that particular circle stops the murder.\n\nPerhaps my disappointment has more to do with my own expectations than anything the developers did wrong -- I was expecting something along the lines of the classic Maniac Mansion. At any rate, it seems the devs don't trust players to be able to figure anything out on their own and felt they had to spoon-feed the solutions to the puzzles.\n\nBottom Line: The Sexy Brutale is worth picking up on sale if you're interested in a very well-presented kind of interactive cartoon. Just don't expect a meaty puzzle-solving/exploration game.\n", "timestamp_created": 1509315633, "timestamp_updated": 1509315633, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.678202", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36526145": {"recommendationid": "36526145", "author": {"steamid": "76561198413365095", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505423936}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Muy bueno, tanto visualmente como musicalmente.

The art style, the music, the setting, are incredible. It's loads of fun to run around stalking people through the casino day after day, watching the set-up to the murders, which are spectacularly horrifying if you actually take the time to just watch, knowing that something is about to happen. If you haven't solved the puzzle of how to save them, people WILL die, in a horrible fashion. It's quite a surreal experience.\n\nNow, that leads me to the flaws. I strongly recommend that if you have a controller to hook up, USE IT. Not because this is an action game, but because the keyboard/mouse control setup is awkward (press SHIFT to spy through a door then press X to stop spying, wtf?!), can't be rebound, and can actively hinder your understanding of the game controls. For instance, you have control over time in this game. If you're at a clock, you can move time ahead to 4pm or 8pm. And while I had thought that you could also reset the time to 12pm, the start of the game's day, it frustrated me to no end because there was no option to do this at the clock where you can change the time to 4pm or 8pm. So I wasted an awful lot of time in the game because I would try something to stop a murder, it wouldn't work, I would know right away that it didn't work but there was still plenty of time left in the day afterward and I couldn't just tell the day to reset so I could try again right away. Turns out, the option to reset the day is an actual button you press, not an option in the in-game interactable clocks, and I never pressed that button while using keyboard and mouse because there was nothing but a visual button on the screen that didn't say anything about what it did, so I never pressed it. After a few sessions, I plugged in my controller to try that out instead and discovered this button within a few minutes because the button on the screen that had been labeled \"F1\" now said \"LT\" so my brain now needed to know what left trigger did, whereas it being F1 was just so generic that it never even registered as a thing that could do something.\n\nFurthermore, the way you use your inventory items is really unintuitive. It took me a rather a long tiime to figure out how to set other clocks as spawn points because you need to use your pocketwatch on them to do that. The Achievement Hunters had even more problems figuring this out. It's not difficult, it's just not implemented well so it's easy to overlook. You have one active item, it's displayed on your screen- it'll be whatever you last picked up unless you switch to something else. You can rotate through your items on hand by pressing one of the two buttons displayed near the item on your screen. Using an item on something requires pressing a completely different button than interacting with the thing normally- you press X to interact with a clock but Y to use an item on it.\n\nAlso, there is at least one puzzle which can be solved via looking at information in the map, after you have acquired the item which gives you that information. You have to press SPACE in the map to open this information, and I never realized you could do this until watching Achievement Hunters play this game after I finished it. I picked up the item which gives you the information, but had no idea what it was and instead solved the puzzle via just running around for an excessive amount of time using trial-and-error of trying items in various places until finally something worked. \n\nAnd once you realize that sort of thing, this game possibly becomes too easy. I never had that problem while playing through it, I found most of the puzzles to be reasonably challenging to the point where I had to check guides to see how to advance at points, but if I had had a better grasp of the controls I don't think I would have needed to do that. If you watch the Achievement Hunters videos, they actually solve puzzles far too quickly without even fully realizing what they're trying to stop. And that's no way to play this game.\n\nSo, in a nutshell: use a controller rather than bad keyboard/mouse controls; F1/LT is your reset the day button; use inventory items with a different button than normal interact and scroll through them using the two buttons displayed next to the item; and just take your time and watch what's going on to best enjoy the game's atmosphere.", "timestamp_created": 1509090410, "timestamp_updated": 1509090410, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36024542": {"recommendationid": "36024542", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077473819", "num_games_owned": 203, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508870970}, "language": "german", "review": "Lukas", "timestamp_created": 1509053292, "timestamp_updated": 1509053292, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36010324": {"recommendationid": "36010324", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995144383", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 476, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508212492}, "language": "english", "review": "The Sexy Brutale is a neat little \"pont and click\" adventure and one of the good examples for Unity engine games.

The game even automatically chooses the mask ability you have to use for each situation when it becomes available, not that it would be hard to guess anyway.\n\nFor example the glass shattering and lock-picking powers are perfectly identical in how they\u2019re used and only serve to open different types of \u201clocks\u201d. The architect insight power is left completely unused in puzzles and only serves to unlock more optional lore, again through contextual button press that you randomly get when walking through certain areas. Even the increased hearing ability that you can actually use everywhere and lets you keep track of people outside the rooms you occupy isn\u2019t really used that way very much, only notably during segments where you peek through a keyhole and you guessed it, use a contextual button prompt yet again to make otherwise unheard dialogue visible. I\u2019d wager it was originally intended to allow circumventing occupied rooms more easily (you lose if you\u2019re in a room with someone else for too long), but the death timer is extremely lenient and you can just run through occupied areas every time, even straight through the masks that start chasing you. No need to hide in closets either, as they only grant higher visibility of the room compared to keyhole peeking.\n\nThe progression is linear and puzzles encompass only their own set new area the vast majority of the time, and even after the mansion slowly opens up there's really no cases where you have to run from wildly different areas of the map to gather clues or gadgets to prevent a murder. Pretty much each puzzle and its solution is isolated to the new area you just unlocked, save for one where you just have to manipulate 4 very obvious switches.

Instead of killing people without being seen try to save them from their demise by indirectly messing with their routine before it's to late and time resets. If you enter a room with people in it, time will stop and their masks will become sentient and chase you until you leave the room which is why you should avoid being seen. The premise instantly got me hooked.\n\nThe entire atmosphere is amazing, the visuals are simple but neat, the mansion itself is designed nicely and it rarely gets confusing despite there being a number of rooms. The music is also topnotch. Often it's a track that is as long as the entire day is and the music gets intense right as your target is about to die. You could be anywhere in the mansion and you'd still know that things are getting urgent.\n\nThe puzzles rarely feel unfair. They are challenging but not too hard, often if you dont know what to do it helps to explore the mansion as new info can be revealed by spying on some of the characters. For example, in one chapter you have to name a password and you find out what the password is by spying on a character conversing with another one.\n\nThe only problem I had is that this game is technically poorly optimised. My PC meets this games standards and yet theres some dips in the framerate here and there. Theres also this annoying problem where when you want to enter a room the game has to process that for a second, which will result in you waiting in front of the door for a second and then entering it. It'll feel like you didn't press the button right. Often these hicc-ups are connected with the framedrops. These problems are inconveniences at worst though and never made me miss a prompt. Generally the timing in this game is quite forgiving.\n\nOverall I'd say this game is a solid 9/10.

I'm aware of the fact it make sense in light of  the timetravel plot, but still i wasn't pleased about it.\n\n\n\u2718 The name: There is nothing of \"Sexy\" in the Sexy Brutale ( aside from some statues and that hot soundtrack and a couple of naked statues, still this one is nitpicking at best) kinda misleading title.\n\n\n\u2718 Too Easy: The puzzles are beautifully done, i like all the creative ways  the roster of characters dies, but puzzles are too easy to solve and answers tend to ,usually, lie there, highlighted.\n\n\n\u2718 Disappointing Ending: Alright so, I found myself really enjoying the game, so much i end up finishing it up ( wiith only 4 achievements left to complete) in one single night without resting, i was really enjoying the game and it kept me interested, glued to the screen playing all night, wich is extremely good, but, i'm not gonna lie, i was pretty disappointed with the ending, since the start  i was waiting for some sick bad guy/s to reveal him/themselves and give that special flavour to the story you were waiting since the start when you asked yourself \" how is this intrigue gonna end? why is the staff murdering everyone, what is the motif, is this gonna be something mystical, supernatural, are we gonna get some sick unexpected plot twist that is gonna leave us mouths open? are we gonna get some clarity about how they do this and why? I bet there is something really meaningful about the choice on the diverse and interesting way these characters are getting brutally killed\" ... sadly no, turns out the big plot twist was pretty simple and kinda lame [spoiler]  The main Antagonist  is just yourself, no interesting villans, no meaningful reason of why you decided to do this, just to punish yourself, you basically tried to make your mansion explode to get some big cash from the  villa insurance, and because you're a dumbass so you just forgot and set the bombs timer wrong you end up killing all your friends/guests/wife boy oh boy  oh boy you goofed, nothing mystical, nothing creepy, interesting, supernatural or mysterious.just  boring and tasteless, even the big teased plot about the vodoo  evil fish with satanic powers went absolutely nowhere, pretty normal,kinda disappointing and overall bland. [/spoiler]  at least this is what i felt when it came to it.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nOverall a well crafted game  but i'm not really sure i would  have bought it if i knew about the short duration and the blandess of the ending ,still, sometime you have just  take the risk, try and see.\n\ni don't feel like i'd go back if i could because it still was worth the experience,\n\nI chose to be positive cause the game was still good and the soundtrack was  remarkably good, \n\nat least a 7.5/10 in my book.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________", "timestamp_created": 1508114056, "timestamp_updated": 1508725747, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35760622": {"recommendationid": "35760622", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996929593", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 890, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508359077}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Varias veces jug\u00e1ndolo me ha venido un lejano recuerdo de finales de los 80.

I bought this early by the sole virtue of Jim Sterling's review. Long story short: I was oversold on it. It's still a very good game, but Mr. Sterling had me expecting something outstanding, something that would stick with me, and The Sexy Brutale didn't do that.\n\nShort story long: This is a groundhog-day/adventure-puzzle game where you watch murders most foul, then suss out how to prevent them. The Sexy Brutale has well-polished art and sound design that emphasize wealthy excess, and most of the puzzles are clever without being difficult. These virtues are pretty much enough to make it a decent game, but the real deciding factor of its lasting quality rests on its ambitiously thoughtful narrative. Without giving anything away, the endgame revelations will either work for you, or they won't. While I appreciated the effort that went into making the story impactful, I wasn't impacted.\n\nMy bottom line rests on an unfortunately useless platitude: Your mileage may vary.

Regardless, I say to give this game a chance.", "timestamp_created": 1506559683, "timestamp_updated": 1506559683, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499943", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35234101": {"recommendationid": "35234101", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051304382", "num_games_owned": 496, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 464, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505408186}, "language": "english", "review": "Puzzle-wise, The Sexy Brutale is a little lacklustre. Perhaps only half of the few puzzles are good; the rest I blindly fumbled through. However, the story and environment make up for it (and this comment comes from someone who usually doesn't care about story and environment).\n\nIn The Sexy Brutale, you play as priest Lafcadio Boone, who runs around a giant mansion, witnessing the murders of guests at a party, and rewinding time to stop their deaths. The whole game takes place over the course of a single Saturday from 12 noon to 12 midnight, though time rewinds back to noon once you hit midnight.\n\nThe direct comparison would of course be to [i]Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective[/i], as both games revolve around the same premise. However, while [i]Ghost Trick[/i] has you stop the murder *while* it's happening, The Sexy Brutale has you stop the murder *before* it happens. It forces you to do this by disallowing you from being in the same room as another character, so you can never directly affect things in the room.\n\nAnother key difference is that this is a more isometric view, and you have free movement (as opposed to in Ghost Trick, where you can only move between cores). You also don't have any special ghost-powers. This makes for slightly-less-good puzzles in The Sexy Brutale, unfortunately.\n\nThe environment in The Sexy Brutale is superb, however. Since the whole mansion is a single setting, you can observe evidence of other victims' deaths while you're working on saving a different victim. For instance, one of the first victims you save dies from a gunshot at ~3:45. (His death, along with any other deaths you've prevented, resets when you reset the day.) No matter where you are in the mansion, assuming you haven't managed to save said victim, you'll hear that gunshot. You'll also hear a bell go off just before 7:00 (that's another victim), and some glass breaking at 4:15. This happens on every iteration of the day you're in. And indeed, the people in the mansion do react to these sounds, adding to the immersion.\n\nAnother way the game plays with the time-looping mechanic is with the soundtrack. The same ~6 minutes of soundtrack play throughout each iteration of the whole day. While the soundtrack changes with the room you're in, it's undeniable that it feels very much like you're playing through the day again and again, but trying to accomplish a different goal each time. Further, the soundtrack accompanies the murders well.\n\nThe controls, unfortunately, are a little weird for keyboard and mouse, and unfortunately aren't remappable. I don't know how good the game plays with a controller, but you may find it more comfortable using a controller instead. Regardless, this is a minor quibble I quickly got used to; the constant key-prompts helped, too.\n\nWithout spoiling too much of either game, I should also note that the story in The Sexy Brutale isn't as intricate as that of Ghost Trick, and nor are the puzzles; if I had to recommend only one of the two, it would be Ghost Trick hands-down. Nevertheless, both games told the stories they wanted to tell well, and The Sexy Brutale has a more immersive world than that of Ghost Trick.\n\nPoint is, The Sexy Brutale is a good game in its own right. It may not be great puzzle-wise, and it may not surpass Ghost Trick in terms of story intricacy, but its world is very well-made and is enough to carry it through from \"just OK\" to \"pretty good\". Get this first if you like a neat story with a good environment, and if you feel like the \"stop the murder from happening\" type of puzzle felt fresh, feel absolutely free to buy Ghost Trick as well (on Nintendo DS or iOS).", "timestamp_created": 1506479683, "timestamp_updated": 1506479683, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502576", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35233509": {"recommendationid": "35233509", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043772233", "num_games_owned": 483, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1373, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507469551}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the finest games I've played in years and what I'd consider a spiritual successor to Ghost Trick, the Sexy Brutale was an incredibly immersive experience from start to finish with an immensely satisfying conclusion.

I'd recommend this when heavily on sale, as I 100%'d the game in 7.6 hours, and there's only marginal replay value as each murder is easy enough to solve once you figure out what needs doing.  The puzzles were in my opinion just the right amount of difficulty.  I spent some time on some, but always knew I had the tools in front of me to solve it.  The time pressure is minimal since the day is fairly quick and easy enough to jump to later points in the day, so unlike other time-loop games you're never really waiting around for anything to happen.  The story is also very intriguing, moving at a nice pace and revealing little details about the people and the mansion itself.\n\nThe big thing that makes this a heavy sale recommendation is really just the length.  With only 7 murders (including one pretty much tutorial murder and an \"epilogue\" murder with a fair amount of hand holding), there's just not a lot of content to burn through.  A successor to this game could be incredible of it either doubled the amount of murders or expanded the individual murders to have more moving parts.  At the end of the day though too much risks overstaying its welcome, and the game definitely doesn't waste your time, each murder is unique and full of charm.

Unfortunately, given what the game actually is, I can't recommend it.  \n\nWhat I liked about The Sexy Brutale has already been covered in depth by others: the artwork and the atmosphere are quite beautiful (I especially liked the combination gasmask/playing card idea for the staff).  The characters have good backstories which keep them from becoming two-dimensional.  The brochure, which contains information and backstory for the hotel and updates as you play, is an excellent idea.  The dialogue is passable and appropriate for the characters.  A shadowy, chained figure waiting for his cards is something I find very intriguing.  \n\nAnd there the list of positives ends.  I will list the negatives in order of importance.\n\nThe first negative aspect of the game is the name itself, \"The Sexy Brutale.\"  While I don't necessarily agree that use of the word \"sexy\" will lead prospective gamers to expect sex, I still think it was a mistake.  You simply don't find casinos or hotels with the word \"sexy\" in the name.  In fact, you don't find any high-end establishments where the word \"sexy\" is featured.  It doesn't need to be.  \"The Brutale\" by itself is a superior name, and it's not even my first choice. \n\nSecondly, this has been referred to as a puzzle game, but the actual puzzles presented to the player are so simple that it's tempting to call them pseudo-puzzles.  All too often the object needed to solve the problem and save the guest is laying in the open for no apparent reason.  I assumed (incorrectly) that the puzzles would become more complex as the game progressed, and more than once found myself overthinking the problem; the solutions are uniformly unsatisfying because they are so simple, and sometimes that simplicity makes them seem downright unrealistic.  Guests can only be killed in a specific time and place, so that saving them can be as easy as keeping the staff away from the appointed place during the appointed time.  If you're expecting the target to be chased through the hallways by a determined killer, you will be disappointed.  Once the initial murder is foiled, the game considers the guest in question perfectly safe. Furthermore, foiling the murder usually comes down to using a single quest item one time.  There are no intricate problems to untangle.  \n\nLastly, the ending is absolutely abysmal.  \"It was all a dream\" kind of abysmal.  There was a period of time, maybe in the late 90's, when every other horror movie ended with the revelation that the main character had multiple personalities, and none of what you just watched actually happened.  The Sexy Brutale's storyline ends with a silent, wet fart.  The reveal is the definition of anticlimax, where the original sin of the antagonist and the premise of the entire game are shown to be incredibly mundane and well-traveled.  It also accidentally destroys the backstory (as revealed through dialogue) of the protagonist, Lafcadio Boone, without any explanation, so that the lack of originality is exacerbated by sloppiness.  \n\nThe Sexy Brutale could have been saved by better puzzles and a decent story.  As it stands, it isn't worth anything close to the asking price.  \n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1505159036, "timestamp_updated": 1505159036, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 40, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475279", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34888894": {"recommendationid": "34888894", "author": {"steamid": "76561198274619846", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1214, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514776506}, "language": "english", "review": "A wonderful game with a really nice concept.

que tratar\u00e9 de ser lo m\u00e1s claro y conciso posible.Estamos ante un juego de puzzles al m\u00e1s puro estilo Cluedo,pero con la peculiaridad de que en vez de descubrir al asesino debemos evitar que este mate a los invitados.\n\nLa acci\u00f3n transcurre en una lujosa mansi\u00f3n en la cual se celebra una fiesta de m\u00e1scaras,al m\u00e1s puro estilo Mardi gras,y en donde tendremos que evitar que los invitados sean brutalmente asesinados.Para ello nos meteremos en la piel de Lafcadio Boone,un misterioso personaje que lleva la cara cubierta con una m\u00e1scara que le ayudar\u00e1 a pasar desapercibido  ante la presencia de invitados y/o asesinos(aunque no de sus m\u00e1scaras).\n\nLa mec\u00e1nica del juego est\u00e1 basada en el ensayo y error,ya que todo el tiempo estaremos en un bucle temporal,de aproximadamente 9 minutos,en el que tendremos que resolver una serie de puzzles antes de que termine dicho ciclo para salvar,uno por uno o por parejas,a todos los invitados.La resoluci\u00f3n siempre es la misma,observar escondidos las acciones tanto de los asesinos como de los invitados para actuar en consequencia y evitar el tr\u00e1gico final de estos \u00faltimos,y a\u00fan as\u00ed el juego nunca se hace pesado ni repetitivo,siempre nos pica a intentarlo una y otra vez hasta salvar a cada uno de ellos,adquiriendo as\u00ed sus respectivas m\u00e1scaras que nos otorgar\u00e1n habilidades especiales que nos permitir\u00e1n avanzar desbloqueando nuevas estancias de la mansi\u00f3n.\nSi seguimos esta premisa nos costar\u00e1 menos quedarnos encallados,ya que aunque veremos morir a los invitados una y otra vez acabaremos encontrando la clave para salvarlos.\n\nEn cuanto al apartado t\u00e9cnico estamos ante un producto de excelente factura,sin grandes alardes pero con con mucho mimo en el apartado art\u00edstico,con unas est\u00e1ncias ricamente elaboradas y preciosistas con las que deleitarnos,la acertada vista isom\u00e9trica ayuda mucho en este aspecto.Las animaciones de los personajes,sin ser memorables,cumplen perfectamente su cometido y dotan de vida y carisma a sus peculiares personajes.A todo esto hay que sumarle un brillante apartado sonoro compuesto en su mayor\u00eda de melodias swing  que encajan perfectamente con el ritmo del juego.\n\nLa duraci\u00f3n del juego es m\u00e1s que correcta,sin encallarse demasiado se puede completar en unas 10-11 horas.\n\nSi te gustan los juegos de puzzles no dudes en hacerte con el,vale cada uno de los euros que cuesta,un gran trabajo de Tequila works,como no pod\u00eda ser de otra manera,100% recomendado.", "timestamp_created": 1504998435, "timestamp_updated": 1505002997, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0,

The game is set in a mysterious mansion and played in 12 hour cycles (about 10 minutes in real time) after which time rewinds and you play another cycle, retaining all the knowledge you've obtained. Your job is to prevent the mansion staff from murdering the guests which involves discovering the victim/murderer's whereabouts and finding ways to put a spanner in the works. Save the guests and discover the secret of the mansion.\n\nThe time travel mechanic works brilliantly, peeling back another layer of the mystery with each cycle while a steady stream of new skills let you revisit old areas with new eyes. The soundtrack is also set to the 12 hour cycle and includes sound effects for key moments in each guest's story. Like many of the game's clues, these won't make much sense at first but the further you progress, the more you'll recognise cues from what's happening in other parts of the mansion, making connections that tie the multilayered story together.", "timestamp_created": 1503916283, "timestamp_updated": 1503916283, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34545619": {"recommendationid": "34545619", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030150936", "num_games_owned": 320, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 353, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503885990}, "language": "english", "review": "I really wanted to like this game. The art style looks fantastic and there isn't a lot of games that utilize the Majora Mask/Groundhog day time mechanic. So when I heard about TSB, I was sold. Puzzle based game where you have to save people in the mansion from being grusomely murdered and have to start the day over again to learn peoples routes and solutions to save them, I thought it was a 10/10 right away. The concept was good, the execution however...\n\nStory: Not gonna get into spoliers but I felt this was the best part of the game. It's was story about self-forgivness, and the game eludes a bit of what actually going on until the end of the game where it hits you like a truck. The only part of the game I can't complain about.\n\nMusic: Really love the composition of the music in this game, really helps with the games set it's own style. Every area of the mansion has it's own track, from the jazzy casino parlore to the eloquent style of the theatre. My only gripe was whenever you transisiton from one area to another, the previous area's music will hard cut stop into the new area music. It's really jarring to not have a fade out/fade in of the music. Not worst thing in the world, but it really broke the experience.\n\nGameplay: The concept is really cool. Basically when you start the day, every NPC has a starting location in the mansion. They have a set routine that they do throughout the day. But at some point of the day they will be murder by the mansion staff. You have to one by one save people from their deaths by manipulating the enviorment. Sounds really awesome! \n\nBut once you get into it, the puzzles you have to do save people aren't as complicated as one would hope. Often the most difficult part of the game is figuring out which character to follow at what time so they can say a keycode to a door or reveal a hidden passage for you to use. Some of the puzzles do require a few more steps than others but they usually involve with getting into a room and hitting a button. There were a couple of times where I found the solution, I was able to solve the puzzle on the first try, which for a game about starting the day over again, I shouldn't be able to do. \n\nEach puzzle takes place in the own part of the mansion, which is a big let down. These puzzle feel very isolated, and they have nothing to do with the other puzzles for the most part. I feel it would be a stronger game if the NPC patterns had a lot of cross over. Where I had to know the timings of the characters to get certain items or wait for them to change the enviroment in someway. But for each of the puzzle, you're just dealing with the victim and the mansion staff who are trying to murder them (which is usually one person). \n\nThis game had some really good idea going for it. But it just falls short of a recommendation for me. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1503898936, "timestamp_updated": 1503898936, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.600977", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34522115": {"recommendationid": "34522115", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993499227", "num_games_owned": 513, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 612, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511655411}, "language": "english", "review": "Still thinking about this game days after finishing it.

It's a puzzle game with its own twist: you can't be in the same room as any other character, so you have to learn the NPCs' routes and schedules so you can work around them to stop the mansion/casino/theatre's staff from murdering them. Another mechanic is time manipulation: you relive the same twelve-hour period over and over in order to save the guests and can rewind time back to noon at will or advance time to 4 or 8 PM at any clock.\n\nThe characters are well written and endearing; even the staff have their own quips and barbs.

I've done with this crap on pc. The game as it is is awesome and would be recommended at any time. But with my system g15 keyboard, wireless controller 360 it is impossible to play. First my controller were not detected and it is the only game which did not. 2. If the controller is not detected why on earth the game dont find my keyboard so i can press the f****ing x button in the tutorial. Everyone load it not legally and try it before you buy it and you have a dead game because you can't play it. It is the first time I have this issue in a game which is so new. And from my perspective it is a shame that the developers didn't fix this since april either bring the game on pc out with out a workaround. \n\nYes I unplugged my controller but the Keyboard is still dont working ingame. And yes I tried my 360 Controller and plugged it in before I started the game and it has the same effect. (like read in many communitychats or on google)\n\nSo everyone who wants to play it like me. Try it without buying till this is fixed or you will have a hard time with this. \n\nIt is worth every penny because I watched some minutes on Youtube and saw the Review of Totalbiscuit which was the reason to buy it. \nMaybe sometime my system respond so I will  experience that for myself. I will not buy it for another system, either. I will not reward this error.\n\n\n\nUPDATE: I can play the game now. I played first Rocket League with controller after that I switched to sexy brutal and now the controller was found.

It can probably be completed in about 5 hours, and has a great style, with art, music and theme coming together very well. However, for experienced puzzle solvers, or point'n'click veterans, the solutions to each mystery will seem somewhat shallow for the majority of the game.\n\nThe Groundhog Day comparisons are almost universal, and with good reason. However, I think it is also worth comparing The Sexy Brutale to both the N64 classic 'Majora's Mask' (you are locked in a timeloop, and each time you go through it, you progress a little bit forward; not to mention the theme of masks both games have) as well as the most recent 'Hitman' (similarly playing through the same space of time over and over, where instead of trying to make creative murder happen, you instead try to make that creative murder... not happen).\n\nThe game does have a few strikes against it. Its time mechanics are a bit underdeveloped (better time manipulation and/or access to fastforwarding are the primary concerns). The game has a tendency towards slightly simplistic puzzles (a 'complex' mode a la Hitmans Professional mode would be much appreciated, even if it might jar with some of the themes). The game also makes each 'case' very isolated from the rest of the mansion and the other victims (which makes the mansion feel less like the sprawling party it is clearly supposed to be). Finally, the game unfortunately saves some of the best concepts and ideas for the end (the 'Arm' idea have a LOT of design space in my view).\n\nThese shortcomings, however, are not nearly enough to make The Sexy Brutale a bad game, it merely keeps it from being an instant classic. The asking price is perfectly reasonable, but if you can get it on a sale, be sure to grab it immediately.

It would have made a better second puzzle. It makes a good use of the mechanics of this game while not being hugely difficult. The fifth puzzle is a funny one. It isn't too difficult and is something that uses previous mechanics. Nothing special though. The sixth puzzle is a doozy. This one requires you to explore a lot to find everything. I would like to say this was a gem, but they added randomness into the required pieces. Had that not been the case this would have been my favorite. The final one was an interesting one. Just getting there is the first and most interesting puzzle. As for the real puzzle, you really have to think outside the box and it isn't terribly clear, but not impossible. An interesting and creative end, but nothing to write home about. \n\nOverall lackluster puzzles that don't make full use of the main mechanics. I wish they could have used the ideas from the forth and the 6th more, minus the rng. It could have been a great game.\n\nThe Story:\nThe story is interesting. I wouldn't buy it for the story but it does wrap everything up. It even explains the little details you see. Nothing overly flashy or fascinating though.\n\nThe collectibles:\nThe cards are scattered throughout the mansion and there is no clever trick to finding them other than clicking on every nook and cranny and being lucky enough to check a place early. Some are timed. There are only two collectibles I can think of that involve any ingenuity, and that is being generous. This adds nothing to the game and you are better off using a guide.\n\nThe alt-ending:\nI wouldn't call it a real alt ending. For the effort it took to reach it, it was a massive middle finger.", "timestamp_created": 1501743113, "timestamp_updated": 1501743113, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504400", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33986639": {"recommendationid": "33986639", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067840151", "num_games_owned": 327, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 728, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501742430}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good crime/mystery game.

Each new attempt gives you an opportunity to explore and discover, to put the pieces together of the mystery and the solution to the problems you are presented. \n\nThe whole game is saturated with character, making every area interesting to navigate and explore. The writing is phenominal for the most part, with each character being unique and feeling like a person you interact with rather than an object for you to play with. Each person also has their own paths that they take over time, making your navigation, and their movements, into intricate choreography. \n\nThe sound and music is also mosty fantastic. The music doesn't just sound good, but the music in each area is lined up with the time and nearby events. During the game, you can also hear different sounds coming from distant areas at the same times, creating a mystery as to the identity of the source, and making you feel clever as you discover them and identify them as they go off when you try again. These two factors together make the whole game feel cohesive and helps you know not just where you are, but [i] when [/i] you are, as the tention builds and you run out of time. \n\nThe sound isn't perfect though. In particular, after a certain mechanic is introduced, entering or peeking into certain rooms plays an obnoxious sound that's louder than anything else. Also, there is no transition between the music of the different zones; it just cuts from one song to the other. This is mostly fine, but moving from some areas or during different parts of the music can create a jarring shift.\n\nTwo last complaints: The major complaint is optimization. I don't know if it's my computer, but it shouldn't be, since it runs more complicated and graphics intensive games just fine. The game runs smoothly during most of it, but it stutters as it loads new rooms. From what I can tell, it loads a room as you enter it, and keeps it loaded until you hit certain areas that unload the previous area, so it's not too bad. The minor complaint is the collectibles. I probably got about 98% completion on my own, and for the most part everything is straightforward. I did look up a walkthrough for the rest, and I would say about 1/2 of the missing collectibles I missed due to a lapse in my judgement. There's 3 or 4 that feel like it would take random chance to find on your own, and I hate using walkthroughs, so I was mildly annoyed.\n\nThis game is a real masterpiece though, despite the minor nitpicks here and there, it thouroughly captivated me. I got completley immersed, and hated anytime I got interrupted playing it. You should pick it up, and when you do, set aside a couple 4-5 hour blocks to be able to play as much as you can while stopping as little as possible.", "timestamp_created": 1501705297, "timestamp_updated": 1501705297, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33976879": {"recommendationid": "33976879", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202765391", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 57, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509101757}, "language": "english", "review": "Very overhyped.

I started playing it the day that I bought it. And I kept going, and going, and going. I was irritated when I had to stop and make some food for dinner. I paused the game, put something in the micro, sat down and played a few more minutes, and forgot about my food. An hour later, I remembered, hastily ate my cold burrito able to spare 5 minutes away from the game, and then went back to work solving the mysteries of this bizarre mansion/casino with it's colorful cast of characters and carefully crafted plot.\n\nThen I beat the game. Then I kept going until I had found all of the achievements. I was fully satisfied.\n\nIf you haven't read other reviews or heard much about the game, it works like this: you are in a mansion full of npcs who are moving about and participating in various simultaneous stories according to a script. Some of the npcs are setting up devious murders.\n\nYou are able to sneak around, but are generally discouraged from being in the same room as anyone, so you will have to spy on them from the next room, or hide in a cabinet. Ostensibly, your task is to find ways to interact with the environment in such a way that the murders are prevented from occuring. This involves memorizing who is going to be where, when, what they interact with to execute their plans, and then being sure to muddle things up at the right moment. But really, there are deeper mysterious to uncover, and it is more about understanding what all of those simultaneous plots are telling you about the bigger plot.\n\nI just want to add that the aspect of time is very nicely tuned. You never feel like oppressed by it, and it doesn't move too slowly either. Because of the clocks - which let you change where you start the day - if you are ever out of time you can just reset and carry on with whatever you were attempting to do. It's more about understanding the space of time and how events are mapped to it, rather than it being something that limits what you are able to do.\n\nUltimately it's the kind of concept I've always wanted to see done well, but aside from a few attempts here and there, and the dark shadow of the moon in Majora's Mask, the groundhog day formula is one of few formulas in gaming that hasn't really had enough experimentations to produce the definitive example, the way things like Dark Souls or Diablo have for action rpgs; wow for mmorpg; ocarina of time for action adventure; forza or gt for racing/car porn, etc.\n\nThe Sexy Brutale is what I will point to from now on. \"Oh, you mean like the Sexy Brutale?\"\n\n+ unique gameplay\n+ distinctive and beautiful art\n+ great script/plot (for the most part)\n+ engaging story you really come to understand due to repeated viewings and interactions\n+ ability to move starting spot keeps each \"run\" from feeling overly repetative\n+ MUSIC!\n\n- gameplay tone changes somewhere past the middle and I was less engaged\n- ending was not the worst but I'm not sure it quite stuck the landing\n- some mechanics underused (super-hearing for instance)\n- You can only skip time forward to 4pm or 8pm.

Initial setup for this game is an absolute pain due to horrible control implementation.  For some reason, the game cannot differentiate between the different controllers you may have plugged in or active - including virtual controllers.  It will process any input it thinks it is receiving, and you cannot set a specific controller.  In my case, this prevented me even from using the menus - I had to force-close the game from Windows because I could not control anything in-game.  To resolve this issue, you need to have ONLY the controller you will be using active.  You must unplug all other HOTAS, joysticks, pedals, controllers, and I even unplugged my Vive for good measure.  You must also disable all virtual controllers.  I see this as a cardinal sin in game development - there is no excuse for having to mess with other hardware to make a game work  That knocks the game down from an easy 4.5 stars to maybe 3.\n\nOnce you sort out the controller fiasco though, it really is a charming little game.  Puzzles often tend to be a bit easier than my over-thinking brain comes up with, artwork and overall design is very good.  I'm sitting at 5.5 hours as of the time of this writing, and am probably around 3/4 of the way through the game, and judging from other reviews, it looks to take anywhere from 6-12 hours to finish, depending on how much of a completionist you are, and how quickly you figure out the puzzles.\n\nThe mechanics are fairly forgiving - if you make a mistake, you can \"rewind\" the day to noon any time you want, or if you run out of time, you automatically rewind at midnight.  Advancement is handled nicely - even if the person you're currently trying to save dies, you can still explore to find more information, items, or environment objects to use next time through that day.  Spy on people to see where they are and what they do at what time, and as you progress, your map records where these people were at what time.  You can scrub the time forward and back on your map to help you plan your own movements, etc. - pretty key in one particular part, but useful other times too.  When time rewinds, you lose any objects you collected, but you do not lose information - key codes, movement of victims/staff, locations of secret doors/panels, etc. stay with you through any further rewinds.\n\nIf you can get past the absolutely irritating issues surrounding getting the controller working (and remember, you have to unplug/disable all other controllers BEFORE you start the game), it's worth your time.  I personally would say the game is worth $10 rather than $20 due to how short it is, but if it weren't for the controller problem, I wouldn't feel bad about spending $20 on it due to how polished the rest of it is.", "timestamp_created": 1501520935, "timestamp_updated": 1501520935, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530486", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33931262": {"recommendationid": "33931262", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047680332", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 333, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501519600}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought this when it was half price, but man, it's worth top dollar. \nThe setting, the art style, and the gameplay all work wonderfully together to create a fun but sinister atmosphere that twists together a colourful detective story with groundhog and a sprinkle of the otherwordly. \nAlthough I occasionally had some laggy controls (I think that was my end however) it never caused a big enough problem to make me stop.

Combine that with a great art style, cool theme and surprising good story, I can definitely recommend it to those looking for a unique time travel murder mystery. But it's not perfect. For one, the pacing seemed slower than necessary, mostly because your character moves at a snail's pace, and the time travel mechanics will often have you waiting for things to happen before you can progress.

The mechanic stopping you does it in a nice way that prevents punishing the player from accidentally being in the wrong spot but also stops you from interacting in the rooms when you are.  Through a groundhog's day-esque mechanic, you repeat the day infinitely until you find the way to solve each particular murder, so it's best to just watch what unfolds once or twice before trying to do too much.\n\nIt's not a long game, although there are collectibles that unlock some additional content for those that are interested in being completionist.  Instead, The Sexy Brutale focuses on making the most of the time it does have you, and succeeds at it.  The amount of character and lore oozing from the game shows just how much the developer cared about making it.\n\nThat said, I think it should be said that this game is not going to satisfy hard-core puzzlers who like fiendishly difficult or complicated games.  The puzzles are interesting, but intuitive.  The true reward of this game isn't solving the puzzle, it's about exploring the mansion and observing all the particulars of each murder.

Buy now if keen, wait for sale otherwise.\n\nLovely art style & cute character designs offset the brutal tragedy sealed up in the walls of the eponymous mansion/casino. Yes, the game is named after the location where it is set. If this bunches your panties for whatever reason, I'd suggest you have a look at some of Steam's other fine games. Life is too short to get infuriated over such developer choices or suggest lists of banal alternatives.\n\nGameplay involves sneaking around the sprawling mansion spying on everyone, picking up everything that isn't nailed down and figuring out to use it. Much of the challenge comes from figuring out where you need to be and when, then how to be there at the right time to do your thing, sometimes involving a chain of such planned actions. Feels different and fresh enough to be diverting. The day resets at midnight, giving you as many shots as you need at getting your current task right. Keeping everyone's movements and actions straight isn't too taxing as the game has a built-in system for showing character's movements on the map once you have observed them pass. You can scrub back and forth through the day to see where they're going and when so you can plan your own actions. Gameplay is expanded by obtaining powers from new masks that give you more potential actions and the ability to solve problems that you could not before. Rather like what you'd get in a metroidvania/zelda game.\n\nFor me, The Sexy Brutale didn't outstay its welcome, giving me about 13 hours for main game completion + 100% Achievements and miscellaneous messing around stalking characters ingame trying to get every last snippet of dialog (some of which were quite chucklesome).

The puzzles and gathering of clues to learn how to solve them is fun and never feels like a chore. The characters and writing is a clever blend of humorous and dark, with enough moments to make you laugh while simultaneously shocking you with their brutality. The music is terrific, composed to swell and blend with things that are happening within the plot, and always acting as a treat for the ears. But I think the greatest strength of the game is that it simply offers a good mystery that plays well with the reliving of the day. Things like hearing a gun shot, watching the lights flicker, or seeing something pass a window all tell the player that something is going on somewhere else in the house, and gives incentive to keep progressing if only to find out what is causing the phenomena that you watch each day.\n\nAs a whole, I cannot reccomend this game enough.

If not, after reading this go to most helpful and check them out. I'm not going to rewrite what others have said.\n\nWhat is the kind of person who will enjoy this game? It is a person who is looking for a casual, relaxing, yet interesting game that doesn't drag on for days. It seems to take about 8 hours to finish and 10 hours to complete. I will not say that this game has a very in depth story. In fact it's rather simple, though with an interesting twist at the end, but it is interesting and I kept wanting to find out what the hell was going on. The puzzles are not too complecated, in my opinion, and at least one I found was quite poorly designed [spoiler]as it requires you to do a task then restart the day a few times[/spoiler], but the good thing is you don't need to be terribly precise with your timings, and even I didn't manage to \"die\" in my play through.\n\nNow, for some of the bad things about this game. None of these are terribly bad or deal breaking, but they are still worth noting so you know what you're getting into. \n\n[list]\n[*] [b]The majority of the dialog boxes are timed.[/b] I put this in bold because, as a slow reader, this was an irritation of mine. I would be half way through reading someone's dialog when it'd go away. [b]However[/b], none of the real important dialog boxes are timed, and require you to click in order to progress them. This is also true of dialog boxes that come up when you interact with something. This gives you time to read and understand it, however time is still ticking, so don't take too long.\n[*] You can't rebind any of the buttons. This is unfortunate, as buttons they chose are rather odd (Z, X, 1, and 3). I also imagine that it might be an issue with those who have different keyboard layouts, but due to the slow nature of the game, it shouldn't really be a problem.\n[*] There are no graphical settings, which is unfortunate. This game isn't really graphically intensive, so you don't have to worry about turning down graphics if you have an older PC, but it sure would be nice to be able to turn them up to make the game look even better.\n[*] Between completing one murder and starting another, you really have no direction on where to go. You have to sort of guess some times. But I guess that's part of the nature of puzzle games where you have to retrack your steps. You have to remember you saw something earlier that you couldn't interact with because you didn't have the right item or ability.\n[*] Occasionally, animations would get out of sync, but usually things got fixed on their own, so again not a big deal.\n[/list]\n\nAll that being said, I whole hartedly recommend this game to anyone who likes puzzle games and enjoys a good aesthetic and a funky sound track. If you're looking for a challenge, you might be better off spending your money elsewhere.

The gameplay and \"missions\" are enjoyable, fun, surprising and not too easy. Again, the characters have been carefully polished and designed. Every story is interesting and I wanted to listen to every piece of dialog (which is worth). I tried to be in every corner and get the whole picture. And gosh, so many times I was at 1 second of finding The clue and BAM the time resets... I raged and laughed at the same time. Exquisite.\n\nI was so waiting for the \"Grand final\" that is building the whole time, for the final resolution. I completed 100% (which I highly recommend, because it is fun and you'll discover a few extra places and stroy lines that are cool). The story got me really deep and I wasn't expecting it. It is brilliant till the End. I simply loved it. And I am definitely going to play it again in the future.\n\nThe only negative point is the Missed Opportunity of having a whole day run with all the characters. Yeah, no, that doesn't happen, sadly.

Instead, the challenge comes from gathering the information you need and sidestepping everybody (as you're not allowed to be in the same room). \nAlso, it's short: You'll have the game finished in an afternoon, maybe two if you go hunting for all the collectables.\n\nWith that said, the attention to detail is absolutely incredible. Almost every room in the mansion is unique and characters are wonderfully animated. The audio too is absolutely brilliant.

More of a proof of concept than a satisfying game.\n\nLong version: \n\nI was real disappointed with this. Lost interest 90 minutes into the game and have shelved it for the moment. \n\nThey have the great framework for a great game, and they certainly have the artistic talent. The problem is they just don't have the writing or design talent to go with it. \n\nThe plot: Comparisons have been made to Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective. The plot in that game managed to make the player give a shit about the story right from the very beginning. Sexy Brutale...I guess they wanted to go for \"mysterious\" but they don't have the writing chops to pull it off, and you're given absolutely nothing to care about from the start. You're dumped into playing a mute protagonist with no background, trying to save people you know nothing about from murderers you know nothing about in a setting you know nothing about, and it's all presented not in a sinister tone but a whimsical tone like \"Clue\" so you're not even motivated by basic righting of wrongs. For all you know, the guests are evil and the servants are heroic resistance fighters. Even the people who have beaten the game say there's no plot to care about, until the very end where you get hit with a clumsy exposition dump.\n\nThe puzzles: Are far too simple. There are usually only one or two VERY basic and obvious steps to stopping each murder. The challenge isn't figuring them out, it's sitting through the tedious NPC travel routines waiting for the right time to do something. You quickly figure out the simple solution to stopping a murder, then spend five times as long peeking through doors waiting for NPCs to slowly waddle along and leave the room so you can do something. Worse is that, although you can rewind time, you cannot fast forward it and every rewind point is at least one full minute of real time waiting for key events. Every retried attempt is at least 60 seconds of just sitting there waiting for NPCs to run through the same routine. It gets old very very fast. The puzzles are 20% (very basic) deduction and 80% tedious waiting. This game would be great if they could get the Danganronpa writers who know how to write an intricate murder to solve.\n\nThat's not even mentioning the awful PC controls. Hold down right click to move (not right click to move, HOLD DOWN. If you let go you stop moving), left click to open door, then E and space to examine or peek through doors. It might sound simple, but trust me it's super awkward trying to play. It feels like a lazy DS port except it was never designed for touchscreen! There is no reason everything couldn't have been tied to left and right mouse clicks. It's definitely not worth $20. Even at 40% off for the summer sale I feel I didn't get my money's worth for 90 minutes until I lost interest. The only reason I can think of for buying this is supporting the developer enough so that they eventually get decent writing & design talent and release a proper game for this concept in the future.\ufeff\n\n(for anyone thinking I can't review this after only 90 minutes, just how long should you give a game to give a good impression if the whole thing is only 4-6 hours long?)", "timestamp_created": 1499400805, "timestamp_updated": 1499400805, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 50, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497343", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33173193": {"recommendationid": "33173193", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094368264", "num_games_owned": 215, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 625, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499068432}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u96f0\u56f2\u6c17\u306a\u3069\u304c\u51c4\u304f\u826f\u304f\u3068\u3066\u3082\u9762\u767d\u304b\u3063\u305f\u306e\u3067\u3059\uff01\n\u3068\u3042\u308b\u5c4b\u6577\u3067\u6bba\u4eba\u4e8b\u4ef6\u304c\u8d77\u304d\u4e3b\u4eba\u516c\u306f\u6642\u9593\u3092\u5dfb\u304d\u623b\u3063\u3066\u305d\u308c\u3092\u963b\u6b62\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3067\u8a71\u304c\u9032\u3093\u3067\u3044\u304f\u306e\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001\u305d\u306e\u6027\u8cea\u4e0a\u540c\u3058\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u4f55\u56de\u3082\u898b\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u591a\u304f\u3057\u304b\u3082\u30b9\u30ad\u30c3\u30d7\u3084\u65e9\u9001\u308a\u304c\u306a\u3044\u306e\u3067\u7279\u5b9a\u306e\u90e8\u5206\u3060\u3051\u898b\u305f\u3044\u5834\u5408\u306a\u3069\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30b9\u306b\u611f\u3058\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\n\u305d\u3053\u3060\u3051\u30de\u30a4\u30ca\u30b9\u70b9\u3067\u3059\u304c\u305d\u3093\u306a\u306b\u9577\u304f\u306a\u3044\u4f5c\u54c1\u306a\u306e\u3067\u305d\u3053\u307e\u3067\u6c17\u306b\u306a\u3089\u306a\u3044\u304b\u3082\u3057\u308c\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3002\n\u30bf\u30f3\u30b9\u306b\u96a0\u308c\u3066\u30b9\u30c6\u30eb\u30b9\u3068\u304b\u3082\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3051\u3069\u3059\u308b\u610f\u5473\u306f\u306a\u3044\u3057\u8b0e\u89e3\u304d\u30d1\u30ba\u30eb\u3082\u305d\u3053\u307e\u3067\u96e3\u3057\u304f\u306a\u3044\u306e\u3067\u304a\u8a71\u3092\u697d\u3057\u307f\u305f\u3044\u4eba\u5411\u3051\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1499069692, "timestamp_updated": 1499069692, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.588909", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33166731": {"recommendationid": "33166731", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998605149", "num_games_owned": 905, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 465, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499040816}, "language": "english", "review": "The story has good pacing and the puzzles aren't too hard but are satisfying to complete because you can empathize with the characters a bit after stalking them.

The story and atmosphere are what kept me coming back though, the entire game just oozes style and thought that left me unable to put the game down until I finished it.

I found myself trailing every character, trying to catch every piece of dialogue I could, each new piece I saw making me want to find more.

It gripped me, not for it's complexity, but for it's simplicity and charm. \n\nThe story is what kept me entralled towards the end, but at the beginning it was the music I loved. It fits so perfectly which each main area having a different song to figure things out too. But more than that, the music plays to the time, so when someone is about to die, the music gets tenser and draws you in, immersing you in the world even more. It plays such a perfect role in the world, eventually taking over for the clock in most cases as you can tell just by the music what is happening in the rooms around you.\n\nIf you want to come into this game looking for a puzzler, you might find it a tad easy and short for the price. However, if you are willing to sit down, take in the sound,  the music, the backstory and simply enjoy a wonderfully charming title, then the world of The Sexy Brutale is one to savour. \n\nNB: I did get some loading issues entering rooms.

This game takes place in short sessions, each pass revealing more of the map, more awareness of what is going on in the game and more puzzles to solve.

Within these 12 hours, the staff off the mansion is killing the guests one by one. Your task is to prevent the murders, find out what is going on, and eventually break the loop.\n\nYour presence is somewhat ghost-like. You cannot talk to or otherwise interact with other people (actually you have to hide from them), but you can investigate and manipulate objects as long as no one else is in the room. To prevent a murder, you first have to observe the actions of the characters, by peeking through keyholes into neighboring rooms, listening in on conversations, or hiding in cupboards. Once you understand the sequence of events, you need to find a way to break it, e.g. by manipulating a murder weapon before the killer picks it up. This creates puzzles which aren't overly complex, but imaginative and varied.\n\nThere are 6 of such murder cases to solve, with some of them having more than one murder to prevent. Saving a victim will give you access to another area of the mansion, where the next murder is taking place. You will also gain additional powers from each saved victim, which can be used to gain more information and reveal secrets throughout the mansion, giving you a reason to revisit areas you've already been to.\n\nI found the puzzles and the mechanics of this game very engaging. Observation-based games [i]can[/i] easily become a bit boring due to the passivity of the main gameplay mechanic, and games with a time-loop mechanic [i]can[/i] easily get repetitive - but The Sexy Brutale never felt that way. I always found new interesting details. I felt that I was unraveling an intricately designed mystery, step by step, and the repetition of events affirmed me that my understanding of that mystery kept growing. (Also, once you prevented a murder, you don't have to repeat that ever again.)\n\nI enjoyed the story and characters quite a lot. The characters are very distinct, you learn many little details about them, and the ending was appropriate and very touching.\n\nThe game's presentation is gorgeous. The graphics look splendid, and there is a lot of variation between the areas and rooms. The same goes for the music, especially the jazzy tones for the bar and casino evoke the atmosphere of such an upper-class establishment at some time in the last century perfectly. The sound design also integrates exceptionally well with the gameplay: sometimes you get audio cues from neighboring rooms, and certain events can be heard in the entire mansion. There is no voice acting, but I did not miss it.\n\nFor me, The Sexy Brutale was an amazing adventure, and I am really struggling to find something to criticize - apart from the godawful and completely misleading name. My biggest concern are probably the controls - keys cannot be rebound, and the control scheme assumes that the keys Z, X, 1, and 3 are close together since you have to press them frequently, often in time-critical moments. That's a problem for French, German, and Dvorak keyboards, and it's very disappointing that such an integral feature was overlooked in a game that is otherwise so finely polished.\n\nSome players also complained about the game's length, but I think 20\u20ac list price for a well-designed, highly polished game that took me 8 hours to solve and 10 hours to fully complete, are appropriate. Given that I have much less time now than I had 20 years ago, I actually appreciate games that pack high-quality content into an experience that can be fully had in a day or two. The Sexy Brutale fits that bill perfectly.\n\nI recommend this game wholeheartedly to everyone who likes adventure games and murder mysteries, especially if you have an eye for details and like the setting.", "timestamp_created": 1498789999, "timestamp_updated": 1498890093, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 72, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.865847", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33002533": {"recommendationid": "33002533", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043684504", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 428, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498758889}, "language": "english", "review": "Really great game.

In addition, this story relates to my human experience on a very personal level. As the only game to ever make me cry, I must recommend this modern classic. Based on some other reviews, it does not relate or appeal to everyone, but if The Sexy Brutale speaks to you as it speaks to me, then it is truely beautiful.\n\nPuzzles - Casual Fun\nThe puzzles are really easy. I found them engaging and fun (mostly from a narrative perspective), but not hard or stimulating. If you are a hardcore puzzle fanatic, you will probably sleepwalk this game is a few hours and wish for your money back. Personally, while I do enjoy hard puzzles, I enjoyed The Sexy Brutale as some laid-back fun.\n\nSoundtrack - Sexy\nIt's swing or jazz of some kind. Im not sure what it is technically, but instinctively I love it!\n\nLength - Short and Sweet\nTook me 9.5 hours to 100% the game with all achievements, collectables, and endings. $20 might be a bit much for such a short game. I got it for $13 on sale.\n\nPerformance - Abyssmal\nThe only graphics options are a few resolutions and fullscreen/windowed mode. I had to turn the resolution down to 720p (the lowest possible setting) just for a barely playable 20 fps. Although I am using a laptop, I can still get 25 fps on Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor, which is a very demanding, realistic looking, open world AAA title. The Sexy Brutale looks like a GameCube game and heats up my GPU like a liquid physics simulation. Although the game is slow-paced and requires zero reactions, there is no excuse for this.\n\nConclusion - BUY IT ON SALE INSTANTLY\nAmazing Story makes Shakespeare Jealous\nEasy \"Puzzles\" for Filthy Casuals\nSexy Soundtrack\nShort as a Hobbit\nTERRIBLE Performance, but still worth it", "timestamp_created": 1498723371, "timestamp_updated": 1498723623, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32978117": {"recommendationid": "32978117", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040583724", "num_games_owned": 166, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 295, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498711581}, "language": "english", "review": "Good little game.

There are some achievments left but whatever since this game tell its story so beautifully I dont really know where to start.\n\nFirst of, the main feature, Timetravel. Really well done! It felt kinda funny in the first few minutes but you'll grew to love it and you will play around with it thinking 'Oh, ok what happens if I do something else here two hours earlier?' Sort of like 'Now you are thinking with por..' yeah you know...\n\nSecond in my list is the art style. And what a beautiful art style it is! Ok ok your taste may differ and if you don't like it, oh well. But the coloration for the diferent rooms/settings, the character/item design. Over all a very well done job. The only downside would be the map, in which I constantly missed little details like the candles and such.\n\nThe third thing I would like to write about is the sound trak. Wow. It's unbelievably fitting! Upbeat tunes when you enter the casino and bar, slow downtrodden melodies when you are in the basement. It really compliment the game to its utmost extent. A small problem would be that it changes too abruptly sometimes when you chance scenery. But very seldomly.\n\nNow, the controls. I played with my xBox360 controller and had no problem whatsoever. The whole thing is completely intuitive.\n\nStory.\nColour me impressed. I had many a diffrent theory about what is happening in this mansion and why.

This is what this game is.\n\nYou are one of the guests in this mansion called \"The sexy brutale\". There are other guests, and also staff. Staff wants to kill the guests (no spoilers).\n\nYou have to put ones and twos together to figure out what exactly is happening, and save a bunch of people from being murdered, but you're not allowed to interact with anybody directly. You can only effect change through actions that you do when nobody's around.\n\nEverything in this game happens in about 10-ish minutes (12 \"hours\" in game time), but because everything happens in parallel, and you can't be everywhere at once, you basically keep playing these 12 \"hours\" over and over again, in different locations of this mansion.

A lot of the points I will talk about will pertain to this genre.***\n\n[b] Verdict: Overall I would give the game 9/10. Sexy Brutale is a fantastic game that really adds a new twist and pushes the boundaries of the genre. I recommend this game and will continue supporting the developers should they make more games like this. [/b]\n\nCons:\n[list]\n[*] Play time\n\nPlay time was shorter than I would have liked. I beat the main story in 9 hours. I know part of this comes down to finances, developers, if you're reading this just know that I would be willing to pay more for a longer game. \n\n[*] Puzzle difficulty and Linearity of Puzzles\n\nI am used to playing harder room escape games and the difficulty in this game was easy. It is set at a difficulty where anyone can solve it regardless of their experience in puzzle games. I personally wished it was harder (or at least an option to play at a higher difficulty) with less obvious hints. The puzzles are also quite linear, there are only a set number of items you can pick up in each area and it doesn't take much to figure out what to do. \n\n[*] Music Transition Between rooms\n\nThey are too abrupt and take away from the atmosphere of the game. \n\n[*] Buggy Controls\n\nI had to fight with the controls a few times, there was some lag between my input and the display. Loading time between rooms is something I experienced somewhat frequently. That being said the game is playable and I did not experience any save file glitch. \n\n[/list]\n\nPros:\n[list]\n\n[*] Music\n\nMusic is absolutely amazing. I love jazz and this games SCREAMS 1920s to me. Music was tailored to each room and it fits the theme and art direction perfectly. A+.\n\n[*] Story\n\nIf the story can move me then I think it's a story well done. I was definitely moved by the ending and it reminded me much of my favourite childhood game Majora's Mask. The dialogue between characters are fun and brings the characters to life. \n\n[*] Art Direction and Style\n\nI loved the art direction with this game. It is unique, memorable, and really suits the character's personalities. The rooms are built to reflect their theme. I absolutely loved the Bar, Garden, Tank room, and insect room. \n\n[*] Game Play\n\nMost of the games in this genre is text heavy with very little exploration options. This game is the opposite. It allows the players to move in 3D and piece together the story by themselves. I absolutely love this aspect of the game. It offers a fresh and interesting take on how games in this genre could be made. \n\n[/list]\n\nGames that are similar and also available on steam: Danganronpa + Zero Escape Series", "timestamp_created": 1498321385, "timestamp_updated": 1498321504, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32730833": {"recommendationid": "32730833", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045326062", "num_games_owned": 161, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498316694}, "language": "english", "review": "This isn't a bad game at all, but at only 4 hours long and incredibly easy, it's hard to recommend even at the \u00a310 sale price.\nAs it's a puzzle game, I expected to have to figure thing out, but there was very little of that.

You quickly find yourself a pocketwatch that can rewind time and reset the day. If you've played Majora's Mask you know the drill, though, think of The Sexy Brutal as single day that goes by very quickly and you're in a dungeonous version of Clocktown though a bit bigger. There's 7 \"missions,\" where you have to save a guest (or pair) but figuring out how to can be time consuming so there's a decent chunk  of content.\n\nThe Clue aspect is basically the film, but in reverse. First you have to find the person you need to save and how they're going to die and by whom, finding that out is the easy part. There's a minor stealth aspect in that you can't be in the same room as anyone else, everything goes dark an their mask will chase you down and out of the room. With that said, you can peer through keyholes and listen in on conversations to figure out where people have been and or what they're doing. You have to piece together all this information, in reverse, to find the key points where you mess with a plan or item that changes the course of time.\n\nOnce you save a guest you'll get a new power that will open up more of the mansion and the day will reset, all of the guests you save are still living out the same day, actually all guests are living the same day over and over and you can hear them all happening as well throughout the day. So for instance the first guest you save, the tutorial guest, is killed via a gunshot and at the same time everyday you'll hear that gunshot and you know he's died, yet again. Your task into the save them again, but to press forward.\n\nAt 5 hours I'm pretty much at the end of the game, I'm on last pair of guests I need to save before the final, single guest, so I can say I'm close to the end. It seems like the game can be done in under 8 hours easily which might seem short, but there's optional collectibles and the game has a great charm to it that makes it short and sweet so it adds a lot to the replayability for me.\n\nSo maybe, just like the game itself, I'll play it again... and again... and again... because it's really fun.

Its super clever and really fun to witness everything going on.  \n\nThe story is great, the mystery of why you are stopping these murders unravels as you get further on and by the end I felt completely satisfied, I wouldn\u2019t change a thing in regards to the story.  Although the game has a puzzle tag the actual puzzle solving aspect isn't particularly difficult, it's more important to getting your timings right and observe the characters and how they interact with each other.\n\nThe design of the environment is truly great, the individual rooms are beautiful to look at and the whole place is amazing to wander around.  As you solve murders you gain new abilities that let you explore other parts of the mansion, it's always good to revisit earlier parts of the mansion with the new abilities.\n\nThe music is completely on point, it changes depending on the area you are in and appropriately sets up the mood for what is to happen next.  I particularly liked the music in the entrance of the casino :)\n\nPeople say that the game is short but personally I think it's perfect in length, any more and it would be become stale, any less things would have felt rushed.  6-7 hours to complete and find all the secrets is perfect for me.\n\nMy only complaint with the game is there is little to no penalty for not being stealthy, I know it's not really a stealth game but being able to walk into a room whilst people are taking and just walk straight through and out the other side without any really impact to the story or characters is disappointing, personally I would have rather it changed the outcome of that particular day to which you need to rewind time to fix your mistake.\n\nOverall though this game is exceptional, so far it\u2019s the best game I've player this year (2017) and I would highly recommend it to anyone.\n\n[h1]Steam Controller[/h1]\nPlayed flawlessly on the Steam Controller using Xinput, for some reason the store page says partial controller support but for me I had no issues and the game presented the correct button prompts.\n\n[h1]Steam Link[/h1]\nThe game streamed without problems to the steam link, the game doesn\u2019t require any fast reactions so the slower nature of the game means streaming to the steam link with the controller for input even with some latency doesn\u2019t cause a problem.\n\n[h1]Widescreen Gaming[/h1]\nThe game was unplayable at 5760x1080, the menu was zoomed in and I couldn\u2019t even exit the game.

The music is very pleasant, and adds to the well-made atmosphere. Overall, I really hope that the developers expand on the game a bit: it would be very easy to have some form of a \"New Game +\" mode, with greater player risks, and an altered \"day\" to play through.

Short, but sexy.\n+ Plot twist for those that like em.\n\nCons:\n- 7 hours to 100%.\n- Easy to solve puzzles, do not buy this if your intent is to solve hard nuts, they are so easy you sometimes just stumble into the right solution.\n- A few visual glitches and bugs that without prior knowledge doesn't ruin the story but is a PRETTY big one (mask can fall of when hiding, you should really fix this guys).\n- Completely linear progression, sadly no real connection between the different characters which is sad because it would have added so more if saving person A somehow changed the outcome for person C whilst person B needed person D.\n- Spelling errors in lore, lots and lots of spelling errors.

Die grunds\u00e4tzliche Spielidee, mit verschiedenen M\u00f6glichkeiten die G\u00e4ste des Hauses zu beschatten, um ihre Ermordung abzuwenden, macht mir richtig Spa\u00df. Man deckt nach und nach die Wege der G\u00e4ste auf, lauscht in vertrauliche Gespr\u00e4che hinein und greift dann in den Ablauf dieses einen, immer wiederkehrenden Tages ein. Die verschiedenen Bereiche des Anwesens sind gut gestaltet, die Figuren knuffig.\nIm letzten Viertel \u00e4ndert sich das Spiel jedoch. Die G\u00e4ste werden zur Nebensache. Hier setzte bei mir die Langeweile ein, welche durch die endlosen Textpassagen zum Ende hin noch stark gesteigert wurde. Ab und zu wird nochmal eine Pseudoaktion f\u00fcr den Spieler eingef\u00fcgt. Die letzten 20 Minuten h\u00e4tten auch als Video ablaufen k\u00f6nnen.\n\nTechnisch ist das Spiel ganz solide, zumindest hatte ich keine Abst\u00fcrze. Allerdings wurde es manchmal ruckelig, wenn man in kurzer Zeit viele R\u00e4ume hintereinander passiert. Hier kommt es auch mal vor, dass man kurz in einem schwarzen Raum steht und gar nichts sieht. Da ich dieses Verhalten auch bei Let's Play's sehen konnte, f\u00fchre ich es auf das Spiel zur\u00fcck und nicht auf mein System.\n\nGanz am Rande hat mich noch die Steuerung genervt.

Having to manage attempts to save the guests in the mansion with the time rewinding was a really fascinating element of gameplay.\n\nHowever, I won't recommend purchasing this at full price (hence the vote). Wait till a discount.\n\nThe main reason I say this is due to the length of this game - I completed the game in 6 hours (essentially one sitting). I consider myself to be a rather experienced player with these sort of games - I refer specifically games along the lines of Zero Escape, Danganronpa or Ace Attorney - and I found this game to be far too forgiving. With those other games I listed as examples, there are usually some mechanics to punish you (E.G. Zero Escape gives you bad ends, Ace Attorney has three strikes before the judge rekts you, same with Danganronpa). Here in this game... I'm not sure I really ever gotten myself in a situation where I might get a Game Over. Because there're no stakes, I'm just ramming my head through any obstacles that set itself in the way. \n\nFacing a connundrum that got you stuck? CLICK ALL THE THINGS! But then again there was almost nothing that got me stumped enough as to require me to get a time-out to think it over - again stuff that I sometimes had to do with the other games (not just those listed). Had the game forced me to do something like that, it'll have been a heck lot easier to recommend but since that's not the case, it's a real downer. \n\nHell, I can only think of one occasion where a Game Over is somewhat possible. One of the game mechanics is that your character cannot be in the same room as any other character, you take \"damage\" if you are... Only one thing, that health bar drops so slowly I could just stick around in the same room for various reasons (checking the room, stopping time, the lulz). Tying in with that, you'll find that the game becomes far too easy as well because there're no real stakes. I can't really say I'm happy to note that the brute force method is actually a viable strategy (since it's not discouraged). \n\nSo there. Discounted pricing or no go, I'd say!

That game was fantastic.  I loved the sound track and how the music changed as you moved through the mansion.  This is one of the few games where I found I was hungry for lore and 100% completion because it is completely within reach.  You really get your money's worth if you're tracking down all the lore and tying up all the loose ends.  \n\nThe other nice thing is the game almost forces you to quit every once and a while to think.  I would do hour long sessions with a puzzle, make a satisfying amount of progress and then stop because I would get terribly stuck.  When you come back the next day new ideas come flooding and it's suddenly easy to continue the story.  They balanced the difficulty almost perfectly.  I only got stuck once at the very end and had to google how to continue, I must have missed key dialogue during a cut scene.  \n\nMy only complaint is Luficio would sometimes not respond to going through doors and you'd jam the a button and he would kind of freak out before going through.  Also I sometimes would go try to go into a room but still have the visual of the previous room I was in but with only the light effects, I could hear my character's steps but not see him or the room he was in.

At the same time, it was just as good hearing the sounds of the mansion and knowing exactly what caused them. The gunshot at 4PM every day. The lights flickering. The glass shattering. The soundtrack is fantastic as well. I wish I could buy it.\n\nThe gameplay is great. I wish it was more difficult, but it's solid as it is. I loved following everyone around, trying to figure out how they died, and then trying to piece together a plan to save them. When the plan didn't work, it was just as good reversing time and racing against the clock to find out what went wrong. \nThe only change I'd make is for the game to be more punishing when you get caught in the same room as another character. As it is, you can run circles around the room and escape without much worry. I feel like you should lose health much quicker so you can't just run by. The sound is so threatening when you're in the same room, but the actual threat is so low it's practically nothing.\n\nThe story is pretty good. I normally don't care about story in games, 'cause for me it's much less important than gameplay, but this one is pretty interesting and the characters are done pretty well.\n\nGame is great.

This is more the type of game where you need to use stealth to sneak around and find clues that will help you prevent the murders of your friends.  It takes place at a party in the titular casino mansion, where the staff murder all of the guests for some unknown reason.  As the protagonist, your job is to find out what this reason is, as well as locate Lucas, the mysterious owner of the casino who has not been seen recently.  To accomplish this, you must repeatedly play through the same day at the casino in a time loop not unlike those from Groundhog Day or Majora's Mask, rescuing each of the guests and inheriting their powers one by one as a result.  These powers allow for increased access to the rest of the mansion.\n\nI found this style of gameplay to be simple, yet engaging at the same time; the puzzles weren't too hard, but still required me to think at least somewhat - especially due to the time factor.  Unfortunately, there were some occasional glitches with the graphics and controls that would cause the game to freeze up for a few seconds when entering a new area.  While this wasn't a game breaker, it was particularly annoying when I was short on time while trying to reach a certain destination - in a game like this, every second matters.  However, this was my only real complaint, as this game is generally very well put together.  I believe The Sexy Brutale's biggest strength is its story - specifically, its ending.  The entire game is rife with symbolism, which becomes even clearer at the mind-blowing conclusion.  I don't want to spoil any major plot details, so I'll just say the whole thing was brilliantly executed.  To top it all off, the graphical style and soundtrack were both charming and fit the game's wacky casino vibe perfectly.

It's not too hard but not too simple but maybe a little... 'Why would I think to do that?'\n\nIt has a fun look to it and intresting mechanics, fair puzzles and with it constantly looping you can keep doing things. The music is wonderful too (Bell is definitively worth a listen).\n\nBut for 20$ it\u2019s a bit too short, could have done a few more puzzles and hell even Easter eggs. The card gathering could use some organizer so we can see what we already got instead of spending hours looping though the whole thing looking FOR ONE FREAKING CARD! Ending kinda sucked though, anticlimactic as hell but then again considering the way the game looks at the character from a slightly top-down way and had no voice acting (Not counting Bell) it WOULD make it harder to make more drama, cause to do that one would need to not only have voice actors (Which it didn\u2019t have the whole time) one would also need to change perspectives.\n\nI think my biggest complaint however (And this is something I\u2019ve seen be a problem for others too) is that when clicking to do anything with the doors -be it look though or go though- it doesn't always react then you click. There have been times i\u2019m trying to get though a door while being chased and losing half my life just cause it wouldn\u2019t let me go though the door when I clicked. In a game dealing with doing things on time that just isn\u2019t good at all. The controls also were weird in weird places and not even able to be reassigned to better places.\n\nIf you can get this for cheaper and/or can handle the delay in clicks, I would say go for it cause it CAN be fun and the characters are nice and it looks wonderful. But if you can\u2019t get it for cheaper or play someone else\u2019s then I wouldn\u2019t really advise it, get something like Saints Row or something (cause it\u2019s half the price and much more to do.)", "timestamp_created": 1494321556, "timestamp_updated": 1494321556, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31641948": {"recommendationid": "31641948", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029482219", "num_games_owned": 354, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 353, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494267913}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic story, writing and puzzles.

You've been invited to a masquerade party at the Sexy Brutale casino, only to be horrified when you realize that there's only one cards table and you're not very fond of roulette. They deliver another, slightly less traumatic but still shocking realization immediately afterwards: everyone in attendance is murdered in one day (about 10 minutes in real life). Finding the only cards table being permanently occupied by one of the other guests, you decide the only thing left to do is to rescue everyone so you can go find a different casino. \n\nThe basic gameplay involves moving through the mansion and eavesdropping on the other guests, slowly piecing together what's happening and getting clues on how to save each guest. Saving a guest gives you a new ability, and each one helps you see the story a little better and access more of the mansion. Everything moves at the same pace throughout the mansion in real time, so you have to rewind to the beginning pretty often to see everyones' movements. It's more interesting to play than it is to read about, but if you enjoy point-and-click adventures you'll probably enjoy this. The story is interesting, and the art style manages to make horrific deaths look like cute doll scenes. If I had to complain about something, it would be the stealth aspect; essentially, your character can't be in the same room as another one, unless you were hiding in something beforehand (you can still eavesdrop through keyholes, though). If you do go into an occupied room, everything goes dark and the guest's mask starts to chase you, and I don't know what happens if it catches you because it never caught me but I imagine it's something bad, maybe even worse than being in the fanciest casino you've ever been in but only having roulette to play. It's not annoying enough to detract much from the game, but it also feels a little unnecessary, and I do think the game would be a little bit more fun if they had an option to let you wander around the guests and see the story better. But either way, the game is pretty fun, and an interesting way to put together an adventure game.\n\nBut seriously, only one card table?

Because I'm a critic I'm still going to criticize it, but they're honestly small nitpicks. SB knows exactly what it wants to be as a murder mystery time traveling extravaganza and manages to pull it off.\n\nAlright let's start with the complaints, only three this time. First off and the one that's probably going to get the most people: The Sexy Brutale eventually becomes a labrynth to explore. By the end of the game you have the ability to get around more quickly, but there's not really indication (from the map at least, there's pictures you can use but the end points from those are unknown unless you remember where they are) on where you end up when you fast travel this way. You kinda have to figure it out for yourself. You'll be looking at the map a lot, but again this is happening towards the end of the game where the whole hotel is opened up for you and you're allowed to freely explore. Second, for those completionists out there, the Playing Cards. They're put around in some obvious locations and then some much less obvious locations. You might still figure them all out but it'll take time. It just becomes a struggle when the game doesn't tell you what cards are missing. So it helps to explore thoroughly to begin with, looking at every object, and then make a second pass after you can fast travel to unlock and break things. Finally, from a gameplay standpoint, the stealth mechanic is pretty nonthreatening. You can easily enter rooms with other people, go through to the other side, and only take a very minor penalty. While being in the same room as someone else disables most of your options other than running, knowing that you can just move through rooms with people in them takes a lot of the danger from the game.\n\nSo what's good about this game? Pretty much everything. Music? Killer, wish they had the soundtrack to purchase other than getting the PS4 special edition. It's a great mix from creeping doom jazz to orchestrated cries to the void. Every murder mystery section of the hotel has its own variable mix to match what's currently going on and eventually you just sync with it. Gameplay? Nearly spotless. Minus that complaint I had about the stealth stuff, SB is well padded so you always feel the stress of time on you, doesn't feed you hints (well it does sometimes but you need to know where to look for the hints, and they may not seem like hints at first), humorous and atmopsheric dialogue makes redoing sections to find the solution actually a treat rather than a chore (barring a few situations), every puzzle can be solved with a little thinking and hunting and the game is more than willing to show you through its gameplay to do so. Controls? A little weird, but it works for the adventure game format. Controllers are better if you have one compared to mouse and keyboard. Graphics? Well, that's what drew me to this game to begin with, that squashed Viewtiful Joe / The Wonderful 101 art style for characters has a ton of charm and style and works well with the game. Plus so many things are well animated. The environments are diverse and intreging to explore... Goodness. Story? Oooh boy, loaded with nice little red herrings at the best times, you always feel like you're figuring things out and then it gives you a few hints to push you in another direction. Again, the dialogue here is great too.\n\nI'm so happy to find amazing games that really pull me from beginning to end. The Sexy Brutale is such a game. If you dig stylish adventure games, there's a whole lot to like here. Plus the game sells normally at 20 US dollars for a game I'd probably spend at least 40 on. Yeah. The only reasons not to buy it are that you hate fun or want me to judge you. Or maybe you're a little squimish. That's possible too.

Important information that could be easy to forget is marked on your map (eg \"You now have the security codes to these three security cameras\") as well as the known positions-per-time of each guest. The most the game will do to point out an objective is to give you a general idea of where to now explore, in the style of the new Zelda.\n\nAs I said, I'm still early in the game, and it's reported to be a slightly short game which is fine by me. The title may cause some people to raise an eyebrow, but this is a very unique and well-presented package.\n\nEDIT: Ending comments sans-spoilers - This game is like the next Spec Ops: The Line for me in terms of literary value. I'd love to get a \"book club\" of people together and have them play the game together in one week, and then have them discuss \"So what did X represent?\" I probably would not have appreciated the ending much if people had just summarized it in a few sentences for me (\"What? So....That's dumb!\") but it's very well-presented, and ends up casting a whole new reflection on all the various seemingly unconnected elements of the game.

I also wish there was a way to zoom in.\n\nStill it is imo fantastic storytelling, great music, immersive gameplay and a compelling ambiance.\nIf you have a free day and are looking for a good interactive story game, I recommend buying The Sexy Brutale.", "timestamp_created": 1493854216, "timestamp_updated": 1493854216, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503923", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31532592": {"recommendationid": "31532592", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147894067", "num_games_owned": 500, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 392, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493852588}, "language": "english", "review": "Must buy", "timestamp_created": 1493852903, "timestamp_updated": 1493852903, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31530847": {"recommendationid": "31530847", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048414224", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 440, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493903179}, "language": "english", "review": "Truly spectacular", "timestamp_created": 1493843331, "timestamp_updated": 1493843331, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31527634": {"recommendationid": "31527634", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966975615", "num_games_owned": 214, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493755666}, "language": "english", "review": "No Xbox one and generic controller support.

When I first started playing I only had one word: WHOA! I honestly had no idea what I was doing, I didn't know which way to go and my heart was still pounding each mystery I tried to solve. But I can honestly say after playing through it, that this is truly an amazing game with an amazing story and learned slowly but surely as I continued to play on. In this one you play as Lafcadio Boone as he wakes up in one of the rooms of The Sexy Brutale Casino Mansion. He meets a mysterious woman who gives him a mask as well as a pocket watch which gives him the power to turn back time and restart the day. She tasks him with saving the victims that have died and with each victim that he saves he receives  a different power from each mask that he picks up after saving them. Now here are two kickers as you play : 1. You know who the killer is. 2. You have to find a find a way to save the victim within a certain time limit in each chapter. There is one final kicker but that is something for you to find out on your own when you play. As I said before, the story is amazing and the music makes it the sweet icing on the cake and it also gives sort of a classic film noir feel. I hope that we get a DLC of the soundtrack. There were a couple of technical concerns that I had when trying to maneuver the character as well as transitioning from one room to another. Despite that however this is worth checking out and playing and it will leave you with questions in the end which may make you want to play it again to see if you want to find more answers that you may have missed at least that is what I think in my opinion.  This is a game that I enjoyed (and still do) playing and I hope that you enjoy it too.", "timestamp_created": 1493782138, "timestamp_updated": 1493782138, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513253", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31515253": {"recommendationid": "31515253", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036561843", "num_games_owned": 306, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 276, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493768092}, "language": "english", "review": "Very neat game.\n\nPros :\n\n- the time travel mechanic was very well handled. The simplicity of how it's handled in Majora's mask is brought back very well here (conviniently also in a game about masks, I doubt that was a coincidence.) \n- the music was amazing, some of the best video game music I've heard. \n- stalking people down the halls was actually super fun to learn how they died and what might have prevented it. Didn't even mind rewinding after I realize I missed something. \n- the camera sways VERY slightly in rooms and it's super nice. \n- all the areas actually look really nice. Big fan of whoever did the art.\n- all the characters felt goofy, even the villain dudes. Like a cartoon it was super absorbing. \n- Figuring out a puzzle was actually super satisfying. The only one i didn't even mean to solve was saving the second group. I just flipped a button and they got saved. It took me a while to realize what happened. I put more thought into the first guy. \n- spoiler alert: There's a room close to the end of the game with a picture of everyone and you can hear almost every death from that room. Then the light turns off over their picture. It's so cool. \n- Spoiler alert continues: I actually really enjoyed the plot. It wasn't so much about what was going on with the guests, they were set dressing. You were supposed to be spending that time determining what was really happening. Then the story unfolds really nicely (even if very cliche'd. )\n\ncons - \n- the loading made me want to kill myself. It's not that there are long loading periods, there was just times where the area ahead hadn't loaded (or hell, even the area I'm in) and I'm just mashing the door button next to a door or walking around a black room waiting for the lights to come on. There was a perfectly black room I ran into earlier in the game that I never found again because the first time i went in there, it just didn't load. It took me forever to figure out that'd happened. \n- some of the puzzles aren't that fullfilling. The third save was a genuinely nice series of figuring things out by following and so on. Some of the later ones though, the answer is either told to you, or you basically figure it out because the answer is given to you by proxy. (there was an unlocked door that you could use items on and I knew immedietly that, spoiler alert, you had to lock the guy in there. ) \n- the threat of masks chasing you was never a threat. It super scared me the first time, but that was it. Actually, once you learn just how long it takes for masks to start chasing you on top of how much health you have, it's not uncommon to completely stop caring where people are and just go through rooms they're in anyway. \n- midway through the game, I bumped into some ghosts and when you do that you go into this weird \"don't hurt me\" backing up pose. I was already behind them when that happened though so that pose never turned off. I had to restart the day because I was just slowly backing up everywhere and couldn't do what I was planning to do fast enough. \n- I think it would have been cool if you used keys or items from some areas for puzzles in other areas or guests. One puzzle in the  game that I can think of actually does this which is a shame because I had a mental list going of what was where and that only payed off once. \n- the last puzzle in the game is a bit too easy for being the last. Considering the fact that I don't think it's a stretch to say this game takes influence from Ghost Trick, I'd expect the final puzzle to actually be a bit challenging. \n- I think it's a bit of a missed opportunity that the watch didn't fix gradually. You only have five hours for the first 30 minutes of the game, then 12 hours the rest of it. I don't know. It feels weird that it was ever restricted at one time. \n- I get why they did it, but the enemies having more varied designs or something would have been cool. It feels like everyone got murdered by the same guy and I get that that's what we were going for, but considering how like 2 of them have really witty banter after their kill while others get nothing, I'd like just a bit more... something. \n- The camera picks a location in each room and stays there. It's fine on its own but the map is easy to read with a compass. So if I want to head north, the northern direction gets changed and it's actually super easy to get lost. \n\nAll and all, I'd actually recomend this game. It's super good, the problems don't hold it back enough and I'd assume developers who put so much time into making the product this good will read reviews and maybe patch problems out of the game. Play it, but maybe wait for a sale. You can play it without a sale too, but it's a short game and has a $20 price tag which feels too high but considering what clearly went into this, I can't see them reasonably lowering it.\n\nBrief end bit.

Boone can't intervene in the murders directly, but he can manipulate the environment to stop them. When a guest is rescued, they'll bequeath you their mask, which will grant you a new ability or power. The game gives off a Majora's Mask kind of feel, with Boone reliving the same day over and over again while acquiring masks to grow in power and open the mansion for exploration, and I like the game, but I do have some thoughts on it...\n\nFirstly, the murders themselves. They're creative and brutal (or should I say BRUTALE? Ahahahahaha oh god I'm so alone) but...they're rather easy to solve, and don't require a ton of exploration. I don't mean that there isn't exploration involved, but it will rarely take you outside of the area where the guest is getting murdered. Not only that, but when you have to rescue two guests at once, there's only one solution involved. I accidentally solved one of the murders, simply by wandering around and examining objects. \n\nSecondly, I think the game might have felt a little more organic if the mansion was more open. Most of the time, you focus on one guest, solve that, then move on to the next guest without really giving it a second thought, and just doing what the Bloody Girl tells you to do. I think letting the player explore more on their own would help the game feel a little bigger, and not quite so linear. But there isn't really anything wrong with this.\n\nBut those are really my biggest gripes with the game. The Sexy Brutale oozes personality, and most of the charm actually comes from watching the various staff and guests interact with one another. Each character has a unique personaility and you get to know them a little bit better by the end of your time travelling escapade. Each power you collect feels useful and opens up more of the mansion for exploration (Oh, on a slightly off-topic note, the story is ok. I was slightly disappointed by the ending, but I had fun overall).\n\nThe game is also loaded with with secrets and collectibles. There are 52 playing cards hidden around the mansion, and each guest has an invitation that explains a bit about their background and how they know the owner, the mysterious Marquis. \n\nPros:\n+ Characters have vibrant personailities\n+ Murders are both creative and brutal\n+There are loads of secrets and collectibles\n+Great soundtrack\n+Environments are interesting\n\nCons:\n- Not a ton of exploration involved to solve murders\n- Murders are kind of easy to solve\n- Game is a little too linear \n- Ending is lackluster\n\nOverall, I had fun with the Sexy Brutale, and I'm glad I played it.

Its a ton of fun trying to figure out each victims story, piecing together what happened and then discovering how you can manipulate the environment to prevent the murder.\n\nGenerally there are two complaints. Sometimes we got stuck on doors because the game seems rather particular on when it accepts hitting the A key to get through a door.  The second part of this is the duration of some animations. The most glaring and least spoilery of this is when saving yourself to one of the various clocks. It takes a solid half hour for this to occur.

We havent quite figured out how to locate the last victim, but we beat the game to this point rather quickly and that was with spending extra time to, at times, uneccessarily walking around stalking characters just to have them revealed on the map for down the line.

[i]The Sexy Brutale[/i] misses the mark for me.[/b] Sorry Jim. Some reviewers said it was too easy - that absolutely was not the case for us. I found the whole thing to be a bit confusing, really. We had to look up spoilers twice because we were dead stuck, and the answer was so unsatisfying both times. \"Unsatisfying\" in the sense that it wasn't enlightening or some learning moment - in example, something or some strategy we had tried several times before, just not at the right time during that level. It was odd. This is a frustrating title because all the components of it are really great - but it just doesn't work for some reason.\n\n[i]Essentially, you are trying to prevent a murder in mansion/hotel called [/i]The Sexy Brutale. The universe is quite wild with masks giving powers and crazy characters, which is pretty cool. The rule set is weird and dense, which is what I find difficult to wrap my brain around. Working with time is the core mechanic, I suppose, but we struggled the whole time with that too. It's a lot of trial-and-error to figure out where to be at the right time.\n\nThe tutorial/first murder prevention led to an 'aha' moment for us, which was satisfying and got us interested, but that was it.

Full price, it's a bit of a tough sell. Interesting, but flawed. Puzzle gameplay is solid, even if puzzles are at times simplistic, and other times frustrating. Overarching story is definitely the weak part.\n\nSo, okay, I'm a little bit torn on this one. This is a reasonably competent puzzle game, and rather enjoyable, especially if you like mystery genre (since most puzzles in first two thirds of the game are kinda based on whodunit premise). It lacks polish a bit, i.e. some animations are janky, music cuts off abruptly in places. Nothing too bad though. But that's not why I'm torn. I'm torn because the twist is so cliche it's painful. I've seen it a mile away, but refused to believe until the game acknowledged it with \"you probably guessed already\". Well, what can I say? Story isn't a strong part of this experience. So if you're looking for that, walk right past. Guest deaths are rather creative though, so maybe the last statement isn't entirely true, but if you're looking for a great mystery-type story, you won't find it here.\n\nPros:\n+ Music. Music is awesome.\n+ Gameplay is enjoyable. A bit of a fresh take on the murder mystery genre. Nothing groundbreaking though.\n+ Up to a point it's fun to learn \"the truth\" behind smaller mysteries. Sadly, only up to a point. By the second act, initial allure was gone, and game offered nothing new.\n\nCons:\n- Plot twist is utterly disappointing. I won't spoil it here, but it's kinda obvious by the third act. And we've seen it a lot lately, so it's kinda cliche.\n- Short, if you skip the collectathon. Yes, this features a collectathon. I finished it in 4 hours, and I did go out of my way a bit for collectables. I did not get all the collectables in that 4 hours, mind.\n- Becomes somewhat tedious towards the end. Again, won't spoil it here, but suffice to say that some puzzles in the endgame seemed to be entirely out of the left field.\n- Lacks polish. This is a minor nitpick though\n\nIt might seem like I'm overly critical, and it's very possible that I am. But that's because I did honestly enjoy the game (well, most of it, plot twist was very disappointing), but I felt that it could be so much better. Overall I recommend picking this up on a sale or something. While I don't really feel full price is a ripoff, I can't say it's entirely justified either. It's a bit of a mixed bag, but an experience worth having, provided you enjoy a bit of murder mystery theatre with a dash of a supernatural spin [spoiler]although not really, but that's spoiler territory[/spoiler]\n\nBeing torn as I am between \"thumbs up\" and \"thumbs down\" -- I really feel more like \"meh\" in this case -- I'm going to opt for \"thumbs up\" in this particular case. The game is flawed, to be sure. And asking price isn't entirely justified.

The music plays into this quite a bit as the intensity of the soundtracks will increase as important events happen. It's consistently reminding you of all the murders that are taking place around you no matter where you are. You'll end up thinking to yourself by the end of the game \"There's the bell toll, that means 'so-and-so' died, there's the gunshot...\". It helps with timing things too which is good.\n\nThe sleuth mechanics of the game are neat although they can be easily abused. I never felt like the guests in the rooms posed much of a threat as I could always sprint across without any trouble and there was never really a need to hide in a room unless you wanted to hear a conversation play out without peeking through a keyhole. If anybody enters a room you are in you can always just go through the door they came in second later with no consequence.\nThis could have been designed a bit better by having the guests collidable or making the masks a bit quicker and more dangerous. For dead ends there could be more hiding places, and not just wardrobes either. This would have encouraged a bit more clever navigation throughout the mansion instead of just walking around without consequence. I never felt I needed to use the listening mechanic either because of this which was a shame.\n\nIt's an interesting game, short but very sweet. My only gripe besides the sleuth gameplay would be that almost all the solutions for the murders are very straightforward. Although they do require a fair bit of investigation before you understand what needs to be done, the solution is immediately made clear instead of slowly pieced together. It's not Broken Sword levels of puzzling but it gets the job done.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone really, but it's not without it's flaws.\nA fantastic game nonetheless and I would like to see more like it in the future.\n\nAlso the soundtrack is incredible.", "timestamp_created": 1493499506, "timestamp_updated": 1494803256, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.733294", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31428942": {"recommendationid": "31428942", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995937772", "num_games_owned": 324, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 450, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495865453}, "language": "english", "review": "The Sexy Brutale is kind of like if Groundhog Day met The Vanishing of Ethan Carter.

The concept reminded me a lot of the DS game Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective, which I really enjoyed. (Seriously, if you liked this game, then try that one.) And I don't regret buying this game at full price, at all. This is actually the first time I've written a game review in my life, which should show just how much I like this game and want to make sure others know about it!\n\nThe time that I spent playing the game \u00edncludes - apart from me gleefully exploring every little nook and cranny and watching all the scenes unfold in practically every single room - a couple of hours backtracking and looking for collectibles (which was slightly frustrating, see more under cons below).\n\nPROS:\n+ The art style is wonderful and unique, and I love the use of masks in the game. \n+ I absolutely love the music and how it's used: it creates a great sense of atmosphere and personality to the different locations, and it's used splendidly to create tension at just the right moments. I especially like the way the music changes depending on what's going on in the vicinity.\n+ I personally love games that toy with time, but that's a preference that not everyone may share with me. \n+ The \"puzzles\" never frustrated me because they were based on observation rather than actual puzzle-solving. However, this isn't only a good thing. See more under cons below.\n+ While the story concept (i.e. the reveal in the end) wasn't really new to me, it was interesting enough. Regarding the story throughout the game, I really like the concept of telling a story through bits and pieces like this: piecing it all together by watching what unfolds in all the rooms of the mansion, one scene at a time, and following it all in real time. The murders were clever and I greatly enjoyed watching them all (some more than others).\n+ I guess it could have been a longer game, but seeing how much I loved it, I find it well worth the price even for just under 10 hours of gameplay.\n\nCONS:\n- The \"puzzles\" were not really puzzles and I personally found them a little too easy. Some of the puzzles I managed to accidentally solve while exploring the area, without even knowing what was going on, and that disappointed me, especially since I couldn't immediately do some of them over again (because the game forced me onwards). Furthermore, I would have preferred if there were different ways to approach every murder, instead of having only one way to solve them.\n- The collectibles (playing cards) were mostly easy to find, and everytime I found one, the game told me which specific card it was. But with only one left that I hadn't found in the end, I was out of luck - there was no way to see which cards I had left. This forced me to look up a walkthrough, then meticulously going through basically the whole mansion to search through all the spots until I randomly happened upon one bookcase I hadn't checked. Tedious. (Also, the reward was slightly disappointing imo.)\n- I would have liked having more options when it came to forwarding time, because as another review also mentioned, there were a few times where I had to just stand around and wait for things to happen.\n\nTLDR; The Sexy Brutale is an awesome game with great atmosphere that nonetheless would have benefited from more complex, actual puzzles with different solutions. 9/10 from me.", "timestamp_created": 1492685525, "timestamp_updated": 1492686370, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507168", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31251267": {"recommendationid": "31251267", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966719867", "num_games_owned": 512, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 500, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492673991}, "language": "english", "review": "Been a while since a game has made me cry.

No performance issues for me.\n\nI wish the solutions were a little more complex, and the mansion was a little less linear and more open, and that it let you discover targets/victims and when they died, rather than being a little hand-holdy and linear about it with sectioned off regions and \"here is your new target!\" chapter headings. I wish there were more enemies that were less obviously bad guys, and that there were more filler/superfluous/red herring characters. Now there are none of those. What exists is tight and complete.

La trama tiene lugar en un solo d\u00eda que se repite indefinidamente al llegar a la medianoche, al m\u00e1s puro estilo de Atrapado en el Tiempo. Frente a la acci\u00f3n y a la agilidad de reflejos prima la capacidad de observaci\u00f3n y, en ocasiones, la paciencia (conseguir el retrato completo de uno de los asesinatos puede requerir repetir el d\u00eda algunas veces, pero cada nuevo fragmento de informaci\u00f3n se sent\u00eda de lo m\u00e1s gratificante).\n\nOtro punto fuerte que emparenta The Sexy Brutale con un g\u00e9nero con el que a primera vista no parecer\u00eda tener demasiado en com\u00fan como son los Metroidvania es el desbloqueo de habilidades que te permiten acceder a otras habitaciones de la mansi\u00f3n. Las nuevas estancias tienen una cierta cohesi\u00f3n tem\u00e1tica, d\u00e1ndole matices nuevos a la ambientaci\u00f3n general.\n\nGameplay al margen, el juego destila estilazo. La atm\u00f3sfera est\u00e1 muy bien conseguida, con gui\u00f1os claros al steampunk, vud\u00fa, Lovecraft y en general a otros grandes del g\u00e9nero de terror  de finales de S.XIX y principios del XX. Asimismo, la banda sonora es impecable, no se siente repetitiva en ning\u00fan momento y acompa\u00f1a fabulosamente al apartado visual. Destaco en particular las dos pistas vocales que me encantaron.\n\nEntiendo que la duraci\u00f3n (En 9h casi del tir\u00f3n lo he superado al 100%) pueda resultarle reducida a alguna gente, pero en mi opini\u00f3n dada la mec\u00e1nica, el tipo de puzzles y la cantidad de contenido me pareci\u00f3 m\u00e1s que adecuada: alargarlo m\u00e1s en estas mismas condiciones podr\u00eda terminar siendo repetitivo. \n\nPrecisamente, como punto no exactamente negativo pero que me gustar\u00eda ver en una hipot\u00e9tica segunda parte, apuntar\u00eda la sensaci\u00f3n de que los puzzles en general son relativamente inmediatos una vez has observado cada situaci\u00f3n el tiempo suficiente.

But the overall impression along with the characters which you are to save add quite a bit to them all.\nThere is no voice-acting but that might actually be a plus as most things are easy to interrupt and avoid the repetition. No need to hear how many arrows you have taken to your knee as it were. The music is in the background most of the time and changes with the game events. The main music is kind of upbeat but non-descript as well. It's kind of reminds me of an old 8-bit midi track that some games had to fill the soundscape and it reminds very much of Ms. Fischers Murder Mysteries main theme, which is kind of fitting.\nThe normal sound follows the same as the music. Effective but sparse for the most part. It's not bad quality, just not a lot of sounds.\nThe artstyle is very stylised and cartoony. Very distinct which helps with the feel of the game as well. It is very reminicent of Monkey Island and such click based puzzle games where most things were exaggerated to a degree. \n\nThe one bad point is the interaction. Extremely reliant of left click to get into stuff but also get out of dialogs which will get annoying quite quickly as you move by right-clicking on the screen. You kind of expect to move right away but a dialog is up and you don't notice it all the time. A trvivial thing but the one annoyance actually.\n\nNot a lot of options are available but what is there suffices. This game could easily be playable on a tablet as well.\n\nOverall this game is a gem, well worth the price in my opinion.", "timestamp_created": 1492120740, "timestamp_updated": 1493596875, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31124687": {"recommendationid": "31124687", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032177254", "num_games_owned": 457, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493038595}, "language": "english", "review": "So far so good.

No, no, that's good enough: Ten Little Indians by Neil Gaiman.\n\nThe puzzles are reasonably straight-forward, and you should be able to pull them all off by using observation. The game metaloop works like this: you wander around (and at the same time collect collectables), look and poke at everything, learn the lay of the land and spy on the events and the characters, probably for a couple of loops at least. Then it's usually pretty straight-forward to figure out what to do, as long as you have all the info. I actually solved the second murder in the game by accident just by puttering around, and had to restart the game so that I wouldn't be spoiled for the 'solving the murder' scenes before I actually got to see what the murders actually WERE! The worst puzzling involves the late game when almost the whole mansion opens up to you. If there's something that you missed earlier, it can be annoying to hunt it down.\n\nAs for performance, it ran perfectly fine except for loading issues at the start of the game (not minutes, but annoyingly long because it fades out the loading indicator and then loads it back again), AND sudden loadin spikes in-game that left the room I entered almost black until the game caught up.

It just needs a severe kick in the butt in both content and the puzzle gameplay.\n\nThe game, as is, is way too short. Just over a handful of the murder puzzles is not nearly enough. And it's not like they're complex either, which is the other problem. Anyone with an eye for observation can literally solve these scenarios without really knowing why, and practically bypass the actual story of the occasion. I did so on the 5th scenario. I had no idea what was really going on, just that very simple puzzle intuition led me to the solution without needing a great deal of  comprehension. So really, the game needs more complexity in its solutions. More red herrings, more mechanics to utilize.\n\nI really want a game like this to be superb.

The game's use of sound is brilliant, with music that is both catchy and encapsulates the timing and feeling of the murder(s) happening in that corner of The Sexy Brutale; and each murder carries with it its own sound that echos throughout the house, like the first gunshot, [spoiler] and the shattering of glass, the ringing of the bell, the sparking sounds, and the roulette spinnings that hammer the nails in the coffin of a pair of victims [/spoiler].

Quite fun to just explore, especially if you're a completionist who has to touch all the things. I loved following the different guests and staff around, watching them interact and eavesdropping on their conversations. The world is very well built and written, and the way the character paths weave together over the time line make the time travel quite satisfying. Most of the murders are creative and fun to foil, some are just weird.\n\nThere are a few rough patches. Some animation and audio transitions are jerky/sudden, and during my second play session some of the rooms took a noticable two or three seconds to load. The main character also controls poorly when near walls or obstacles, or even doors. Usually the game is generous enough with time that it doesn't cause you to fail, but it can be frustrating when you're trying to get to a closet to hide just before someone enters a room. May take you out of the experience for a moment, but the game will pull you right back in.\n\nPlayed with a 360 controller. Beat the game 100% in a little over 8 hours.

Votre r\u00f4le est d'emp\u00eacher que les meurtres se concr\u00e9tisent.\nComment faire? Miracle, le jeu vous offre une montre qui vous permet de remonter le temps, permettant de recommencer la journ\u00e9e \u00e0 l'infini. \n\n\nChaque cible de meurtre se trouve dans une zone confin\u00e9e du manoir compos\u00e9es de plusieurs pi\u00e8ces dans lesquelles se trouvent des objets qu'il va falloir combiner, associer ou bouger pour emp\u00eacher les meurtres, avant qu'il ait lieux, bien \u00e9videmment.

I haven't seen anything quite like it before, though I'd bet my mother that there are at least a dozen good books taking their spin on the concept. Though the actual inevitable twist becomes somewhat predictable due to some heavy foreshadowing, the characters were entertaining and the creative and macabre death scenes were a lot of fun. While the game has the same sort of tryhard-y artsyness a lot of indiegames tend to go for, it has a lot of levity and charming writing and takes a lot of time indulging in its inherently fun and somewhat silly setting. This levity lead to me being much more absorbed in the story than I otherwise would've been, so I actually gave a crap by the end. So while it's not the greatest thing in the world, it's charming and doesn't take itself obnoxiously seriously, so it gets a big thumbs up from me.\nThough I think some of the puzzles could've done with a bit more complexity, they were still tricky enough to keep me busy for a while. I'm not a big fan of puzzle games, so maybe their comparative simplicity was a bit of a blessing for people like me, but if you're really into the genre, they probably won't stimulate. But even then, there's still a very charming and creative mansion full of devious macabre secrets and amusing snippets of trivia to read up on as you pass through. \nPlus a killer soundtrack. I mean, sweet lords, those tunes are so taffing catchy, I can't even. This is one of the few times where I would not hesitate to spend the cash for the game's soundtrack, yet it's not even available! What a world we live in.\nSo on the whole, The Sexy Brutale is a very good game for people who are into this sort of thing. I doubt it will have a big mass appeal, but if you're the kind of person who enjoys spending a long evening getting absorbed in a slightly campy but charming setting, then I think you will enjoy your time with this one.", "timestamp_created": 1492005143, "timestamp_updated": 1492137722, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506681", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31096323": {"recommendationid": "31096323", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023732246", "num_games_owned": 367, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492000894}, "language": "english", "review": "The Sexy Brutale is a fantastic game full of exotic and charming characters, great level design, wonderful music and a core gameplay mechanic that will have you thinking \"That was so clever\" up until the very end.\n\nThe puzzles are very satisfying and while some can be completed without looping time at all there are others where you will be repeating the day spy on another conversation or find out where an item or secret passage is.

During this time every single guest in the mansion, where the Sexy Brutale takes place in, gets murdered in a variety of creative methods. \nWho the killers are doesn't matter, to the point where the murderers themselves are all named after playing cards, like \"2 clubs\". They all wear very similar masks so you can pinpoint them immediately, and the gameplay is similar to Gregory Horror Show where you can explore the mansion to discover their timetables and what their thoughts and conversations are. Where all characters are, at whatever the time is, will be saved in your map as you encounter them. It is a very well made and helpful tool, especially as it is impossible to encounter all characters within the course of a single ingame day.\n\nIt is up to you to save the mask-wearing guests from the ever-present killers, and gain the powers of their masks to save the later guests from harm. Whenever you turn back time your character retains all of his memories, but loses most of his inventory, so there is a strong sense of trial and error before you discover the solutions to these puzzles.\n\nAn interesting mechanic is you can never interact with another killer or victim. Whenever you enter the same room as them time freezes and their masks spawn a \"phantom\" which attacks you until you leave. This isn't ever meant to kill you, and is purely a way to ensure you solve these puzzes in an indirect manner, so none of these characters ever encounter you before you save them. You learn about each character via heavy amounts of easedropping: peaking through keyholes, and listening to their conversations, is a big part of the game, and a key element to solving the crimes.\n\nEvery victim is always killed in their own individual manner, which happens at specific times in the day, so you always know when it is too late to save someone. The deaths are both visceral and entertaining, and are worth experiencing.\n\nThe writing is great, with a wonderful cast of characters. The identical mask-wearing murderers are especially memorable, despite their individual lack of identity, as they embody a great sense of humour. Particular mention goes to the pianist killer who plays the piano beautifully, and speaks in a very poetic manner as he goes around his evil ways. His method of killing is especially interesting.\n\nMusic is fantastic, and is a major highlight. The soundtrack is very strong, and sets the scene in a superb manner. There is not a single bad song in the Sexy Brutale. \n\nThe themes of the game are time travel, voodoo, and casinos. The Sexy Brutale is named after the casino portion of the mansion, and the character masks are very similar to what you may have seen in Grim Fandango, and Guacamelee, with the Mexican flavour to the setting. There is lots of alcohol around, and even a luchador character is present. It helps that every single character, barring the killers, have unique quirks and personalities, so you can explore their individual storylines as you attempt to save them.\n\nThe problems with the game mainly revolve around a few particular issues. First is its framerate as you enter new areas. It can chug a little bit as you go through the rooms, and there are a lot of rooms in the Sexy Brutale. It's not gamebreaking at all, and not always noticable, but is something I saw on several occasions. \nThe second main problem is how you travel through time. You start the day at 12pm, and the day ends at midnight, although you can forward time to 4pm or 8pm. You do not have the freedom to choose other times, or even reverse time, except for going back to the beginning of the day.\n As the game is set within a single mansion there is a lot of backtracking to do. I would have preferred it if you had the ability to teleport between the huge clocks which dot the map and serve as the save points. There are a lot of collectables in the form of playing cards and guest invitations, so you are encouraged to explore and investigate every room.\n\nThe storyline is also rather odd as you begin being greeted by a woman that enters and leaves the world via blobs of what looks like wet orange/red paint. Who she is, and even who you are, remains an unanswered mystery for a huge part of the game. You are given a name, but not a past or even personal motive until the final chapter.

This is a really interesting concept as everything in the mansion is moving in real time, making you rewind time and follow characters around to discover hints at how to stop their murder. The problem with this is because it is so hard to make a game work in this way, there is only one way to stop the murder for every character. Coming from playing a lot of the Hitman games it made it hard to enjoy the game as much as I wanted to.\n\nThe presentation of the game is amazing, the art style and music fit very well into the setting and exploration is encouraged to solve the puzzles in order to prevent the murder of the next guest. The main problem with this is that some of the events are time based which you may miss depending on where you are at the time, meaning you may think that nothing of importance happens in that room. It ends up becoming a bit of a chore to constantly backtrack through already explored areas to come across an event you missed.\n\nThe storyline is overall pretty weak, I wish there were more NPC's that had interactions which developed more of the story, who were not involved in the story.

You can not share a room with any person but you can peek through doors and hide in cupboards to investigate what's going on. There is only a single day in which the victims are all being killed but - you can reset this day over and over and over. All information you uncover is saved on a map of the mansion, meaning once you know person X is in room Y at Z o'clock, you can check this on your map. It's a simple yet fantastic premise. There is plenty of dialogue to eavesdrop on that will come together and reference future discoveries but present a competent mystery at first. Progression through the mansion works a lot like it does in Resident Evil games, where you will find plenty of blocked passages early on & find ways to go past hours later.\n\nThere are some minor nitpicks about quality-of-life improvements and the UI but they are negligible.

But really, the gameplay is linear and rather dull.

There is only one solution to each murder, so after watching each murder once and restarting the day, it just becomes a chore you have to get through to advance the story.\n\nI suppose it's puzzle solving in the point-and-click adventure sense, I just found it to be wasted potential though.  Most of the work is just waiting for people in different rooms to pass by and watching the same animations play out over and over.\n\nNice music, nice art style and nice story.

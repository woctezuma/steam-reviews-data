While Planet Coaster is of course another spiritual successor of RCT games, with a more \"modern feel\" to it, Parkitect is more like a continuation of the classic games, which I mention so that if you're reading this review you can make a  decision based on what you're looking for.  \n\nI have only played a short time so keep that in mind when you read this.  In my first hour of playing this and learning the ins and outs of it, having played all of the RCT games up to RCT3, the feel, the look and the mechanics of Parkitect was easy to pick up on and learn.  Definitely one that fills that urge to return to the old tycoon games, that's for sure.  It does the job very well.  You create the rides, place entrances, exits, test and open the rides as expected, add paths, shops, and your employees for keeping things running and clean.  They've added \"haulers\"  which is new, and shops will need to have them in order to have their products or raw materials (food) delivered to them in order to run.  I think this was a good idea for those super into micromanaging everything under the sun for your park. \n\nI am sure this game isn't for everyone as I pointed out some may be looking for something more modern, for which I recommend Planet Coaster but for all the others this is absolutely a must play game! \n", "timestamp_created": 1516262270, "timestamp_updated": 1516262270, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39367871": {"recommendationid": "39367871", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091457500", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5680, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1006, "last_played": 1516359236}, "language": "english", "review": "Highly reccomend this game, I've had hours of fun on it and its very addictive!", "timestamp_created": 1516031871, "timestamp_updated": 1516031871, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39302090": {"recommendationid": "39302090", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007522502", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 91, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 91, "last_played": 1516400463}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ud50c\ub808\uc774\ud558\ub294\ub370\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4\uc11c \uc9c0\uc7a5\uc774 \uc788\ub294\uac74 \uc544\ub2c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud574\uc8fc\uba74 \ub354 \uc88b\uc558\uc744\ub4ef \u3160\u3160 (\uc9c1\uc811 \ud55c\uae00\ud328\uce58\ub97c \ud574\uc8fc\uc2e0\ubd84\uc774 \uc788\ub358\ub370, \ucd5c\uc2e0\ubc84\uc804\uc5d0\ub294 \ub9de\uc9c0\uc54a\ub294\uac74\uc9c0 \ud328\uce58\ub97c \ud558\uba74 \ub124\ubaa8\ub124\ubaa8\uac00 \ub728\ub354\ub77c\uad6c\uc694)\n\n\uac8c\uc784\uc790\uccb4\ub294 \uad49\uc7a5\ud788 \uc7ac\ubc0c\uc74c!\n\n\ub864\ucf54\ud0c02\uc778\ub370 \uadf8\ub798\ud53d\uc774 \uae54\ub054\ud558\uace0 \uadc0\uc5ec\uc6cc\uc9c4\ub290\ub08c?? \uac1c\uc778\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub8642\ud560\ub54c \ub290\uaf08\ub358 \ubd88\ud3b8\ud55c\uc810\ub4e4\uc774 \ud574\uacb0\ub41c\uac70\uac19\uc74c.\n\n\ubcf8\uc778 \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130(i5-7500, gtx1050, RAM 16)\uc5d0\uc11c \uc794\ub809\uc774 \uac00\ub054 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud568.\n\n\uc544\uc9c1 \uacf5\uc6d0\uc774 \uc791\uc544\uc11c \uc798 \ubaa8\ub974\uaca0\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uad6c\uc870\ubb3c\uc774 \ub354 \ub9ce\uc544\uc9c0\uba74 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\ub0b4\ub0b4 \uc794\ub809\uc5d0 \uc2dc\ub2ec\ub9b4\uac70\uac19\uae30\ub3c4\ud568..\u3160", "timestamp_created": 1515830949, "timestamp_updated": 1515830949, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39254949": {"recommendationid": "39254949", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039954199", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1367, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1367, "last_played": 1516196410}, "language": "english", "review": "After much deliberation and scepticizm, I finally decided to purchase Parkitect.

Wird also nicht so rund zu lesen sein. Also ich habe das Spiel noch vor dem Steam Release in einer sehr fr\u00fchen Version \u00fcber Hum*** Bun*** gekauft, und habe es bisher nicht bereut. Die Entwickler halten Ihre Versprechen ein und entwickeln das Spiel st\u00e4ndig weiter. Die Spielgrafik ist Geschmackssache und reicht nat\u00fcrlich nicht an ein Plan** Co*** heran. Das ist aber auch gar nicht der Anspruch der Entwickler. Hier liegt ganz klar der Wirtschaftsaspekt im Vordergrund. Und da hat es einiges mehr zu bieten. \n\nPositives\n+ noch laufende Entwicklung, st\u00e4ndig neue Updates\n+ sehr guter und fordender Wirtschaftsaspekt, dadurch angemessener Schwierigkeitsgrad\n+ Achterbahneditor ist dem von RCT2/3 sehr \u00e4hnlich bietet aber mehr Freir\u00e4ume\n+ schon jetzt ausreichende Anzahl von Attraktionen\n+ per Mods sind massig neue Attraktionen und Dekorationsm\u00f6glichkeiten vorhanden, aber nat\u00fcrlich auch Szenarien oder Vorlagen f\u00fcr Achterbahnen\n+ realistische Warenversorgung der Shops\n+ massig M\u00f6glichkeiten sich detailierte Statistiken \u00fcber Besucher oder Attraktionen einzuholen\n\nNegatives\n- die Performance ist angesichts der doch recht einfachen Grafik noch ausbauf\u00e4hig, reicht meiner Meinung nach aber aus\n- bisher sind keine Besuchergruppen implentiert, die Besucher laufen einzeln durch den Park\n- Shops sind schlecht zu individualisieren, hier k\u00f6nnte man mal bei Pla** Coa** abgucken\n- kein Tag/Nacht Zyklus... was aber mit Sicherheit kommen wird?\n\nInsgesamt eine ganz klare Kaufempfehlung f\u00fcr Leute die Freizeitparksimulationen m\u00f6gen und sich mit der Grafik anfreunden k\u00f6nnen. Ich lege meine Hand daf\u00fcr ins Feuer da\u00df die Entwickler das Spiel nicht nur zu Ende bringen werden, sondern es auch wirklich in eine Richtung entwickeln werden, die sich die Community w\u00fcnscht. Wer nat\u00fcrlich viel Wert auf realistische Grafik legt, dem sei ein anderes Produkt ans Herz gelegt, bei dem allerdings die Wirtschaftsaspekt ziemlich zu kurz kommt.

At the moment I can't see anything that's too different, but game is constantly being updated by the looks of it, with a campaign mode to come in the full version. I'd like to point out I've not done much track, scenery or level designing. Will edit this if I can think of something else, or something gets added or changed! (Edited in line with developer feedback, who I'd also like to praise for swift response).\n\nPros so far;-\nI like the addition of supply chains for shops (reminds me of Theme Park but not quite as infuriating as manually ordering stock)\n-Staff rooms and staff training\n-Employee Paths (the people get annoyed if there's people currently walking past with boxes...!)\n-Queue paths, if you drag a queue it no longer automatically stops at the first 'normal path'. Minor but this was a big annoyance for me when planning things on RCT 1+2\n-Ghost car when constructing tracks. No more saving, placing entrance, opening ride, testing and re-loading if something flies off the end ;)\n-Mod community has made some pretty decent stuff so far, mainly scenery. There's a lot of blueprints floating around too.\n-Guest insight. Market research is a great idea, plus detailed actions of all the things the guest has done recently.\n\nCons;\n-Zoning for staff. Rectangle zoning feels clunky, able to edit a zone but very clunky.\n-Track building can feel a little weird, can currently only edit track at the 'front' (annoying if you've made a mistake or want to tweak something as you have to bulldoze). \n-Rollercoaster types are nothing you haven't seen in other games.\n-Not sure the guest needs balance is quite right, I noticed in scenario editor there's an option to say whether guests will be easily satisfied needs wise or not but in the general sandbox they seem to need drinks all the effin time pretty much forcing me in a more or less empty park to build drinks every 5 or 6 squares, which seems ludicrous to me. Interestingly they don't need the toilet often.\n\nWhat I'd like to see;\nImprovements in zoning. \n-For staff efficiency my mechanics are generally going to cover a larger zone than my handymen or haulers, being able to set individual zones by specific staff member different to the blanket zone, or for example be able to zone each type of staff individually (Handymen have their own zoning, mechanics their own, etc)\n-Would be nice if a supply depot on the cusp of zone1 and 2 could serve both (with 1 hauler being set to zone 1, 1 hauler being set to zone 2). If this is implemented I don't think it worked.\n-An option to select between brush zoning and rectangle zoning. I'm sorry, zoning is my main issue with the game as is.\n\nNot having to only edit the coaster at the front of the track (very infuriating).\n\nRide cam\n-Yes, there is a mod, but I think incorporating this would be a nice addition. It's the only part of RCT3 I enjoyed and can while away some time waiting for some cash to roll in.\n\nBetter reporting\nFeel it can be much improved!\n\nMore rides, more shops, more, more!

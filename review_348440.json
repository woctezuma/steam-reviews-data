But this game immediately reinvigorated my interest in the series and is easly the best installment so far.\n\nWhile the core gameplay remains the same, this game features a new look, from the reworked and much improved menus to the various tilesets. The amount of content included has significantly expanded. Not only are there a lot more regular levels, the developers also added 24 hidden levels. There are dozens of new mechanics which gradually introduce a diversity so far unseen in the series. Levels never feel same-y or boring due to various new blocks, bubbles, mechanics and goals.\n\nThere have been several fixes of old annoyances when it comes to menu handling and transitions. The progression is very gentle and captivating and better balanced than either predecessor. The sound effects are great. The keyboard handling is as solid as ever. I've never had any kind of technical problems.\n\nThe game also introduces a melancholic storyline told in voice-over for the first time. I didn't much care for it and I feel it didn't add anything to the game. It just felt out of place and shoe-horned in. The initial load time including splash and title screens is very long for such a simple puzzle game and started to annoy me over time, but that's pretty much the only downside I can come up with.\n\nIf you want to buy only one Quell game, make it this. I do recommend picking up the trilogy collection, but there is no denying that Memento is the pinnacle. It has the most content, is the most visually appealing and stylish, is better balanced, more diverse and over-all the most enjoyable game of the series so far.

As Scotty said in \"The Search for Spock:\"\n\n\"The more they overthink the plumbing, the easier it is to stop up the drain.\"\n\nAnd that's what happened here.  \"Quell\" was mostly fine with just a bit that was too complex (the green dots).  \"Quell Reflect\" added a few more things and made many of the puzzles too complex.  I considered it borderline OK.  With \"Quell Memento,\" the developer added many more behaviors.  Some are fine, but a few of them just gum up the works.  If he had just left the puzzles as interesting and pleasing, I'd have been happy.

alone adds enough variety and extra challenge and there are other new things as well. instead of 84+4 levels, now there are 144 plus 24 hidden ones, and more of a story than in the previous games, but it's still not really worth mentioning.\n\nyou can look at the trilogy as one long game cut into three parts. nothing wrong with that, it's a really enjoyable experience and if you've played the previous ones, there's no reason not to play memento as well, especially with all the new stuff. the only gripe I have is that the objectives aren't displayed at the beginning of the levels and checking what color the blocks have to be requires some extra keypresses or clicking (the goal is usually blue anyway), and you can't readily access the hidden levels you've found, only by going to

Since it also boasts an actual story (do what you want with it), it just feels like the first two were prototypes and this is the real game they wanted to build.\n\nI would like to insist on the puzzle designs. Memento slowly introduces many, many new mechanics over the entire game, and never forgets to add a few tutorial puzzles, which also give you breathing room after some harsher earlier stages. But it never tries to impose these new mechanics on you -- sometimes it'll just abandon them after a few puzzles, because the game simply wants to surprise you; it doesn't try to force mechanics that don't make sense into a particular puzzle.\n\nYou can feel that the developers had a lot of fun creating the levels, and hopefully you'll have just as much fun discovering them.

Some of them work well but many of them don't. Some just add complexity, but not in a good way. It's easy to make an puzzle game with every increasing complexity that is hard to solve. The tricky part is designing something relatively simple, yet so clever that solving it is a challenge.\n\nQuell Memento isn't a bad game, but the first one was much better, so there was no need to make Memento. If you're desperate for some more Quell levels after completing the first two games, then Memento might be for you, otherwise I would suggest giving it a miss.", "timestamp_created": 1452033280, "timestamp_updated": 1452033280, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.460990", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20120762": {"recommendationid": "20120762", "author": {"steamid": "76561198208078171", "num_games_owned": 356, "num_reviews": 231, "playtime_forever": 339, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451615190}, "language": "english", "review": "Good puzzle game. It's actually quite difficult and has multiple additions from the first game.  If you played the first one and thought it was a bit to easy and are wary of getting this one, don't worry: this one has some pretty challenging puzzles in it. \n\nJust like the first one you collect pearls to beat the level and there's random hidden gems in blocks you'll have to smash your ball in to to get. I hate the gem thing and used a guide to get a good amount of them because I think it's stupid to have hidden stuff like that in puzzle games. I'm playing a puzzle game, not a smash my ball into every block simulator.\n\nThis game adds multiple unique ways puzzles have to be completed unlike regular quell though.\n-light up all the blocks to adds certain color\n-light up all the diamonds with your light rays\n-a weird gold pearl that turns your ball gold and mostly screws with level completion for various reasons\n-moving a red ball simultaneously with your blue ball (red balls kill)\n-there's hidden levels with hidden items in some levels. They follow the same unlocking procedure as the gems, so I hate them\n\nAll in all, just ignore the gems and you've got yourself a nice little puzzle game on your hands.

Some of the things it includes with the two previous Quell games are the amazing level of polish, and the spectacular soundtrack. This game also retains the challenging puzzle aspect of the other games, but manages to add so much new content that it feels like a whole new world.\n\nIn Quell Reflect several new mechanics had been added over the original game, Quell Memento takes those mechanics and multiplies them three-fold. Adding in whole new puzzle types, and at least a half dozen new mechanics, this game is a whole new experience on the old puzzle game we\u2019ve all grown to love.\n\nIt just takes to the second shelf before you start seeing some of the major new mechanics (Illumination), and it does not take long until you start seeing why these can be so challenging!\n\nAnother aspect new to Quell Memento, and one of its strongest components is that the game has added a sort of storyline to it. For the first time in the series the game has a voice over that talks as you reach new stages. This story helps put the entire Quell series into perspective, and gives the game a life of its own. When I first played Quell Memento I was truly touched when I reached the end.\n\nThe Quell series is truly spectacular, and I cannot recommend these games enough, Quell Memento is the final installment in the series, and if you\u2019ve played either of the others, you owe it to yourself to pick this game up today.\n", "timestamp_created": 1431628028, "timestamp_updated": 1431628028, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.686163", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 69, "total_negative": 2, "total_reviews": 71}}

Right now i'm in 5.9 hours in game and game is still rising it's tension and getting to top point. I still couldnt reach to top point in story but driving story, mystery and characters make me keep going without any boredom. \n\nSecond thing i want to mention is this game is different from other VN's where you choose the action you want to do. In this game you have senses sympathy system, and before important decisions you have to decide who will you trust? Who will you listen? Game let you know everytime an important scene is ahead by showing you SSS wheel. By putting your SSS point to certain characters you can change your actions, your dialogues and overall story. I want to give an example which contain spoiler if you dont want to see it please pass : \n\n[spoiler] At certain scene teacher run off without her AD(which keeps you safe from radiation)  to save her students, while you and other survives rush her help stairs starts crumbling and falling, and at that point game asks you to make decision, you either put your sympathy points on teacher which makes you follow her, but you fall from stairs and die. Or you put sympathy points on your teammates who warn you to dont go and you back down to safety. [/spoiler]\n\nI must say that i really liked different approach they took with SSS but my only problem with it you dont always understand in which scene you have to put it. I was late for few scenes because i waited to understand what's going on and sometimes it took story to entirely different way from what i thought. Thankfully this only happened when it's blue, which is not fatal. In 6 hours i didnt encounter any orange-fatal- scenes where it passed it, they always let you know you're at last dialogue before SSS wheel dissappear.\n\nOverall recommend this game to VN lovers.", "timestamp_created": 1516305363, "timestamp_updated": 1516305363, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39295182": {"recommendationid": "39295182", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025232147", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1900, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 437, "last_played": 1515901790}, "language": "english", "review": "tl;dr: Highly recommended for the first 10-15 hours, recommended with some qualifications for the rest of the play-time.  \n\nRoot Double begins by giving you a choice between two routes. The default choice is route A(fter), which starts you off in the middle of a dangerous situation and gives you a good dozen hours of intense (for a VN) drama. You watch from the perspective of Watase, a rescue worker, as he and his fellow survivors struggle to escape a catastrophic laboratory accident. This route feels tailored to players who prefer action/horror VNs; its bad ends are violent, plentiful, and sometimes difficult to see coming, and there's a sense of distrust and paranoia among the cast. The other choice is route B(efore), which gives you the lead-up to, and early hours of, this accident from the perspective of Natsuhiko: a teen boy who spends his days with his gaggle of lady friends but who suddenly finds himself responsible for averting a disaster. Route B seems like it would appeal more to people who enjoy slice-of-life and romance VNs; its pace is slower, with fewer choices and relatively predictable outcomes, and while the events of route A loom in the future, this route devotes a lot of time to its protagonist's everyday life and childhood memories.\n\nThere's a reason why Root Double's action is split between two (often overlapping) perspectives: one of the game's major messages is that empathy is a vital human characteristic, and that our well-being depends on our ability to consider situations from other people's perspectives. At the same time, the perspective split is kind of poorly implemented. I have no idea why the developers decided to let you choose between the routes, because that element of choice seems just to have made the pacing of this VN a bit of a mess. Starting with B means that you'll benefit from a gradual ramp-up of the action and a much more straightforward approach to the decision-making system, but you're also thrown into a sometimes painfully generic romance VN situation (complete with branches that depend on saying the right thing to your lady companions). Route B also straight-up spoils many of route A's twists and carefully-paced revelations. Starting with A, meanwhile, is what I'd recommend, but doing so means that you'll finish reading that route feeling excited to learn what's going on, but then you'll spend another dozen or so hours reading a story about a bunch of goofy anime teens. The poor pacing of route B is all the more noticeable after route A, especially because B forces you to scroll through long-winded and repetitive explanations of the game's sci-fi concepts after route A has already given you an adequate understanding of them. The game's subsequent routes--which are unlocked after you finish A and B--clear up all of the mysteries established in the earlier ones, but they also suffer from a similar sense of repetitiveness. I hope you like examining the same books and reading the same pieces of dialogue and watching the same events play out multiple times with slight variations...\n\nEndings in this game are reached through the choices you make using the \"Senses Sympathy\" decision-making system.  At first, this system feels unnecessarily obtuse: choices that are often simple binaries are made using sliders that represent each of the 9 major characters. Deciding to pair up with character y, for instance, means setting their slider higher than that of character x at a branching point; trusting character z means setting their slider to the highest value.  The slider for your viewpoint character is a little more complicated, especially in route A, because its meaning can change depending on the context.  Setting it low or high can indicate (to give a few examples) whether you defer to someone else's judgement or go with your own, meekly accept criticism or stand up for yourself, question your abilities or feel confident in them, or refuse to pay attention or remain alert. The issue is that it's not always clear which of these possibilities is the relevant one in a given scene, which can lead to some frustrating bad ends when your protagonist acts in an unexpected way. The good news is that the game auto-saves at every decision point and, if you leave them turned on, the tips that appear after bad ends will usually give you a clear indication as to how you can achieve a better outcome. Initially, I found this system frustrating, but as the story went on and its plot relevance became clearer, I came to appreciate it. In the end, I think its thematic value outweighs its occasional moments of clunkiness.\n  \nI don't have much to say about the art and music in Root Double: they exist and are inoffensive. The backgrounds are serviceable but the game's primary setting (a big lab filled with interconnected rooms and staircases, all with mostly identical designs) conveniently allows for a lot of re-use of assets. The character portraits are expressive enough, but the style in which the female characters are drawn, in particular, sometimes feels a little too cute for the intense situations these characters are dropped into. The music is always well-suited to the situation, but the soundtrack suffers a little from a lack of variety: you'll hear almost every track in the game early on in your playthrough. Nothing is grating in this production, but nothing really stands out, either.\n\nIf it seems as though I'm lukewarm on Root Double, it's probably because this is a good game with an even better one hiding under a mountain of text that's very well-localized but which could have used some more editing. If you're familiar with and enjoy Takumi Nakazawa's VNs (or you're into other games, like the Zero Escape series, that share some of those games' DNA), you'll know what to expect here, and you'll almost certainly like it.

There are issues. See below for details.***\n\nRoot Double is a visual novel in the style of the classic Ever17, with some similarities to works like Steins;Gate or 999: Nine Hours, Nice Persons, Nine Doors. At its core its a classic thriller scenario: Some people are trapped and are likely to die unless they find their way out. But like the aforementioned VNs, its heart and soul is in both the heavy science-fiction elements of its plot and the writing of character relationships. If you've read or played some of those, you know roughly what to expect: A fun and suspenseful story that reveals its layers to you over time, until suddenly you're hip deep in mind-blowing sci-fi mechanics and hidden motives and terrible truths. Its great fun! \n\nUnfortunately, Root Double is a slow burner. There is a LOT of exposition. And while its complex science-fiction ideas do merit more exposition than usual, this VN really just gets bogged down. Explanations last far longer than necessary for the viewer to understand things, and they're repeated, sometimes quite frequently, as you play the different routes. \n\nThe way the player makes decisions is also needlessly obfuscated with a complex system involving gradations of \"positive feelings\" that the protagonists have towards other people. In many cases, it can be hard to tell what a particular level of positivity even indicates. In some situations the protagonist will agree with a character, in others they'll disagree with them because they want to protect them, in yet others seemingly nothing will happen at all. Its confusing and kinda pointless.\n\nI found the characters fairly hit or miss. Some feel like 90s anime stereotypes whose voice acting grates painfully against your skull. Others are reasonably intriguing, even endearing. None of them are fantastic sadly, and the portrayal of female characters errs towards patronizing (what should be powerful and capable female characters are sidelined in various ways to let the male heroes lead the way). But if you do like them, you'll love the sheer depth given to how their backstories all interweave in interesting ways.\n\nThe plot itself is fairly good. Route A is suspenseful and intriguing. Route B is dull, but somehow servicably manages to get you to care about a new set of characters. The remaining routes unlocked after those two are really interesting (though sometimes so heavy on exposition that they feel like they overstay their welcome), and the twists, while more predictable than I'd like, were satisfying. It does suffer from moralizing a particular point of view that (I suspect) resonates worse with western audiences than it did with the original Japanese one. [spoiler]Characters whose goals were to defeat a heinous evil organization (LABO) are portrayed as misguided or even evil, simply because their plan was against the law and could have resulted in casualties among LABOs staff. Even though their plan took an absurd degree of care to avoid casualties.[/spoiler] \n\nOverall, decent. It never reaches the mindblowing emotional heights of Steins;Gate or 999, and it feels like a bit of a retread of Ever17, but it still manages to stand on its own as an exciting story.", "timestamp_created": 1514775293, "timestamp_updated": 1514855718, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38440218": {"recommendationid": "38440218", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084556418", "num_games_owned": 494, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 3940, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513722019}, "language": "english", "review": "Length : About 65 hours\n\nSo, as stated just above, it's a very long VN. And it's fully voiced by talented people.\nThe overall quality is very good and the music was nice too. \nWhile reading it, the setting and the ambience kinda reminded me of Ever 17. With more fire and less water.\n\nThe story is an adventure/mystery kind and it's separated into four sections plus a bonus one (\u221aAfter, \u221aBefore, \u221aCurrent, \u221aDouble and Extend Episode). Only two episodes are available at first, and the others get unlocked one by one once you finish those. \n\nI began with \u221aAfter first, then jumped to \u221aBefore but I'm not sure I would forcefully recommend on doing the same. \nLet me explain :\n\n\u221aAfter is an adventure-mystery story following a rescue worker named Kasasagi Watase who's dispatched on a disaster scene and suffers a loss of memory due to some event. You more or less begin the game just after that and thus go into the story while being completely blind, both the protagonist and you the reader.\n\n\u221aBefore on the other hand is slice of life-ish and shows the days before the disaster from the point of view of Tenkawa Natsuhiko, a high-schooler, and his close friends. It's slow and peaceful compared to \u221aAfter and introduces the characters from the other group of survivors whom you don't really meet during the first episode.\n\nSo, reading \u221aAfter, then \u221aBefore is the intended order [b]but[/b] the very nature of \u221aBefore slows down greatly the rythm of the story and can make the reading a bit painful after the fast-paced non-stop action of the last part of \u221aAfter that ends on a cliffhanger. And also, since \u221aBefore is all about people you know nothing about since you only got a glimpse of them during \u221aAfter, you're not compelled to know about them at this point. \n\nOn the other hand, going \u221aBefore -> \u221aAfter [b]would spoil[/b] lots of things in \u221aAfter, plus making the amnesia gimmick lose its shine since it would be reduced to a plot point rather than a way to introduce the reader into the story [b]but[/b] would make the pacing of the story a whole lot better and painless.\n\nSo I still recommend the order in which it's presented to you but it can be a hurdle for some people; I think I'm an avid reader but even for me, it took me multiple sessions to go through \u221aBefore. I couldn't read it in just two sessions like I did for \u221aAfter. Really, that's the greatest negative point of this VN.\n\nAfter that, you get the \u221aCurrent episode. Then the \u221aDouble. It's hard to talk about them without spoilers but to summarize, \u221aCurrent is the joint adventure of Kasasagi and Tenkawa (it's a bit on the short side) and \u221aDouble is the second half of the game, with all the revelations, climaxes and endings where everything comes together.\n\nOn a side note, it took me 44 hours to reach what felt like the real opening.\n\nWhat about the Extend Episode ? It's a bonus containing some recaps of things you already read, with additionnal scenes. It's unlocked after witnessing the true ending and it's also the very last piece of the puzzle. \n\nSo, do I recommend it ? Yes.

Now, is the writing in this game as good as its predecessors? I'd say no: the core concept is great, but the scenarios themselves are rather average. The science-fiction this time around is rather weak as well: there may come a point in time when you will ask yourself when exactly the \"science\" part of \"sci-fi\" departed the story and left you with just \"fiction\", the contrived kind that serves simply to conveniently advance the plot.\n\nThe art and sound aren't anything to write home about. I'm not a fan of the character art style nor the backgrounds. The usage and quality of the sound effects are poor in general, and the BGM is mediocre at best. However the voice acting is quite good; Megumi Toyoguchi and Akane Tomonaga, both of whom had roles in Remember11, lend a hand here. The former reprises her role as the b*tchy young professional, while the latter smashes the role of the fang-flashing genki girl.\n\nIs Root Double as well written, concise, or memorable as its predecessors?

Some people (for example: me) see VN more like interactive books or something closer to interactive theater rather than video game. It\u2019s popular in Japan and slowly getting popularity from western audience. What it might be surprising for some people is pricing of games like this. Pricing of top VN might be close to AAA titles what could surprise players unfamiliar  with this genre. If you never played/read VN before I can assure you that this title is good place to start. Just make sure that you start playing [b][u]Root After[/u][/b] first. Root Before answers some of the questions in Root After at the very beginning and you want to avoid that.\n\nRoot Double -Before Crime * After Days was the VN title that surprised me the most (in positive way, of course)At this moment it holds 3rd place in my VN ranking together with Ever17. To be honest, in my opinion this title should be little higher in VNDB ranking. \n\nWhen you start the game you are waking up into world in year 2030 at LABO, a giant scientific research facility built by a lake on the outskirts of Rokumei City where an incident occurs. In result you are trapped inside this facility and You will be facing lots of dangers. You will be playing as Watase Kasagi an amnesiac rescue captain and you have to survive during lockdown. After clearing this route you will play as Natsuhiko Tenkawa as he goes through incidents as well as his life the week before we get to know more about this future world and why certain things are happening inside the LABO. \n\nStory itself is well-written, there are interesting twists, developing characters, lots of endings - 39 (bad, normal, good) with impressively executed final route. This VN could read even someone who is not interested in that kind of games. I even think that RD makes a great first VN.\n\nAt the beginning I explained more or less how VN looks like and what is unique in Root Double that there is no \u201canswers\u201d which players select. Instead you will be using Senses Sympathy System (SSS). During the gameplay you will have to make a choice how much you trust each character and this choice will affect the direction of the game.\n\nThe visual production value of Root Double is top-quality. Sprites, CGs and backgrounds all look great and visual effects are put to good use frequently. Music is also good quality but it lacks some memorable tracks.\n\nVery few productions feature the number of intriguing mysteries and revelations hidden within its depths and it takes the time to get them all but I found that time definitely worth it\n\nPros:\n[list]\n[*]Great story for anybody,\n[*]Interesting characters that develop during the game,\n[*]Well-designed art (Sprites, CGs and background),\n[*]Multiple endings with great executed final route,\n[/list]\n\nCons:\n[list]\n[*]SSS is unique but may confuse players.\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1509488655, "timestamp_updated": 1516105879, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548872", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36052328": {"recommendationid": "36052328", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970296271", "num_games_owned": 398, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 4829, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509134724}, "language": "english", "review": "This one is a pretty high quality mystery novel that opens up and transforms piece by piece as you progress in the story.\n\nDo note that this is both character building/interaction- and exposition-heavy story. Writer does admirable attempt at fleshing out the world and characters and the way it differs from our own. You will either like this approach or not. For me it was fine for most part. YMMV, you've been warned.\n\nNovel is divided in five parts, of which only two are open for reading initially (After, Before, Current, Double and Xtend). Play completely through episode \"After\" first, even though logically and chronologically it would seem better to read \"Before\" first. It's not, just trust me on this.\n\nVoice acting is one of the highlights here, as it is both high quality and all dialogue is voiced. This is also a pretty long story, so as long as you like the subject matter you will get your \"money's worth\" for sure. I'd say you'll spend at least 50 hours if you actually listen the dialogue. I'd say it took about 65 to get through the main stuff and then few more hours poking around for different endings and Xtend extras.\n\nI recommend this VN for any fan of light science fiction and mystery stories.", "timestamp_created": 1509127619, "timestamp_updated": 1509127619, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551282", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36035898": {"recommendationid": "36035898", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137109739", "num_games_owned": 190, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 2234, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509084108}, "language": "english", "review": "Long visual novel with lot of death flag.\nThe After Route is great but the Before Route is boring but give you in depth knowlodge about the lore.\n\n\n\n\nPS: You must get Good Ending in After Route to unlock the 3rd route", "timestamp_created": 1509090942, "timestamp_updated": 1509090942, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35914131": {"recommendationid": "35914131", "author": {"steamid": "76561198198865842", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 2598, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510671648}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros : \n1 graphic, visual, music, voice acting amazing\n2. story line twisted \n3. full of emotion\n\nCons : \n1. can be confusing to complete 100%\n2. need to replay again and again if you make mistake\n3. ending may not be satisfying depend on your principle", "timestamp_created": 1508661036, "timestamp_updated": 1508661036, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35842471": {"recommendationid": "35842471", "author": {"steamid": "76561198338524247", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2159, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508428271}, "language": "english", "review": "The story it was good, but i don't really like any characters, CGs not bad, Root After it was good, but Root Before it was sooooooooo boring, other things will be spoillers,  7/10.", "timestamp_created": 1508428147, "timestamp_updated": 1508428147, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35831679": {"recommendationid": "35831679", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995106975", "num_games_owned": 191, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2764, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499536103}, "language": "english", "review": "soo sooo good would also find out truth again/10", "timestamp_created": 1508384180, "timestamp_updated": 1508384180, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35701840": {"recommendationid": "35701840", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039869009", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2940, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498965013}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like visual novels with a deep story this game is for you.", "timestamp_created": 1507930712, "timestamp_updated": 1507930712, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35608763": {"recommendationid": "35608763", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005507216", "num_games_owned": 297, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1327, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507569065}, "language": "english", "review": "For those unfamiliar, visual novels are, true to their name, a crossbreed of novels and a visual medium. Think of it as a play with still pictures instead of actors: characters have dialogues, monologues, and non-verbal interactions between each other, all depicted with anime styled drawings, full voice acting, sound effects, and background music. It is a popular medium in Japan and is slowly getting more popular in the west. \n\nRoot Double is an exceptional visual novel. At a research institude dubbed the Laboratory of Atomic and Biological Organization (LABO for short), multiple explosions occured, leading to a mass evacuation while a research team rushes in. Shortly, a lockdown order was issued in the fear of a nuclear meltdown while nine lives remain trapped inside. Dead bodies with gunshot wounds, people who shouldn't be there, there seems to be a lot of mystery surrounding the LABO explosions and lockdown, and it's one of the things that drew me in. \n\nI felt Root Double is about 60% sci-fi and 40% mystery. While it could be seen as a closed circle who-dun-it, it's better to not treat it as such. The mystery is more about circumstances of each character and how they reached LABO, rather than how the dead bodies came about. Everything is well foreshadowed, which contributes to the best part of Root Double: its writing. The other big piece of its excellent writing is its world building (with believable \"science\" rules), which attributes to the sci-fi nature of this visual novel. \n\nWhile writing, voice acting, art, and music is all excellent, pacing issues prevents it from getting a perfect 10.

Ofc you can try to figure out every little possibility by yourself but i highly recommend a guide (not at first or even second playthrough, but when you feel like you dont want to fail all the time anymore).\nBecause there unfold so many further aspects of the story with every additional playthrough (or better said: route) I took.\nFirst time I didnt even see half of the important chars, then I saw them and understood their connections, afterwards it comes out that they had even deeper connections then you thought they would have and so its a really joyful ride to find everything out this game has to offer.\n\nI highly recommend it, cause of its incredible story (including so many different routes and outcomes to experience), its vivid characters and also technically speaking full japanese audio and skipping options.\n\nThe only bad about it is, that i repeats itself many times.....more precisely i mean this: (Keeping in mind you can always skip scenes you have already read up to that point where you havent) You play a scene with one unimportant decision, then, second try, you make the other decision. Ends up, that just one character say one other word, but everything else stays exactly the same. But since its another scene you cannot simply skip that \"already read\" part.\nOther example: You get to see many scenes from multiple perspectives. And also here some perspectives are simply not relevant and simply boring, But since every third sentences is \"Oh i think this looks great\" you cannot skip it either. Dont get me wrong you can basically skip anything.

[i]At least if you are interested in story.[/i] Relatively setting, I think, I shouldn't repeat description entirely, but try to remark the merits instead.\nThe plot is narrated through several (mostly the featured two) protagonists, revealing it from multiple angles, that are good at supplementing each other if you read the roots at alphabetic sequence. Not all of them are equally good, moreover some are written supplemental intentionally. Story isn't complicated enough to dumbfound reader completely, but it manages to keep tension and intrigue well. Lots of details come in engrossing rate together as parts of exciting aggregation.\n\nWithout spoilers I could say, that SF part is rather hard and thorough. Especially the first chapter is laden with plethora of such details, for multiple facts even an ingame encyclopedia is given. Also in game's setting [spoiler]telepathy[/spoiler] somehow resembles Rifters trilogy without marine attributes. \nSomeones might disagree, but I'd like to say that featured SSSystem, which around gameplay is built, is good at making choise input more subtle, than ordinary line picking (but also can complicate branching).\n\nVisual style is typical for mikeou and is rather unexpected to be found in non moe vn. Contribution of lip animations is substantial. In addition to them, sound is just perfect, voice acting of each character grasps after half a dozen phrases and represents it's owner individually. Accordingly, all characters are written to have personal speech habits and even with sound-off many lines are good at representing situation and mood. Moreover, disclosure of characters' individuality and their past, which define the story, provides reader with at least half of overall experience.\n\nAs a bad trait I could touch multiple narrative approach toward the same situations, that protracts seriously (esp. the extra episode, half of which can be easily put down), although, it also helps to memorize the story (or at least current chapter) wholly and, since the skip option is present, it's not significant in repeated reading.\nConsidering the plot, majority of bad endings aren't important, but they end up with narrative impasse quickly after wrong choises, hereby this flaw could be considered as just a method to create atmosphere of danger.

I've had quite a few sleepless nights playing through the game, especially during Routes A, C and D.  You take control of 2 characters throughout the story.  Kasasagi Watase is the main character of Route A.  He is a Rescue Worker called in to save the workers of LABO after several explosions threaten a nuclear meltdown.  The other character you control is Tenkawa Natsuhiko who is a school student, Communicator, and that gets trapped in LABO during the incident.\n\nIt's highly recommended you play through Route A first since you have access to both A and B are the start even though Route A takes places after Route B chronologically.  Route A has lots of action and choices involved to keep everything interesting.  You will root for certain characters, then hope they die, then root for them again.  Go into the game without trying to disect the plot and predict what happens.  There are certain parts where it's easy to do this, but I feel it's better if you don't.\n\nRoute B is the \"Backstory\" or \"Before Crime\" route.  It takes place about a week before Route A and gives a lot of insight into the powers that Communicators have.  It drags on a bit in certain spots which can put a damper on the pacing when comparing it to Route A.  Power through it because the last couple chapters of Route B make up for it a lot.\n\nRoute C is a recap of Route A in the perspective of both characters.\n\nRoute D takes place after Route A, also in the perspective of both characters as they work together to escape LABO and not die in the process.  \n\nIt's a fantastic VN that I feel does not disappoint.  The only bad part was the slog of Route B, but it's necessary to learn about Communicators and more about the city they live in.  It has a fair amount of twists and turns and knows how to keep things interesting.  There are definitely a lot of sh*t VNs out there, but this is one I can easily recommend.  I don't usually play VNs if they aren't over 30 hours because I \"like to get my moneys worth\".  This game can easily take you 50 hours to play through.

The overall plot was good from the beginning to the end, I was immersed into the story and the pacing. \n\nThe story of this game is good to great, some aspect like the slice of life and the intense atmosphere had me reading through the entire visual novel.

These questions were constant throughout and it does its job with the vn to make you unaware of the truth.\n\nHowever, that's where things falls flat. As it's surface it was well done but at the middle part to the end of the visual novel, I personally found it to be rather slow and got to the point where I found it annoying to read. Some endings were not good at all and some may fall much lower to the great experience of the vn. I personally found the latter half to be more of a slow feast compared to the beginning only towards the ending yet that's another 25 hours to read through. \n\nThis visual novel doesn't explain what the choices are at all beside one beginning of the tutorial and you are left questioning what the value of the Senses Sympathy System (choice system) is.

Listening to it on is own doesn\u2019t give you the same feeling as playing through the vn which gives you more of the punch that it needs.\n\nIf you don't mind something that will make you question and think alongside a VN that make you question itself but a thrilling adventure than I would recommend it to you.

How to explain Root Double...\n\nRoot Double is a thriller/drama about a fictional event in a research facility that went completely awry on September 16th 2030. You initially view the events unfolding through the eyes of Watase, currently an amnesiac, who must slowly piece together what is going on and how to escape from a nightmare of fire and radioactivity. There is no 18+ patch and no sexual content, but there is a fair amount of violence, so be warned.\n\nThe story is told through the perspectives of multiple different characters, and there is no singular protagonist. Furthermore, the story departs a little bit from traditional choice-based visual novels; you may control the story and its outcome, but you do so through an odd system, the Sense system. The Sense sysem will activate whenever a special moment happens in the story, allowing you to control the character's sense of confidence in others, including themselves. One you have set their 'Sense', the story will proceed, and they will make a decision based on what their Sense level is. In order to control the decisions of the character, you must toy with the Sense menu, instilling extra faith in anyone who seems to have a good idea worth following - many times, it is correct to lower your own character's confidence in themselves to prevent them from being brash and getting themselves killed.\n\nAND OH BOY DO THEY GET KILLED. If you don't like blood and violence in your writing (electronic or otherwise), stay away from Root Double. This isn't a 'romance' VN full of cat girls and bath scenes, this VN's a bloody drama-turned-tragedy. When you're trying to figure how to lead the characters through this horrible mess of panic and terror as you try to avoid radioactive death.\n\nThe confusion is part of the fun though. The writing in Root Double is very thorough, with everything shockingly thought out from start to finish. If something happens and you don't understand why, it's because you don't have the full picture yet. However, the further you progress, the more pieces you have to put together, and the story slowly begins to make sense. If you really start to get into the story, you might even begin to start figuring out things on your own before the story spells it out, and figuring out the mystery that is LABO.\n\nOne criticism I do have with the story is its tendency to replay scenes. Since you will be viewing the story from the perspective of multiple characters, there is overlap where things get re-explained, and the action slows down. If you're invested, this won't be a problem, but some might be put off by the tendency for the story's tendency to retell the same events from a different character's perspective again and again. It -is- critical to understanding the story, and it does show just how thorough the authors were in contructing the story piece by piece to make sure no plothole was left unplugged, but I can say it can distract from getting to the meat of the story. Otherwise, the world building is spot on - the story is consistent, but explains itself bit by bit, and the supernatural elements aren't dumped on you right at the start, giving you time to learn and understand them as they are progressively introduced.\n\nWhat is fantastic however is the depth and breadth of each character. They all have their own reasons for having ended up where they are, whether they intended to or not. The story plays on the themes of minds and memories, and each character's past outlines their motives and purpose for being there on the day of the accident, from their boring every day lives to the present conflict.\n\nHow to actually enjoy Root Double is up to you. I found that Root Double's tendency to retell its stories from different perspectives combined with its sheer length made it more pleasant to read in small bits, rather than trying to chomp down on an entire arc in one sitting. Many stories are better read in a short span of time so that you don't start forgetting bits of the story, but this doesn't hold true for Root Double which is better to read over a longer course of time. It's also not incorrect to read this using a walkthrough; there are some spoiler-light walkthroughs that tell you how to get to an ending without telling you exactly what happens, and this is one VN where I wouldn't consider it totally wrong to use a walkthrough.

Yes, though the VN's complexity and mature themes lends itself to a higher age group than your standard run-of-the-mill VN.

This made the game easier to play in multiple settings as opposed to other VNs which many people should be thankful for. On the other hand, it makes the game tedious to marathon, but that's easily resolved with holding skip. There is also the Extend episode, which was required for the true end previously, but they moved it to the extras section since it was tedious to go through a bunch of old scenes in a route that had a number of flashbacks anyway.\n\nMaybe because I've played a fair number of visual novels, but the twists that came up were somewhat expected compared to others. The story is tightly written, so any odd detail is bound to show up later in the story as rather important. Whether or not you enjoy it is up to the reader, but personally I enjoyed having to connect the information together and guess a little of what happens next.\n\nThe thing that impressed me the most was how they used the scientific principles fairly well.

So other than the obvious artistic liberties they took, I was glad that the scientists and experiments they mentioned were at least valid. I learned a lot more than I expected about fire safety too.\n\nI was not a big fan of how the options worked, since I wasn't too sure how high or low I needed to set the baseline value.

It is unusual and suspenseful. The game goes out of its way to be unusual...but that may or may not work for the average gamer. Still, the game has some amazing moments if you can have the patience to reach them.\n\nPros [/b]\n\n+ A very interesting and suspenseful story\n+ Great voice acting (in Japanese), music, and sound effects\n+ A unique concept for a visual novel\n+ High production values make this visual novel have a quality that is not present in many visual novels on Steam\n+ Layers upon layers of plot exist in a VERY complicated and intricate system of twists and turns\n\n[b] Cons [/b]\n\n- The Enneagram concept is interesting but it really doesn't work as a system of making choices in a visual novel. The maker of the game chose to force the concept into the game in many places where a more conventional method of choice making would have made FAR more sense to the gamer.\n\n- The game should have provided better hints as to the cause and consequences for choices. Sometimes, a choice should not result in a positive response from the people involved. (No response is okay sometimes, in other words.) Othertimes, the gamer must find the exact right way of making the given choice so that a positive effect occurs.\n\n- The +1 and -1 signs that appear next to the Enneagram disappear FAR too fast given the interesting and suspenseful storyline. I have reloaded saves many times because by the time I am through reading a couple of sentences relating to the choice that was made, the +1 and -1 signs have disappeared. What this means is that the gamer must reload game saves until both the + and - results and the text results from the choice are all written down in some kind of document the gamer must use to determine what the best course of action really is.\n\n- The translation is off in places. In one place, Yuuri says \"hai\", which means \"yes\". The game translates \"hai\" as \"no\", which ends up being confusing for people that don't have at least a very small vocabulary of the spoken Japanese language. Overall, the translation is good, but this novel could use a bit of polishing in the translation.\n\n[b] Debatable [/b]\n\n? So many visual novels have many good endings. It would not have been hard for the game maker to put more than two good endings into the game. But the game maker decided to put a great deal of effort into long and detailed bad endings. This may or may not work for you as a gamer.\n\n? This game has a great many choices that the gamer must make. And the effects of those choices may not be felt for several hours of gameplay. The effects of most of the choices in the game are cumulative. This is why I said that the gamer should take detailed notes as the game progresses. The gamer is expected to keep track of the cumulative effect of the many choices in the game if the gamer wants to see the best ending of the game without the use of a guide (and a few do exist in the Steam forums).\n\n? The game will have flashbacks within flashbacks while a VERY little time is passing in the real plot of the visual novel. This gets VERY tedious. You WILL need a great deal of patience to get through the flashbacks. They start in the B section of the novel, and they will drag on and on in the D section of the novel. By the time you are reading the D section of the novel, however, you will understand why the flashbacks are an integral part of the story. At that time (hopefully) you won't mind the flashbacks so much. But until then...plan on waiting a while.\n\n[b] My suggestions [/b]\n\n1) Buy the game on sale. While the visual novel has a high level of quality, the concept for the game's choice mechanism is a bit rough around the edges. The choice mechanism WILL make sense, but not until LONG after the gamer has had to make dozens of choices using that mechanism. Not all gamers have patience for that sort of thing.\n \n2) Play the game for a while without using a guide from the Steam forums. Try to get a feel for what the game maker wanted the gamer to experience. It's an interesting thought...but that thought could have been implemented MUCH better for a MUCH more satisfying effect. And that leads me to my next suggestion.\n\n3) Once you get one of the endings that tells you that character XYZ doesn't like the main character enough - OR - you start to get frustrated with the number of times you get the \"game over\" screen, start the game over and follow one of the Steam forum guides. There are different guides available for different play styles.\n\n[b] Conclusion [/b]\n\nRoot Double is worth your time...particularly when you know what you are getting into ahead of time. Put the game on your wishlist until the game goes on sale.\n\n[b] Tips [/b]\n\n1 - Do not expect that playing through the Root A part of the game is enough to get the good ending of the Root A part of the game. While Root A is meant to be played first, Root B completion is required to get the good ending of Root A. If Root B was not nearly as tedious with all the flashbacks, I would consider telling you to play it first. Perhaps that is why the developer of the game allows the user to pick which one to play first--it really is a choice for you to make.\n\nThat said, [spoiler] Save the game in Root A where Ena is holding a gun and Ujita and Jun are questioning whether or not Ena should even be carrying the gun. This is where you will need to pick up Root A after completing Root B. [/spoiler]\n\n2 - I have read that the xtend episode can be unlocked with the good end or the true (grand) end. I could only unlock xtend with the true end. And once I started playing xtend, I knew why. Therefore...\n\n[spoiler]\nSave the game once the Partner SSS choice comes up and DO NOT save over that game save.

It's an amazing mystery and thriller story. The characters are all great, distinct and their voiceovers are very well done. It explores lots of interesting themes and there is an amazing attention to detail in every regard. There is a lot of fictional (supernatural) science involved but every part of it is very well thought out and explained thoroughly which makes it very believable and plausible.\n\nI'm quite new to the world of visual novels. This is my fourth VN and so far I've read a couple of the best ones (Steins;Gate, Steins;Gate 0 and The Devil on G String) and I thought there were always some plot holes, inconsistencies or fairly unreasonable dei ex machina in all of them. But not in Root Double. The story is almost perfect and I don't think there are any unreasonable elements; everything has a reasonable explanation and subtle hints are present from the very beginning that can prod you to make theories about parts of this vast mystery before the truth is revealed.\n\nI have very few criticisms for Root Double. The story can drag a bit in some parts and suffers from overexposition, but I found the premise, characters and world engaging enough to enjoy those parts as well. Also, the choice system can be confusing and sometimes make the result of your choice the exact opposite of what you intended. It can take a lot of trial and error, time or the help of guides until you can reach the true ending.\n\nBut it's so very worth it.

If you are unfamiliar with the visual novel genre, there are some things you should know going in:\n\n1) Don't expect it to be a traditional \"game\" in that you can act upon the \"in-game world\" - you cannot. \n2) Don't expect to be able to impact the \"game\" much at all - everything in visual novels are completely scripted.\n3) Visual novels should be played for the thorough enjoyment of both the story as well as the entire experience.\n\nA visual novel is basically a regular novel, but on steroids. I've always loved reading, and perhaps some of the most incredible stories I have ever read have been visual novels due to the additional effects such as backgrounds, character artwork, sound effects, and most importantly... the soundtrack, which can drastically impact the mood and really creates the emotional atmosphere of the story as well as empathy towards the characters.\n\nSome of the best stories I've ever experienced were products of Japanese creators. Although many people might associate anime and visual novels with \"sex\" because, let's face it, they 'can' be used for those purposes, that's just really one extreme. The reality is that anime, and in this case visual novels, are just another platform, another medium, for delivering some of the greatest stories ever written to the hearts and minds of people everywhere.\n\nWith that said... let's get to the VN itself: [b]Root Double -Before Crime * After Days[/b].\n\nAs mentioned in other reviews, [b]Root Double[/b] was produced by Takumi Nakazawa, the creator of the Infinity Series. Ever 17 in particular is critically acclaimed as one of the greatest visual novels ever written. In Root Double, Nakazawa utilizes a lot of the same elements from Ever 17, but the way he applies them is entirely original and unique, much different from its predecessor. Both of them, however, are outstanding productions and well worth the experiences which in my opinion will never be forgotten.\n\nRoot Double belongs to the \u201ctrapped\u201d genre of visual novels, whereby the characters in the story find themselves stuck in some type of sticky situation and need to find their way out usually before disaster strikes, ending in most of their deaths. The novel consists of four routes: \u221aA (after), \u221aB (before), \u221aC (current \u2013 unlocked after the first two routes are completed), and \u221aD (double \u2013 unlocked once all routes are completed). Although the first two routes are both available from the start, they should [b]absolutely[/b] be played in chronological order. Each arc is told from a different perspective or viewpoint.\n\nThere are 39 different endings total throughout the four arcs, most of them bad, and they are almost all related to a certain \u201ctheme\u201d.\n\n\u221aA is the question arc, whereby the story poses a lot of questions to the reader as it progresses and everything seems unclear, or a mystery. Having a question arc where things don\u2019t necessarily all add up  dramatically increases the suspense of the story and greatly succeeds in building tension! While I was playing through \u221aA, I wasn\u2019t sure what was happening or why, but I was frantically trying to figure it out on the fly before the novel beat me to the explanations (saved for the later arcs). The story itself is very exciting and filled with drama, as lives are at stake and the threat of death is constantly looming at every step from multiple different outlets, whether it be the setting itself or even other characters! Multiple times throughout I had to pause and sit back and take a break because my heart was racing so fast from the tension and suspense. And while you\u2019re trying to figure out what\u2019s really going on, the game decides to fuck you over completely and turn in a completely unexpected direction. The plot twists were outstanding! At the end of the first arc, you\u2019re left with a feeling of helplessness and confusion, but more importantly thinking \u201cWHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT THAT WAS FUCKING AWESOME\u201d. Completely mind-blowing. The first arc has 17 bad endings, one good ending, and one normal ending: I\u2019d recommend definitely playing through both the normal and good endings (in that order) if nothing else. Both endings give different clues as to what might be occurring, and even some of the bad endings include helpful hints into the plot, as in learning more about other characters that you might not be interacting with in the two main endings. You might be thinking at this point\u2026 \u201cYeah, there\u2019s a thrilling story that\u2019s really cool, but does it all make sense?\u201d And yes, it\u2019s extremely easy to throw a bunch of crazy unrelated shit together and call it a story. But EVERYTHING in Root Double has a purpose, and it ALL ties together, as you\u2019ll find out. Every single question you might have from \u221aA and even in other arcs will be explained.\n\n\u221aB is the answer arc, whereby a lot of the confusion of the previous arc is cleared up. THIS BY NO MEANS EXPLAINS EVERYTHING, as even after \u221aB is complete, a lot is left unexplained. Rather\u2026 it gives a lot of insight into the background of some of the characters and why certain events may have occurred. \u221aB changes the perspective to a different main character that also is a part of the events that take place in \u221aA. And honestly, I\u2019d 100% consider the perspective of \u221aB as the \u201cmain character\u201d over Watase even though both of their perspectives are crucial to the plot: the story as a whole is more about the perspective of character \u221aB. I really enjoyed the execution of \u221aB with the story flipping back and forth between points in time both before and during the disaster \u2013 it helped build a lot of the tension and led towards one of the biggest reveals of the arc that I ended up shockingly figuring out myself a few minutes before it was presented. And yet even after the arc is completed, the story gets even better and saves some of the most shocking twists for \u221aD.\n\n\u221aC basically merges the perspectives of the first two arcs and summarizes everything that has happened to that point \u2013 there aren\u2019t any choices, but this arc is extremely helpful as a refresher and puts together some things you might not have thought about!\n\nIf you thought the first three arcs were good, you\u2019ll be extremely unprepared for \u221aD. Everything you previously thought was a lie (actually just very well masked) and the deception that is revealed is absolutely mind-blowing. In \u221aD, the story ties together every single little thing and leaves no loose ends. There are even plot twists to the plot twists! And the best part\u2026 everything will make sense and fit together snugly like a jigsaw puzzle. There are no missing pieces, no blank spaces at the end. \u221aD allows for the most user interaction into the outcome of the story out of all the arcs, and I\u2019d strongly advise you to go through as many different endings as you possibly can.\n\nI don\u2019t want to give away too much about \u221aD since it was my favorite part of the game, but the amount of information it gives regarding every single character in the novel is insane and the characters themselves develop strongly through learning about each other as you learn about them at the same time.\n\nI cried during \u221aD. A lot. And not just at the endings, a lot of which were pretty heartwrenching. It hit me right in the feels and drew me in so much closer emotionally, which I really, really enjoyed. The emotional impact Root Double had on me as a whole can only be described by playing the game for yourselves.\n\nRoot Double, from beginning to end, was an incredible journey that I want to etch into my memory forever. It truly is a masterpiece.\n\n[b][u]Plot[/u][/b]\nI personally loved the setting of the story and the development of the plot throughout the entire novel. Although some twists were \u201cpredictable\u201d per se, they had to be deduced through the information given throughout the story and weren\u2019t completely apparent.

Well worth its price here though (discount or not). \n\nOverall:\n\nThis is the first visual novel I have played. And honestly, it has a better story then all the other games I have ever played. This surprised me. The long Campaign is over 50 hours with 30 hours of  content. Player choice does affect the world significantly, as this has 39 endings, mostly bad. Sometimes, in order to make the right choice the main character needed to have low confidence in himself, which is something I have personally never seen in any video game before. Solid background score and sound design.\n\nRoutes:\n\nBoth routes are very good (Root A and Root B) and there is some content generated based on what endings you get. Root B may seem boring, but picks up steam significantly in the last third of the game, and its finale (just pre and post credits) will explain the events in the start of Root A. \n\nCharacters:\n8 of the 9 characters you interact with are amazing with great voice acting backing up a very rich backstory, 1 (lets call them: bonde ninja) is pretty annoying. Both protagonists are very well developed as well. \n\nLore: \nPossibly has the least plot holes I have seen in any work. I am not joking, on my first playthrough, I noticed and predicted plot events based on information I got, while people may say that this makes the game \"predictable\", no its not, its that nothing feels like an ass pull, and you feel rewarded when you see your prediction become true or realize that you misunderstood that information(remember this game allows the main character to have low confidence in his abilities).

Mostly spoiler free aside from the structure of the game below and my impressions of the routes in terms of pacing, detail, etc. Please don't take this as a negative review, I just want to point out some things I feel people should know so they can finish the game happily, unlike the couple of negative reviews from people who have not scratched the surface of what Root Double has to offer...\n\nRoot Double is a story told from multiple perspectives that conjoin to create one full story. \n\u221aA: fast paced story of the events inside LABO, a deteriorating research facility\n\u221aB: A slower paced, informational explanation of the context of the city, the facility, and some key worldbuilding points\n\u221aC: (Unlocked after both \u221aA and \u221aB) A recap/addition to the previous events\n\u221aD: (Unlocked after \u221aC) The final route where everything gets tied together\nExtend Episodes: More details to tie loose ends (I have not started these yet and will not offer my opinion of them for this reason)\n\nHere are the issues I had while playing the game:\n- After an exciting and clean-cut \u221aA, \u221aB is packed with a lot of fluff that could've been summed up in half the time. That said, you do get a lot of scenes that strengthen your feelings towards the characters. \n- \u221aB has a LOT of exposition. A TON of pseudo-science technobabble. It is important to the story but the explanations really shouldn't be told in the form of literal classroom lessons. It breaks the flow of the game considerably, and for this reason, among others, I would not play \u221aB first. \n- \u221aD is told almost entirely in flashbacks of things you've already seen. It drags. A lot. \n- Some of the plot points are easily guessable right off the bat, and some are totally out of left field. At points the characters would say something like \"Oh! Now I get it!\" regarding something that I had assumed to be true an hour ago. Other times, they'd assume something and I'd have to keep pressing forward with the dialogue to even understand what they meant. But it all does click after that, so not a big issue. \n\nThe game could've been cut considerably, and I do wish they slowed down a bit with the exposition and backstory. Every character has their chance to tell their story, which is nice, but it dampens the drama because the game is so saturated with it. I found myself caring less about each successive trauma-riddled past and more impatient for the game to get to the point of the incident. \n\nWITH THAT SAID, everything is worth it. The game is a meticulously crafted tale. Every tiny detail fits together like the world's most wordy jigsaw puzzle. They really left no stone unturned. Every word each character says, every action, they are all hand picked carefully to create the tale. The characters are all likable, understandable, and act in realistic ways. If you're on the store page for Root Double, it's because you like suspense/mystery games and are probably interested in visual novels. Maybe you even have a couple Infinity series games under your belt like I do. In this case, it's a no brainer. In fact, I would encourage anyone even mildly curious to buy this game. \n\nAt the time of this writing, Humble Bundle has a bundle with this game and a couple other visual novel titles for $12.

Les survivants doivent s'\u00e9chapper de cet enfer dans un laps de temps donn\u00e9...\n\n[i]Root Double -Before Crime * After Days- Xtend Edition[/i] est un VN tr\u00e8s bien narr\u00e9 et certainement l'un des meilleurs VNs disponibles \u00e0 ce jour sur Steam. Celui-ci dispose d'un tr\u00e8s bon prologue, d'une intrigue palpitante, d'un bon d\u00e9veloppement sur les personnages et de plus la route finale est \u00e0 en couper le souffle ! C'est d\u00e9finitivement le Visual Novel dont l'histoire ne doit pas \u00eatre rat\u00e9e. \n\nPour une meilleure exp\u00e9rience, il vous est fortement conseill\u00e9 de commencer par la route After avant de passer par Before. \n\nDans un premier temps, vous \u00eates dans la peau de Watase Kasasagi, capitaine d'une \u00e9quipe de sauvetage travaillant pour \"Sirius\". Il se r\u00e9veillera dans cet enfer avec une amn\u00e9sie, ne sachant plus qui il est et pourquoi il se retrouve dans cette situation. Cette route met en place l'histoire, beaucoup de probl\u00e8mes et questions se succ\u00e8deront, ne laissant ainsi aucun r\u00e9pis aux lecteurs.\n\nDans un second temps, la route Before r\u00e9pondra \u00e0 toutes les questions que vous vous poserez lors de la lecture de After. Cette fois-ci, vous suivrez Natsuhiko Tenkawa, un simple \u00e9tudiant qui devra revivre les \u00e9v\u00e8nements pass\u00e9s durant les 6 derniers jours pour d\u00e9couvrir la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 derri\u00e8re ce d\u00e9sastre. Pour ma part, c'est la route la plus ennuyante et lente de tous... j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 super content de l'avoir fini le plus vite possible.\n\nUne chose est s\u00fbre, les survivants devront se serrer les coudes entre eux pour pouvoir survivre.\n\nAu niveau du gameplay, on a ici quelque chose de compl\u00e8tement diff\u00e9rent compar\u00e9e aux autres VNs. La plupart des VNs nous limitent \u00e0 de simples s\u00e9lections de choix, Root Double joue sur le niveau de confiance que l'on a envers les personnages appel\u00e9 Senses Sympathy System. Le seul point commun entre ces deux gameplays, un mauvais choix est c'est le Bad Ending assur\u00e9, assez frustant personellement.\n\nPour ce qui est de la bande sonore, je n'ai rien \u00e0 reprocher, extr\u00eamement parfaite du d\u00e9but \u00e0 la fin et quand il faut. Je ne m'ennuie jamais \u00e0 les \u00e9couter en boucle.\n\nEn conclusion, Root Double est un bon VN du genre thriller, tr\u00e8s bien narr\u00e9, poss\u00e9dant une histoire tr\u00e8s engageante et compos\u00e9 d'une superbe bande son.

Only text though, the voices are still Japanese. \nThe story draws you in from the start, there is no time to breath and since the character you play is suffering from amnesia, there are lots of mysteries to solve to find out how the situation you find yourself in came to be.\nI also like how the story is split up into different parts and each time you finish a part more light is shed on the background of what is and what was happening.\nWhat I found most surprising - bacause I have never had that before in another visual novel - is that I liked all of the characters I met in the game without a single exception. This was such a lovable staff, very charming. And even though you are constantly under pressure in thie game there is still time for a few romance parts (don't expect a romance VN though).\nI can recommend this game warmly, it's currently my second place visual novel after Clannad!

Root Double's strongest points are by far its characters. They're incredibly well developed, likable and memorable. \n\nThe story itself is excellent too, I won't go into it much more than the steam description says but just know that there is far more to it than meets the eye. \nThe pacing is pretty solid as well. While the game can slow down at points with its pacing it is nowhere near as bad as the pacing of other vn's such as ever17. While Ever17 is more of a stop, go, stop, go pacing affair Root Double, while slowing down at points never really comes to a screeching hault at all. \n\nIf you're looking for a solid visual novel though with great pacing, great characters and an interesting plot then pick this one up.

Plus it gets into the action immediately, compared to B which has a very gradual bulidup.\n\nPlaytime:  ~27 hours is the amount of time it took for me to finish the game, while playing through any bad/alternative endings I happened to run into. (around 5 to 7 of them)\n\nMain review: Very well might be my favorite visual novel of all time. Huge length, fully voice acted, genuine \"gamefeel\" things implemented like screen shake, ambient sounds, falling ember particle effects, and heat haze that sell the setting of a blazing nuclear research facillity. \n\nTwists and story beats are handled elegantly, most notably with a very major reveal done 20 minutes in because the writers knew that if they used it as a plot twist later on it would feel like utterly unpredictable BS. Sorta like how if you're gonna have a \"it was all a dream\" twist, you damn well better not end your story with it.\n\nA great majority of other plot details and reveals are hinted at throughout, which both lends the game well to writing theories and speculation down, and to allowing you to think back and say \"oh, *THATS* why that occured back then!\" Every character feels unique and serves an important purpose, with their own motivations and justifiable reasonings for their actions. I ended up hand writing a full 2 sided paper of my current theories while I was playing through.\n\n\nOverall, Root Double tonally and conceptually most resembles other visual novels like 9 Hours 9 Persons 9 Doors or other works directed by Kotaro Uchikoshi, so if you liked the Zero Escape series or generally near future Sci-fi suspense stories, then this game is most likely right up your alley.", "timestamp_created": 1493250420, "timestamp_updated": 1493250547, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505650", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30999584": {"recommendationid": "30999584", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032397651", "num_games_owned": 1475, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 3264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491578398}, "language": "english", "review": "Simply put, a fantastic VN.

They keep us tethered to the word around us, but are surprisingly fragile and can shatter in a mere instant. Not to mention that they are prone to distortion or outright fabrication. Yet they are the most important way that you can connect with someone and in, a way, give your own existance worth and meaning. While not strictly making that case until a scene at the tailend of the VN, it's a common theme in Root Double.\n\nThe plot of Root Double is a bit hard to describe because it involves the convergence of two stories. The first story is that of Watase, a rescue worker that has developed amnesia. The catch is that as a result of this amnesia, he's been thrown into a situation seemingly of the explosion of a nuclear reactor, radiation seems to keep going up, and he needs to figure out a way for him and everyone under his care (including multiple civilians, a worker at the lab, and his two subordinates). This ends up proving more complicated than he could possibly imagine as bodies start to pile up.\n\nThe other story is that of Natsuhiko, an esper (while not technical accurate it's a decent colloquial description), that is supposedly powerful but is unable for his abilities to manifest. While this is certainly closer to the typical VN experience, as it were, I feel that the author handles it effectively and deftly. All the characters are interesting and likable and there is clearly enough mystery going on that I was far too immersed in the characters and story to be particularly upset that it isn'tthe most original thing in the world.\n\nThe music and visuals are quite good and compliment the story effectively as well.\n\nOverall I could be more specific about certain aspects but I really think this game is stronger going in as blind as possible.

Au d\u00e9but c\u2019est un peu d\u00e9stabilisant, on sait pas trop comment le r\u00e9gler mais on se rend vite compte que mettre 0 ou 1 change pas grand chose et on se restreint vite \u00e0 2 ou 3 positions.

[/h1]\n\nTwo groups connected by fate seeking escape. On one side rescue worker with strong will to save lives or so he believes. On the other is a high-schooler with talent towards telepathy. All around sudden disaster, crushing your peaceful days on Rokumei. Your mind, your reality and past, everything is unstable, crumbling. That\u2019s how it starts. There is no clear answer. Just a hope to survive another hour through fire, radiation and much more inside LABO.\n\n\nBest things in Root Double are bound by decision system. SSS is a complex thing, sort of trust mechanism (also in your past), even slightest choice can lead to long consequence, if person distrust you or the other way around. There is no indication though that hero will act as you want. There are no meaningless decisions, almost all can change mood and create threat. Discovering good end is difficult because of that. Story and characters are well crafted and dimensional, you will be surprised. Each section: After, Before and more, to reach final +40 hours is a minimum, many relationships and feelings along the way, from many point of views.\n\n\nRoot Double is a bit repetitive at times with ost, revisiting past and occasional re-reading same events. Some cool action scenes are also unrealistic. DESPITE all that though you can't complain. Nothing seems to be underdeveloped. Besides It misses just a little to be incredible VN, somewhere in the flow of the story, when After route ends less decisions appears. Maybe it\u2019s because the game is trying hard on explaining certain parts few times. Give it a chance and your mind will sink into mystery adventure.

I don't play them as much as I used to anymore, but this one was one that I just had to pick up when I heard about it and saw the kickstarter for it.\nIn short, it's one of those visual novels where there are 9 or so different people trapped in a place that's locked down for a certain number of hours, and they have to escape within a certain amount of time or else they die and etc. \n\nBut there is so much more to it than that, I tell you hwut.\n\nLike I said I'm a bit of a sucker for these types of games, but depending on what kinds of stories and scenarios and cliches you like/are okay with, you may like this game as much as me, or you might just find many of the tropes and cliches kind of annoying. This is an anime visual novel, so the typical anime tropes will be here. I do find some of them kind of annoying, but it doesn't really get in the way of the good parts of the whole thing overall, in my opinion.\n\nI've heard that people thought that this game starts off slow, or it had a good premise but they feel if goes too slowly or there's not a good payoff in the end? And to that I say that it's somewhat true, but I believe the payoff is well worth it in the end. \nIt has good characters, a good story, good plot, good twists.. I couldn't be happier. Like I said in my little review of the 3rd Zero Escape game, this is the type of game where I do look back on when I first played it and didn't know anything about the story or characters or all that, and I wish I could go back and replay it without knowing anything. \n\nSo without rambling too much about nothing, I do recommend this game if you like visual novels. It was even recommended by the guy who made/wrote the 999/Zero Escape games, so that's basically all you need to know if it's good or not!!

If gambling on one of those sounds like it\u2019s worth it, and you have ~50 hours to kill, then you know what to do. \n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\nFirst of all, Root Double is a bit disjointed. The events of the game are centered on a catastrophic accident which traps the main cast in a deadly environment. Not all of the game takes place in this high tension environment where everyone\u2019s lives are at risk: a good chunk of it takes place before the incident, and the player sees how the mundanity of everyday life is gradually overtaken by looming danger. Some of the other reviews criticise these past segments for being too slowly paced or boring, and that\u2019s fair criticism not just of those segments but a lot of the early game as a whole. There were a few times I questioned whether it was even worth it to stick through to the end, when I had little investment in the characters early on. I\u2019m glad I stuck through these tough spots, because it really picked up for me in the second half.\n\nDespite its pacing issues, I still think that the story, in all its detail, was masterfully written. In both parts the player is treated to several perspective-shifting revelations, alongside the characters, which challenge their biases. A given scene early in the game could be interpreted in several possible ways depending on how far you are in the story. Characters I didn\u2019t really care about at all became some of my favorites after viewing them in a slightly different light. The way the many fragments of story from past and present blend together to reveal the truth is my favorite part of Root Double and is important to the themes of the story. It wasn\u2019t as emotional an experience for me as my other favorite VNs, but Root Double still had its moments. \n\nIf you like playing a more active role in reading the story and make note of every bit of foreshadowing to figure out what\u2019s going on before it\u2019s revealed in big flashing letters, you\u2019ll probably have a good time here. In my playthrough, there were many realizations which I enjoyed making before the characters themselves. I was way out in left field with a couple of my theories. Despite paying close attention, I even ended up forgetting about a few plot points and was pleasantly surprised when they suddenly made sense. Only a few times was I bothered by the characters taking so long to figure something out. When the story got going, the flow of information kept me intrigued and kept me guessing.\n\nOne thing that is definitely worth mentioning is the sci-fi element: [spoiler] telepathy, basically [/spoiler]. This VN takes the route of explaining almost in too much detail the exact mechanism by which this phenomenon occurs, rather than just detailing the specifics of what the phenomenon does or what triggers it. If you aren\u2019t one to care about the details and would rather say, [i] \u201cit\u2019s not real anyways who cares,\u201d [/i] then the explanations of how the sci-fi works could be boring and pointless, but I greatly appreciated the care and thought that went into this aspect and for once wasn\u2019t bothered by having to ignore sloppiness or glaring flaws in the science. Overall I thought that the fake science in Root Double was very fleshed out and extremely well done, but I\u2019m sure that for some players who have more in-depth knowledge of physics the required suspension of disbelief would be a bit higher.\n\n[h1] Presentation [/h1]\nThe visuals are pretty good. If the anime aesthetic is a turnoff for whatever reason, this VN is pretty damn anime so you\u2019d better avoid it. There are enough CGs for important scenes, but a few more would have been nice. Similarly, it seldom feels like characters should have had a separate sprite drawn for a specific scene. All of the CGs, sprites and backgrounds are detailed and together make for coherent visuals. The font is always easy to read. There were some cool visual effects at play as well, but that\u2019s standard fare.\n\nIn terms of sound design, the voice acting is expressive enough to let you hear the character\u2019s state of mind, and each voice actor adapts their character\u2019s personality well. The sound effects are good with the exception of the [spoiler] guns [/spoiler]. There are a few stand-out tracks from the OST as well which are good for hyping up key moments in the story.\n\nAll in all the visuals and sound work together to immerse you in the story. Oh yeah, and Double Bible is a killer opening, so there\u2019s that too [spoiler](but only if you\u2019re a weeb)[/spoiler].\n\n[h1] \u201cGameplay\u201d [/h1]\nRather than the story branching from decisions made by the player, instead the protagonist at the time takes their own actions based on their feelings towards the other characters: the player has their influence on the world by \u201csharing their feelings\u201d with the protagonist via the Senses Sympathy System (SSS). Initially the SSS feels like a pointless change from the norm, but it doesn\u2019t really change anything since you\u2019d probably be reloading to get the outcome you want anyways and the reason for the SSS does make sense eventually. \n\nIn some cases, usually for important branches, the SSS was more difficult to use than traditional decisions, but everywhere else I thought the SSS added more than it ruined. Redoing decisions if the SSS doesn\u2019t behave as you expected is fairly easy thanks to the automatic quicksave feature. If you really hate it, after clearing a route, the \u201canswers mode\u201d for that route is unlocked, allowing the player to do away with the SSS and just choose from the possible outcomes of that branch, for bad-end hunting and such. While a few of the bad ends foreshadow and justify events far in the future, other than that, collecting them is only to satisfy your curiosity or grab the all endings achievement. I personally haven\u2019t gotten all of the bad ends since they\u2019re a pain to replay for basically no payoff. \n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nMany aspects of Root Double are hit-or-miss: the pacing, the story as a whole, the sci-fi, the aesthetic, the branching choice system. Just because I wasn\u2019t bothered by any of those elements doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t be; but Root Double broke into my favorite VNs, and I recommend trying it out to see if it can do the same for you.", "timestamp_created": 1483435999, "timestamp_updated": 1483436349, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28966427": {"recommendationid": "28966427", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026813059", "num_games_owned": 206, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3484, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473809367}, "language": "english", "review": "First and foremost, i'd like to say this:\n\nDo not be deceived by this Visual Novel.\n\nRoot Double tells a story divided in four parts, through the viewpoints of two protagonists: Watase, the firefighter and Natsuhiko, a high school student capable of using ESP powers like telepathy and such.\nThe game initially ropes you in with a very engaging and well written survival scenario, in which several characters trapped inside an underground laboratory try to survive after a nuclear meltdown occurs and the whole place is locked down to prevent the radiation from leaking outside. This part is actually very entertaining to read, as it feels like a fast paced survival thriller.\nThen everything starts falling apart as you get to the second scenario, Root Before. The game switches to a high school setting as you see the events that took place before the incident. Seeing what led to the events that happen in the first part sounds interesting on paper, but the game's pace slows to a crawl as it forces you to read through hours upon hours of slice-of-life with poorly developed characters that i frankly couldn't care less about. Even the single possibly redeeming factor of this scenario, a relatively well built-up plot twist that was supposed to have some emotional weight behind it, is completely wasted as the game promptly turns the entire twist meaningless mere moments after it happens.\n\nAnd sadly, it doesn't get better from here. The game's final scenario is just a long series of flashbacks one right after the other, with essentially nothing actually happening in-between. The story's main conflict has a very unsatisfying conclusion and the ending itself is rather overly idealistic and generally dissappointing.\n\nAs such, I'd like to stress that you should not be deceived by this VN's strong start, because that's literally all it has going for it. Only dissappointment awaits after those initial 15 hours, and as you can see from my playtime, that's not even a third of the reading you'll be doing if you stick around until the end.", "timestamp_created": 1483420403, "timestamp_updated": 1483420403, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.623797", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28928623": {"recommendationid": "28928623", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101009245", "num_games_owned": 120, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 3998, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486212938}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6628\u665a\u6253\u5b8c\u4e86A\u7ebf\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6240\u8c13\u7684GE\u8ba9\u6211\u60f3\u8d77\u4e86CC\u7684\u4e00\u5468\u76ee\u7ed3\u5c40=\u3002=\n\u611f\u89c9\u5751\u8d8a\u6316\u8d8a\u5927 \u5b8c\u5168\u505c\u4e0d\u4e0b\u6765\n\u603b\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\u6211\u89c9\u5f97\u4eba\u8bbe\u5267\u672c\u6f14\u51fa\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u975e\u5e38\u68d2\uff0c\u5f3a\u70c8\u63a8\u8350\n______________________________________________\n\u7b80\u5355\u73a9\u4e86\u4e00\u4e0b\u5f00\u5934 \u6e38\u620f\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5341\u5206\u65b0\u5947\uff0cBSD\u4e4b\u540e\u5df2\u7ecf\u5f88\u4e45\u6ca1\u8fc7\u8fd9\u79cd\u975e\u7eaf\u7cb9\u9009\u9879\u7684\u6587\u5b57\u7c7bAVG\u4e86\n\u611f\u89c9\u5e94\u8be5\u4f1a\u662f\u4e2a\u5f88\u6709\u610f\u601d\u7684\u6545\u4e8b \u5360\u5751\u5bd2\u5047\u56de\u53bb\u6162\u6162\u73a9~", "timestamp_created": 1483334540, "timestamp_updated": 1485395648, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28814292": {"recommendationid": "28814292", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049932799", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 3421, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483051810}, "language": "english", "review": "Just finished the game and man...what a game!

Some were great, some were not so great. But one thing I've found to be true is that Takumi Nakazawa, director of The Infinity Series and Myself;Yourself, knows what he's doing. So when I saw Sekai Project was launching a Kickstarter to bring a Takumi Nakazawa game to the West, I jumped on it. And I was not disappointed. I don't usually write long reviews, but this game deserves it. So without further ado, here is an in-depth review of why Root Double -Before Crime * After Days is another masterpiece of Japanese storytelling.\n\n[u]Story[/u]\n\nIt's not a visual novel if it doesn't have a story, right? In September of 2030, an explosion rocks a nuclear facility in the fictional city of Rokumei. An emergency evacuation is issued, but 9 people end up trapped in the lower levels of the facility anyway, and Root Double is the story of their harrowing attempt to all escape with their lives. And that's all I can tell you. Literally anything and everything else is a spoiler.\nI'm not going to mince words, the narrative of this game is perfect. Every character is written so elaborately, every relationship explored to the fullest. There's pretty much a twist every half hour, each one more earth-shattering then the last. I found myself grinning ear-to-ear several times during the game, completely enthralled by some of the crazy twists and turns the game was throwing at me. The \"A-ha!\" moments in this game are some of the best I've experienced in a mystery-based game like this.\n\n[u]Gameplay[/u]\n\nRoot Double is different from other visual novels in that there are no choices - at least not in a conventional way. Instead, the game employs what is called the Senses Sympathy System, or \"SSS\". When the story arrives at a branch, you are able to alter your impressions towards certain characters and sometimes even yourself. It's a little confusing at first, but really ended up being one of my favorite parts of the game. It's very unique, and even ends up tying into the story of the game. Other than that, Root Double is another standard visual novel. You can skip text you've already read, or skip scenes altogether.\nRemember, though, that this [b]is[/b] a visual novel. If reading dialogue for 25+ hours doesn't sound appealing, then this really isn't the game for you.\n\n[u]Sounds[/u]\n\nRoot Double is fully voice acted, and everyone does an amazing job. There's some emotional stuff in this game, and it's handled noticeably well by the cast. The soundtrack is also really good, not overshadowing what's going on in the story, but providing a great background for this harrowing, sometimes disturbing tale. It's creepy when it needs to be creepy and delightful when it needs to be delightful. No single track stands out, but that's how it should be.\nSound effects are also a big part of this day. Blaring sirens, explosions, jarring radio static, etc. It really helps to set the mood and adds a lot of realism.\n\n[u]Conclusion[/u]\n\nRoot Double -Before Crime * After Days is exactly what I wanted. I expected a lot from the director of the Infinity series, and my expectations were shattered and surpassed. I love this game and really enjoyed the time I spent learning all I could about its world. If you're a fan of anime or visual novels, this game is a must-play.", "timestamp_created": 1472702483, "timestamp_updated": 1472702483, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25228536": {"recommendationid": "25228536", "author": {"steamid": "76561198196704053", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 3608, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473606117}, "language": "english", "review": "This was an incredibly good story that was thrilling, engaging and suspenseful. I also love it that it has little or no romance but still delivers a solid story experience.\n\nFor newbies, you might be a little concerned that the Choice Making System is really a Who-Do-You-Trust (aka Senses Sympathy) System, but don't worry, there's a tutorial that pops up before your first choice that will take you through the ropes.\n\nI personally thought that it was refreshing, although sometimes it can be quite hard to make a rational choice.\n\nHere's the lowdown on the Story Structure - There are 4 routes. You have to complete Routes A and B and unlock the good endings before Route C will appear. And you have to complete Route C before Route D will appear. Route D is the final route and comprises of a whopping 7 non-bad endings!\n\nThe recommended route order is A - B - C - D. Personally I feel that route B will give you a lot of answers to Route A, and if you like that sort of understanding, then you can play B first, but if you like to be kept in suspense, then play A first.\n\nSecondly route B onwards is filled with many flashbacks, and that's one thing I hate about the game, the amount of flashbacks/recollection! That includes route C and route D too :(\n\nWell I kind of understand that, since the main topic of the game deals with Memory and the Mind, but at least there's a fast forward button.\n\nThere are also 100 save slots so you will never be out of space.\n\nAlso, there's a lot of scientific theory in this game, so it will definitely make you think a lot :)\n\nPlus there's like over 50 hours of gameplay! Really freakin worth it.\n\nWhat can I say?

Not only is the story filled with many heart-pounding and emotional moments from start to finish, but the world, story and characters are all extremely fleshed out and detailed while remaining coherent, and are all tied together by the end to make for one of the most satisfying and 'complete' stories I've experienced. It's easily one of my favorite visual novels, and my current favorite game on Steam.\n\nLong review:\n\nDue to Root Double being directed and conceptualized by Takumi Nakazawa, Root Double is often compared to Ever17, another game he had a large involvement in (being its director and one of its two main writers). While the comparison is apt in many ways since they certainly do share a fair amount of similarities, fans of Ever17 should be aware that Root Double focuses less on shocking twists and places more emphasis on fleshing out its characters and world building. That said, Root Double still has some good twists (and there were some revelations that surprised me), and I probably found it more consistently engaging and exciting as a whole (even if I love Ever17). Long story short, I'd say any fan of Ever17 is likely to find Root Double worth their while, since Root Double shares much of the same appeal and is just as intelligently written. Just don't the experience to be exactly the same.\n\nWith that out of the way, let me focus more on reviewing the game itself: \n\nAs you may have read in the synopsis at the top of the page, Root Double tells the story of a group of survivors who got trapped inside a locked down nuclear research facility by the name of \u201cLABO\u201d which is undergoing meltdown, thus setting the groundwork for a thrilling story of survival and drama.\n\nAs with most visual novels, Root Double is divided into multiple routes, though in Root Double's case, the routes aren't separate paths, but are all integral to the plot and part of the same overarching storyline (certainly not unique to Root Double, but worth a mention since many visual novels do it differently). Far as these routes go, you're initially only able to choose between routes A and B, so let me give a basic summary of them both:\n\nRoute A: This route has you playing as Watase Kasasagi, a rescue squad captain that finds himself trapped inside a nuclear reactor that's beginning to undergo meltdown. Aside from having no clear way out, he's also completely lost his memory, which makes his survival and the protection of the other survivors that much harder. Additionally, radiation levels in the facility are continuing to rise, and anti-radiation medication is in extremely limited supply, further threatening their survival prospects and severely limiting the time they have to find a way out.\n\nRoute A is probably Root Double's most consistently suspenseful route, as it's filled to the brim with danger and tension. Not only are there the many perils brought forth by the disaster, such as raging fires and the steadily increasing levels of radiation, but it's not always clear who you can trust, which adds a dash of psychological suspense to the overall situation. The danger is an active presence as well, since the game has quite a few choices - mess any up, and you can easily wind up on one of this route's many bad ends.\n\nAll in all, Route A makes for a pretty thrilling survival story, and works well as a hook for the game's overarching plot, so I\u2019d recommend reading it first.\n\nRoute B: This route has you assuming the role of Natsuhiko Tenkawa, a boy who lives in Rokumei City, an isolated research city that just so happens to house the nuclear reactor Route A takes place in. Up until now, Natsuhiko has lived a fairly peaceful life, but as mysterious and unusual events begin to unfold around him, that peace is threatened to shatter.\n\nCompared to Route A, Route B is a bit slower-paced, since it focuses more on exploring some of the story's underlying mysteries, along with fleshing out the game world and this route's major characters. Due to the more peaceful city setting, this route does have a fair amount of slice of life scenes, though it still tends to be pretty engaging since even those slice of life scenes usually work towards world-building or developing this route's characters (which I generally found fairly endearing). It doesn't take too long for the aforementioned mysteries to be thrown into the mix either, and as those mysteries gradually become a bigger focus and the route progresses, things continue to get more exciting until the story eventually connects up with the start of Route A (albeit from a different perspective).\n\nWhile Route B's fairly interesting even on its own, it feels a bit like a \"B side\" to the events of Route A in some ways. While it certainly can be experienced first and should still make sense if you do so, I'd personally recommend reading it second.\n\nAfter route A and B are completed, there are actually two other routes that will unlock, which serve both to tie Routes A and B together and to progress the story further toward its eventual conclusion. I can't really speak much on those routes without going into spoilers, so I'll refrain from doing so here, though I can say that each route managed to be very engaging throughout and felt like it built upon the story substantially. Another thing I found notable is that every single route manages to build up to an exciting climax towards the end and really finish with a bang, which made each route's conclusion feel very satisfying (and left me super excited and wanting to jump right into the next route to see what would happen next).\n\nAnother aspect worth highlighting is Root Double's cast of characters, since it's definitely one of the visual novel's strongest points; the entire cast is excellent, and I wound up loving most of them by the story's end. Each and every character gets a good deal of development as the story progresses, to the point I'd say Root Double is a story about its characters just as much as it is about the overarching survival situation and the many mysteries surrounding it. That said, someone who doesn't care much for the cast may find the significant character focus a bit much at points, since each character gets explored in quite a lot of depth, sometimes through extensive flashback sequences (especially closer toward the end), though I personally loved the flashbacks since it let me further relate to the cast and learn of their influences and motivations. The different character stories also wind up creating a large tapestry of events that further fleshes out game world, so it can be interesting to see the ways in which certain events connect with one-another and interweave with the overarching storyline.\n\nFar as the story as a whole goes, it makes for a very exciting ride, with many emotional highs, both thrilling and dramatic. These moments are further accentuated by the game's soundtrack, which I found quite enjoyable and felt captured the mood of each scene well, and CGs, which looked sharp and cleanly drawn, and were fairly plentiful throughout. The CGs especially stood out during the more dramatic scenes, since the character's expressions were often drawn with a lot of intensity, and I really liked the way and colors and lighting were used for dramatic effect.\n\nAll in all, I feel Root Double is an example of a very well-rounded story: It's got plenty of action, mystery, tension and drama through its thrilling survival situation, though through it all, it never loses sight of its characters, and manages to be sentimental and heartwarming as well. Root Double has just about everything I look for in a story, and I enjoyed it immensely every step of the way, from the its thrilling start to its extremely satisfying conclusion, so I give Root Double my highest recommendation!", "timestamp_created": 1468443007, "timestamp_updated": 1468443034, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523077", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24252306": {"recommendationid": "24252306", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051866394", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2943, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502299328}, "language": "english", "review": "I paid USD$125 (+$10 shipping) for a Collector's Edition of this game during the Kickstarter. Having just finished the digital version (physicals have not shipped), I can now say that that was a decision I do not regret.\n\nHaving been written by Takumi Nakazawa, who wrote the Infinity Series in collaboration with Kotaou Uchikoshi (Of Zero Escape fame), it's not surprising that the story of Root Double would feature a complex plot and a number of mindblowing twists. But Root Double goes beyond that, surpassing in my opinion all of the Infinity Series, Uchikoshi's 999 (haven't read his other works yet), and Nakazawa's other work I/O. \n\nWithout giving away too much, let me just say that where those other works failed, Root Double has found success. Unlike Ever17, the pacing is generally great (with the exception of Route B), providing a constant atmosphere of suspense and mystery as the many plot threads unravel bit by bit. And unlike Remember11 (and 999 + I/O), the reveals and conclusion are thoroughly coherent and satisfying, leaving not even the tiniest of mysteries unexplained. The story features many twists that will leave you stunned or blown away, and something that really impressed me is how well they were foreshadowed through such little and seemingly insignificant details, which only show their full significance in the bigger scheme of things. While it's technically possible to solve a lot of things in the overall mystery (I solved a few), the game is likely to have many more unexpected reveals in store for even a highly discerning reader.\n\nFinally, unlike I/O, which tried to explore themes of alienation and development of cyber-realities with mixed success, Root Double approached and dealt with the issues of a society of telepaths with a surprising amount of depth and nuance. This is Root Double's second major strength. All 9 of the main characters feel like fully fleshed out human beings, with their own backstories, motivations, ideals, and perspectives behind things, which at times bring them into conflict with one another. The concept of psychic powers, dubbed \"Beyond Communication\", is handled with care, with attention being given to developing the technical (sci-fi) aspects of the phenomenon as well as the societal issues brought about by the existence of such a phenomenon.

for people to survive. Nine people are trapped inside LABO and there are only 6 meds left that can help them survive before the gates open. Who will you choose?\"[/i]\n\nRoot Double -Before Crime * After Days- Xtend Edition is a visual novel that blends action, sci-fi, suspense, drama and mystery magnificently. It's a visual novel that tries to stray away from the traditional choose an option system. The VN does not provide players with a set of choices that could possibly lead to a heroine. Instead, the game uses its own decision-making system called the Senses Sympathy System (SSS). The SSS is a grid where players get to adjust which characters that are relevant to the current situation do you actually trust. Depending on how the player has adjusted the grid, it can either lead to some surprisingly bad ends or better yet help you survive and move on to the next scene. The Senses Sympathy System (SSS) might take a little getting used to but once you get the hang of it, you'll get indulged deeper into the VN's story.\n\nRoot Double -Before Crime * After Days- Xtend Edition can be played in two different perspectives namely: Watase Kasasagi and Natsuhiko Tenkawa as the game features two protagonists. The VN's story starts where a fire incident took place in a nuclear research facility, named LABO. A rescue squad is sent to help evacuate the people inside the facility. The squad is headed by Captain Watase Kasasagi.  But as things get worse, LABO's reactor started a nuclear meltdown leading to a total lockdown of the facility. With the rescue squad trapped inside LABO, they have no choice but to continue the rescue operation as there maybe some people left inside. As they go deeper in LABO, strange things have started to happen and all of a sudden Watase Kasasagi was knocked out unconscious for some unknown reason. As he woke up, Watase has lost his memories and the story of survival and trust begins.\n\nRoot Double -Before Crime * After Days- Xtend Edition is a visual novel with a lot of content. It took me 50+ hours to finish all the root chapters and a total of around 60 hours to complete everything. The VN also features a lot of endings and epilogues for players to unlock. The VN's replayability is pretty high as there a lot of what-ifs. The development of each character is done very well as almost all characters have their own back stories and important roles in the story. As you grow to hate or love a certain character, there will always be a reason for such. The Xtend episodes adds a little more content for the story as it tries to tell more about each character's past experiences.\n\nOverall, Root Double -Before Crime * After Days- Xtend Edition is MUST have if you're a big VN fan. It's also a big change of scenery as most visual novels in Steam cover more on romance and fan-service. If you're looking for a visual novel that focuses more on sci-fi, drama, suspense and mystery, then this is a VN for you!", "timestamp_created": 1467109967, "timestamp_updated": 1479925374, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.600454", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23630503": {"recommendationid": "23630503", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027176779", "num_games_owned": 187, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 549, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490115738}, "language": "english", "review": "Likely one of the best visual novels I have played.

Even though it is not as shocking as its predecessors (it is unarguably an \"infinity\" game alongside the others for its themes, pace, extensive and thorough sci-fi elements, and epilogue) perhaps because we got accustomed in such endings of his (though BC ending was indeed mind-blowing and could hardly be foreseen), it's been a jewel in story-telling, character development and plot planning. I shall explain my self better: every turn of events in both timelines arises from the story itself and there is not even a tiny hole in all the although complicated plot; characters are so well characterised and emotional parts felt really moving because of that, especially the slice-of-life part of BC route served none other purpose than that of creating such empathy between the reader and characters and it worked really well, and thinking how everything ended it\u2019s even more satisfying. In the end, all pieces of the puzzle that were scattered along the story wisely and with care fit slowly but steadily together and everything (and I mean everything, even the titles of sub-chapters) has a purpose either narratively or philosophically (the true ending was the most intriguing and philosophically fascinating I've ever read in my own life). \n\nA special mention goes to the Sympathy System that replacing canonical choices system with bars with which the reader can adjust his own attitude and feelings towards the characters although it may seem dull later on (on most the time on BC route and later on) it fit so well in the story in such many ways I think it is such a brilliant gameplay choice I cannot label whomever thought of it other than a genius.\n\nAnother praiseworthy field was the art. Lots of well drawn CGs, with perfect timing in order to heighten involvement. \nI also liked a lot the \u201canticipation\u201d  trailer on every true ending of a route; it was a real hype-generating device that drew me to instantly begin the other routes despite a long session of reading (because of enthralling endings).\nThe only thing it did not stand out but did its own work well apart from writing itself because, well, it\u2019s a visual novel not a book, was the soundtrack.

Later this month we'll be getting the closing chapter \"Zero Time Dillema\".\n\nAnyway, Root Double is a sci-fi visual novel about 9 people being trapped inside a nuclear research facility called LABO. After an explosion occurs and a \"Case N\" is announced, the facility enters a timed lockdown and those 9 souls must survive until it's lifted. However, too many things seem strange about the incident, and the answer lies within the memories of each one, both after and before the accident.\n\nFirst of all, PLAY ROOT A FIRST! I cannot stress this enough. Otherwise your enjoyment of the story will be severely damaged.\n\nSecond, even though it often gets compared to the Zero Escape series, know that Root Double is not so much about the survival as it is about it's characters and the worldbuilding around the novel concept of Beyond Communication (think Telapathy, but way more detailed and explained in well researched scientific terms). It has its fair share of tense moments, and Root A in particular is more focused on the increasingly dire situation, but after that things slow down a bit to focus on characterization, which I didn't mind at all: it still had tons of suspenseful foreshadowing and it was absolutely entertaining throught.\n\nIt has some problems, however: some of the biggest twists are rather predictable and I felt it lost some opportunities of creating really awesome scenes using it's core storytelling premise, which is absolutely BRILLIANT by the way.

While it may not be the most exciting visual novel for large portions of the story the overall package is worth the time investment put into it.\n\nThere are 2 Routes presented to you when you press start:\n\nAfter: Which takes place from the point of view of a rescue worker caught in the middle of a terrorist attack on a Nuclear Reactor/Research facility.\n\nBefore: The events that lead up to the terrorist attack in the week before it happened from the viewpoint of a young student. Yes, it does start out as boring as it sounds.\n\nWhich route should you read first? A, without a doubt. While I would actually recommend switching between the routes every chapter I don't think anyone would do that, so I recommend you start with A.\n\nWhile I'm not sure if it was just me, but one of the largest issues I had at the start (is 20hrs still early on?) was a lack of any real emotional investment in any character. I couldn't find myself caring about anyone by that point, but somehow in the last few acts the VN finally sunk its teeth in and everything was kicked up to 11. I'm not sure why the first 20+ hours of character development didn't do anything for me (probably because it wasn't too great at the start), but if you feel the same don't worry the meat doesn't even begin until the second half.\n\nPros:\n[list]\n[*]A fantastic story\n[*]Incredibly well done foreshadowing at certain points. It's the small things.\n[*]Very fleshed out characters\n[*]Great voice actors\n[*]A well done term glossary\n[*]An explanation for what you did wrong if you ever get a bad end\n[/list]\nCons:\n[list]\n[*]Way too much over-explanation on repeated concepts\n[*]Lots of repeated events (Not a huge con for me personally since you can skip through them)\n[*]Huge sections of slow pace (there's a section that takes place at a school and it really feels like you went to school) that add very little at times (only argument for it is rounding out characters and unnecessary extra-foreshadowing)\n[*]Way too much easy to notice foreshadowing for certain events.\n[*]Everyone is related to everyone trope (I was basically shouting at the VN warning that it better not do this. It did.)\n[/list]\nOverall:\nWould I recommend this? If this is your very first Visual Novel? Probably not. I would definitely recommend some lighter reads or some mixed Genre VN's instead, but if you've read enough to know you enjoy the medium and can handle the slower pacing then I could not recommend this enough. My personal favorite on Steam at the moment and it ranks up there with my favorite VN's in general. I wish they subverted the reader's expectations based on the foreshadowing a little more, or used less foreshadowing in general but excessive foreshadowing isn't exactly a bad thing especially if you miss a few hints.\n\nFinal warning though just to be clear: When this gets slow it gets VERY slow.

Root Double -Before Crime * After Days- Xtend Edition is not your typical moege filled with moe where it\u2019s all about romance. Instead it has the touch of mystery, SCI FI and many more in this visual novel. It\u2019s story is very rich and its filled with heart stopping moments and twists throughout.\n\n[h1]The Story[/h1]\nThe city sends in \u201cSirius,\u201d an elite rescue squad, to deal with the situation. But the situation only gets worse when LABO\u2019s nuclear reactor melts down, sending the facility into lockdown\u2013with members of Sirius and survivors still trapped inside in the meantime filling LABO with the ashes of its dead. With lethal radiation leaking everywhere and not enough anti-radiation medication to last until lock down lifts, the survivors make more and more grim discoveries. In their struggle for survival, in a deathtrap full of fire and radiation, they learn that doubt is their greatest enemy, and trust their greatest asset. There are still 9 hours before the system recovers. The rescuers have only enough drugs to prevent radiation exposure for 6 people, but what about the other 3\u2026? Strange, phenomena keeps happening\u2026 There is also suspicion of a murdering going around as they find some researchers and rescue team members dead from bullet wounds, and three high school students who are also trapped in the lab but are nowhere to be found.\n\nThere are 6 mysteries surrounding this incident:\n1. During the incident, the captain of the rescue team lost his memory. What happened?\n2. Why were these normal high school students locked up in a place like this?\n3. A murdered body was found in the research facility they\u2019ve been locked down in. Why?\n4. Why did this incident happen? Why can\u2019t they get out?\n5. Why is the one that cannot exist \u2014 \u201cthat guy\u201d \u2014 here?\n\nThe mystery gets deeper and deeper. Gradually, the constant conflicts get more and more on these people\u2019s nerves\u2026\nThe key to surviving is hidden 6 days ago. In the sealed memories of the young man\u2026\n\nThe story is definitely one of the most interesting and intense story I have read. It has many plot twists and it is very confusing at first. I got a little frustrated at the front parts and at the \u201cdecision making\u201d parts that uses the sense system as it is very vague unless you used a guide to help yourself through the story and the time frames of \u221aA and \u221aB these two different perspectives don\u2019t overlap, you can\u2019t get the full picture of the cause and details of this incident from one route alone. Only by clearing all the routes will you be able to grasp the full story. The ending chapter is very satisfying as it starts to connect all the plots together while revealing the true nature of the story. Overall an extremely enjoyable read from the start to finish.\n\n[h1]Senses Sympathy System (SSS)[/h1]\nIt does not use a traditional system when you are presented with a straight choice instead it uses an original system where you are given the opportunity to adjust certain characters\u2019 \u201csenses\u201d at specific points. Each character\u2019s senses can be anywhere from 0-8, according to what value you input into the \u201csenses sympathy system\u201d it may or may not change the route/plot of the story thus giving the game an unpredictable progression. A character\u2019s senses represents their impression to others at that moment. For example, in the face of danger, raising Watase\u2019s senses can make him more courageous, on the contrary it may make him react recklessly. The senses system is kind of vague at times, but it does a good job of distancing the player from the narrator, and it makes a whole lot of sense later on as the story unfolds.\n\n[h1]\u221aA[/h1]\n\u221aA does an extremely good job of suspending the player and it is provably gripping part of the story, with dangerous events happening most of the time and a large number of bad endings the player may encounter. Desperate to survive and unravel the secret behind the incident at the lab and Watase\u2019s lost his memories. It makes the player [me] want to keep advancing into the story without break. [That\u2019s what I did for 12 hours straight] Root Double features two different protagonists: Watase Kasasagi, a rescue squad captain who has lost his memories in the hours after the incident, and Natsuhiko Tenkawa, a student piecing together the clues in the six days before.\n\n[h1]\u221aB[/h1]\n\u221aB is provably the most boring section for me as there is quite a huge amount of info dumping from Ena about BC when she is teaching the class in the school. But then \u221aB is very important to the story because it does not only shows what happened 6 days before the \u201cincident\u201d through Natsuhiko point of view, and it perfectly sets you into the direction that the game wants you to go into. It tricks the players into believing something is there. [Not mentioning because it is a major spoiler]\n\n[h1]Audio and Visual Elements[/h1]\n[b]Visual Elements \u2013[/b] Many things to note here is that the backgrounds, CGs and character sprites used in Root Double -Before Crime * After Days- Xtend Edition are very consistent with each other in turn made the whole visual novel as whole looks \u201csmoother\u201d. This is really a huge thing for me overall I absolutely adore the artstyle used in Root Double -Before Crime * After Days- Xtend Edition despite it being a moege art style being used in a \u201cserious\u201d VN. Though personally I wish they used a different approach for the art style since it a more \u201cserious\u201d type of VN but overall the moege VN art style managed to fit in nicely. I got to agree with Mashiro that Salyu is super cute I almost got killed by moe too.\n\n[b]Audio Elements \u2013[/b] Music is a very important factor to consider in a visual novel because music has a great ability to set the mood or depicting one character personality. I absolutely loved the music tracks in Root Double. When I was playing Root Double the moment I heard Jun Moribe voice I instantly recognize it and my suspicion was right she was voiced by Tomonaga Akane \u53cb\u6c38 \u6731\u97f3 the same voice actor that voiced  Kazami Kazuki from Grisaia no Kajitsu. Well I personally like her voice and I always actively seek out seiyus so knowing that Tomonaga Akane \u53cb\u6c38 \u6731\u97f3 voiced Jun Moribe, I liked Jun the most of course this was not the only deciding factor. The soundtracks itself are obviously good as it fits into the game perfectly and each of their character theme songs depicts them their personalities perfectly too.\n\n[h1]To sum up[/h1]\nWill I recommend this ? Simple answer is yes. I would definitely recommend this visual novel if you are the type of person who likes SCI-FI and want something serious for a change. Though do note that this has some form of \u201cdifficulty\u201d because it uses a different system that branches the player out and without a guide it will take you an extremely long time to complete the whole visual novel.

I loved the 999/Zero Escape series so I decided to give this game a shot and help crowdfund. Starting Root A is highly recommended since that dives you straight in the game as an amnesiac main character, Watase Kasasagi. You're trapped in a nuclear facility with very little resources to survive. What happened and who's behind all of this? Why do you have amnesia? Immediately, the game throws you into a survival drama and in my opinion, it was done wonderfully. Tension rises as time passes by and who would you trust? Using the Sympathy Senses System, you make decisions based on how you 'feel' towards certain characters. Be careful, you could make the wrong choice and just die without even knowing.\n\nThe game is one big ride through Root A. Root B however, is world building that leads to the events of Root A. Some twists in Root A are casually explained in Root B so I would recommend you not to play Root B first. Root B was slow in my opinion, but I understand why it had to be. By the end of Root B, you'd be thrown into a world of twists and turns and things start to come together.\n\nI loved the ride in this game and the amount of detail they put into it. There are subtle hints that lead you to the twists, extra scenes depending on your SSS, and more content than I initially thought. The ending ties everything up nicely with all the character's motives and backgrounds explained as you go along. Near the ending suffers from pacing issues since there's a ton of explaining. There are heroine epilogues based on your decisions also. There's also a neat skip feature ('R' key) that skips to the next decision or unread text so you can quickly unlock different endings.\n\nThe ending didn't give me an explosive feeling like I did with S;G/999 but it was tied up nicely and well worth the ride. There's tons of content in this game that can easily extend to 60-70 hours+(I still need to unlock everything). Overall, I would rate this an 8/10; it gave me a great experience and I would recommend it to anyone who's a fan of mystery and drama VNs.\n\nPros:\n-the ride was great\n-in-depth characters\n-twists were shocking\n-multiple endings\n-jun best girl\n\nMid:\n-ending didn't stick out to me but that's subjective. still good overall.\n\nCons:\n-end pacing was long\n-a certain twist was kinda disappointing to me. ('N')\n-the romance of a certain character was sub-par", "timestamp_created": 1463097024, "timestamp_updated": 1463097073, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553221", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22922132": {"recommendationid": "22922132", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970897817", "num_games_owned": 1257, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2234, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463027903}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent game.

I've played them all, Never7, Ever17, Remember11, and also some other titles from the director of this novel that I wont mention because I dont know which is the copyright status of their translations at the moment (unofficial so probably not approved). Prior to this review, I have finished the game (all endings) and unlocked most of the epilogues. Needless to say, I'm also a big fan of Mr. Uchikoshi - and therefore his best friend maker of this game Mr. Nakazawa. So what to say....\n\nSpoiler warning\n\n\nBlick Winkel changed his pantaloons and was given a smaller role in this novel, but it's still there. Mr. Nakazawa loves to play with the 4th wall. Wether is Self, Mr. Spirit, Blick Winkel, or Santa Claus, it is always the same thing. So... if you have played another novel made by KID or Regista, you will know what to expect. This is a good point for those that didnt play any other novel from the same author, but for \"us\" avid readers it feels old quite fast.\nThe twists were all expected, so much so that I often had to shake my head in response to the hints in routes B and D while muttering \"Really? Is this it?\". Everything feels so simple, so... easy to figure out. It is clearly a more bland, easy going experience if compared to Remember11 or Ever17, it is closer to an anime than a proper visual novel of this genre. I was always expecting a new twist or a final revelation that never came. It feels a bit dull in the end.\nSome moments were a little cheesy, others were totally out of place. Route A is the best because its something that fans of the genre and the author know and expect\\respect, and its great for setting the mood. B feels a bit boring, has its unnecessary moments, classic anime reactions and characters with one note only, to be fair my least favorite despite the good twist, again easy to figure out. D was a bit of a mess, and characters once important were then forgotten in the background with 2-3 lines every hour or even less. The True Ending didnt satisfy me in the least. The Good Endings were fine, but still not really worth the effort because the outcome could be spotted from a mile away.\n\nOverall, I consider this one of the lesser titles that Mr. Nakazawa has created, if we speak about the storyline and characters. The bad endings werent so appealing too, R11 bad endings were terrifying and shocking in comparison, something that Root Double lacks. The \"main vilain\" is a joke, but it serves its purpose. I just wished that the info dumping part would end in route B instead of being dragged on till the very end of D, where any normal person would have noted what was important and could have figured out on his own the remaining answers. \n\nEven after the complaints, i recommend this title because its visually stunning, has great voice acting, good sound design, and it embodies a genre that absolutely needs to be ported on to Steam en masse. If you dont mind a very light hearted journey through the lives of nine people trapped in a laboratory dealing with all sorts of dangers and philosophical speeches, and you can get over some really stupid lines, you may enjoy this product. I hope many people get to love this genre so we'll all play new extreme escape adventures of great quality.", "timestamp_created": 1462755224, "timestamp_updated": 1478959497, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558914", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22871694": {"recommendationid": "22871694", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053382125", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2484, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483504191}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the better visual novels of the 'escape' genre.

I've spent a lot of time getting a bunch of bad endings - there are many of those in Root Double. You might find gathering them to be enjoyable, just like in Fate/stay night.\n\n[strike]Now, something that could be seen as a negative or even a positive depending on what you're looking for: It's kind of... \"straightforward\". The dialogue and narrative. It doesn't seem like the kind of story where you end up thinking hard about something deep that a character just said/implied. And yea that'll be a negative for some (like me). But that may or may not change with the later routes. Technically I've only seen one part of the VN.[/strike] Already proven false and I'm still far from done with the VN. So yea this is very promising.\n\nThe biggest surprise for me though is how intensely mysterious AND [u]creepy[/u] it gets at times. Really did not expect that. Scene transitions, music (some of the unnerving tracks are extremely effective), text effects, graphical effects, etc. All used very well, better than most translated VNs. I mean, to me at least, Root Double might as well have 'Horror' added as a minor tag to it. I'm impressed. Presentation-wise, the mysteries in this are really, really good. There's a sense of dread this VN gives you with its mysteries and I just love that stuff.\n\nAs it is, I'd highly recommend Root Double to people who enjoy mystery stories, such as the Infinity series and Zero Escape. I don't know how the story will pan out in the rest of the routes, but at the very least Root A is great.\n\nI'll probably make an update later after I'm done with the whole thing", "timestamp_created": 1462100610, "timestamp_updated": 1462312429, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583924", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22728833": {"recommendationid": "22728833", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997082109", "num_games_owned": 1162, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462222494}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0410\u0431\u0441\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0445\u044d\u0432! \u041f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043d\u044f\u044f \u0412\u041d \u043e\u0442 \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u0418\u043d\u0444\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0438 (Never7, Ever17, Remember11), \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0435\u0449\u0451 \u0442\u0443\u0442 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0442\u044c? \u041f\u043e\u043a\u0430 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e \u0434\u0432\u0443\u0445 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432 \u043e\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043b, \u043d\u043e \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0433\u0443 \u0441\u043c\u0435\u043b\u043e \u0440\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c. \u042d\u0442\u043e \u041e\u041d\u041e!", "timestamp_created": 1462043286, "timestamp_updated": 1462043286, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536461", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22723124": {"recommendationid": "22723124", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004752450", "num_games_owned": 285, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1234, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462022489}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a game that could have been a lot better if it were a little tighter - the 'after' portion of the game is amazing and some of the best writing/suspense I've seen in a VN outside of 999/virtues last reward, but at a certain point in the later parts of the game it begins to overstay its welcome and wallow in its own story.\n\nOnce the core mysteries are solved the game meanders for a significant time exploring characters in a way that feels superficial and forced when it could have just gone for the ending and provided a satisfying experience.\n\nThe other issue is the sense system, which is functionally a regular choice system where the choices are obfuscated. I really wish the game had just given the option to select the choices from the get go. The sense system does tie into the story but they sacrifice wayyyy to much in playablity for what it adds on that front.\n\nThe Xtend content (which full disclosure I've not finished) doesn't feel like it adds much to the story and is eminently skippable.\n\nThe game is worth a purchase, and is good overall (especially the first quarter where the setup, suspense and writing quality was better than almost any other VN I'd read) but only grab it if you are willing to accept a deeply flawed VN whose heart is in the right place.\n\nFor fans of Never, Ever and Remember this is MOSTLY better than those entries, the exception being that I think those games handle their twists and pacing better. I feel sad because if Takumi Nakazawa and Kotaro Uchikoshi had worked on this together instead of it just being Nakazawa I can't help but feel that with the setup it had this would have been a VN of almost unrivaled quality.\n\nEDIT: Just want to clarify and say that this game has so many negatives in my review because it fails to live up to its own potential, its still better than 70% of Visual Novels I've read.", "timestamp_created": 1462023774, "timestamp_updated": 1462024649, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.689830", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22721475": {"recommendationid": "22721475", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119209962", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1935, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464871674}, "language": "english", "review": "Finished Root A and in the middle of Root B right now and I'm loving it so far.\n\nI definitely prefered Root A (intense suspenseful mystery game) to Root B (Slice of life with segments of suspense) from what I've seen so far but together they make for a good game.\n\nWould recommend for fans of the Zero Escape series or Ever17 :)", "timestamp_created": 1462017360, "timestamp_updated": 1462017360, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568123", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22716730": {"recommendationid": "22716730", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072649127", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461994724}, "language": "japanese", "review": "xtend edition\u3092pc\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3081\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u306a\u3063\u3066\u5373\u8cfc\u5165\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u304c...\u82f1\u8a9e\u3070\u3063\u304b\u308a\u306a\u306e\u3067\u3053\u308a\u3083\u3042\u3060\u3081\u3060...\u305c\u3072\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u3082\u652f\u63f4\u3057\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044 \u304a\u9858\u3044\u3057\u307e\u3059...", "timestamp_created": 1461994770, "timestamp_updated": 1461994866, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.619371", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22709354": {"recommendationid": "22709354", "author": {"steamid": "76561198207387507", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 26, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461995775}, "language": "schinese", "review": "just beat it\nGOTY\n10000/10\n+ perfect, flawless, extraordinary, marvellous, phenomenal, THE game u must buy\n- ...what? u mean this game has cons? How DARE you say that?\n\n*****************************************\nOK, serious.\nNot like Mr. Uchikoshi, Mr. Nakazawa wasn't very active as a scenario writer after Remember11. He made several games but they didn't turn out to be a success even in Japan (I/O and M;Y). Mr. Uchikoshi attracted so much attention in the western world, while I think Mr. Nakazawa deserves more concern than what he has actually. Just as we buy some game because its dircetor is \"that\"  guy, this game \"Root Double\" worth buying because its Takumi Nakazawa who made it, for some people like me at least. \n\nFor people who doubt if Mr. Nakazawa's name ensures this game's quality, I would like to say \"Don't expect too much\", it's just a VN, and even a galgame, maybe there are some aspects in the game which won't fit your choice, but at least, I can promise u something, for sure:\n\n+ This is a whole ever17-style game using NONE of any tricks in any Infinity series game;\n+ There is NO TIME-LEAP or any trick related to time or parallel world. And magically, the core remains the same as Never7, Ever17 and Remember11.\n+ Surely, a lot of cliffhangers and twists, as usual.\n+ Only one TRUE END\n+ All mysteries and plotholes are clearly explained in the end, compared with ZE, Danganronpa, S;G or even I/O. Perhaps some explanations are not what u expect, but at least there is no meaningless plot.\n+ Social significance. I'm serious, the game puts a philosophical question about moral and society, which i have never seen in other games, and I adore this kind of question.\n\n\n\n******************\u4ee5\u4e0a\u662f\u7ed9\u9b3c\u4f6c\u770b\u7684\u3002***********************\n\n\nRoot Double\u771f\u7684\u662f\u6b3e\u597d\u6e38\u620f\n\n\u4e0d\u8fc7\u5176\u53d1\u552e\u5386\u7a0b\u5404\u79cd\u60b2\u50ac\uff0c\u4e00\u5f00\u59cb\u5c31\u7591\u4f3c\u88ab311\u5927\u5730\u9707\u63a8\u8fdf\uff08\u56e0\u4e3a\u4e3b\u7ebf\u5c31\u662f\u7089\u5fc3\u878d\u89e3\uff09\uff0c12\u5e74\u53d1\u5e03\u65f6\u4e2d\u6cfd\u5de5\u4e00\u9635\u731b\u5439\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u4f3c\u4e4e\u662f\u53cd\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e00\u5806\u4eba\u62ff\u56de\u6765\u89c9\u5f97\u6ca1\u5439\u5f97\u90a3\u4e48\u795e\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u90e8\u5206\u5267\u60c5\u8282\u594f\u592a\u5dee\uff0c\u5dee\u8bc4\uff01\u5173\u952e\u662f\u4e4b\u540e\u4e2d\u6cfd\u5de5\u5c45\u7136\u516c\u5f00\u627f\u8ba4\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4fee\u6b63\u5e76\u8ffd\u52a0\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u5267\u60c5\u540e\u5728ps3\u4e0a\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e2aXE\u7248\uff0c\u55ef\uff0c\u6539\u662f\u6539\u6b63\u4e86\uff0c\u90a3\u4e4b\u524d\u4e70\u521d\u7248\u7684\u4eba\u8be5\u600e\u4e48\u529e\u5462\uff1f\u4e13\u95e8\u5356X\u76d2\u4e70\u521d\u7248\u7684\u4eba\u4f1a\u600e\u4e48\u60f3\uff1f\u7ecf\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e00\u756a\u6298\u817e\uff0cps3\u7248\u4e5f\u6ca1\u5356\u51fa\u591a\u5c11\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u4e5f\u4e00\u76f4\u6ca1\u5f04\u51fa\u5565\u77e5\u540d\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e2d\u56fd\u54ea\u6015\u5bf9Infinity\u7cfb\u5217\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u89e3\u7684\u4eba\u90fd\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u77e5\u9053\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u3002\n\u4f46\u6211\u662f\u89c9\u5f97\u4e0d\u503c\u7684\u3002\u65e0\u8bba\u5982\u4f55\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e0a\u90fd\u548c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u65e0\u5173\u3002\u521d\u7248\u6700\u5927\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u800c\u4e14\u5b98\u65b9\u627f\u8ba4\u4e86\uff09\u662f\u5728\u8282\u594f\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u8ddf\u5267\u672c\u672c\u8eab\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u53ea\u662f\u73a9\u8d77\u6765\u53ef\u80fd\u6bd4\u8f83\u7d2f\u3002\u800cXE\u7248\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e00\u4e9b\u4e0d\u592a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5267\u60c5\u88ab\u6254\u8fdb\u4e86\u901a\u5173\u540e\u7684Xtend Mode\u91cc\uff0c\u800c\u771f\u76f8\u5927\u767d\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u5267\u672c\u5927\u5e45\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u6f14\u51fa\u6548\u679c\u4e5f\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4e0d\u5c11\u3002\n\n\u81f3\u4e8e\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u503c\u4e0d\u503c\u5f97\u73a9\uff0c\u8bf4\u771f\u7684\uff0c\u8981\u662f\u62b1\u7740\u83dc\u5e02\u573a\u6311\u6311\u62e3\u62e3\u7684\u5fc3\u6001\u7684\u8bdd\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u4f60\uff08\u975e\u8d2c\u4e49\uff09\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4ece\u53d1\u552e\u7ecf\u5386\u6765\u770b\uff0c\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u4f3c\u4e4e\u786e\u5b9e\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u7528\u592a\u8fc7\u671f\u5f85\u7684\u5fc3\u6001\u53bb\u73a9\uff0c\u518d\u8bf4\u4e00\u4e2agal\uff08\u8fd8\u662f\u90a3\u79cd\u76f8\u5bf9\u5ec9\u4ef7\u7684gal\uff09\u80fd\u73a9\u51fa\u5565\u82b1\u6837\u5462\uff1f\u6211\u4ec5\u80fd\u8bf4\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u6b3e\u4e2d\u6cfd\u5de5\u98ce\u683c\u7684In\u7cfb\u5217\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c31\u662fN7,E17,R11\u7684\u7cbe\u795e\u7eed\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5b8c\u6574\u3001\u6e05\u695a\u3001\u660e\u767d\u3001\u4e0d\u7559\u60ac\u5ff5\u5730\u8bf4\u5b8c\u4e86\u4e00\u6574\u4e2a\u60ca\u5fc3\u52a8\u9b44\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\uff0c\u6211\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5149\u8fd9\u70b9\u5c31\u80fd\u914d\u4e0aIN\u6b63\u7edf\u7eed\u4f5c\u7684\u540d\u5934\u3002\u800c\u4e14\uff0c\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u7528\u5230\u4efb\u4f55\u65f6\u95f4\u8be1\u8ba1\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u505a\u5230\u548cIN\u7cfb\u5217\u6b8a\u9014\u540c\u5f52\uff0c\u5b9e\u5728\u96be\u80fd\u53ef\u8d35\u3002\n\n\u54ce\u5440\uff0c\u53cd\u6b63\u4e70\u4e70\u4e70\u5c31\u662f\u4e86\uff0c\u4f60\u4eec\u518d\u4e0d\u4e70\uff0c\u4eba\u5bb6\u4e2d\u6cfd\u53ea\u80fd\u5929\u5929\u5bc4\u4eba\u7bf1\u4e0b\u505a\u80d6\u6b21\u7ebf\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u8981\u8138\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u4e86\uff01\uff08\n\n\n\u6700\u540e\uff0c@\u4e09\u5341\u5f20\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1461955842, "timestamp_updated": 1461955842, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.631926", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22685069": {"recommendationid": "22685069", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080141070", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7732, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483839783}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm only done with the first chapter of Root A, but I can safely say the amount of detail put into this story is astounding.

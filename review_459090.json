There are four party members available in this game. I ended up having the two characters that I initially disliked grow up on me (Kalden and Tiziana), as they had decent character development. The other two felt neglected and/or just plain boring, even though they were initially interesting when introduced. I totally DESPISED the ending.\n\nThe combats are fun as you unlock more abilities through story milestones. The game is relatively easy, even when playing on the hardest difficulty. I liked how, for a party-based real-time rpg I did not have to use tactical mode often to win battles. The drawback to that meant that fights were relatively simple and ended up being repetitive toward the end, being limited to 4 active abilities per character.\n\nThe skill tree has decent customization, and as the main character you get to pick an element for which you'll get some unique abilities that differ from those available to your allies. There's also an 'Ink' and 'Engravures' system, which, honestly, is rather bland.

It IS a visual novel but its NOT a RPG. Its all been a simple railroad through a (cutely drawn and animated) story. There are not even any dialog choices! There are no non-combat skills. Combat is - compared to e.g. Tyranny - pretty basic, with three elemental spells per character (depending on the mask the character wears) and very limited tactical options. There only seem to be autosaves (no manual saving). \n\nWhile the game strives to create a plausible pseudo-italian renaissance setting (with magic masks), it does not really succeed - mainly due to lack of background immersion. Tyranny starts with the same limited amount of background info, but fares much better in conveying the setting to the player.\n\nStill, you maybe want to give it a try and refund if you don't like it.", "timestamp_created": 1515191491, "timestamp_updated": 1515193035, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39065078": {"recommendationid": "39065078", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996310350", "num_games_owned": 912, "num_reviews": 158, "playtime_forever": 669, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515105163}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041c\u0430\u0441\u043a\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0430: \u041f\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0438 \u0438 \u0422\u0435\u043d\u0438 - \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430 \u0441 \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0442\u044b\u043c \u0444\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u043e\u043c \u0438\u0437 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u044f\u0434\u0430 \"\u0431\u044b\u0432\u0430\u043b\u043e \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0445\u0443\u0436\u0435\". \u0420\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f: \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0435 \"\u0434\u0430\", \u0447\u0435\u043c \"\u043d\u0435\u0442\". 5/10.", "timestamp_created": 1515105342, "timestamp_updated": 1515105373, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39037198": {"recommendationid": "39037198", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009714773", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2087, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 54, "last_played": 1515267095}, "language": "english", "review": "I picked up this game after having seen it at PAX and have not regretted it a moment since.

Well-defined characters. Fun combat. Interesting world. Incredible music. Definitely recommended. Sequel or I riot.\n\nLong Answer (trying to remain spoiler-free):\n\nI've played this game basically non-stop since I bought it. It's without a doubt a spectacular and lovingly-crafted story. All aspects of the game have been built around this. There is a massive tonne of lore, but you don't need it to understand what's going on. It will absolutely add fantastic depth to what you're experiencing however. The combat can be engaging or it can be a cakewalk. It is not a massive tactical hurdle to overcome, but (without giving much away) how combat in the game progresses serves to accentuate how both the story and the characters have developed.\n\nAs stated above the characters you meet are all well-defined and flawed people. You get to experience their journeys throughout the story and how said journeys contribute to the overarching themes that this game is putting forward.\n\nThe game is delivered with a great and detailed visual flair. Some wonky physics here and there with outfits, but it didn't distract me too much.\n\nThe sound delivers on all fronts all the time. Period. The voice cast gives it their all to help realise the characters they portray and the soundtrack is simply wonderful and on point. I'm a big sucker for this sort of thing so it definitely helped.\n\nThere are a couple of nitpicks I should mention in the interest of fairness:\n\nThe sheer amount of lore can hit you like a tonne of bricks at first. You just need to keep in mind that it is not necessary reading, although it is recommended to read most of the character-based stuff to get the most out of the story.\n\nThe companion AI is not going to please everyone. It occasionally got on my nerves, but it didn't turn out to be too much of a hassle. To be honest I just thought of every Neverwinter Nights/Baldur's Gate game I've ever played and it really didn't compare poorly. There are decent AI customisation options for those that get picky.\n\nFinally there is the accusation that the game railroads you. It absolutely does. But frankly (and this is from someone whose favourite game is still the Witcher 3), not every game needs to have multiple endings to be considered good. If you're interested in this game then chances are you're happy experiencing a good story and interesting world above all else. This the game delivers in spades.\n\nIt's clearly made by folks who are invested and passionate. They've got me hooked for a sequel. I certainly hope they make one.", "timestamp_created": 1515020701, "timestamp_updated": 1515020701, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38732243": {"recommendationid": "38732243", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009165370", "num_games_owned": 281, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 929, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514436398}, "language": "english", "review": "Quick Pros:\n\nGreat Characters\nBeautiful to Look At\nStory is Good\nEnjoyable Soundtrack\nCombat is Enjoyable\n\nQuick Cons:\n\nVery Linear Game with very little Exploration and no choices to be made", "timestamp_created": 1514369990, "timestamp_updated": 1514369990, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38700968": {"recommendationid": "38700968", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975978173", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514300782}, "language": "english", "review": "A great tactical RPG with strong worldbuilding, story and vocal performances.

It's not without it's flaws and it's not for everyone, but alltogether, it's one of those games you play till three am, then go to sleep upset that you have to go to work the next morning instead of playing more. The voicework, sound, story, setting, and certainly charchters are all exceltent, matched with colorful artwork. The combat is...tolerable? It's not what you'd be here for, anyway, and it can be entertaining, at times.

On one hand, it is clear that it was made with a lot of care; it has a unique look and world, and it truly tries to be something special. On the other hand, it clearly doesn't live up to the ideal that it strived for, with heavy flaws and too many things crammed into too small a game. It's difficult to recommend, since the main hook (the story, supported by the voice actors) just doesn't deliver in quality. The fact is, if you are tempted to buy this game off the premise, you'd do well to lower your expectations, in the same way you would if you watched an amateur play. Sadly, that is what Masquerada reminds me of the most.\n\nFor the details, we'll start with the positives. The game looks quite good, at least in terms of art design. The voice actors do a good job, as you would expect since the cast is well known in the VA business. The combat system is also pretty damn solid, with a focus on team synergy (sadly, the team only consists of three characters, but it's easy to overlook) in an ARPG-like way, but with a pause function (something like Dragon Age: Origins). You can set party AI behaviours, or take full control yourself; when you get used to the specifics, it makes for a quite engaging experience. As a concept, the story is actually pretty good and it does take time with the different characters, making sure that you know them, which results in some good moments.\n\nBut here's the major, MAJOR problem with the game: It railroads you. Hard. We're talking straight roads and thin corridors from A to B throughout almost the entire game. Anything else is either finding new masks (or Mascherines, as the game calls them) in order to get new ultimate abilities (ranking from pretty poor to decent) and some other, small upgrade items. Thing is, those are all marked with big, glowing circles on the ground, in a way that is almost insulting; no actual looting, just running around the levels looking for giant, multicolored circles in order to get the extras. Most of the circles are not items, however; they are lore drops. If you play Masquerada, I hope you enjoy reading, because there are a LOT of lore drops per level. Now, you could skip over them and probably get out fine, but a lot of the worldbuilding is done in the lore section. They didn't seem to be able to fit all the story in the actual game, so instead I imagine that they wrote it out and crammed it into the lore section. I spent more of the game reading than I did actually playing, as a result.\n\nWith all of that said, I think that all of those problems would have been at least tolerable if the story was as great as it could've been. However, it just isn't. The pacing is all over the place: in one minute, you are talking with your crew, basically being able to play with one hand; the other, you are zipping from place to place, while the main character puts together clues. Most of this is made through cutscenes, with some battles sprinkled in between - no dialogue choices, no agency, just going from cutscene to cutscene, going through a corridor to a glowing circle, and then another three cutscenes. Missions that would have been side missions in other games (like companion quests) are tinkered together with the main plot, with no choice if you want to do them or not. It's a game that acts as if it wanted to be a TV show. \n\nThe consquence of this is that everything feels overdramatic and awkward, because there is no space in between \"moments\" that happen. Even in the companion quests, everything has to be SUPER important ALL of the time - every cutscene has the characters sharing their innermost feeling, or sighing deeply, or screaming at eachother, or emoting about how much doubt they have. The frustrating thing is that some of those moments are truly good by themselves, but in the bigger picture they aren't allowed to actually stand out because something else superimportant has to happen in the next cutscene as well. If fleshed out properly, with proper time given each moment, I wouldn't be surprised if this game could've been 50 hours, if not more. And it probably should have.\n\nFor all my frustrations, there are good things hiding in Masquerada. It had promise, the characters are memorable and I don't necessarily regret having played it. But I can't with a clear conscience recommend it either.

Or an unbelievable cardboard caricature of a power-hungry evil dictator? Or just some angry, rampaging dragon that's angry because, well it's a dragon?\n\nNo one is like that in Masquerada. You may not agree with the primary antagonist, but you get to understand where she comes from.\n\nAll the characters feel grounded, from the heroes to the villains. They are people with believeable motivations, which makes the story soar.\n\nAnd the story is beautifully done. From the immersive world building and art design, to the dialogue of all the characters (all of it voiced), to the high quality codex entries.\n\nMany a time in RPGs I skip reading lore entries or books, but not in this case because they are so well written. Perhaps the secret is also that it is a journal lensed from the protagonist Ciercero's perspective. It helps you understand him better and makes us care about the characters and lore.\n\nIf you are looking for an open-world, multiple branching choice RPG with tons of replayability, this game is not for you. It is entirely linear (like some JRPGs), relatively short (12 to 15 hours), and has zero sidequests. You are playing not as an avatar of yourself, but as a inspectorre (think detective) set in a fantasy renaissance Venetian setting. It is his point of view and story, and he is a man on a mission.\n\nWhat you give up in terms of sprawling open world and a quest log full of entries, you get a tight storyline with well written believable characters that grow on you. I laughed; I teared up; I worried whether characters were going to die because I cared. \n\nCombat wise it was passable but the pausable real-time action is not a key highlight. For me at least.

'just another indie RPG'. If you've got the same impression from the game's description, please, hear me - it is anything but! Not 'just another' anything. By no means 'generic'. And not even an RPG (well, not what we usually call 'RPG'). And though it is (kind of) indie, it has basically none of the flaws usually associated with this tag. It is beautiful. It is polished. It has amazing soundtrack and VA (it is fully voiced, by the way).\nSo, about what it actually is.\nWitching Hour Studio did what I was hoping to see for a good long while. They approached the game itself as a mean to tell the story instead of way-to-popular approach: using the story to keep player from closing the game. It seems like a minor difference, but in fact it changes everything.\nIt is a story, in the first place. Beautiful, strong and completely linear narrative. And in this case I with no doubt put linearity as a 'pro'. Because not a once had I seen non-linear plot and choice-driven dialogs written at the level of a good book. Choices and branches simply put too many boundaries on the writers and the industry still has to learn to come over them.\nWell, with 'Masquerada' developers decided that they want to tell a story and got rid of everything that got in the way. And oh, they did it splendidly! Everything that works towards immersing player in the world, everything that amplifies emotional impact is refined to the point of perfection. Everything else is toned down and done well enough to neither distract nor cause any annoyance (well, save for companion's AI and checkpoint system. They actually CAN be annoying at times. Nothing too bad, though).\nI guess, it is quite obvious by now, that I absolutely LOVE this game.  \nIt is like all my prayers being answered:\n[list]\n[*] strong, entralling story with just the right measure of tragedy and comfort, despair and hope. It is way more, than I expected and way better than I can express. I'm sure to replay it more than once, just like I do re-read my favourite books. \n[*] beautiful, unique and very stylish world. Worldbuilding is fantastic. Society, (not)-religion (oh, how I love the way it is portrayed here! Most certainly not your generic Christianity/Greek mythology rip-off. And one of the most beautiful set of charnel traditions I've ever seen), politics and history, magic system - everything is beautiful and well-thought, everything fits together perfectly and contributes to the story. I highly advise reading all the Codex entries right upon finding them. Though, I think, the advice is unnecessary because of how wonderful the Codex itself is. It is not some paragraphs from schoolbook. No, instead it is protagonists' personal journal. It contains all sort of things: cold facts, dear memories, bits of philosophy, thoughts of things long gone and events now present.\n[*] wonderful, flawed, struggling, developing and very, very [i]alive[/i] characters. I loved them all. Their and their relationships' growth is absolutely believable and very touching (or, at times, heartbreaking). I've never acknowledged how forced and unnatural these things are in most AAA projects, till I played Masquerada. I've just thought something like 'well, games, genre, all the restrictions, you just can't expect book's level interactions here'. Now I know for certain - it can be done! And if choices need to be removed for this to happen - I personally am glad to send choices to hell. \n[/list]\nActually, this is already enough for me to like the game, but there is more:\n[list]\n[*] charming visuals. Living proof that you don't need bordering-real-life 3D (and cutting-edge graphics card for your players) to make the game truly beautiful and appealing. Animated comic-book styled cutscenes are also clever move, adding to overall impression.\n[*] fantastic soundtrack. Orchestra and choir and even in-game songs. The music is amazing by itself, but given it's match to the world's style and specifics of the world's traditions... I lack the words to express it. Just listen.\n[*] superb voice acting. Dialogs are fully and wonderfully voiced, I feel that it added so much to the characters' depth and overall perception. \n[*] Cicero Gavar. I know, I've said about characters earlier, but he deserves personal mention. Easily my favourite game protagonist and one of the best across other mediums. \n[/list]\nNow I need to stop with exaltation and say something about gameplay.\nPersonally I found it quite nice and entertaining. I've played on Storymode, though, so my opinion may be not the most worthy one.\nCombat is real-time with tactical pause, you've certainly seen enough of the kind. Two companions at one time, fallen party member can be resurrected right during the battle if you manage to channel long enough. Battles overall are fast-paced, positioning is quite important, skills are fun, varied and look nice. Some combos, if you manage skills carefully. No stats, no loot, no inventory, no grinding. Skill points are awarded for plot battles. You can choose an element near the beginning of the game, it defines available skills. Skills can be enhanced through not-very-big skill trees and easily respecked since certain point in the game. You can find new Mascherines on the locations, these will provide you with different ultimate abilities. Also you can find inks and engravings which will provide some additional benefits. That's about it.\nAt Storymode combat obviously was pretty easy, I had no need to actually setup party behaviour (there are some options that may be usefull on higher difficulties) or micro-manage the party, save for couple of battles, where companions were adamant about entering every single AoE (and there are quite a lot of AoEs!). On higher dificulties those suicidal tendencies may become annoying, I guess.\nI like so much how carefully every combat mechanics is woven into lore. It is a small touch, but it is so nice to feel during the combat that you are actually [i]in[/i] this world, adhering to its rules, feeling how your actions [i]fit[/i]. \nExploration is pretty straightforward: you see glowing circle - you go to it. Some are at open sight, to find others you'll need to do some walking around, but nothing too long or complicated. Personally I like this approach, since I still have nightmares about Deep Roads and endless doors and chests with nothing of interest (and my interest is lore) inside. Some can find it too easy and obvious - well, you've been warned.\nI also like how the tutorial is done - it is short story serving as a prequel to the main game. And even in tutorial you get lore, emotions and drama - to get you prepared for what awaits you in the main story.  \n\nMy review turned out to be an ominous wall of text, so TL;DR.\nPros:\n+ Story\n+ Characters (all of them and specifically protagonist)\n+ Worldbuilding\n+ Visuals\n+ [i]Soundtrack[/i]\n+ Voice acting\n+ Lots of well-written text in Codex\n+/-  Linearity and pretty lightweight gameplay (I think it is for the best, but some may disagree)\n- Companions AI\n- No manual saves.\n*If you are not well accustomed to high fantasy genre you may at first find yourself drowning in lots of Italian-esque terms. Brace yourself. It won't last long, though. Lore is given to you in thoughtful way, so after the first impact it won't be overwhelming. I am fan of the genre and had no troubles here, but I see how it may become an issue.\n\n'Masquerada' is beautiful, breathtaking and heartbreaking story with uforgettable, flawed, growing and alive characters set in unique and amazingly well-thought world. Visuals, VA and wonderful soundtrack greatly add to the experience, and nothing detract from it. Gameplay is solid even if not the deepest one.

It's beautiful, from the backgrounds to the character designs to the phenomenal voice acting to the music; I honestly cannot praise any aspect enough.\n\nThe battle system is tastical but never grinds to a halt. It's also a vehicle for the world building and so is everything else, because Masquerada never wastes your time. For example, the \"codex entries\" are not written like schoolbook texts. They are written by the main character and it's genius and refreshing. You get information about the world as seen through Cicero's eyes, and get information about him at the same time. I'm actually surprised this hasn't been done more often yet.\n\nThe world building is dense and everywhere, but never overwhelming (except maybe for the 'prologue', a separately playable tutorial that is thankfully not indicative for the game itself). There is no distraction in the form of sidequests, no long and confusing corridors that eventually lead to a loot chest. Open world games can be fantastic and fun, of course, but the balance between keeping you engaged in the story and distracting you with hundreds of markers on your map is very often a thin line, at least for me.\n\nIn Masquerada, there's only you and the characters and the story, and once it grabs you by the heart it's very difficult to take a break from it. There are no filler screens, nothing that doesn't further flesh out the world you are exploring or helps you understand what makes the characters tick or where they stand to each other.\n\nSpeaking of the story: you'll know some of the beats, some will take you by surprise. It's a story about redemption, about found family, about war and loss and coming to terms with your decisions and their consequences. There is death, but the game never crosses over into grimdark territory, never loses that spark of hope and humour. Cicero is now one of my favourite main characters, but honestly, there is not one character I wasn't emotionally invested in by the end, even the villains. They are just that human, that honest and *real*. The excellent voice acting does its part as well.\n\nThe love of everyone involved in this project shines through in every screen, in every line of dialogue, in every gorgeous musical note, and it's just a joy to experience them.\n\nI hope this wasn't too confusing.

A year and a half later I was totally eager to play the game and I'm so glad I took the time to sit down and try it out. \n\nPROS\n- The artwork is STUNNING. The details that exist in the world's environment, the character designs, the masks, all of it is wonderfully opulent and rich. The designs really work into the storyline, so no part of it really feels arbitrary. The animation sequences are done in an animated comic book format, which was really neat. \n- The story and lore are great! There are some people who complain that the story is discovery-driven, vs. hand fed to the user. I personally really liked that, since a lot of the main plot and snippets of lore are fed through dialogue sequences. If they had tried to cram more of the lore and backstory in the dialogue options, it would've been quite bloated and conversation-heavy. Instead you find bits and pieces of the game's lore and character relationships with the main character in little points around the map. Reading through them is completely optional and won't detract from the story, but provide a lot of richness to it. \n- Characters were enjoyable. They all start off a bit abrasive, but as you interact with them more, their depth and personal woes really come to light. Learning about the things that drive them and keep them going in that kind of society was a fantastic experience. \n- The game is mostly (or fully? can't completely recall) voice acted, with a great cast of actors who really bring the characters to life. The music was also wonderful, and I would generally recommend it as a whole soundtrack.\n\nCONS\n- The game is, IMO, fairly battle-light/clunky. The mechanics are there, in which you have a skill bar, skill tree, and basically auto-attack near enemies. There are some skills that require specific targetting, which was the clunky part for me since single-clicking targets in hordes was annoying. It was still FUN overall, just not the most refined aspect of the game. \n\n\nOverall, would highly recommend to anyone who enjoys solid stories and experiencing a game with enjoyable characters. If you're looking for something that's game-mechanic heavy, I wouldn't suggest it, but maybe watch a video or two to enjoy the sights and sounds of the game.", "timestamp_created": 1501876344, "timestamp_updated": 1501876344, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539336", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33902957": {"recommendationid": "33902957", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103916275", "num_games_owned": 1114, "num_reviews": 104, "playtime_forever": 1658, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501411646}, "language": "german", "review": "Storylastiges und etwas arg einsteigerfreundliches Iso-RPG\n\nMasquerada: Songs and Shadows ist sicherlich kein Spiel f\u00fcr jedermann. Das Game legt seinen Fokus definitiv auf die Handlung, Charaktere und Sagengut-Texte.

Daf\u00fcr ist die Story aber auch sehr spannend und die Charaktere wachsen einem schnell ans Herz. Und dank der gelungenen audiovisuellen Pr\u00e4sentation werden diese Vorz\u00fcge sogar noch mal multipliziert!

(one of these stories is also my favorite gay male narrative to come out of any media in almost a decade - so make of that what you will.) these are people who know their stuff and they execute it exceptionally well. \n\nthe game opens beautifully, pulls off well the common fantasy trope of dropping you into the middle of a complex universe with its own laws. at about an hour in, when you\u2019ve become accustomed to the game, you will probably begin to wonder if this is where the game plateaus - if (like many fantasy titles by bigger studios, even) the game will sort of, be impressive for this first stretch until it gets tiring, and the lofty worldbuilding will fall out from under it and crush the game under a lore slog that outpaces your desire to read it. i.e. impressive, for an indie game, A for effort, but ultimately too ambitious. i expected this! but for me, it never reached that point - such a pleasant surprise that this easily became one of my favorite games in recent memory.\n\ncombat is simplified, stylized Dragon Age - a little clumsy, although at least still very pleasant to look at. (disclaimer: i\u2019m vastly more interested in stories in games, and could usually care less about combat unless the two are integrated somehow. the game\u2019s story mode felt like a good balance to me - simple enough that i didn\u2019t struggle very much, not so simple that it felt like repetitive busy work.)\n\nwhich, of course, brings me to story - and i think the game\u2019s environment shines on its own, but the story is what really blows the doors off everything for me. it\u2019s Fullmetal Alchemist meets UNDERTALE, in a way - a starkly human war story with an incredibly vulnerable heart. i know \u201cindie\u201d is hardly a genre, but hear me out: much like UNDERTALE is so much more than the snappy jaunt through skeleton town it begins as, MSAS avoids the lofty, snooty, shallow narrative of political intrigue that so often plagues socially relevant stories full of complex lore. i think that deserves to be noted specifically - at many points, it would\u2019ve been very, very easy to fall into that trap, but MSAS keeps its feet planted firmly on the ground in a way that exceeds every other title i\u2019ve seen that\u2019s tried. the dialogue is tight and the message is clear - far from getting in the way, the wordy codex (usually presented as endearingly vigilant cicero\u2019s personal journal) flows with the direction of the narrative naturally. \n\nthis kind of dark storytelling can easily cross into the territory of either Edgy Kick-the-Dog Suckerpunch or that of Unchallenged Nihilist Escapism - MSAS on the whole does neither, balancing perfectly on the knife\u2019s edge with the sort of subtle, deceptive brilliance of all enduring fantasy stories.\n\nthe game\u2019s not perfect, but it was brave as hell - in my opinion, it paid off. well done.", "timestamp_created": 1496152890, "timestamp_updated": 1496152890, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.726296", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32055047": {"recommendationid": "32055047", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080317636", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1100, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492970203}, "language": "english", "review": "*Minor Spoilers* Alright, this game was fantastic.

Each character is believable and fleshed out, having been voiced by some of the top voice talents of the industry. The trials and tribulations faced by each character are also told in a way that makes the player reflect upon him/herself. I've found this both enlightening and engaging. At times, I'm even drawing my own life lessons from the character's reflections in the journals.\n\nIt took me a while to grasp the combos with the combat mechanics, but when I understood enough to be proficient, I've found myself having fun optimising my tactics.\n\nOne of my favourite things about the game, though, is how the character talking portraits during the dialogue sequences are set up. Each speaker's talking portrait during the dialogue is quite literally a camera pointing at the actual character's avatar animating in the world. This may be a small detail, or even to save work separating a high poly portrait vs a low poly avatar, but because the actions in the portrait are directly from the avatar, it makes the dialogue animations feel more intimate and authentic for me.\n\nAll in all, if you're looking for an open world RPG with branching plotlines, look elsewhere. If you like an engaging story, with believable characters that take themselves seriously, and don't want to fiddle with complicated mechanics, this would be right up your alley.

I love this game so much.\n\nI have had this game in my Library for a while. I've watched the trailers for it and I figured it was a good game to make an investment in. But not until recently have I been actually able to play it for myself and truly experience it. I have to say this is absolutely one of my favorite games I have ever played. And it's really saying something since I don't usually have such strong feelings about games nor do I play that many in the first place. \n\nFirst I love the style that the game is in from the 3-D elements such as the character models the the more handrawn looking elements as well. It is such a pleasing style that blends these two elements together. Not to mention the world building and the characters themselves. I just love everything about the artistic approach to this game and it is certainly pleasing to look at. \n\nNext the story. God the story. I don't even know if I can put into words how much I love the story in this game. Not only to the stuff that we hear in game but all of the notes and Codex pages you can gather! Now I'm not usually one to try and read up on all the lore of a game if I am to collect pages and stuff but this game is just so engaging and interestingthat I just couldn't help but want more information! I took great pleasure reading up on all the pages that I have collected.\n\nAnd let me gush about the fact that the game is completely voice acted, the character protraits actually move and are animated when major dialogue comes up, and just the whole animating of the characters! I love that the whole game is voice acted instead of bits of voice acting and then radio silence from the characters before coming to another part where they are speaking again. It was so wonderful and interesting to listen to. The dialogue was wonderful no doubt about that! It was all so well written. It was funny, it pulled at your heart strings, witty, serious, all sorts of things. Not to mention how much voice acting talent there is and how wonderful everyone pulled off their characters.\n\nHonestly there is so much I could just gush about with this game. It is such a wonderful game I do hope that another Masquerada game comes out in the future. The set up is there and I'm sure that was the intent. I would love to see Cicero and the gang come back for more adventure around Ombre. Find out more about the about the past with the Gods and the Lady that we where introduced to. More about the Fey and the Mascherines and the Deminticate (i believed that's how it's spelled off the top of my head but I could be wrong) as well as this supposed impending Cataclysm. I want to see how Ombre rebuilds itself after everything. I want to know what happened to Damien. I want to know what plans the Lady has for Cicero. I want so many things and learn more about this gorgeous, well-developed, interesting world that I have been introduced to.

However, the story is linear and there are no sidequests. You also cannot return to rooms you've previously visited, so you have to make sure you've explored the whole place before going to the next one. If you're the type of RPG player who likes exploring the world, talking to NPCs, and doing sidequests, this is not for you. However, there are optional dialogues with some of the main characters.\n\nIf you don't like reading, this may not be the game for you. But I liked how very deep and well thought out the lore is, and the codex is massive! If you don't want to delve much into the storyline, then I guess you can ignore that. All dialogues between the characters have voiceovers, and one particular detail that I liked was how there's a 3D animated portait of the character as it speaks, with a banner in the color of their affiliation. Most of the game is in 2D art, but it's intricately designed and very detailed, especially the comics-style cutscenes. The soundtrack is also beautiful.\n\nThe combat is a bit complicated to master, but it helps that you can reset your skill tree and practice at the training grounds. You can try different ability combos among your party members and once you've found the best strategy that works for you, the battles are a bit easier to finish. However, I didn't care much about the stances and it didn't present any issues for me in the game.\n\nThere are still a few bugs in terms of achievements that the developers are already addressing (they respond promptly in the forums).

A hidden gem.[/h1]\n\nDefinitely a hidden gem. I first heard about this game when browsing Steam and right off the bat the art-style, gameplay, story \"rich\" content, and of course, the VAs instantly caught my attention. I downloaded the demo and enjoyed what I had played. It took me a while to purchase the game, but I am glad I did.\n\nFirst off, this game is not meant for somebody wanting an in-depth RPG with a \"high quality\" combat system that focuses on exploration and dialogue choices. This game is strictly linear where the game pushes you in one-direction and only that direction. There are no side-quests and all the dialogue is used to tell the story that they are telling. There are no \"choices\" during conversations that affect the direction of the conversation. As much as I enjoy games with options such as that, there is also room in the gaming world for games that control what you do. This is a perfect example of that. (If you're expecting something else, then don't buy it. Or buy it and refund it if you don't enjoy it.) This game is almost an \"interactive story.\" And it is an amazing story. There is never a dull moment during the game and it isn't too short as too feel rushed and not too long as too feel drawn out. It was almost as if I was playing a book. There is a lot of dialogue betweens the characters and a lot of text if you choose to read the lore. The lore surrounding the world is actually interesting and collecting the tidbits of knowledge around the areas opens the world up and draws you in)\n\nThe Voice Acting is superb. This game has amazing VAs all-around excluding the obvious Matthew Mercer and Jennifer Hale.\n\nThere really isn't much I don't enjoy about the game. However, as most other reviewers point out, the combat isn't perfect. I personally didn't have many problems. I played on normal difficulty and, for the most part, it was pretty seamless (I could see hard being harder, obviously, but I don't think it would be too bad). It actually became pretty easy towards the end. I didn't have much micromanaging to do because I was able to build my companions to pretty much self-sustain themselves (Kalden is a great face-tank and has amazing AoE heals). That just left me to focus on using my abilities. I sometimes needed to control my companions, but that wasn't too often and it almost always worked out well. \n\nLastly, collectibles are a bit sporadic. It wasn't too bad and they were spread out far enough to allow you to read and not tire of reading the lore bits. However, the placements of the seemed pretty random, for the most part. Not a big deal though.\n\nIn the end, the game was amazing and I definitely recommend it to anyone that enjoys a game focusing on story.

The game provides a battle system and character customization system that are deep enough to provide replayability and require strategic decision making, while not being overwhelming like other games in the genre. In addition to that, the game allows you to reset your skill points halfway through the game and rebuild your characters, which I found helped a great deal. The story is engaging and even surprising at times, and the passion of the creative team is evident throughout. The voice acting is overall very, very good. The art is gorgeous, and the soundtrack is well-suited to a game that takes place in a world with culture and magic built on the ideas of art and music. The battle system is real-time but pausable and has several levels of strategy that the player must take advantage of be successful, but again without being overwhelming. The length is good (~15 hours).\n\nThere are a few cons for the game, of course. First and foremost, there is absolutely no \"exploration\". The game is extremely linear and always tells you the direction to go to the next cutscene and/or battle. It is reminiscent of a game like Final Fantasy 13 in this way, where you are always just following hallways to the next event. At first this was not a big deal but gets repetitive as the game moves forward. The lore of the world is built through journal entries by the protagonist, so there's a ton of expositional reading if you want to truly understand what's going on. The storytelling does break the rule of \"show and don't tell\" all the time, and by the end I simply stopped bothering. The dialogue is written in such a way as to require this exposition in order for the player to grasp what's going on, and you can't always get everything out of a conversation from the context. Finally, there are elements of the character interaction that pull me out of the story (the two main male characters become best friends within a few hours of meeting each other, for instance). \n\nThose issues aside, it's a wonderful experience and worth the time for anyone who wants to play through an engaging and surprising story with beautiful music and art, deep character customization, and an interesting (if someone repetitive) battle system.

There's still some minor char-development in the form of small skill-tress and a handfull of \"gear\"-choices (inks, masks, etc.) but none of this is in anyway even close to what old IE games or the fantastic new Obsidian games (Pillars, Tyranny) offer.\nCombat works just like you would expect: realtime with the option to pause and issue commands for your up to three-man(woman) team...yet again it's all very toned down from classical rpgs. \nWhich doesn't mean combat is bad; there are actualy some realy engaging mechanics and encounters to find here; positioning and interupting aswell as skill-synergies do play quite a role in higher difficulties and seeing everything work together is quite a joy.

There's so much dialogue, character interactions, lore and plot to be found that it sometimes even outshines older classics; all set in an quite interesting \"fresh\" feeling scenario.\nWhat begins as a mere criminial-investigation turns into so much more; you see characters grow, change and develope. A lot of the content is definitly focused on more mature players (which is a good thing) and rarely feels forced (which is a quite a feat seeing as how some rather \"spicy\" topics are touched upon). \n\nThe amazing(!) soundtrack, great voice-acting and beautiful art-style do the rest and make this one the most enjoyable story-driven-games i played in along time.

Capped at 15 hours or so, even with time spent reading codexes and messing around.  \n-  Very linear.  It's not like most modern RPGs where you will spend time making choices.  Other than picking companions for battles and quests, the protagonist makes his own choices.  It plays out more like a drama than a game sometimes.\n\nOverall, it's just very well done.

I hadn't really known what to expect when going in; all I knew was that there were masks, political upset, and powers. I'd expected a passing fancy that I'd play once, and then totally forget about.\n\nMan, I have never been to happy to be wrong before.\n\nImmediately upon starting the game, I was in love. Even just sitting at the title screen, you're presented with vibrant, luscious artwork, and absolutely beautiful music. No lie, I ended up sitting there for about five or six straight minutes just listening as I tried to settle on a name for my save file. It gave me high expectations for the actual meat of the game, and I was not disappointed in the least. The world it's set in is beautiful and intricate, colorful and lively and a very welcome change from the grimdark palette most games I've played have been taking. The settings are done in an almost painterly style, full of life and detail and which never get boring to look at. Even background characters add to it, with ambient dialogue ranging from easter eggs to snide comments about your character to the unlucky life of a shiv. It's hilarious and engaging, and I found myself wandering back and forth quite often, to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nThe story is fascinating; you start off searching for a missing person, and uncover secrets that threaten to shake the very foundations of society. I described it to my friend, the one who convinced me to get the game, as \"everything happens so much\", and I stand by that statement: much in the way that all good stories do, the stakes keep rising and rising until it feels like they can't anymore, at which point they keep going. It made for a very tense, exciting playthrough, and even replaying it now I'm noticing things that I missed the first time around.\n\nAs much as I love the story itself, it's the characters that seal the deal for me. They aren't just cardboard cutouts for the player to paste themselves into; these are fully realized beings with complicated pasts and personalities, and they are so, so flawed. They're allowed to be human, instead of paragons of perfection, and so I was almost immediately invested in their stories and what was happening to them. Not to mention, their interactions and the way their relationships develop is so natural and organic, it's endearing to see happen and absolutely had me hungering for more. \n\nAlso, the cast absolutely knocked it out of the park with these roles. Matt Mercer is a fantastic actor anyway, but his portrayal of Cicero was incredible here. Jennifer Hale is a force to be reckoned with, of course; I'm honestly starting to think the way she played Lucia may be becoming my favorite of all her roles. And I don't think I knew much of Rick Wasserman before this game, but the way he lent his voice to Kalden was absolutely heartbreaking and amazing. Absolutely outstanding. And those are only a few names. \n\nI've noticed a few folks complaining about how linear the game is; personally, I appreciate it a lot. It's so easy to get lost with an open world, and to forget the track of the story. I think I put over 100 hours into a (different) game before I remembered I was supposed to be working toward a goal; linear gameplay works incredibly well for this game, because the sense of urgency and foreboding is ever present and looming. If world exploration is your argument, the game provides by way of codices you can find, that both enlighten and enrich the setting and reasonings for why things are the way they are. They're unobtrusive and don't distract from the story, and can be read at your own convenience. \n\nHonestly, I could gush forever about this game, but I think this covers most of it. There is not a single thing I don't love about Masquerada: from the color, to the setting, to the sounds, to the characters, everything was done so carefully and precisely that you can feel all the love and care they put into this game.

And honestly, I didn't know how much I wanted a strictly linear RPG with good storytelling and a relatively good combat system until I played this.  100% of the focus of the game is on telling an enthralling and well voiced story, and the battles fought are never grinded or anything other than planned out.\n\nThis doesn't mean that the battle system is perfect, it's real time with pause and there's some minor problems with getting characters to move / do exactly what you want when you want, but I've been able to play the whole game on Hard and after the verrry beginning of the game it's seemed to all rely on good tactics and character skill selections.  The only serious problem I've had is the NPCs really wanting to run straight into AoEs.

The world of Masquerada is intricate and beautifully, thoughtfully realized, and every time I played I found something new to enjoy about it. The plot, too, takes innumerable twists and turns, yet you never get lost, just staying hooked as the mystery of Razitof Azrus's disappearance takes your main character, Cicero Gavar, deeper and deeper into the core of his society. \n\nBut the characters are the real heart and soul of this story. From Tiziana learning forgiveness, to Cicero confronting his past, to Kalden bravely revealing his true self to a society that has forced him to stay hidden, every character undergrows stunning growth throughout the course of the game, contributing to an overall positive message that mutual support and acceptance is desperately needed in order to make a better world. This is truly a diverse cast of characters, with multiple races, disabilities, and sexualities being presented in a positive light, and yet it never comes off as tokenism. Most importantly, the characters are allowed to be human, to make mistakes and to struggle, and I'm hard-pressed to think of another story that accomplishes this so effectively. \n\nWell, well worth the $20 I spent, and I am anxiously hoping to hear news of a sequel.

What it lacks in length and character path choices is made up for tenfold by its strengths.  Not only is it visually and musically beautiful, but the story is deeply moving and complex in all the right ways.  The worldbuilding is breathtaking, not just because of its depth, but also because it doesn't look or feel like a standard fantasy story that is ultimately just another Lord of the Rings derivation.  It has a spark all its own.  On top of that, the characters are more diverse than any game I've played to date and that diversity is handled so well that no one is left feeling tokenized.  The voice acting is on. point.  The storytelling is twice as compelling as it otherwise would be if not for the way it has been delivered by the cast.  If you want your still-beating heart ripped out repeatedly by the anguish in someone's voice, this is the game for you.\n\nIn terms of game mechanics, it's the isometric style found in games like Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights, Shadowrun, Pillars of Eternity, etc., but with its own little twists that fit with the themes of the game.  Fighting stances matter, for example, and each character's mask has a unique power that charges as you fight.  The game's difficulty is not, I think, at any point at the same ridiculous levels of hard that many other games of the genre seem to exude.  This game can be comfortably played by those who would rather not deal with the stress of highly difficult combat.  Or those who would.  The difficulty option is there.\n\nMy one and only objection is a small one, and that is that you can't save at will.

And I came back pleased.\n\nLet's start things positivly.\n\nThe story, setting, and the characters are well written. There times where I felt happy and actually smiled. Other times, I felt sorrow. RPGames that manage to do this, to me at least, is a rare thing.\n\nThe cast of characters are memorable. Their personalities is what makes them truely shine. And, the fact that each of the main characters have a past and have flaws, that they eventually overcome them, makes them more believable. Not to mention they're fully voiced.\n\nAs for the setting, I found myself in new foreign world filled with lore, which players can read at anytime, and locations that have been beautifully made.\n\nAnd I should not forget about the music. MY. LORD. I'd dare say it's ear candy.\n\nAnd now, sadly, the cons. \n\nThe game doesn't have a save slot feature, just a check point system. You can also pick different chapters, but it's not the same.\n\nThe battle system is a bit tricky to get. And your compainions' AI, despite being able set different tactics with them, can be a bit wonky. It may be best to manually control them.\n\nFor such a beautifully made world, you sadly can't fully free roam it. You basically have to fallow a set path and go where the game tells you to go.\n\nThis game, in my opinon, is a diamond in the rough. While the replay value is somewhat low, and hard core RPGamers may shrug it off or just see the flaws at first glance, this game is like a bed time story.

Here's my quick run-down:\n\nNarrative and story are clearly where the bulk of the energy went.  And it's a really good story. key to that are:\n---- 1) wonderful world-building: start from the premise of \"Renaissance Venice\" + \"Avatar: the Last Airbender\" and that'll get you most of the way.  Do yourself a favor and read all the codex entries you find - they explain a lot of why you're in certain places or why the characters have particular reactions.  It's very text-heavy, but very rewarding.  Really want to play in this world as a tabletop rpg.\n---- 2) superb voice-acting.  The game's dialogue is fully voice-acted and they hired professionals, and it shows.\n\nCombat gameplay is... frenetic: basically, it's tactical and real-time w/ pausing to issue commands, and frustrating because the AI takes over very quickly.  I would recommend you do a mixture of the following:\n---- 1) If you want to focus on it as a story game, vow to never pause.  Start the game on the easiest setting, customize the AI behaviors. Once you get used to issuing commands quickly you can ratchet up the difficulty.  Focus on playing combats as the protagonist and think of when you switch to other characters you're Cicero issuing commands.\n---- 2) if you want to focus on it as a tactics game, take a look at some of the auto-pause functionality and turn off the AI entirely.  Every couple of seconds, pause and issue new commands.  Start on hard difficulty, focus on synergies (e.g. the tags and between different characters' abilities).   \n\nExploration gameplay is... like going to an art gallery.  The environments are gorgeously rendered, but there's little interactivity and often you don't get to revisit environments once you've advanced to the next one (with some exceptions).  On the one hand, it's really easy to find individual objects (they're highlighted with giant beacons).  But on the other hand, you only get one chance to find each thing.  It would be helpful if the devs made it easy to figure out where you missed a codex entry or mask or ink or engraving or whatever. Maybe that's in there (you CAN go back and revisit subchapters you've already played), but I didn't see it.\n\nCharacter optimization is fun, in that there are like a bajillion ways to customize each character (different abilities, different inks/engravings/masks). The game is well-designed enough where the abilities are roughly equivalent in power AFAICT, so you're free to choose the ones that seem cool (air squirrels FTW).  Unfortunately, a lot fo the game's mechanics are not spelled out.  What does Vulnerability do?  My assumption is that it means you take more damage.  That might be buried in a codex entry, but it'd be helpful if there was a little pop-up when you mouse over it.\n\nOverall, I liked the game a lot, but I love narrative-heavy games.  Masquerada was certainly worth the $1/hour I spent playing it. I do wish that the investigation element, which is so crucial to the plot, was better expressed in the gameplay.  \n\nIf what you want is a deep narrative-heavy experience in a wonderfully-realized world and you're cool not having a whole lot of narrative agency, Masquerada is awesome. Take your time to savor the parts of it where the devs really put their focus - narrative and world-building (read the codex entries).  If what you want is an open world that you can freely explore with super-crunchy gameplay, skip this one.  \n\nThat said, my recommendation is a conditional but enthusiastic yes.\n", "timestamp_created": 1479339586, "timestamp_updated": 1479339586, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26595657": {"recommendationid": "26595657", "author": {"steamid": "76561198216890093", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479120888}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u753b\u9762\u582a\u79f0\u5b8c\u7f8e\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u771f\u7684\u6709\u70b9\u7f3a\u4e4f\u3002\u975e\u5e38\u559c\u6b22\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1479104823, "timestamp_updated": 1479104823, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535928", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26564316": {"recommendationid": "26564316", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002542208", "num_games_owned": 195, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1250, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478910198}, "language": "english", "review": "This has been one of the best emotional fieldtrips I have ever had through a Video Game.

I find the stylized visuals to be well put together and fitting with the theme the game is aiming for, even though some of the textures are rather low detail. The visuals of the characters actually remind me of Abyss Odyssey in a way I can\u2019t really explain, but just so things are clear, that is a plus in my book. The animations themselves look really smooth but they seem a little off place in comparison to the 2d background, and that took me a while to get used to.\n\n[h1][u]Story[/u][/h1]\n\nThe game takes place in Ombre, a country widely known for its exotiqueness and magic. On the other hand, what really distinguishes it from the rest of the world is the use of masquerines, which grant its wearers control of the elements. Given the scarceness of these masks, Ombre\u2019s society was divided into several factions, guilds and whatnot, and this is pretty much what shapes the entire storyline. That said, at first I felt like the game didn\u2019t really do a good job in explaining what was going on and who you are but, slowly, everything started to make sense (reading the codex entries helps a lot). The tutorial, which teaches you the basics of combat, also serves as a prologue to the events of the rest of the game, which takes place 5 years after. I feel like even slightly resuming the initial part of the plot could potentially spoil some people so I\u2019ll refrain myself from doing so. All you need to know is that this game pretty much has it all, from an enduring political conflict in a society characterized by huge disparities in terms of social and political structure to ever enduring friendships, betrayal, loss of loved ones, intrigue, mystery and the discovery of the secrets behind an old civilization. Not only the world but each individual main character is very unique and interesting in their own way, offering a different vision of the world that surrounds them. The game does have some jokes here and there, the overall theme of the game is rather grim and dark, but it does have its cheerful moments.\n\nThere is a lot to be said about the game story and its world building, and I do really mean A LOT. There\u2019s tons of codex entries that you can collect and read, which provide an insightful look to Masquerada\u2019s world, its locations, history, characters, culture and factions. The writing is exceptionally well done, and reading these is a joy and it certainly helps in getting you more immersed into the world and understanding everything that is going on in greater detail. When reading these, I often found myself lost in thought wondering about this place, imagining how the places it described really looked, how I\u2019d fit in, what I\u2019d do in order to change it for the better and so on. I really found it very hard to not lose track of time when playing Masquerada. \n\n[h1][u]Gameplay:[/u][/h1]\n\nThe worst thing in Masquerada for me, or the least good part of it, depending on how you see it, is the actual gameplay. While playing the game you\u2019ll either be in combat or walking around these closed areas trying to get from one point to another. In the latter, you can find codex entries, upgrades for your characters but also other people talking to each other about their everyday life or about more important events. These interactions are sadly not voice acted, while the main dialogue is, which is a shame given that the voice acting is actually really really good. \n\nCombat is fought in real-time but you have the option to pause. While in other games pausing would give you an advantage, in the sense that you could plan your approach and use your abilities in the best way possible, I didn\u2019t find the need to do so in Masquerada, for I found the combat to be rather shallow and basically a spam fest. I must say the combat really disappointed me because, initially, it looked liked it had a lot of depth to it, with different possible combos with the various elements and other mechanics such as different stances that change how fast you can use your abilities and how much damage you deal/take. It\u2019s also worth saying that the abilities that you have will be unlocked with points that you\u2019ll get as you play through the game so there is some room for you choose what you think it\u2019s best. Then there\u2019s also your masquerine ultimate ability, which varies depending on the masquerine you have equipped at any given time.\n\nOne particular mechanic which I found to be really neat is the ability to set your companions behaviour, in the sense that you can tell them what skill should they use and on who. For example, you can make it so that they target the enemy with the lowest amount/highest amount of HP. Still, if you want, you can completely disable this entirely.\n\n[h1][b][u]Overall thoughts:[/u][/b][/h1]\n\nWhat the game offers in terms of story, world design and visuals, compensates the lack of depth of the combat system and overall gameplay, which really hurts how I overall feel about the game. Masquerada could pretty much just be an adventure game stripped of all the combat and it still would be just as good. That said, I do appreciate the fact that it was rather easy, for it allowed me to progress faster through the story without having to worry with my opponents. Still, just when I was starting to feel that the game was extending itself, it just suddenly got even more interesting and hooked me even more.\n\n[h1][b]If you\u2019re looking for a superb story with a unique range of characters, each with their own ideals and visions, and an interesting, intriguing and believable world then Masquerada might be just the right game for you. If, however, you\u2019re looking for a challenging experience or something that offers a lot of depth in terms of combat, or pretty much any other form of gameplay mechanic to keep you hooked for that matter, you might find yourself rather disappointed.[/b][/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1478896969, "timestamp_updated": 1479927767, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.718970", "comment_count": "10", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26518829": {"recommendationid": "26518829", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984141578", "num_games_owned": 214, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 715, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478784582}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is an exemplary RPG, with a brilliantly executed storyline that matches its beautiful and immersive setting. \n\nWhat greatly stuns me is how much this game gets /right/ that I found lacking in other games. Its in-universe lore - using familiar concepts of a built in 'codex' to explain concepts, collected by investigating objects of interest or eavesdropping on random conversations - is rich and detailed, yet not overly slapped in your face. The story itself is so strong, you find yourself wanting to quickly brush up on the protagonist's thoughts in his journal, or reading up upon what 'Media' means. (Not the press.) While in other games I found no need to touch the 'lore' journals, as most formulaic fantasy settings allow me to quickly work out the one or two differences in how 'corrupt church' 'drunk mining stubborn dwarves' fit into their world. In this rich, Venetian-inspired, creative and original setting, I was enchanted by its design and found myself eagerly learning as much as I could as I explored it.\n\nWhen I say explored, it is more truly like being led through a story. Being fond of books, I'm no stranger to the idea of a well done start from chapter one to the finale, but most games that take this approach rely so heavily on a complex-yet-standard RPG system to do their work for them. Instead, writing is prolific, the voice acting is superb and touching, and the dialogue is plentiful. The protagonist is no copy-paste blank you-are-this-man type, but an interesting hero with his own displayable flaws and merits. I found myself able to relate to some of his issues quite a bit, so he came to me as a very excellent protagonist to walk through the story.\n\nThe companions' 'plot lines' are not done in a side-quest format (in fact, there is a total lack of side quests or backtracking entirely) but instead are part of the development of a story, not used as filler but as fuel to drive the narrative forward. It's refreshing to see such a traditional approach to writing rather than a rather shy walk around the issue of 'we don't want to bore the player' circle of laziness. The first companion I thought of as mildly interesting grew on me - a little at first, and immensely by the end. Every other companion, regardless of my first impression, eventually became such a strong and interesting character that I was pleased to hear everything they said and see their part in the story.\n\nThe music is by Josh Whelchel, whom I had encountered over a decade ago in the little-known 'Spirit Engine' series of side-scrolling RPGs. His music then was excellently suited to the them (with over 70 tracks being produced for the first game) and were so catchy, I still have them today. His music in this is drastically different in style, but suits the game to a tee. It perfectly suits the intrigue-filled tale, the very latin-inspired choral musics accompanying the folk music of violins, harps, and flutes to complete its 'medieval Italian' dark fantasy theme. The soundtrack, as well, has about 40 tracks, so it is well worth the price.\n\nThe art is gorgeous and simple, the backgrounds being splendidly well done, and the characters shown in a sort of cel-shaded manner with a Disney or Dreamworks-like drawing style, in the manner of the classic 2D style. I found the art style refreshing, and it belies the plot's sometimes dark or sinister twists in quite a (pleasantly) jolting manner. \n\nAs for the story, I won't go into any detail about it as discovering it without spoilers is an excellent way to experience it. The 'blurb' of the game you find in the steam store is sufficient enough to see if it piques your interest, but I assure you the writing is of the highest quality, the story strong from start to finish. I have never found a game which so excellently used the tutorial as a fascinating story hook.\n\nCombat is very good, reminiscient of Baldur's Gate, Pillars of Eternity or Dragon Age in that one can switch between up to 3 characters, pause at any time to issue orders, let A.I. control your allies (with customizable priorities for energy usage and when to use their abilities) or just letting yourself manually control each aspect, although I did find myself wanting to manually control my companions more than once on occasion. There is no inventory or buy/sell system, instead customization is done with a very nice and transparent skill tree (for each character) and with ultimate abilites stemming from which Mask you currently have equipped. Multiple masks can be collected for every character and are an important part of mixing and matching.\n\nI completed the game on Normal yet still found the combat a meaty challenge, I am rather sure Hard offers an excellent point for replayability (the other point being to completely collect all optional codex entries and masks, for a full-achievement run.) In addition, since different companions can be used at different times in the story, a replay allows you to see the dialogue of other characters in a previously played through segment. For example, I was very surprised that my healer had plenty of dialogue in a segment where I could have had him swapped out for my other characters.\n\nAll in all, a fantastic game. My leisurely first experience was about 12 hours of game time, I am sure a complete run - or a run on hard mode - would take around 14-16.

Masquerada was something that I had tried an early build of back at PAX 2015, then backed when there was the Kickstarter call.  I remember being pretty impressed by the art and the feel of the world even back in the early alpha and was further intrigued when I saw the voice talent that got hired.\n\nEven so, I honestly wasn't expecting a whole lot.  It's been a while since I've had any story draw me in after all, and I guess I've gotten a little disillusioned with the story based indie game market.  However, this one grabbed me by the throat and had me doing a few ill-advised marathon sessions to finish the game because I just had to know how all of the plot threads were going to resolve.  \n\nTwo things really carry this game to greatness: its setting and its characters.  Ombre was a grand, beautiful and dangerous place that I never got tired of seeing more of.  The artists did a wonderful job of bringing various exotic styles and concepts to life.  Whether I was climbing the spiral staircases in the White Spire or scaling the Singing Tree, I was always excited to see what was around the corner.  However, what really sealed the deal for me was the little NPC conversations you can walk into, and the quality of the codex entries.  While it occasionally annoyed my completionist side to walk back and forth to see who talked and who didn't, the side conversation added a much needed extra oomph to the feeling that the Citte was a place of many different personalities and opinions.  Likewise, I read every codex entry that I got my hands on.  The writers made an interesting decision to have all the entries written from the perspective of Cicero, the main character, which added some lovely insights of the character's interior thoughts to the general world building.\n\nSpeaking of the characters, almost all of them were beautifully realized in both writing and performance.  I particularly liked watching Cicero through the course of the game, as Matt Mercer's performance was stellar as always, but Jennifer Hale somehow managed to surprise me again with how she played Lucia.  You'd think I'd be used to being impressed by her after all these years, but jeez, she did an amazing job.  It was immensely fun peeling back the layers of secrets back one by one, trying to figure out what each character was motivated most by, alongside Cicero.  There were actually several plot points that took me by surprise, in a non-bs way, which doesn't happen often anymore.  My only complaint is that Vasco kind of got the short end of the stick in terms of screen time.  He's the only one of the main party that I don't think got a super developed arc, though what was there was intriguing enough.  \n\nAs caveats, I realize that this style of story telling is not for everyone.  I absolutely love reading codex entries, as I mentioned above, and I think that the game would be quite a bit thinner if you aren't the type of person who finds that sort of thing interesting.  Likewise, the combat in the game is not bad, but it's certainly not the main draw.  AI for your companions is a little wonky sometimes, but I didn't have the patience to play it as a tactical RPG as I'm sure was intended.  I played on Normal, and got by in fights with minimal pauses, usually to reposition characters out of AOE effects.  If you're just looking for a super deep tactics game, this is probably not the game for you.  Perhaps it becomes more important if you were to up the difficulty to Hard, which I might do at some point.  Masquerada is also a relatively short game; I'd say it's 10-12 hours.  So if you're looking for something that will give you more than that, look elsewhere.  It's also a linear story.  This is not a downside in my eyes; the writers had fully defined characters and a plot in mind, so giving \"choice\" to the player is kind of... not necessary for this plot to work.  I feel like in the past few years, story driven games have gotten extremely enamored with the idea of \"choice in video games\", and it's kind of nice to have a game that realizes it doesn't need to shoehorn moral decisions and a paragon/renegade bar in to tell a good story.  In terms of bugs, I found two typos and had one screen loading error happen in my 14 hours of play, which I find totally acceptable.\n\nHowever, if you can put those caveats aside, I definitely recommend picking this game up.  It's been a while since I've had this much fun just exploring a -good- story.  Load it up and get sucked into Ombre for a few hours.  Thank you so much Witching Hour!

If you play games for the story and characters, buy this now. If you're looking for a sprawling sandbox with a deep combat system, you might want to look elsewhere -- but I'd still encourage you to give the game a try, just to get a glimpse at some of the storytelling and see if it's your cup of tea.\n\nAt its heart, Masquerada wants to tell you a story. It plays like a book or movie with some combat sprinkled in, and while it is extremely linear, there is a great deal of charm and heart in the game that more than makes up for its flaws. The tale takes place in a fantasy mirror of Renaissance Italy that is recovering from a tumultuous civil war between the Costadani, who are commoners, and the Masquerada, who are the 'nobility' that wear magical masks to tap into the powers of the elements. \n\nThe characters are well written and come alive as the story progresses through action, mystery, and intrigue in an incredibly innovative and interesting world. The music didn't have me humming after closing out of the game, but it adds just the right amount of atmosphere when it's needed. The real aural gem is the voice acting; there are some pretty heavy hitters in the gaming industry doing some pretty astounding work, including Matthew Mercer (various games and anime) and Jennifer Hale (Bastila Shan, Fem!Shep, every cartoon you watched as a kid), and it makes the characters and story so much more engaging to play through.\n\nThe game is a little brief by RPG standards. I spent somewhere in the area of ~15-20 hours on the game while playing on hard, and that's probably an above average playtime. The strict linearity and lack of sidequests makes it so that there's rarely a dull moment in the plot as it strides forward, and you never have to deal with filler that isn't somehow meaningful to the characters, if not the overarching tale itself. Masquerada is rife with world-building and awesome lore, which is further expanded upon by a codex/journal that the protagonist writes in first person about the world and his experiences in it, which add additional layers of depth to the characters he interacts with, their history, his thoughts about current events, etc. \n\nThe gameplay is an isometric, pause for tactics RPG. Each character is attached to an element (water, wind, fire, earth) and a style of fighting (essentially melee rogue, melee tank, ranged caster). Within the introductory stages of the game, the protagonist chooses his element and can then switch between the three styles of combat at will. Each element has a selection of six active ability and one passive ability, each with their own (small) tree of upgrades, but you can only every have your passive and four active abilities selected in battle, and you don't gain enough skill points in the game to max them out. Combat revolves around positioning around enemies' attacks while using your abilities to create elemental tags that you can then activate for a variety of effects depending on which elements are interacting together and your upgrades. Each character has a Focus arc -- an area in front of them that allows them to block attacks and avoid damage directly to their health until the bar depletes. \n\nCombat can be clunky and finicky, however. Things move too fast and it's hard to keep up without constantly pausing. You have to make sure your characters' Focus arcs are facing the enemies that are attacking you while positioning your rogue archetypes to flank for extra damage, while lining up your abilities to do the most damage possible, while managing who is getting tagged with which elements and who is triggering those tags for the best effect, while trying to avoid your enemies' abilities when they're broadcast. This shouldn't be too complex to handle, but when there are a dozen or more combatants on the screen, things start getting muddled because everyone is attacking several times [i]a second[/i]. \n\nThese issues are further compounded by the fact that, although the AI has been adjusted in the most recent patch (for the better), trying to a) keep your characters out of enemies' attacks and b) make sure they aren't attacking the wrong targets... both still remain an issue. The most you can do to set up your characters' AI is determine how many targets are around when they use an ability, which isn't ideal. I ended up turning off most of my abilities for automatic AI use for a number of reasons. One character has a great attack steroid, but is mana starved and kept using an ability to open up combat on 3+ targets once the mobs got larger towards the end of the game, which made it so I couldn't use the steroid buff. Each character has an ability to trigger elemental tags, but your only options are to deactivate the AI for these abilities or have them immediately activate the closest elemental tag whenever the cooldown is up -- you can't specify which tags you want to trigger, or under what conditions.\n\nBut with some pausing, the combat does work, and it certainly isn't such a hamper that it made me enjoy the game less -- but there are some clear design flaws that could be fixed or worked on, and while I don't want to discourage anyone from playing the game, it's important to know what you're getting into, if only so that you can temper some of your expectations.\n\nOverall, I loved this game. I was deeply impressed by the storytelling and the overarching plot. The characters and voice acting were engaging. And for all the quirks and flaws and linearity, I was incredibly happy and pleasantly surprised by my experience with the game. If you enjoy a good story, play this. None of the game's flaws are glaringly awful or make the game unplayable by any means, and experiencing the world of Masquerada is well worth any mechanical idiosyncrasies with the game.", "timestamp_created": 1477721991, "timestamp_updated": 1477722149, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530849", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26281806": {"recommendationid": "26281806", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973285470", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2383, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477712629}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent gameplay, good story and amazing voice acting.", "timestamp_created": 1477712676, "timestamp_updated": 1477712676, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26265281": {"recommendationid": "26265281", "author": {"steamid": "76561198337934424", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1204, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477609626}, "language": "english", "review": "Masquerada has an engaging and exciting story, both heartwarming and heartbreaking moments and a cast of lovely characters.

Disclaimer: Yeah, I backed the kickstarter.\n\nDon't step into Masquerada expecting a Pillars of Eternity-style experience. It's very much a linear story game (if the tags don't give it away). If you're a completionist then make sure you're done with an area before moving on! Very rarely do the blue-teleporter-whatsit-circles have a return trip.\n\nPretty much all interaction points are coloured-whatsit-circles. General rule of thumb is yellow = key dialogue/progression or crafting, purple is optional/collectable and blue is moving to a new area. The exclamation mark on the edge of the screen points to the real quest progresser, which is good to keep in mind when there's more than one yellow point.\n\nIf you don't like Codexes then bare in mind that Masquerada really does - if you want to avoid them I'd say you can skip the lore. Towards the end of the game they start tossing extras at you that didn't fit neatly into a scene but, wahey, they wrote it, so here you go. That said, the entries are at a really nice length and I found all the Character entries particularly good reads as they're from the point-of-view of the main character, Cicero. I can't buy into lore for a world I'm not going to see but I'm always down for seeing more of a character's thoughts.\n\nIt has bugs, but none are game-breaking and no more than you'd expect. Their chapter system makes it easy to jump back if you feel you've missed something. It's an auto-save system so watch out for the notification in the bottom-left of the screen before quitting.\n\nIt's not really a micro-manager experience. I ended up sticking to one character and occassionally skipping to one of the two teammates to use certain skills, but largely I let the AI handle who to auto-attack. I've only played the game through on NORMAL (it may be very different on higher difficulties). There's a Party Behavior menu which offers some extra customisation and the Pause still came in incredibly handy. I couldn't just mindlessly send them into combat, and in the early stages of the game I felt the pain of not optimising my (then) meagre skill points.\n\nI've only played it through once with Air where I went for teleporting around the map. This made any 1 v 1s Cicero had unintentionally hilarious. Totally winnable... if a bit slower than other playstyles. There's some depth to the combat and I didn't dig deep beyond respecs to pay better attention to Threat and Focus.\n\nThankfully, they introduce you to a skill-reset which you have access to in one form or another for the rest of the game. You only get enough skills points to max out a character's Passive and the 4 skills they get additional to that. There's really no point investing in more than 4 skills - you can only use 4 at the time. Experiment with what works best for you and read ahead in the skill trees to see what'll work out best. I'd reccomend making Kalden into a beefy heal tank ASAP. He's fantastic by the end of the game but my poor choices made him into floor-decor for most of the early-game.\n\nI really enjoyed it and would buy a sequel (which they certainly set up a hook for), but I very very very much buy into story-based games. The voice-acting is stellar and really helps in that regard. It also has little snippets of non-voiced dialogue that you can find in the world, the standard \"oh we're just funny little NPCs making Dragon Age references\" or \"we're an ongoing side story that will probably end in tragedy\". I appreciate that, especially when I'd find those same NPCs later on in the game.\nDon't expect any animated master pieces. When in-game visuals don't cut it for the scene they want they go for a pseudo-comic/still-frame approach instead. (You can see one in Steam's preview images.)\n\nGive the demo a try but bear in mind that the bulk of your in-game time will be the story.

First the good parts.\n\n-The voice acting is superb across the board and it really helps to tell the story.\n-The world is very well fleshed out and there is a lot of lore available within the game (I didn't read it all).  As much as I -didn't enjoy the game I would be intrested in a tabletop RPG based on this world.\n-The art is beautiful and the areas are varied.  \n-I enjoyed all the characters and the character interactions that you could chose to see.\nThe story was decent, unfortunately the other areas got to be bad enough that I lost interest about halfway through and focused on finishing than enjoy the story.\n\nThings I didn't like so much about the game.  \n\n-It's way too linear.  I'm a big RPG fan and in general they are linear, but this took linear to the point of dragging you around by the nose.  It's rare if there were two exits to an area.  You can pretty much only go directly to the next scene/location.  \n-There's no option to interact with the world. You cannot talk to a random NPC.  At all.  As much as they rarely say anything all that useful one of the things I enjoy upon going to a new town in a game is running around and hearing all the random stuff the NPCs have to say.  There is some talking in the background that helps, but it's not common.  This ties in with the previous complaint.\n- Battles.  Maybe I chose a poor element, or a bad skill set up, or I'm just bad, but it felt like the best tactic for me would have been just putting the character on autopilot.  It didn't feel like I was effective at all in battle.  Also the targetting for me was a bit wonky as you both right click to target an enemy and right click to swap to an ally.  So when your ally is in melee you can accidentally swap targets instead of attacking.  I did that... a lot.  I didn't usually micromanage my allies and in general the ai was fine, but there was one boss battle where one of my allies just sat there in the middle of the map because she was too far away from my party.  \n- Skill points - I liked the magic in general, but the game uses on a progression based system where after certain fights/bosses you get skill points to allocate.  My issue with this is that it makes me feel like the other fights where you don't get skill points are a waste of my time that I would want to avoid, but can't.  Since I don't enjoy the battles in general this quickly made some areas feel like a slog.  \n - Masquerine customization.  While this seemed like a nice thing I don't think I ever once noticed the effect as they're all fairly small effects with only a chance of happening.  I'm sure it helped a lot, but it just wasn't noticeable so it kinda felt wasted.  Also the engravings could have used more variety.  \n- Complete lack of agency.  I've kinda already touched on this, but it just didn't feel like I got to make any real choices other than do I want to collect and read the lore/talk to my allies or not.  \n\nAll in all if you enjoy a very story driven game and don't have the same issues I did with the combat you may enjoy the game, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone without highlighting my issues with it.", "timestamp_created": 1477464982, "timestamp_updated": 1477464982, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494428", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26189574": {"recommendationid": "26189574", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088385060", "num_games_owned": 164, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1383, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482819157}, "language": "english", "review": "I thoroughly enjoy the game, yet to finish it but I feel that there are several points throughout that make it shine.

Animations are simple but smooth, very pretty overall asthetic.\nCharacters - I don't think I've enjoyed characters so much in a game since dragon age: origins, I genuinely cared for them.  I'd say the only downside is that one of the characters seems to get a lot more character development than some of the others, he's an awsome character, but I would have liked to have seen some more of the others as well.\nCombat mechanics - live action combat with tactical pause function works really well, the fights are usually pretty quick but definitely allow you to plan tactically.  There are qite a few abilities you can choose from and you can upgrade them as well.  It's done well.\nStory/lore - This game has a ton of background information that you can look up in your journal as you find codex entries.  There is a lot of information that you can dig through if you want to learn more about the world but you are not forced to read it all.

What you do get to choose is what type of element you want to be (earth, fire, air or water) and these do play quite differently from each other in combat with completely different skills and playstyles.  You also get to choose which companions you take with you so you can switch up your party composition.

I have played tactically, using active pause to micro-manage my party and the combat was feeling good. AI of companions is customizable to your liking but I preferred to use their abilities manually most of the time.\n  I recommend developing main character to be able to stand on his own and the rest of the party to create combos with their elemental powers.\n  There are few minor bugs like people walking through the party during cutscenes, but I have not encountered anything serious after patch 1.02.\n", "timestamp_created": 1476646536, "timestamp_updated": 1476646536, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500011", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26069872": {"recommendationid": "26069872", "author": {"steamid": "76561198219056015", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 43, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476625730}, "language": "english", "review": "Keeps freezing about 30 minutes into the main story and I have to force quit and try the chapter from the beginning.

The 16.4 hours is what it took to complete it. But honestly I approve this purchase only for the quality voice acting and storyline put together in a graphic audiobook format. The gameplay, on the other hand is severly lacking.\nThe voice actors I was already fans of.  Brought from both the Geek & Sundry (how I found out about this game) and Nerdist websites the actors give depth to the characters to build the connection throughout.  If you are looking for a decent written story set in a graphic novel theme you will come to the right place...\nBut if you are looking for a game similar to a Dragon Age or Mass Effect...disappointment will follow you.\nThe art is beautiful. Designers took time making the city this takes place in. Its definately fantasy by nature and beautiful nonetheless.\n\nDon't expect to explore it though. This game is STRICTLY linear in a isometric POV. One path to follow (albeit one section deviates from this) from beginning to end. There is no interaction with the environment, except buckets of fruit you can kick around. Principle charcters are set to move the game forward. All the other NPCs are there for show. Some will have bubbles over their head in conversations with others talking about what's going on and you will have to stop your running (there is no walk) to read these bubbles which will distract from the play because they will go on for a bit. Safe to ignore unless your goal is to read everything......because that in itself is a chore. \n\nPREPARE TO READ A LOT. Codexes for backstory and history, characters, settings. Almost everything has a codex, set in a way that is so distracting from what you were doing that you might forget what you were doing before you decided to read the entry (some are extensive in text).  Except for the character codexes I pretty much ignored the rest of it, but you might get upset if you don't get all of them. They sit in the path so easily seen (for the most part),  I honestly wondered how I missed a few (which also ruins an achievement). The codexes are designed to enrich the story, but it becomes very tedious and doesn't effect the current events because...\n\n...the story is already written for you.  There are times in the dialogue where there are choices present (making you wonder in a Dragon Age sort of way if I choose this what will happen) but in this reality only one choice exists and the other...is why there are checkpoints. So there are no player choices to worry about. Whatever control scheme you choose just button mash to glory (with some battle strategy mixed in) because even though there are skill trees and inks and such all the characters and all the skills really do the same thing:  to get you moving with the story (the difficuly does spike at times making the use of ill-placed checkpoints and restarts a chore but trial-and-error will rue the day).  Speaking of spoken dialogue...they are ALL TEXT-BOXES. I found myself closing my eyes and listening or lowering the scale of the GUI because they were so distracting. Reading along to spoken texts is OK when its paced right. This isn't that. I found I sped up the dialogue in places because I read faster than they did (which I think ruins other achievements as well).  But the character animation is also these boxes (which they did a real good job with the sync), so having an option to remove these from play removes a lot of design (and so the option doesn't exist).\n\nThe music reminded me of 2 things...1. Final Fantasy where the music never stops and doesn't match the situation (most of the time) and 2. That Knight Rider made-for-TV  movie with the mall chase scene where this calming soothing music existed instead of exciting get-you-pumped music (to this day I still wonder why).  I turned off the music because I found it distracring but then turned it on because silence during scenes needing music is even more distracting.\n\nWith all this you could be asking yourself \"he's recommending this?\" The combat isn't satisfying. The lack of environment depth (you will feel compeled to roam and be saddened with the waste of time). The tedious reading and visual distractions that take you away from the story and gameplay...\n\nBut the story IS awesome. The dialogue and the voice acting DO bring to life this story. You will laugh. You may tear a little. You will feel connected even if the try of backstory and history is forced.  If you are anywhere familiar with the voice actors you will smile with the knowing \"it was her\" or \"that was amazing\".\n\nThere is minimal replayability. If you are a completionist and didn't get all the achievements the first time you may go back but for as rail-linear as it is and all the chapters to choose from, getting those last few codexes isn't worth the extra time IMO. Even though it crashed on me twice near the end (restarting the game fixed both) I felt satisfied and not-at-all cheated. I adjusted how I played and thought less comparing it to another game I was used to.\n\nIs it worth the price? I paid $25. For the quality acting and artwork it is.  But with the lack of player involvement in the direction (think any game where it shows you a button to press to survive peril) of the game, it would probably sell better as a graphic audiobook.\n\nThere is no surprise why the file size is so big. There are a ton of voices and its visually appealing.\n\nBut, unless the story plot draws a hectic situation, there really isn't a sense of dread or peril to rush for anything from a player standpoint. It is a very-elaborate storytelling game.\n\nI don't regret buying this....(The quality is there. It just could have been so much more.)...\nbut you might.", "timestamp_created": 1476501789, "timestamp_updated": 1476504166, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501911", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26028325": {"recommendationid": "26028325", "author": {"steamid": "76561198277644546", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478352214}, "language": "english", "review": "Saw this at GameStart 2016 and was immediately hooked by the prologue (and the fact that the creative director promised that I'll cry many times in this game). I cried, 3 times, but I won't reveal where. I'm not even much of a sentimentalist but their writer has a way with knowing when to squeeze your tear ducts, punch you in the gut, and choke your trachea. \n\nThe first half is a little sloggish as there is quite a learning curve in picking up the terminology related to the lore of Ombre. But once I had party members recruited, I was well acquainted by then. I also really enjoy the pacing at which these lores get revealed, so it doesn't feel like an information dump all at once. With that said, I'm the kind of person that can enjoy a wall of text, but not others. I get the feeling that you might miss the immersion if you decide to skip the text though. \n\nThe second half of the story picks up the pace of the story as you're hit by how much bigger the investigation has become. Many characters will die, and it sucks because through the game you'd actually grow close to them before their untimely demise.  \n\nI share the grievances of your AI doing some pretty stupid things. This is evident mostly in difficult boss fights where they go ahead and run up to get themselves killed, so micromanagement is necessary when faced with a tough foe. There was also an instance where near the end of the game the program crashes, so I had to restart the entire battle. This is frustrating because everything is only via autosave. \n\nHowever, I do like the simpler skill tree system and equipping with different masks and boosts, as opposed to most RPGs with an inventory system and leveling up. It's different, and takes away some elements of the classic RPGs, but it allows for more of the story to seep through.\n\nI'll eventually return to the game to fill up the codex entries.

The world created  in Masquearada contributes to making the story so great. To truly experience the world and story of Masquerada, I would implore any would-be players to pick up and read every codex entry they find. Than you can thank me later. \nCharacters- You start the main game as Cicero Gavar, an exiled inspettorre who's called back to his home city of Ombre. There he is given the task to search for a missing scholar of the city he once called home. Along the journey you pick up companions, face villains, and meet important figures of the city. I can honestly say that every character I came into contact with was memorable. The voice acting of the characters helps make them so memorable. I can say that i definitely had my favorites, but they were all good. It's been a while since last I played a game where I hated some characters not because they were badly written, but because they had done something ingame that I did not agree with or offended the main character in some way. Slight spoiler: the dual with a figure head of the city was so satisfying... I wanted to bash the guy's head in since the first time he was introduced lol.\nGameplay- The gameplay is essentially a linear rpg. You start the game by picking one of four elements to play throughout the game: fire, water, air, or earth. Each element has abilities that allow it to tank, dps, support, and cc, so I would recommend chosing whatever element is your favorite. Along your journey, you pick up companions, one for each of the elements. You chose 2 of them to go on missions with you, and sometimes 1 is a must-go due to story reasons. People complain of the combat, but I found it enjoyable and satisfying. Let me preface this and say that I played on the hardest difficulty. Fights were definitely hard, but they were not impossible. Whenever I found myself taking multiple tries to get past a battle, it was always due to my strategy rather than the game being unfair. The enemies do hit hard, but you cannot just rush in and button mash your way to victory. Placement, comboing abilities, cc'ing enemies, enemy prioritization, reading of enemy tells, and use of pause are all key to beating this game on hard. Once I got the hang of things and realized the flow of combat, I found it to be very enjoyable. \n", "timestamp_created": 1476429970, "timestamp_updated": 1476429970, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499654", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26023061": {"recommendationid": "26023061", "author": {"steamid": "76561198204720536", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 96, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485135770}, "language": "english", "review": "I admit, I love Matthew Mercer. \nAlthough I was never the type to read everything, so I just hit enter a shit ton, each time his voice came on, I fangirled internally.

Listen to an audiobook? Play a visual novel? Try your wits in tactical combat? Why not all at once?\n\nMasquerada is a unique game that offers both the expected quality of an indie game, as in - great story, beautiful soundtrack and, in this case, incredible voice acting; as well as a chance to test your skills in pausable combat.\n\nIn short - this is almost like a casual, more calm and relaxing version of Dragon Age. Complete with lots of lore and engaging world.\n\nWhatever issues this game may have - come from misinterpretation. Of course, if a person wants price\\value or replayability... that's something for F2P skirmishers or grand AAA games. Let's not forget that this is an indie game, and, to be honest, I wouldn't say it falls far behind titles like South Park, it's even ahead in some departments. So - money should not be the question. Experiencing the story should be, and, as even the negative comments have said - this story is one worth experiencing.\n\nAnother issue that people have - is the combat. Well, to be honest that's why there are various difficulties. I can't speak for all of them, I'm playing on Hard, but I see that they can be changed at any time. So while I do find myself struggling and replaying some fights - I realize that this is MY choice. And if I ever find it too much - I can always drop the difficulty to continue. More often than not - I can just analyze my mistakes and do better. Of course, in some cases - the set-in-stone character development might become an obstable(as the game does not have a strict RPG role trinity), but that's.... what you can call replayability. Want to ever replay the game, maybe on a higher difficulty? Do better this time. You know what you are dealing with.\n\n\nWithout tank-healer-dps trinity, the combat system might seem weird, but let's understand that wierd does not mean wrong, it means unqiue. And, in fact. the ability of your tank to also be a healer, or for your protagonist to be a flexible jack of all trades - is better than just, you know, building a tank, a healbot and a glass cannon.\nGet to know this sytem better. See what you can do if you've chosen something wrong. Reduce the difficulty if necessary. What's the one thing that people always blame games like Diablo 3 for? Everything is TOO LINEAR. You make a cookie-cutter build and you win.\nThis is one of the game where you actually have to think outside of the box, live with consequences and get over any obstacles. And, let's be realistic, this isn't Diablo 2. You are bound only by your profile\\current storyline. If things go wrong, you don't lose hundreds of hours...\n\n\n\nSo, to conclude, this is the game that you play for the experience. Not another space pirate simulator. Not another skirmisher. Not another annual AAA flick. Many people can say they've enjoyed a GTA game before, but how many people can say they've experienced To the Moon?\n\nWell, why not experience a beautiful world inspired by west-european traditions, where you play as a detective who has to lead his party on a perilous quest to unravel a mystery that can change everything?", "timestamp_created": 1475834863, "timestamp_updated": 1475835070, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499957", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25898758": {"recommendationid": "25898758", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065822881", "num_games_owned": 1467, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 786, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477519057}, "language": "english", "review": "Masquerada: Songs and Shadows is a highly polished, well-written, well-acted, story-rich RPG that oozes of lore, intrigue, and character.

Stands for Masterpiece.\n\nThis game is wonderful. It's surely unusual because not many people do such games these days and that's why I think it got quite a few negative reviews. People mostly criticize gameplay and system features and surely there are some flaws, but that's irrelevant. The essence of this game is a STORY, and a truly heartfelt one. It's a story about people, their character and their relationship, about a fantasy world crafted with love and soul put in it. This game has really touched the strings of my souls and is a great proof that game development is truly a form of art.\n\nTL;DR - If you want to play classic RPG with many choices, go Pillars of Eternity. If you prefer tactical fights with deep strategy and mechanics, play XCOM. If you desire to live through a breathtaking adventure alongside unforgettable characters with vibrant personalities in a meticulously designed and truly enchanting fantasy world, Masquerada: Songs and Shadows is your choice.\n\nCharacters: Every person in the game is vivid, they don't just SEEM alive, they actually ARE alive. Usually characters in games are developed by people who don't really have much social experience (or so it seems) and don't really understand how people's relationship work, but luckily that's not the case with Masquerada. Due to the small number of characters introduced the devs showed us each and every one of them with their virtues and flaws, with their own stories, in all their uniqueness. They may behave irrationally succumbing to their emotions, but that's realistic, that makes them more alive. These are not your typical \"heroes\" who despite having a few bad traits are 90% good, brave and righteous (or 90% evil). The characters of Masquerada, including main ones, are humans who lie, fear, despair, but also hope, fight for what they believe and, what's most important, they EVOLVE throughout the story, and that's exactly what makes them alive.\n\nWorld: The world of Masquerada if full of minute details that make it much more vivid. A lot of information about the world's features as well as background lore given to us in a form of Cicero's records (or the ones he finds) is simply amazing. In-game we can only see a small part of this world, a city of Ombre with its rich history and peculiar society structure, all though-out very carefully. But we can also get a glimpse on the other nations and territories through the notes, and it gives us more or less full picture of the world, which is quite rare for such games. Numerous minor details and descriptions is what really made a strong impression on me.\n\nSound: Music is quite simple, but really fitting. It helps a lot to immerse in the atmosphere. And the voices! Damn, they're so good. They help to form images of characters so much better and really plays a great part in their vividness! The voice cast  is quite starry: Felicia Day, Liam O'Brien, Matthew Mercer and many other people lend their voices to the characters of Masquerada.\n\nVisual Design: There are many bright colors in the game that in my opinion make the game even more lively. The art style is quite simple and yet eye-catching.\n\nMechanics: Combat system is not complicated at all: elemental tags work pretty straightforward, most descriptions are not overloaded with numbers (much to mucnhkins' distaste). AI is doing weird things sometimes so you always need to keep an eye on your party members, but with the help of tactical pause it's not that hard (may be annoying sometimes though). On the hard difficulty the game is\u2026well, hard. But perfectly manageable. I completed it on hard with the party of characters that I like for personalities rather than for abilities (don't get me wrong, I love all the main characters, but to take along some of them in some situations were more fitting that the others) and although it was a bit harder than if I always had a good-all-around party, it was by no means exceptionally difficult. Even if you think you had built your characters wrong, by the time it starts to matter there will be a skill reset option, so it's quite user-friendly.\n\nStory: I dare to say that people who designed the story are true geniuses. There are quite a few twists and turns of the plot, with many tales unfolding along the main storyline, closely intertwining with it and eventually everything being woven into the grand canvas of an adventure one can never forget. It's not particularly complicated or always unpredictable (some moments are really mind-blowing), but it somehow absorbs you. And, what's important, it's perfectly logical. Not rational, but logical, and definitely realistic. Many important questions arise as you progress and later you can see what answers Cicero and his friends find, how they resolve difficult situations and how it all affects them. All the characters' personalities as well as the word's lore are instrumental in creating this unique feeling of involvement in the story, the feeling of living through it.\n\nVerdict: It's one of the best games I've ever played. I even see it not like a game, but rather an experience I lived through myself. In my opinion this masterpiece can actually influence one's perception, maybe teach some lessons and is definitely a source of inspiration. I doubt I managed to describe the game in all its brilliance and that's why I encourage everyone seeking a vibrant story to try out this game.\n\nTo the Developers: Thank you guys for creating such a magnificent game. It was a truly unforgettable experience, Cicero and his friends now hold a special place in my heart.\n\nRating: \u221e/10", "timestamp_created": 1475593656, "timestamp_updated": 1475594459, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 52, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.792507", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25854507": {"recommendationid": "25854507", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996242611", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 416, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475330033}, "language": "english", "review": "It's not often you find a game with a great [i]and[/i] compelling storyline - and everybody yearns for a good story.

I've seen more of the game than what my gameplay time says, no worries. (We finished the game at the 20 hour mark)\n\nOkay, so there's a very specific group of people out there who would love this game, and also a very specific group that would hate it. This is entirely due to design and what this game is, and what some people expect it to be even though it's not.\n\nFACTS:\n\n- There are NO branching storylines here, and NO decisions that \"get you to an alternate ending\". There is ONE storyline, and that's the one story line there is. Not a pro nor a con, it's what it is.\n\n- The game is EXTREMELY linear. In the sense that you proceed forward, forward and forward. It's like Transistor in that regard: you always went forward, and there's no real point to going back. (Not one of those CRPGs where you get quests from random people and stuff, you mostly go do the main quest and that's that).\n\n- The game is fully voiced, all dialogue between characters is voiced, it adds a lot to the gameplay value. (By the way, it's very high quality voice acting too! Names like \"JENNIFER HALE\" the Female Shepard from MASS EFFECT, or \"CRISPIN FREEMAN\", these names might ring a bell?)\n\n- The game is text-heavy because people talk to each other. So if you just want hack and slash, there are less dialogue-heavy games out there for that, in which case go play some Bastion or something. \nBut if you want lore and codex entries like back in the Dragon Age Origins games, you'll be pleased. The game is heavily focused on telling its story.\n\n- There is skill customization. Multiple skills to choose from, different upgrade \"paths\" to take on said skills.

The only area in which the player has any agency, being combat and the trappings thereof, this making up perhaps 1/4 of the \"game\". That being said, the combat is proportionally well developed considering how little  there is of it or perhaps it is that, it is adequate and you dont get bored in your short time with it. This fact might be a con or a pro depending on the buyer. You fight at the appointed venues and level up, allocating points via a system reminiscent of Dragon Age: Origins. It is all very linear and the fights only occur because they are narratively appropriate. You will not be hunting for bear asses nor taking on lucrative contracts, there is no buying or selling nor gear as such - not beyond the mask you choose to wear. The \"game\" has a very deliberate pace and mood and there are no extras, one might expect, to detract from this.\n\nThat being as it is, by now you might be wondering; what of the other 3/4? Well my friend, it is storytelling. This thing masquerading as a game is a tool for the developers to tell a story via heaps of lore codexes - which could of used some narraration -, character development and the superb voice acting. They do no require your input nor ask for your opinion, you will traverse from point A to point B with the sole task of initiating dialogues and fighting the odd battle here and there. For most of the time you will sit either bored or enraptured by the story unfolding. It is more akin to a radio play or full blown theatre play than it is to an RPG. Indeed there is no roleplay to speak of in the direct meaning of the word. You are a mute witness and at the end of it, you can applaud if yo so wish.\n\nAll I can add is that the characters are very human, they will grow, they will falter and pick themselves up again. The backdrop to their personal conflicts being a civil war where indeed the fabric of reality will be set in peril. If this nonegame intriques you, go ahead and buy it. Perhaps the developers will be enticed to make an actual game with similar levels of storytelling.\n\nP.S: I do not reccomend playing on hard, as the mechanics are not very refined and commanding the party can be clunky. This combined with the archaic savepoint system will have you hating the experience of being set back to the start of an area each time you die.

The game was trotting along merrily as an investigative mystery (see the earlier part of my review), and then shifted tone in the third and fourth Acts. I won't spoil it, but suffice to say, I was tearing hard at the credits. I give it a solid A+ for handling such deft storytelling.\n\nAfter moving onto the harder battles, I feel the key is to pause often (and pause at the start of the fight) and plan your movements. You need to pause and reposition every few seconds to line up a combo, but when you do, the fights are much smoother than fighting in real time which often leads to companion AIs going kamikaze.

The game is very linear, there are no sidequests, dialogue choices, and world maps and stuff like that. But that is not really a negative, because Masquerada makes sure that the journey is a real engaging one. When it comes to the combat the game still needs some work, mainly in that unlike in most RTwP RPGs you can\u2019t select your whole party. This becomes an issue because the Party AI is rather weak and won\u2019t get out of the way of stuff like AoE attacks. On Normal this isn\u2019t much of a problem, but I\u2019d advise against playing on Hard for the time being. Also a few bosses and enemies seem rather unbalanced, able to do obscene amounts of damage that just feels kind of broken. (Like one mid-game boss does more damage than even the final boss does.) The core of the combat is quite fun though, it\u2019s fast paced and feels good, especially the late game when you have real good abilities. So any problems the combat has can probably be fixed, the devs have said they\u2019ll be on it. The game also has no manual saves, which is a rather dumb decision nowadays. (Though it never became problem for me) But yet again that\u2019s a problem that can be patched. (Hell Shadowrun had that same problem too at first, and I love Shadowrun.) I\u2019ve also ran into some bugs, one game-breaking in the tutorial, but as I said the devs will be on it, they seem real receptive.\n\nVisually the game looks really pretty. I\u2019ve ran into some graphical glitches, but overall the game does a bang up job for an indie game on a budget. The soundtrack is also real good stuff too. Overall the game has a nice atmosphere, filled with color and beauty.\n\nNow when it comes to narrative, Masquerada is real damn good, standing toe to toe with some of the recent RPG greats. The game creates an interesting world with fleshed out and likable characters. The game is also filled to the brim with codex entries that you find strewn throughout the game.  I read everyone that I could find and you know a game\u2019s narrative is good when you want to read all the text it gives you. Many of the codices are also used to flesh out the protagonist, Cicero, and his past.  The main cast all have depth and are likable. The characters are also really brought to life by the excellent voice acting brought by some of the industry\u2019s VA veterans such as Jennifer Hale, Liam O\u2019 Brien, Dave Fennoy, Matthew Mercer, Crispin Freeman, and more. Masquerada\u2019s narrative kept me engaged the whole way through. The ending is the right kind where they are some loose ends that can be taken up with a sequel, but pretty much the main narrative of the game has been resolved so it\u2019s not an unfulfilling sequel hook.\n\nSo in conclusion while there are some flaws that can be fixed, Masquerada is a damn fine game that deserves to stand shoulder to shoulder with recent indie RPGs like Shadowrun, Aurion, and LISA and Undertale.

The RPG elements are rather lightweight, limited to ability trees and switching between masks. Experience points/levels and equipment (other than your mask) are absent--perhaps most frustratingly with that last RPG convention. \n\nI find the writing in this game to be a bit of a double-edged sword. Again, I can tell a lot of thought and care have gone into crafting the dialogue and descriptions in the game. At the same time, the wording often comes off as overly flowery, stumbling in its own attempts at eloquence. This is a minor quarrel, probably one that few players will have, but after reading and listening to a few hours of the game's writing as of this review, I feel it is worth mentioning. \n\nI hope the game's AI will be refined in an upcoming patch. Characters currently need near continuous micromanagement, since they tend to wander off and switch targets almost immediately after initiating your command. Getting your party to concentrate on a single enemy in a group is a chore. Telling every member to hold their position helps, but isn't foolproof, and still requires more party-sitting than I think should be necessary. \n\nThat all being said, I'm impressed by Witching Hour Studios' polish on its focused feature set. Masquerada does what it does well, even if \"what it does\" may feel a bit limited from a gameplay perspective. If you view this as a visual novel with RPG enhancements, you won't be disappointed.\n\nEDIT (Oct 3): Removed the complaint about lack of respec.

And in some cases, it delievered. In others...not so much.\n\nFirst off, setting, story, voice-acting: all was superb. Everything I wanted. I found myself wanting to explore and learn everything I could about the Citte and all of its inhabitants and hidden histories. I was drawn in by the superb performances of the voice actors, and the story was gripping that one doesn't mind linearity, if that is a hang-up for you. \n\nI was also a huge fan of the magic system; sure, it followed the Last Airbender formula, but the incorporation of not only masks, but the design, decoration, and stances made it feel far more vibrant and its own thing rather than a carbon copy: each mask/weapon can be coated in a concoction of special inks and herbs to give it more properties, and different masks have different \"Specials\" that can be activated.\n\n\nSo why did I say 'no' on recommending? Well, others have touched upon it. Combat is heavily, and I mean HEAVILY micro-manging. Unless you are hitting the SPACE BAR and bringing up the tactical screen, your companions will go off do whatever they want. They obey only the first command you give them, then the AI decides whether to follow suit or do its own thing. Nor can you scroll through the battlefield while the tactical screen is up; it's frozen in place. \n\nEDIT: Apparently you CAN move the tactical screen by moving the mouse to the edges of the screen. Being one of the things I tried (and didn't work) I can only assume a buggy glitch on my end and not a knock on the game itself.\n\nAnd yet despite having to so closely manage everything, combat is very simple: Right click a target, click a special ability if you want to use it, MAYBE engage in flanking manuevers if you aren't so ridcioulously outnumbered, and that's about it. If direct combat is going to be so simple, than more tactical options would be nice.\n\nThe \"searching\" in the game when not in combat is also disappointing. Just find where the colored circle is, step in it, click \"E\". Congratulations, you found the pokeball. I'm not exactly expecting a full on investigative system, but something a bit more involved than, 'point and click' WOULD be nice. You feel less like a bad-ass Inspetorre and more like Inspector Gadget, following bread-crumbs so obvious it becomes monotonous. Every once in a while you learn about the lore through observation or listening to people's conversations, and then it feels organic. Otherwise, it's to the PC's Encyclopedia Britannica!\n\nAs those are the only two real GAME mechanics, I find those to be harsh criticisms of a game. While the power selection IS nice, some paths are clearly better than others (don't go the magician/distance fighting route; it just isn't worth it. Leave that to your designated distance NPC instead...or do what I did and never use him, because he sucks).\n\n\nI mentioned the story just now, and that is true of the main one. However, I have two further (spoiler-free) critiques of thath, which adds to the \"No\" column. One, the main villain's motivation is clear, and makes a certain amount of sense, but HOW the villain came to this view point is never explored. Perhaps I missed something, but there seems to be a gap between how the villain got from point A to point B.\n\nSecond, your companions. Okay, in these games, it's almost a given that every companion will have a side-quest that you must help them overcome some personal demon to get closer to them. Except...you only get one side-quest. One that deals with a sensitive issue with such heavy-handed hamminess I needed several slices of bacon afterwards. People who play the game know of what I speak. Now, it isn't totally useless creator-preaching; we get to see an important aspect of the secular relgion/cultural beliefs of the Citte, and how it can affect, influence, and motivate lives. \n\nHowever, it is VERY jarring that it is the only such side-quest we get. You read that right; we get no such similar sidetracks for our other characters. Two of them are handled almost off-handedly during the main quest-line, and the other...DOES your fourth companion get anything? After hinting at some hidden relation to the main character and talks of avenging someone's death...it never goes anywhere. \n\n\nOh, and sequel-baiting. I can't abide by the damn sequel-baiting.\n\n\nSo yeah, this game has problems. Glaring ones, actually. And yet...and yet, I want to love it, want to see it do well, and see more about this very inventive world we have been given a glimpse of. The relations of a powerful and vibrant port city who's gift of magic helps make them a center of their world...yet only so far as their borders stretch. A nation that fled religious oppresion for freedom, only to engage in social (and worse) oppresion within its own walls. Factions and politics and people in between, just trying to make a living; the city felt ALIVE. That's a feat to be celebrated in any game. Plus, it's not like this is some $60 AAA title; the game is 25 bucks, hardly a rip-off by any stretch of the imagination.\n\n\nSo I guess I have to say, No, I don't recommend it...but at the same time I don't tell you to turn away and run in horror. Look at the premise. Read through the reviews, and make your own choice. I can vouch for the story (mostly), the world, the music, and the voice-acting. Characters are interesting (if at times 2-D) and the game looks pretty (it should; that's where the kickstarter money was supposed to go). A host of skills for each of your four magic paths, plus three \"styles\" on how to use all of them, give you (on the surface, at least) a lot of options in combat. However, the gameplay is not the greatest in the world; micromanaging companions, the at-times stupid AI, borderline hands-off controls, and an almost useless tactical screen can make combat a chore at times. When not in combat, searching is really look around room, find purple/blue/gold circle, click E, watch cutscene.

You can change the battle formation and styles in game, but I feel that they need a bit tweaking. \n\nLike I said before, there is lots to read. I have enjoyed reading all of it to be honest. It is a journal entry written by the main character so you get a lot of first person opinions on a lot of things. It gives you more of a view of what kind of charachter Cicero is and you get to understand his psyche a lot more. But all in all, there is a ton to read. Even if you don't read the other stuff, the stuff you need to read to understand the plot and what's going on is a lot. \n\nThe story is very linear. Extremely linear. This game isn't meant for a hardcore gamer. This game is meant for someone who wants to enjoy an amazing story, a person who doesn't skip over cutscenes and listens to the characters talk it out. Very beautiful to me, however extremely linear.\n\n\nNow the pro's are pretty self explanitory.\n\nThe voice acting is superb. Top knotch. Every single one of them, every single character, truly brings their character to life. I watch every single cutscene and don't skip over them because I want to hear the characters talk to each other. It truly is amazing.\n\nThe art too is beautiful. I have my setting on \"Beautiful\" so that it pumps it up a lot. I'm sure that if you go down from there it won't be as good and if you go up one more it'll be a lot better. But the art is nice.\n\nI love the gameplay. It is hard and you really do have to pick up a lot of it yourself, but once you understand and get used to it, it's really awesome. I'm more of a story driven gamer so I have my difficulty set to normal, but even then some boss fights are monsters. I enjoy fighting just as much as I enjoy eating the story.\n\n\nOh one more thing to note, is that there's a lot of stuff that you need to read between the lines. But all in all, Witching Hour did a fantastic job. 9/10 good job awesome love it.\n", "timestamp_created": 1475443550, "timestamp_updated": 1475443550, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500565", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25827585": {"recommendationid": "25827585", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066264510", "num_games_owned": 182, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475438305}, "language": "english", "review": "+ wonderful graphics\n+ great story\n+ well crafted and original world\n+ decent music and VA\n+ fluid animations\n\n- unpolished combat system\n- questionable party AI\n- no manual saves, only autosaves per every stage which makes the two points above very frustrating during some encounters", "timestamp_created": 1475437534, "timestamp_updated": 1475437939, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.608461", "comment_count": "11", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25825218": {"recommendationid": "25825218", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985362230", "num_games_owned": 570, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475713839}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is beautiful. I'm not sure if there is any other word I can use.\n\nI wasn't expecting much when I picked this up. I wasn't one of the Kickstarter backers and I hadn't heard of it at all before. But I gave it a try, and I don't regret it at all.\n\nGameplay-wise, Masquerada is a very linear adventure featuring party-based, tactical combat. It's not the best rendition of this by any stretch, but the combat does its job well enough. Characters gain skills and weapon upgrades as they progress through the story. The combat system encourages flanking of enemies and tactical play, though at lower difficulties it can be played more directly with little trouble. Outside of combat, the game is mostly about moving from one story point to the next, while searching for additional lore notes and upgrades scattered across the maps.\n\nThe game follows Cicero in his investigation of a missing person. That sounds simple enough, but things get a lot more complicated, and tragic, as the game goes on. The story is what really elevates this game over others. Cicero and his friends are all generally good, but deeply flawed, people. The story that follows is as much about them overcoming their personal demons as it is about Cicero's investigation, and this is a good thing as the entire cast are so lovable. This is one of the few RPGs I've played where I can genuinely say I love all of the characters, and watching them overcome the tragic circumstances that befall them was the true drive for me to finish this game.\n\nThe voice-acting in this game is excellent, which helps keep the story moving.\n\nIf anyone really wants a good story in an RPG, I'd highly recommend this game.

Not to mention, since you have more skill points the skill selection is more broad.\n\nThe skills are still lacking a bit (they are nothing special), but the synergy with elemental tags makes them more interesting. Also the few bosses I faced made the game more fun.\n\nThe plot is getting extremely interesting and keep myself focused, really good job. The whole setting is great and the graphic too.\nWhile the game is not perfect (for me the gameplay is still the most important part), I feel safe to give this game a positive review and recommend it, as long as you resist until you have all the characters in party, where the game gets more interesting gameplay-wise and the story becomes quite deep.\n\n[b]Old review[/b]\n\nIt's hard to say Yes or No to this game. I'm not convinced yet (I played over 4 hours, but offline, sorry).\nThe story is great and the setting is great too, enjoying it a lot. It's a bit disappointing though, receiving all these huge wall of text early game. Don't get me wrong, it's nice having information, but basically every room I moved into, I get 2-3 wall of text to read. After 2 hours of gaming I fought ONCE and read stuff the rest of the time. Also sometimes you read a description just to discover that is basically what they just told you by voice. At least mark those stuff as read already.\n\nVoice acting and track is great so far, what I'm really not sure about is the combat system.\nDon't get me wrong, I'm enjoying fighting. I even set \"Hard\" difficulty and was enjoying it. However the checkpoints makes VERY PAINFUL dying in this game: for example I changed the AI right before a big fight (takes a while to change the AI), learned some new skills and went in. Died and all my changes were not saved. I'm fine with check points, but KEEP my changes to the character and AI. This is very important for an RPG. In addition, is not clear at all when the game it's saved, you must be really careful to the \"autosave\" text to appear, sometimes you want to go to bed and you just have to keep playing to notice that Autosave message...\n\nAnyway, the combat lacks so far because it's chaotic and the skills are not that inspired. I picked fire (who was so crazy to tell you to pick between 4 elements without giving you any direction or information about skills!?). You can't properly tell \"all characters attack this guy\" (yes you have to go over them one by one and tell to attack), in addition there is an entire combo system around \"elemental tags\", but only 2 skills per character have them and only if you pick a specific upgrade in a skill.\n\nI'm still early in the game. The combat system is \"enjoyable\", but not great. While I value the story, honestly I consider the combat system more important in ANY videogame, because it's the thing that you \"repeat\" during the whole game, so being lacking in that is equivalent in saying the gameplay is not good enough.\n\nHopefully I'll be able to change this review in a few boss fights, but I wouldn't recommend this game for this price tag, the gameplay is too lacking.\n\nThat being said, graphics are amazing, plot is great and soundtrack is good, together with nice setting.\n\nP.S.\nI'm a kickstarter backer", "timestamp_created": 1475400397, "timestamp_updated": 1475745555, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499957", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25808188": {"recommendationid": "25808188", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142436993", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476534086}, "language": "english", "review": "Well if your companion doesn't die in tutorial the game bugs out on the commands which isn't helpful at all.\n\nWas asked to update by comments so have the following update below.\n\nFair point about updating this review, however I also have found that throughout the game cut scenes some times just pop up as a black screen etc. And have had random game crashes.

This review was edited after I finished the game.\n\nLet me start with that I really like about the game:\n1. the voice acting. It is superb\n2. I really like the graphics\n3. edited: I love the story...absolutely love it, from the first to the last moment.\n\nI don't mind the game being as linar as it is as it is leading me through an immersive and captivating story.\n\nTo understand all the points you have to know that I have problems with my hands and cannot do action stuff or anything like that where the hands have to be in movement and active all the time. Also, I am playing the game on OS X so some problems may not apply to you.\n\nWith that said, here the points I really dislike:\n\ncombat\n1. micro management: it is impossible to set things up and expect your chars to keep to the setup. \"Hold\" keeps until the very first action and after that it is turned off again. So you are constantly tabbing through your chars, setting them up once again just to see it's all gone again\n2. targetting: just like holding...it is temporary and changes whenever the chars feel like it. Again, yet another point where you have to micro manage over and over. Also, it sometimes seems to me the chars love to run into the enemy aoe fields to suicide.\n\ngeneral\n1. the checkpoint system: It is setup in a way that you have to repeat the same combat over and over if you fail the 2nd fight in a row. \n2. the checkpoint system: due to the constant micro management in combat, I often end up with hurting hands after only 1 combat and I'd like to quit the game for a bit to recover them from the strain of the micromanagement. But, unless there happens to be a checkpoint after a fight I'd just have to repeat that fight if I did that.\n3. added: this is the only game in my library where I looked forward to loading screens because that meant the game would be saved :)\n\nprogression\n1. At some point, I realised that the element I had chosen wasn't what I wanted and decided to restart and choose another element. Well, that won't work...all these decisions are saved and cannot be changed even on a restart...I had chosen water and water it was going to be...even the 2nd time around. I often restart in RPGs when I see I made a mistake or realise I'd prefer another choice in eg. skills, etc. that I didn't take the first time around. Well, no luck here.\nYour element will survive a restart and can't be changed\nYour skill points and how you distributed them will survive a restart and can't be changed\nand as a consequence, you won't gain any skill points in any of the fights you do the 2nd time around until you are back at the point where you chose to restart.\n\nAdded: in response to comments\nFor me, going back in time, call it restart/rewind or something else means undoing all I've done and that includes decisions, choices, etc.. On the other and, I freely confess I normally keep far away from games with checkpoint systems so my understanding of the system may be wrong.\nYes, I could have created a new profile at that point in time to \"properly\" restart, especially after seeing that restarting a chapter isn't a proper restart but, tbh, going through all of it a 3rd time was a bit much at the time.\n\n\nSummary (now, after finishing the game)\nI am much more torn now...on one hand, I truly loved the story (I can't remember when a story in a game caught my attention like this the last time), otoh, the problems didn't get less but more over time...so I stand by my original vote:\n\nA beautiful game marred by too many problems...what a pity", "timestamp_created": 1475336366, "timestamp_updated": 1475425979, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 102, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.764861", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25799751": {"recommendationid": "25799751", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083025098", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 876, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475446946}, "language": "english", "review": "I will recommend it, but this game has lots of the problems.\n\nThis is a detective story, set up in really interesting world. You can not compare it to BG, or any other CRPGs cause it's not. It is feels like narrative story, where the combat is just a complex QTE.\n\nPROS\n- The story of the world is fascinating. Rich with lore, factions, conflict.\n- The characters are rich, but the game really struggles to explain it. However I loved the fact that everyone is somewhat \"grey\". No pure good & evil.\n- The fabula is unique (at least for me). Brings the Vampire: The Masquerade fascination to the table.\n- The story might be just engaging enough for you to continue.\n- Estetics, music, atmosphere are really nice.\n\nCONS\n- The mechanics. It might be the prefference, but it does not force you to conserve your spells (they are a based on cooldowns). It's really hard to pull combos, which should be the shining jewel of the system. The combat is just too noisy for that.\n- The story is very linear. No searching, no secrets, no reward for curiosity.\n- The surroundings are bit rushed.

I dont know how many acts there are so unsure how much more there is. But I believe I have got far enough to have learned what the game has to offer.\n\nTo start the art style and animation really stands out, the voice acting is top notch and the voice cast has a large collection of recognisable names. When you realise how much dialog there is in the game you will learn to appreciate that the voice acting works very well. I wouldnt be surprised if over half of the time I have spent in game so far was listening to the characters talking. The lore is very deep and I am enjoying the story, I paused the game at the end of Act 2 where there was an interesting story plot point. It really took me a while to come to terms with the fact that this is an RPG without loot to collect.\n\nMy only real gripe is the party AI, you have limited control over automating them and they have no knowledge of the one rule of any RPG (Dont Stand in Stuff). I was constantly finding myself pausing the game to direct each member of the party to run out of the AOE.\n\nThat and I REALLY miss the ability to drink a health potion or switch to a character that has a heal to keep my party members alive. Some of the characters have indirect healing abilities but there is no real \"healer\" type character which makes some of the encounters require a lot of micromanagement to try to keep people together for a chance of the small healing available.\n\nOverall I am really enjoying the game, a primary reason I play games is for the story and that is definitely here. I am not someone that is an expert of the genre which could partly explain the issues I was having managing my party. I am very much looking forward to finishing up the story on Sunday and seeing where the story leads.", "timestamp_created": 1475292420, "timestamp_updated": 1475292420, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467729", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25792001": {"recommendationid": "25792001", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051212542", "num_games_owned": 475, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 112, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475287494}, "language": "english", "review": "Really hard to choose between yes and no, but, I guess, for an average gamer that is a no. I did enjoy the game somewhat, but the combat mechanics made me say 'screw it' and put the game aside from now.\n\nTLDR: Pros:\n* Stylish, beautiful, eye candy from the get-go\n* Original game world, reminding of many things at once (Cadwallon, anyone?)\n* Solid voice acting\n* Pretty decent plot, dramatic moments sound pretty real\n\nCons:\n* Walls of text (might be a pro if you're into it)\n* Learning curve that goes from 'I did nothing and won' to 'I did everything and lost' almost instantly\n* 'AI' that isn't really intelligent at all and just operates based on (very limited) options that you control (not without a lot of trial and error).\n\nMore about the cons in detail.\n\nTEXT: the investigative nature of the storyline is enforced by 'case notes' and overall thoughts and memos by our character about everything he sees. You don't exactly NEED to read them asap to understand what's going on, but it really helps - without it you lose some immersion and quickly enough go into 'click through the blablah, get to action' mode. Otherwise you get hit with a lot of info all at once.\n\nLEARNING CURVE: The game teaches you controls and _one_ basic interaction in combat. Then you get a second character. And a third. And they have abilities. And you don't get enough easy fights to check how they should work or when you should use them. Abilities and upgrades also come with ZERO hints.\n\nCOMBAT: If you go microcontrolling the combat, the game is pretty much Aarklash Legacy wannabe without the tactical depth, and probably a little too frantic for my liking. I immensely enjoyed AL, and here I more often than not yell in frustration at things the characters do (or refuse to do).", "timestamp_created": 1475288349, "timestamp_updated": 1475342645, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 50, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.564259", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25790773": {"recommendationid": "25790773", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065979638", "num_games_owned": 346, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 1166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507576358}, "language": "english", "review": "Note: I was a Kickstarter backer for this game. \n\nSo far, it reads like a BioWare or Bethesda game in terms of lore (and I'm not kidding about the \"reads\" part -- walls and walls of text in the codices) and essentially plays like a better managed Diablo. The characters are so far pretty interesting and I really like the set-up of the world and how the class conflict is playing out (though the sociologist in me cries at some of the text in the codex about why the underclass/poor stay in the Citte where they're \"unwanted\"). I can tell the devs put a lot of work into the world-building and the lore behind the game and, for the most part, have built a realistic feeling society given the context of the world. I'm still pretty early in the game, so I assume this changes more later, but I have been slightly disappointed with character development so far, as most of it has taken place through the walls of text in the codex rather than through the story or interactions with other characters. The interactions I have seen, however, such as between Tristan and Cicero, while short have been deep enough that it's fairly easy to get a picture of that person's character pretty quickly. The world interaction is a little frustrating as everything but movement -- conversations, condexes, switches between phases -- are instigated by stepping into a bright colored circle and clicking E to activate. It takes away a lot of the immersion because it's rendered the backgrounds and environments into pretty pictures in the background that happen to be very very linear. I also have to definitely shout out to the voice actors, all of whom are great (though I don't think I'll ever be able to picture the Glorious Gilmore as anything but Cicero now, since Matt Mercer often uses the same voice). The sound editing could maybe use a little tinkering, though, as I had to turn up my sound, turn down the music and make sure the voices were up to 100% so I could actually hear the dialogue. The music is great but not so great I want it to drown out the voices, which is what happened in the tutorial when I played it. \n\nThe combat is.... Well, let's just say I liked classic Diablo so it's no surprise I like this, even with its issues (such as companion clustering in AOE). But it's definitely nothing groundbreaking in either the combat or the skills (again, unless something changes later in the game). \n\nMy only major complaint would be the lack of a manual save system, which is more of a quality of life issue than anything game-breaking. I'm just the kind of person that would prefer to have a save right before the boss or, in a story-driven game, a save before an awesome cutscene and I can do neither. The game is on an autosave/checkpoint system instead. \n\nStill, the game seems WELL worth the money I added to the Kickstarter and I think it's been given a fairly reasonable Steam price for what you're getting.", "timestamp_created": 1475280783, "timestamp_updated": 1475280783, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505377", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25790238": {"recommendationid": "25790238", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063240013", "num_games_owned": 160, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 636, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475374279}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros!\nGorgeous art style\nFun combat\nInteresting storyline\nGood characters\nGreat soundtrack\n\nCons!\nPrologue/tutorial is mandatory\nNo save system, works on autosaves\nDoesn't feel like much an RPG due to a lack of choices, inventory and the like.\n\nOverall, it's a solid game so far and I can't wait to see more.", "timestamp_created": 1475277905, "timestamp_updated": 1475344912, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.470755", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25789615": {"recommendationid": "25789615", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032186760", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 953, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476235567}, "language": "english", "review": "First 3 hours: interesting story line.  But more of a point and click game with occasional combat than an RPG. Certainly the levels are very linear - not an open-ended world but interesting so far nevertheless.  The art is pretty, voice-acting is well done as well.  In addition, the game feels polished.\n\nOn the downside, two irritating points so far.  First, the companions' AI just loves to cluster your companions together in the middle of area of effect damage.  This can be avoided, for sure, if you take over their behaviour but then combat becomes very  micro-managed.  Second, I sure wish there was a \"save\" game option, rather than autosaves at select story points.

There's not many things that surprise me, especially after finishing Mass Effect, Dragon Age, Witcher, Fallout 4... story telling at its best right?\n\nThis game completely blew me away. Masquerada was written so so so brilliantly. It's combat isn't sloppy, fairly challenging and fun. Voice acting? Top notch. I mean, there are these little nuances that are so clever. You know how when your character starts talking while you're moving around and it tends to cut off when you move to the next screen? Here, the conversation continues, with wonderful insights. The amount of Lore? Too much of course. But spare a minute to read it and, it's like a bleeding journal filled with pain, hope and doubt all at once.\n\nThe companions, only 4. But what an incredible four. Strong character development, rage, doubt, hate, love, all thrown in together.\n\nI haven't finished this game, so I'm reviewing it now. I don't want the ending to influence my entire review, but rather, my gameplay experience of it. Weird note, that I'm a composer irl, and this soundtrack has been bloody fantastic. Such beautiful songs.\n\nI was doubtful if I should buy this game because it wasn't on sale, but frankly, this is the best game I've bought in a long time. It's moved me more than most of the stuff I've watched on tv or in the cinema, and with powerful characters, a fleshed out villain that breaks my heart, and a story I cannot predict in its entirety, Masquerada is a gem that i will remember for years to come.\n\nI hope you enjoy this game as much as i did. Give it a few hours, there's so much more to the story than first appears.\n\nWell done.

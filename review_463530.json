I've been longing for good Ant Game that was more realistic as well keeping your nest area unique. The graphics are great. The controls are pretty good too. This game provides multiple challenges both in the nest area and above ground. It does take some getting used too but in turn makes you a stronger player for later challenges I have noticed. So dont get discouraged if it take several tries for getting the goals done. The in game voice hints are good to those looking for a advice or more of a challenge to try.  A hint, Ants are better in greater numbers and food is your lifeline to success.\n\nMy Pros are this is a solid foundation of the game, graphics are detailed, camera angles not too close or too far (Empire of Ants had this problem) and mechanics of the nest are not micro managing time consuming to not enjoy the game itself. The content now is a good beginning. Worth the money spent if you remember how much Sim Ant was new. The hints given are very helpful and you choose to get rid of or keep them in the game.\n\nMy Cons is nothing that would prevent me from playing or wanting to play this game.

The game gets choppy when you get a few dozen ants. You can get steamrolled on easy mode, while a match in one of the gamemodes I tried was lasting so long that I ended up quitting and going to bed.\n\nThe hive management feels simple and constrained, with the strategy being a basic numbers meta where you need to balance the workers/soldiers/food in a specific way to beat each level. My favorite RTS games are ones that feel like a creative outlet where plenty of playstyles can achieve victory, but Empires of the Undergrowth is not one of them.\n\nI don't think it was worth the pricetag at \u00a315.99, but with so few ants games around I can't hate a dev team for trying.

There's a few bugs/glitches here and there but for an early access game the quality is pretty good (played far worse and only very few that were on par or better).\n\nCurrently there's only 3 ant species in the game, one that you use for your formicarium (a persistent sort of home base you can expand and return to after playing a scenario) and the two others you play in the scenarios. More are planed and more will come though.\n\nThe levels are fun to play and although the real AI hasn't made it into the first release it shows that the developers have a good understanding of level design and that you don't need advanced AI to make good scenarios (the proper AI is on it's way and acutally fairly far developed, it just wasn't required for the early access levels for which scripting was fully sufficient so it's development was delayed in favor of other things that actually were required for the early access release, like mostly fixing bugs that sprung up during the closed beta test to get a most stable and bugfree release client).\n\nI applaud the developers for NOT going with the general \"just smash everything that isn't you color\" theme RTS games seem to favor these days but instead giving us four VERY different scenarios with interesting objectives and different gameplay (clearing an underground map, fending off invading slave-maker ants that steal your brood, surviving against the environment and variosu critters for three days on a beach with rising and falling tide, surviving an Onslaught of two ant colonies trying to take over your nest before their own nests on the lower levels get flooded).\nI'm looking forward to the next scenarios (potentially with leafcutter ants) which will undeoubtatedly be quite different again.\n\nAnother thing I really love about this game is the way units move. This is NOT StarCraft where you can micromanage every single to the point of playing a tabletop game, this game is about MACRO.\nEach of your unit groups (ants from connected nesting tiles are automatically put into one squad and you can put multiple of these squads into a group) can be called to a position by placing a pheromone marker. About half of the ants will react isntantly to the marker, more will follow it over time. This may seem annoying at first but once you've understood how this system works when fog of war gets implemented you'll appreciate it as it basically gives you full line of sight over the entire range of your \"ant trail\" resulting in a huge amount of map control (barely anyone can sneak past a large ant trail and if the trail is attacked at one point the battle will quickly escalate due more and more ants quickly accumulating at the conflict site).\n\nAs to be expected in every early access game the units themselves have some balancing issues (upgrading brood tiles just isn't worth it as more ants are always better and the Formica rufa shooters are ridiculously overpowered) but none of these actually detract from the gameplay or the fun, so they don't matter in the end.\n\nRight now the game has 2 formicarium challenges (with your genetically modified Formica ereptor ant), 4 missions (2 with Formica fusca and 2 with Formica rufa) and the 4 old demo levels (with a Formica ereptor/fusca hybrid colony). If you play them all (including the old demo levels) that should keep you busy for about 10-20 hours (depending on how well you do).\nIt seems a fair price to me, especially when considering that the final product will be much more and have features like a freeplay mode, more missions and more ant species (obviously) and a campaign.\n\nThe developers have been working on this game for years so it is unlikely that this project will be abandoned. The team is small though (3 programmers and a community manager), but they're working really hard and development speed should increase once all major bugs (especially those related the unit navigation aka units getting stuck which still sometimes happens around the entrance areas and cliffs) are squashed - the game has made amazing progression in that regard during the closed beta test so I'm confident this soon will be an issue of the past.\n\n\n\n\nTL'DR:\n\nThis game is lots of fun and has a vast potential to become an AMAZING game. It is not your average RTS game and that's good. Obviously it is still in early access and doesn't have tons of content but the content it has is good and makes you want more. I can wholeheartedly recommend it but if you think it's not worth buying yet just put it on your \"followed games\" list and keep an eye out for future updates.\n\n\n(p.s. I got the game for free but I am not affiliated with the developers in any way. In fact I was gifted it due to my feedback posts on the game's official forums so I could take part in the closed beta test and give further feedback as I wasn't able to back/buy the game at that time due to technical issues.)", "timestamp_created": 1514464406, "timestamp_updated": 1514464435, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38777968": {"recommendationid": "38777968", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981392302", "num_games_owned": 544, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 254, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 254, "last_played": 1513794717}, "language": "english", "review": "I first saw EotU at a convention a year or two ago and instantly knew it was a game I never knew I'd always wanted.

SimAnt is possibly another entry worth mentioning here but, as I never played it (BOO SHAME SHAME), I can't really give any meaningful commentary.\n\nThe gameplay, as I said before, is quite challenging. The initial tutorial seems overwhelming at first but once you start messing about you'll soon get a hang of how things work. Be prepared to restart your Formicarium due to poor strategy - I got my head kicked in by the first challenge mission for the Formicarium because I'd built a colony entirely of worker ants. I didn't realise I had to unlock the soldiers in the tech tree! Derp. Ended up having to restart my campaign to fix the formicarium.\nThe graphics are way beyond what I expected. They certainly don't [i]need[/i] to be realistic for this type of game and yet I'm so glad they are. I find my skin crawling whenever I tunnel into a spider's lair or accidentally unleash a horde of devil's coach horse bugs. UGHHHH!\nMy only gripe with the game is, as mentioned earlier, if you build your Formicarium poorly to begin with you'll have to restart your campaign if you want to reset it. Not the end of the world but a bit annoying, especially as my impatience made me restart the first level several times after my base got wiped out by the big boys.\n\nIn an era of shitty, broken early-access games, Empires of the Undergrowth stands out as a shining gem, crafted by a company with a genuine love for their game coupled with the talent to make it work. I can't wait to see what the future will bring, both for this game specifically and for Slug Disco as a company.\n\nPros:\nGreat concept\nGreat gameplay (so far)\nV Good graphics\nInteresting campaign - the mixture of the longplay Formicarium with the standalone missions works nicely so far.\n\nCons:\nVery few, mostly things that I feel will get ironed out in future releases.\nTutorial is a bit confusing and initially feels overwhelming\nNo subtitles\nCan't reset Formicarium without starting new campaign", "timestamp_created": 1514464263, "timestamp_updated": 1514464263, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38774574": {"recommendationid": "38774574", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020392393", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 886, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 886, "last_played": 1514462076}, "language": "english", "review": "Entertaining game (albeit only four levels and 2 challenges currently) - a solid foundation ripe for additional content.\n\nLife as an ant is brutal without any direct human involvement.

defences crumbling with them.\n\nI tried to to it two other ways where i had 40+ soldier ants and a 7 worker ant meat wall, this lead to them instantly dying to  the fully developed \"Coach Horse\"\n\nI tried a combination of both having 14 level 1 soldier ant's and 7 level 3. this worked a bit better but i still got rekt.\n\nI tried mixing up tacticts that instead of just mass swarming them i would pincher attack them from two areas (diden't work)\nI tried luring them into a wide open area i made and swarming from all sides, nominal succcess but diden't work on the last rooms that had 12+ \"Devil's Coachhorses\"\n\nIn the end all i can say is.\n\nI love this game, it's a fantastic game with a neat new turn in this flood of AAA games of poo.\nDon't get me wrong, it's a good game, might even be a great game. only problem i found was the soldier ants attack to willy nilly to actually be able to take out large amount of enemies, if a way of adding more attack styles or some form of upgrade that increased their health pool/damage, cause right now i don't see the point of having level 3 soldier ant's in the challange missions. as the big enemies still one shot

It's a little light on content, but it shows promise and has a nice polish to it. It doesn't do an amazing job of explaining the controls and mechanics, but you pick it up pretty easily if you're familiar with how an RTS plays. I'm excited for more of this game. Highly recommended.\n\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n\n\n[list]\n[*]Great RTS mechanics\n[*]Wonderful soundtrack and voice acting\n[*]Performance is good, even with large on screen battles\n[*]Unique gameplay mechanics work well for it\n[/list]\n\n\n\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n\n\n[list]\n[*]Game can be confusing at start and you are immediately thrown into the game with no real tutorial aside from blocks of text\n[*]Not much content (obvious for an early access title)\n[/list]\n\n\n\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\n\n\nEmpires of the Undergrowth is a RTS/Tower Defense-esque game with hints of Dungeon Keeper. I honestly had a hard time finding something I didn't like about this game. It doesn't have the most intuitive UI or controls but they're fairly easy to pick up. The game doesn't really have a proper tutorial. It kind of throws you into your first level alongside a barrage of tooltips and hints that tell you how to play the game. Nevertheless, once you learn to play, it's really not any harder to pick up any other RTS. However, Empires of the Undergrowth has two mechanics that help it stand out.\n\n\nFirst of all, are the two 'layers' of gameplay. You have your nest, where the level must be carved out like a Dungeon Keeper style game, and then the surface which plays more like your typical RTS. This gives the game a very interesting mechanic as later maps reveal a day and night cycle which brings out strong creeps at night giving the opportunity for adventurous players to explore or protect their own assets (such as aphid fields) or lets cautious ones retreat to the safety of their nest.\n\n\nThe Formicarium is another unique mechanic. It gives the player a sort of 'home base' so to speak. I thought at first it was some kind of hub world but the Formicarium is more like your home base. You can do levels where you act out scenarios as other ant colonies. By doing these, you unlock food, upgrade points, and expansion points for your base. The Formicarium also has challenges, which function as a kind of wave survival. You can also upgrade your ants at your base and unlock new units. After completing the early access content, you are given control of the wave spawner, allowing you to swarm yourself with enemies. This were fun but it seemed that you were able to survive extremely large amounts of enemies by just retreating to your nest, using its entrance as a chokepoint.\n\n\nThe game is also fairly polished and it runs well. It probably won't win any beauty competitions but it certainly isn't the ugliest thing. The music also stood out to me. It seemed very fitting and was really well done. The voice acting, while not phenomenal, is more than adequate. There are 3 VAs in the game, a male scientist, a female scientist, and a narrator. The narrator and female scientist are very subdued and appropriate sounding for the game, while the male scientist has kind of this 'anime villian' kind of voice. It isn't bad, but it could probably be dialed back a bit.\n\n\nEither way, Empires of the Undergrowth stuck out to me. It's an early access game so there isn't a lot of content, but the content it does show has a LOT of potential. I was pleasantly surprised when I picked this up. This game shows promise and I can't fault it for being a little slim on content as an early access game. The content that IS there shows a hell of a lot of promise and I think it does a great job at providing a varied experience of the game.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1514268379, "timestamp_updated": 1514268379, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38684241": {"recommendationid": "38684241", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994704582", "num_games_owned": 409, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 907, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 907, "last_played": 1514339245}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun RTS with tons of potential.

But you can't divide or fold the troops, you have to separate the spawnfields in your nest (or bring them together). That may be realistic but awkward.\n- Definitely more ant's, predators, types of food etc. Do you know the old Sim Ant? There you can conquer a hole garden and house against the red ant's and the human with bugspay and lawnmower ^^. You can send your queens into the world for new nests and take controll of them etc. This should not become a new Sim Ant but maybe a nice idea for the free play?\n- Did I mention, I hate the male scientist. Need a mission, where my ants can hunt him down ^^\n- Multiplayer.

There is not much of a story within this game as of now, and yes the price is a good amount for this game itself but in a way it is worth it if you like strategy games and ants. \nCurrent state: it's great, I dont have any lag no problems with the commands with my ants that i control. even having 60 ants it all goes just fine. There are a few game modes you can play, such as critters, mostly kill everything in site within the ground. The Nest- killing another queen ant in the under ground. Hold out- survival mode, surrounded- a game mode with a few choices of hardness of the game, casual to intense, there is even a freeplay section within it. There is a few more modes coming around in the future of the development of the game.  There is also a game mode where you can make your colony to be stong and face other dangers within challenges. It is grindy but it still fun. \nPros: still in devopment, each update is like having a peace of candy. Also it has no lag and so its awsome. \nTHINGS I LIKE TO SEE IN THE UPCOMING UPDATES TO SEE THIS GAME GROW. \n----every game mode even challenges to be random generated with the enemies and food. it gets a bit boring sometimes when it is always the same thing over and over. \n----To have enimes to come around once and a while in the other game modes so if we happen to mess up with our food storage we have a chance to get more food from them when killed. \n---- with the formicaium challenges, the challenge mode to be on and having enimes to pop up to get you while you build your nest and if you killed them you cant collect the food from them they just dissaper, I would love to have them to stay so we can harvest them for more food for us. Be a bit more real than just a game. \n----- other ants, they dissapear when killed allow us to do the same as above. at least have it to be like 5 for food, at least it could help us a bit for a better nest if we have more food, and better survival chances. \n----- of course different ant queens or more ants to control like the hony pot ants. and more abilities to be had. \n----- a true forest or beach type mode where you can do what ever you want and survive through the days like survival but a bit differnt. it be like a endless more where you can do what ever you want with no boundries and so on. to make a awsome hug nest like a real ant army. fight other ant armys to control the land and new ant queens in the distance or found to fend off and to control there land in the under ground. all kinds of enemies from above and bellow to go after you as well but be easy in the begining and then progresses to the max of the diffeculty you have picked to be. \nOVERALL GREAT GAME AND BE LOOKING FORWARD FOR THE UPDATES. :)", "timestamp_created": 1513615066, "timestamp_updated": 1513615066, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38402352": {"recommendationid": "38402352", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060353578", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1018, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 837, "last_played": 1513580187}, "language": "german", "review": "Wer Sim Ant und Dungeon Keeper mag, kommt an diesem Spiel nicht vorbei.

It captures the 'feel' of being an ant queen, with some interesting strategic concepts unique to this game. It lacks the strategic depth of something like Starcraft, but given the subject material that's not surprising. \n\nOne significant innovation is that the construction of buildings requires a rather high cost and support only a single ant each--but replacing an ant is automatic and cheap (but not free). This means that constructing a large army is hard, but if a large army is lost it can be replaced quickly. This leads to an interesting debate, about whether it's better to keep a 'reserve' of resources in case you suffer casualties, or spend it on increasing your army size. \n\nNow for the complaints:\n1) There's no real pop cap in the side missions, only limited by the number of buildings you currently have. But there is a pop cap in the 'home base'. This seems unnecessary, and limits your options when you need to defend it. \n2) There's a big difference in difficultly between the side missions and the 'challenge' (i.e. home base) missions--the latter are much tougher. The idea is you can play the side missions multiple times, to build up your forces at your home base. The problem is that this forces you to play the same missions over and over, no variety, which gets annoying after a while. \n3) The game right now is really just tower defence--defend against waves of enemies. It would be much better to include multiple ant colonies, each one attacking and defending. How cool would it be to send in an ant commando force to assassinate another queen? \n\nI recommend supporting this game now, because it's already worth the money.

Right now, there are only 4 of these maps, but each has a further challenge to tackle once it's beaten the first time around. There's also quite a bit to be done in the ant farm section of the game which provides a different sort of challenge than the separate maps. \nI'm hoping that they add a bit more to combat in future updates because it's mostly focused on having the number advantage at the moment.

While the game is/was in early access during this review, my feeling is it's already good and it will get even better for the full release, so I recommend it. The visuals, music and voiced narration gives the game a BBC documentary feel to it. The main campaign is set in a laboratory where scientists are testing your capabilities as a colony, additional \"side quest\" scenarios will let you grind up some resources for your brood to prepare for the tests.\n\nYou control the ants using pheromone markers, they can be grouped and each group controlled separately. You control the flow of ants for a macro strategic advantage rather than squad based tactics or micro managing single units. It's all about getting into that swarm mentality, all or nothing battles where overwhelming the enemy is the only option. Single ants are useless, but the swarm can clear the entire area of all living things in minutes.\nAs such, timing the resource spending and marker positions is crucial for success. Overspend or misplace a marker at the wrong time and your colony might not be able to recover.\n\nWhile the game is a bit short on content at this time, it is very much playable, stable and fun.

I was afraid since it was an Early acess, it would be riddled with bugs ( no pun intended) but it was the opposite, no lag, no stutter, no glitches, no crashes, it ran smoothly and excelent. \n\nPros : - it Isnt expensive for what it offers;\n          - Great sound work with the lab assistants, quite enjoyed that;\n          - The mechanics are tricky but once you figured them out it opens a new pletora of challenges.\n          - Ant mechanics are realistic and beautifull;\n          - Decent amount of enemies from what we saw, but suspect there are more in the works\n          - It is a good game although still in its infancy, and i cant wait to see what more surprises it will bring in the future.\n\nCons : - i cant find anything worthy of meationing - Other then its an early acess game, and its incomplete, but that changes in the future with more content on the way, so it isnt exactly a Con.\n\nFinal review:\n\n- Early acess in this case doesnt means no fun, no challenge, allot of bugs. Quite the contrary, its a firm game with a comical or psyco narrator that wants to push your ant colony to its limit, and i quite enjoyed proving him wrong. The building is freely but in some cases forces you to go back and redo to improve the efficacy of it. By no means the levels are easy, they are challenging and force you to think and adapt and overcome. \n\nIt was a great buy and a great find, and i cant wait to see what more is coming. \n\nPs- Just needs some Steam Achievements and Trading Cards to be Perfect :)", "timestamp_created": 1513164771, "timestamp_updated": 1513165056, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.797297", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38275143": {"recommendationid": "38275143", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979820838", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 509, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512747935}, "language": "english", "review": "There is still little content because it was just released BUT i love the idea and how they worked on playability.

In this mode you are able to improve the genetics of your ants by spending \"royal jelly\" and so choose their strengths and weaknesses and when you're powerful enough you can participate in formicarium challenges, the completion of which will result in some extra food, territory points (needed for digging within the formicarium) and some royal jelly. The issue is that food is fairly sparse in the formicarium and so in order to make reasonable progress, you need to play the missions. \n\nDifferent missions are available depending on the level of your formicarium, at first two missions are available. After improving the formicarium to level 2 by completing the challenge, you will be able to participate in the next two levels. At the moment only 4 missions are available, but with 4 difficulty settings as well as an added \"challenge mode\" (which adds a twist to the level you are playing) there should be enough to keep you busy for now. Each of these missions is narrated beautifully in a way which wouldn't be out of place in a nature documentary. \n\nIn addition to this, there are an additional 4 \"Alpha game modes\" accessed from the extra modes section of the main menu, and there will be a custom and freeplay mode in the main game, \n\nDue to the excellent narration I actually found this game very educational and I came away from playing it knowing a lot more about ants and their preditors than when I went in bare in mind however that some artistic license has been taken with some species in order to provide better gameplay. \n\nFinally, the in game music is brilliant, a brass orchestral track really sets the tone and the music changes somewhat dynamically with the in game action.\n\nI bought this game knowing that it's still under development, I was aware that the amount of content was somewhat limited but this game archs back to a time when RTS games where innovative.

Economy management, balancing unit ratios, and sending units to the most strategically advantageous positions at the right time. That's not a bad thing, because it does those things pretty well. I agree with some of the other reviews, in that unit costs, damage and other stuff could use some balancing. But as this game only released a few days ago and is still in development, that's forgivable in my opinion.\n\nOverall, this game is a very fun game.

Concept is very innovative, but you already know that. \nGraphics are clean, game is fluid, and it's is kind of realistic in the making. It's not just a classic RTS with units replaced by ants and others insects but there is a very immersive gameplay. Ants have their own consciousness, everyone of them know what they have to do and you can't control them neither select them. You control the expansion of the nest, create chambers and groups, and place pheromones on the map to lead the expansion. But there is an eratic behavior of the units you cannot really control or lead with exactness. For exemple, if you place pheromones at the other side of the map, an ant who try to reach it will grab the first food it see and go back to bring it to the nest because well, it's an ant, and the most important thing is to pile up food and defend the queen. However, you can order ants to not fight or not pick up food. In the same way you can create variant sort of ants : workers, fighters, fighter that spit (no sexual joke). In some missions you'll have to make mixed group like workers escorted by fighters. \nDifficulty is well balanced. Not to easy to make it boring, not to hard to make you stop. \nAt the moment I'm writing this evaluation, this game lack a bit of content but it came out last week and there is just the few firsts missions of the story mode that made me play 17 hours. \nI didn't have so much fun on a video game for a long time. \n++ 11/10 would love to defend the queen from cockroach and recycle spiders to make food again.", "timestamp_created": 1512914763, "timestamp_updated": 1512914763, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38166700": {"recommendationid": "38166700", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027385824", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1001, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 203, "last_played": 1514777325}, "language": "english", "review": "The game \"Sim Ant\" reborn!

Die daf\u00fcr ben\u00f6tigten Ressourcen gewinnt man durch Missionen, in denen man eine eigene Kolonie spielen muss und es mit diversen Insekten aufnehmen muss. Dabei ist man immer auf der Jagd nach zus\u00e4tzlicher Nahrung, denn nur so kann man seine Kolonie vergr\u00f6\u00dfern und mehr und st\u00e4rke Ameisen aufstellen - und dieser Kampf um Nahrung ist wirklich hart, sp\u00e4testens ab der 3. Mission muss man genau abw\u00e4gen, ob die zus\u00e4tzliche Nahrung die potentiellen Verluste an Truppen ausgleichen k\u00f6nnen oder nicht.\n\nEs gibt auch einen Techtree, mit dem man die Ameisen verbessern kann, der steht aber nur in der Hauptkolonie zur Verf\u00fcgung. Diese lebt normalerweise friedlich, aber jede 3. Mission testen Wissenschaftler die \u00dcberlebensf\u00e4higkeit und so kommt es auch hier zum Kampf.\n\nDas Spiel l\u00e4uft stabil, keine Abst\u00fcrze, einmal einen Bug, der mit dem Neustart der Mission beseitigt wurde.\n\nAktuell gibt es leider nur 4 Missionen, die man normal oder als Challenge spielen kann, wobei letztere nur ein paar zus\u00e4tzliche Gegner bringt. Zus\u00e4tzlich gibt es noch 2 (?) Testmissionen gegen die Wissenschaftler. Das Spiel ist \u00fcbrigens ziemlich schwer, speziell die Missionen 3 und 4 haben es in sich, wo man es teilweise mit Gegner zu tun hat, die man praktisch nicht besiegen kann - denen auszuweichen ist keine leichte Sache und man muss wirklich aufpassen, ob sich das Risiko lohnt.\n\nInsgesamt bin ich durchaus zufrieden, auch wenn der Spielumfang momentan noch recht gering ist.", "timestamp_created": 1512754470, "timestamp_updated": 1512754470, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.625000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38155688": {"recommendationid": "38155688", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034241859", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3038, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1113, "last_played": 1514795803}, "language": "english", "review": "This game reminds me of another game we had back in 2000's \"Empire of the Ants\", sadly it wasn't that well known back then.

At the moment the game is limited with 4 possible missions, and two challenges. The two challenges. You basically get a formicarium where you control a small nest that is limited in how much you can change it, and the food available (it even comes with a tech tree). \n\nYou unlock more food, upgrades as well as how much of the nest can be dugout by completing the missions you get two missions that basically teach the basic game mechanics. After completing a mission you'll return to the formicarium with some royal jelly (used to unlock two types of ants and improved ant abilities). When you're feeling confident in your ant abilities you're able to launch your first challenge which will put your formicarium through several trials. If you manage to complete the challenge you'll unlock two more missions and a second challenge. \n\nControl of the ants is not entirely direct. Instead you can assign groups of ants (1 to 5) which are then directed to patrol from your queen to a pheromone marker. That can present some issues in that there may be occasions when your ants might walk in to a fight one by ones but as long as you're aware of what is happening this is generally easy to manage.\n\nWhile I recommend the game as I personally enjoyed the challenge and narrative of the game, it should be noted the game is short as it currently is with not a lot of replayability.

Lamentablemente el juego solo esta en Ingles.\n\nEste es el \u00fanico inconveniente que le veo al juego, el no tener voces en nuestro idioma o al menos subt\u00edtulos. Pero tras escuchar la voz en off en ingles, me quedaron las ganas de escuchar esa voz en nuestro idioma, que me sumerja en mi propio documental de Hormigas.\n\nDeberemos proteger a la hormiga reina, controlando una colonia de hormigas, haciendo crecer su poblaci\u00f3n y ampliando sus dominios.\n \nTendremos que escavar los t\u00faneles de nuestro hormiguero, almacenar comida suficiente para mantener nuestra poblacional, colocar las zonas donde incubar los huevos de nuestras hormigas, diciendo cuantas obreras y guerreras queremos.\n\nMientras vamos creando nuestro t\u00faneles nos encontraremos con otros insectos pac\u00edficos y otros agresivos. Deberemos de eliminarlos para a\u00f1adir sus restos a nuestras reservas de comida y evitar que nos maten a nuestra Hormiga Reina.\n\nEl juego esta en Acceso Anticipado por lo que su desarrollo aun esta en proceso, aun y as\u00ed encontramos 2 modos de juego, uno de ellos con objetivos diferentes a completar y otro en el que tendremos nuestro propio hormiguero y seg\u00fan vayamos haciendo misiones iremos ganando materiales para poder ampliarlo y hacerlo crecer (os muestro este modo en el v\u00eddeo).\n\nTambi\u00e9n podremos mejorar las estad\u00edsticas de nuestras hormigas Obreras, Guerreas y Reina. Espero que vayan desarrollando mejoras y a\u00f1adan m\u00e1s opciones de construcci\u00f3n, m\u00e1s tipo de hormigas y por supuesto nuestro idioma.\n\n\nEl juego a superado con creces mis buenas expectativas y lo recomiendo a todos los amantes de los juegos de estrategia y simuladores. Encima tiene un precio bastante interesante (19,99\u20ac), si encontr\u00e1is alguna rebaja mejor aun.\n\nJuego diferente que nos pondr\u00e1 en la piel de una colonia de hormigas. \n\nQuien no ha querido ser alguna vez una peque\u00f1a hormiga trabajadora y Feroz?", "timestamp_created": 1512497554, "timestamp_updated": 1512497554, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.664987", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38084394": {"recommendationid": "38084394", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962692786", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 631, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 185, "last_played": 1514848250}, "language": "english", "review": "This game will be amazing when finished.

The ones that DO go there will often wander around the nest after a few seconds, then make their way back. The enemy units are, however, extremely coordinated and will go directly to your queen with no hesitation. This means any real fight is just you desperately trying to get your units to behave as the enemy steamrolls throughout your nest. The developers have claimed this is \"realistic\" ant behavior, but anyone who has observed ants in the wild knows that ant colonies will swarm around predators very effectively once the threat is identified and marked.\n\nAnd let me just say one of my favorite games of all time is Dwarf Fortress. I am fine with not having complete and direct control over every single one of my units. I just think there should be a \"mark predator\" command or something that makes your soldier ants stop wandering around and get to fighting.\n\nAlso, as you can see from the comments on this review, the community for this game is trash and likes to respond to legitimate criticism with \"YOU MAD?\".

There are 2 basic classes of ant - the workers and the warriors. There's a queen too, but she doesn't do much - she's a liability: you have to defend her at all costs because every other ant can be replaced. If the queen dies, the colony dies.\n\nThe goals are simple and realistic: ants need food to make more ants. More ants = good. But more ants means food gets used up. No food = bad. So your main task involves getting more food for the colony and all that entails: food has to be stored. Food sometimes belongs to other critters who don't want to share. And sometimes the food just doesn't want to be eaten. Even worse, sometimes you run into things that think ants are food. How wrongheaded can you be?\n\nWhile this could get boring quickly, the devs have designed the game in an interesting way: You have a basic, simple and vulnerable colony. To improve this you need to play scenarios to improve your colony by researching different ant abilities, etc, or just getting more food for your colony. You need to do this to survive the next step, which is the colony challenges. In challenges all the decisions you've taken will be tested and failure means your colony and your queen dies. Thank goodness for save games!\n\nHopefully as this game is developed the devs will up the ante even more or include some sort of randmization to allow replayability which is one eventual drawback that might show up in the future. However after a couple hours I still can't survive that first challenge and my colony still needs work.\n\nThis means I'm hooked for now.  I want to see what's in store further down the road, and while the game is extremely simple (it's ants, after all. They eat. They move. They die) and even grindy, I don't mind because it's the ants that do the grinding. They don't mind - it's what they do! The big picture - getting a colony that can survive what the devs throw at it - that's quite a bit harder.\n\nWell done!\n", "timestamp_created": 1512191521, "timestamp_updated": 1512191521, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 140, "votes_funny": 16, "weighted_vote_score": "0.918530", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "37992305": {"recommendationid": "37992305", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997127377", "num_games_owned": 535, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 110, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512205406}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic, really enjoying this game.

WHen i was in Kingergarten and 1st grade, my school had a few computers. On those computers were 3 games, one of which was simant. I played that game whenever I could and loved it. I have been waiting for a new ant game ever since. EotU may be a slightly different concept, but It is a great game for it's own reasons.\n\nThe graphics are decent, and more than adequate for the point of the game. The concept of a gene-stealing ant is very original and cool, imo. The gameplay is a bit straitforward at the moment, but there is enough strategy involved to make it fun. Don't forget that it is still in Early Access(more game modes in the future). The levels give a proper challenge, even on easy mode. The pheromone control system is pretty neat as well. I do wish you could move the queen to a different part of the nest( it would be very helpful for defensive missions). Also, as always, I really want a sandbox gamemode where i can dominate the landscape and crush my competition.\n All in all a fun early access game with lots of potential.", "timestamp_created": 1516039223, "timestamp_updated": 1516039223, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39365368": {"recommendationid": "39365368", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038636588", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 829, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 833, "last_played": 1516124982}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is ridiculously awesome.\nIt's not only...\n*...beautiful.

The way ants are organised in the real world is the way you will win this game (well, basically that's the way you win every strategy game because ants are superior - but you know what I mean) and you can actually learn someting!\nNot only about ants and beetles but also lessons for life: Treat your queen right, protect the children, work together in teams/scouts, never stop improving yourself, have some fire-spitting friends covering your back and enjoy your meals even if it's just woodworms.\n\n...but it's also so much fun! \n\nThis is an actual strategy game and no ant simulator.

M\u00f6chte man hochrangige Ameisen besitzen, gilt es hexagonale Strukturen anzulegen, da so die Punkteverteilung optimal ist.\n\nDas Ganze ist sehr intuitiv, und f\u00fcr mich schon nach wenigen Spielminuten greifbar gewesen, ohne irgendeine Form von Tutorial.\n\n[b][u]Schwierigkeitsgrad:[/u][/b] EotU ist schwer. Jede Mission besitzt 4 Schwierigkeiten: Easy, Normal, Hard und Insane.\nDer Entwickler selbst sagt zum Balancing, dass Easy und Normal f\u00fcr jeden machbar sein sollte. Hard wird so gebalanced, dass die Entwickler die ganze Missionen noch schaffen und Insane ist nochmal ein Ticken schwieriger.\n\nIch kann diese Einsch\u00e4tzung best\u00e4tigen, wobei ein Schwierigkeitsanstieg zu sp\u00fcren ist. Ist die Mission 1.2 auf Hard fast kein sp\u00fcrbarer Unterschied zu Normal, so bekommt man in Mission 2.2 derma\u00dfen viele gegnerische Ameisen um die Ohren gepfeffert, dass man mehrere Anl\u00e4ufe braucht, bis man die optimale Strategie.\n\nMeiner Meinung sorgt das f\u00fcr eine gute Motivation und erh\u00f6ht den Wiederspielwert einzelner Missionen, neben dem Bonus, dass man Ressourcen f\u00fcr seine Ameisenfarm bekommt.\n\n[h1]Inszenierung:[/h1]\n\nDas Setting des Spiels lehnt sich an ein Biologielabor an, welches als Hauptmen\u00fc dient. \nVon hier aus kann man zu den verschiedenen Levels der Alphaversion oder aber in das eigene Formicarium bzw.  die eigene Ameisenfarm. \n\nDie Ameisenfarm ist ein zentraler Teil des Spiels, da man hier missions\u00fcbergreifend mit seiner Kolonie w\u00e4chst und \nvon hier aus werden die Storymissionen gestartet werdeb.(zurzeit sind es 4 Missionen + 2 Formicarium Challenges) Au\u00dferdem erforscht man hier neue Eigenschaften und Ameisentypen f\u00fcr seine Kolonie.\n\nDas Ganze funktioniert so, dass man f\u00fcr jede Mission eine gewisse Anzahl an Futter, Erforschungspunkten (Royal Jelly), und Felder zum Ausgraben bekommt, um so stetig voranzuschreiten.\n\nIn den Missionen spielt man eine davon unabh\u00e4ngige Ameisenkolonie, die in der Art einer Naturdokumentation von einem Offsprecher begleitet wird. Man muss gewisse Aufgaben erf\u00fcllen, wie z.B. alle Kreaturen im Untergrund besiegen oder 4 Tage gegen feindliche Ameisenkolonien zu \u00fcberleben.\n\nDabei bekommt man einige Nebeninformationen vom Offsprecher, wie die lateinischen Namen der eigenen Ameisen und andere Insekten und deren Verhaltensweisen, was der Illusion einer Naturdoku zu Gute kommt.\n\nDa zurzeit nur 4 solche Missionen existieren, kann man noch nicht viel zur Abwechslung sagen, jedoch versprechen die Entwickler Nachschub in Form von neuen Missionen zu liefern, die immer neue Sachen ins Spiel implementieren sollen, wie z.B. Blattschneideameisen, Regenf\u00e4lle, neue feindliche Gegnertypen usw.\n \nAn Ideen mangelt es sicherlich nicht und jeder der sich f\u00fcr die Weiterentwicklung des Spiels interessiert sollte auf dem Twitch bzw. Youtube Kanal von SlugDisco vorbei schauen. Dort wird regelm\u00e4\u00dfig ein Entwicklerstream abgehalten, der Einblick in die Entwicklung von EotU gibt.\n\nIst die Kolonie genug gewachsen und hat man alle Missionen eines Kapitels erreicht, muss man in einer Formicarium Challenge seine Kolonie auf die Probe stellen lassen, um die n\u00e4chsten Missionen spielen zu k\u00f6nnen. Diese Challenge wird als Biologieexperiment der hiesigen Wissenschaftler inszeniert, wobei einer der Wissenschaftler eine leicht sadistische Neigung hat, weswegen meistens mehr Geschmei\u00df auf einen zu kommt, als seine Partnerin plant.\n\nDas sorgt f\u00fcr eine ganz lustige Dynamik, ist spielerisch etwas z\u00e4h, da man hier meistens nur ausharrt bis endlich alle Gegner abgefr\u00fchst\u00fcckt wurden. Richtige Strategien kann man hier keine entwickeln, da meistens das Halten des Kolonieausgangs gen\u00fcgt. \nGen\u00fcgt dies nicht, muss man eventuell einige Missionen erneut spielen, um seinen Ameisen weitere Eigenschaften zu erkaufen und die Challenge erneut ausharren.\nDas kann sich aber definitiv in Zukunft \u00e4ndern.\n\n[h1] Technik [/h1]\n\nEotU basiert auf der Unreal Engine und macht insgesamt einen soliden Eindruck. In Anbetracht der Anzahl von Entwicklern (es sind 2 und ein Designer), die dazu auch noch echt sympathisch sind, bin ich definitiv zufrieden.\nDie Models wirken echt, wobei ich mir bei einigen Gr\u00f6\u00dfenverh\u00e4ltnissen nicht ganz sicher bin. \nLeider sind Animationen ein wenig karg, was aber definitiv zu verschmerzen ist, da ab einer gewissen Koloniegr\u00f6\u00dfe\ndas Gewusel individuelle Animationen \u00fcberdeckt.\nDa wir aber eine Ameisenkolonie spielen gilt sowieso Gewusel > Individualit\u00e4t, denn das ist es auch, was Ameisen ausmacht, f\u00fcr mich zumindest.\n\nBugs, au\u00dfer die die man steuert und die die man bek\u00e4mpfen muss, sind bei mir keine aufgetreten bzw. nicht aufgefallen.\nLediglich einige fragw\u00fcrdige Designentscheidungen, die aber nicht unbedingt ins negative Gewicht fallen m\u00fcssen.\n\nZ.B. die Startbrut die sich um die K\u00f6nigin scharrt.\nDiese kann nicht verbessert werden und sie sammelt nur Nahrung, die sich in der N\u00e4he befindet. In manchen Missionen\nist das erste Futter aber schon soweit weg, dass sie dieses nach dem Ausgraben nie sehen w\u00fcrden.\nMan muss zwar nur diese Startbrut einem Pheromonmarker zuweisen und dann wie gewohnt Futter sammeln.\nMuss es dann jedoch wieder zur\u00fcck \u00e4ndern, damit auch neue Stellen gebaut werden.\n\nDas Ganze ist nicht sonderlich nervig, und kann in manchen Leveln sogar als Early Game Strategie eingesetzt werden um schnell Futter zu stacken, aber die Notwendigkeit am Levelanfang k\u00f6nnte manche st\u00f6ren.\n\nEotU ist ein Early-Access Spiel, macht aber einen sehr guten Eindruck. Vorallem Sachen die negativ sind, bzw. st\u00f6ren werden auf Communitywunsch auch vom Entwickler ge\u00e4ndert. (siehe z.B. Bev\u00f6lkerungslimit im Formicarium).\n\nWeitere Inhalte die der Entwickler verspricht, k\u00f6nnen von der Community vorgeschlagen werden (siehe Devstreams), dabei wird definitiv ein Freeplay Mode entstehen, in dem mehrerer Kolonien (zurzeit nur AI) sich gegen immer andere Bedrohung beweisen m\u00fcssen. Es wird neue Ameisenarten, wie z.B. die ber\u00fchmten Blattschneideameisen geben, neue Gegner wie Skorpione oder dem Cordyceps Pilz und neue Mechaniken wie Jahreszeiten oder Niederschlag geben.\n \nSo das wars.

For the available content, there are 10 \"missions\", 4 are seperate from the main missions, one of which includes a freeplay option, which does what it says.

The price may have been a little too high for what content there is as of right now, but do not let that disuade you. Early Access has its ups and downs.

THIS DOES NOT NEED MULTIPLAYER. Replayability is there, though they are the same maps, and most you are unable to go above ground. Thoroughly looking forward to what else comes out of this game!\n\n(Message to the devs)\nIf the possibility of integrating a \"conquest\" like mode to the game, y'all absolutely should. Add weather patterns that boost and negate your colony with specific seasons and rain etc. (combat and food aquire rate or something). I say conquest as in, start in a regular setting, with a player picked amount of rival colonies. But, being able to go above ground, take all colonies, and move to a new part of the map. Sending part of your colony to it with the ability to send aid in a way, with the maps getting progressively more difficult to beat. Final map/dlc could be invading a termite colony, like the movie when I was a kid, Antz.\n\nGreat game guys! Keep up the hard work!

Everyone who has a Heart for Ants wont be dissapointed by this game.\n\nAs the Mods and Developers already stated many times Empires of the Undergrowth is an early Access with more content coming soon. As for now this game contains 4 challenging Missions in \"Formicarium Mode\" plus Two even more challenging Formicarium challenges which you need to pass to further advance in \"Formicrium mode\". And without spoiling the best about the Formicarium challenges lets just say they come with a very amusing \"twist\".\n\nAtmosphere 10/10: The narration during the levels reminds of a documentary- very good Voice Acting. As for the Music: very fitting, dramatic or calm or simply catching the scenery perfectly. To be honest Ive spent quite alot of Time just Listening to the Soundtrack.\n\nSetting (10/10 or less depending on your wish for a realistic Setting):\nLet me further explain this strange rating. You manage a colony of gene stealing ants in \"Formicarium mode\". These Ants do hopefully not exist outside of this game for they are capable of raising other specimen as their own. \n\nThese other Specimen in Empire of the Undergrowth so far are Formica Rufa and Formica Fusca which are real Antspecies. You play your first two Missions as Formica Fusca then you must finish the First Formicarium challenge as your Gene stealing Ant colony. After that you finish the next two Missions as Formica Rufa before you can try your Luck at the Second Formicarium challenge. So you have both some really cool \"Fantasy Ants\"(you can determine their coloring also) and beautifully modelled realistic Ants with the promise of more of them still coming.\n\nGame Mechanics 10/10 (early acces):\n- Moving Ants through Pheromone Markers which is a great more realistic concept than just controlling them as in most \n   other RTS Games.\n- By completing the Formicarium Missions you get Ressources to Upgrade your Gene Stealing Ants\n- Building Tunnels and Chambers to help your Colony to survive\n- Variety on Mechanics like: a rising Tide or Ladybugs trying to diminish your Food Ressources\n- Underground and \" Above Ground\" Missions\n- Wide Variation of Enemys to your colony with still more coming soon  \n\nCommunity and Developers 10/10:\n- Really dedicated Mods in the Forums answering every Question in a polite and efficent Way. \n- Livestreams in which you can witness the Development and even make Suggestions\n- Passionate Community of Ant Lovers who try their best to make this game even better\n- Frequent Bug Fixes (I didnt encountered any so far).     \n\nBut for now it seems like I have dropped my Beetles so this Review ends here :D.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1514996971, "timestamp_updated": 1514996971, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39005004": {"recommendationid": "39005004", "author": {"steamid": "76561198246628682", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 988, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514874626}, "language": "english", "review": "Very solid looking base game and im yet to come across any \"bugs\" so far.

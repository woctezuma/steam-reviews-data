Back then, I was an eight year old kid living in a cold, often rainy town near the Swiss border who had only experienced memorable console games (mainly platform and FPS genres) to kill boredom with. It was my first encounter with a historical strategy game, and boy did it rock my world.\n\nOf course, for a young kid such as myself, it would be laughable to say I had any real grasp of effective town-management in Zeus. But the suprising thing is that you didn't really need managing skills to get fully immersed.\nI can still remember the terror I'd experience when an irate deity of Olympus would send his pet monster to wreck my nascent city, or worse still, use his own godly powers on my buildings and unsuspecting townsfolk. All for the terrible crime of not building an expensive temple in his honour. \nI can also recall the fear I'd experience when some pushy enemy would send a dozen hoplite formations at my doorstep with only a few watchmen to fend them off.\n\nZeus was a strange, terrifying, and highly immersive world. It featured a clever combination of challenging gameplay and mythology. The voice acting was excellent.

It certainly lives up to the others in the series! I'd describe it as a cross between Pharoah and Emperor. The scale of the people/buildings resemble Pharoah, and the size of the maps and gameplay is more like Emperor. If you enjoyed any of the other games in the series you will enjoy this one. The gameplay is fun and challenging but easy to follow. The graphics and sound are clear and fitting to the historical period. As in Pharoah, some names of the people are puns on their profession which always raises a smile. This will be a game I play again and again through the years.

Like I have played a Zeus game that doesn't have all the sound effects, the only sounds I heard was the clicking of the mouse and ambient noises. Even with those downsides, Zeus was one of my favourite childhood games that I kept playing through thise day. Until it came out on Steam.\n\nFor the first time, I've experienced it with music, voices and a cinematic intro! No longer will I ever play that pirated version. \n\nMy experiences with this game is that you mostly have to plan about how you start makin' a city. My tip is that you must place your granary and storehouses at a strategic location, so you can build living districts around it. Don't forget that you storehouses around the granary must only obtain fleece and olive oil to avoid space density and build your industrial districts elsewhere.\n\nIn short: The game is easy to learn, but difficult to master.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1487621284, "timestamp_updated": 1487621284, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29962867": {"recommendationid": "29962867", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052585820", "num_games_owned": 333, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 475, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487253748}, "language": "english", "review": "This was my favourite city builder growing up, and I bought it on Steam hoping that the game-breaking bugs, the slow gods bug and staffed building animations bug had been resolved.

You can cross transfer your saves from to GOG to Steam and vice versa (done it myself).\n    [*] Game is playable in windows 7 and windows 10.(checked)\n    [*] No DLCS! everything that was ever published for the game is there. Poseidon was the official expansion for Zeus ; adding missions that have lots of water and new buildings/heroes to the existing ones.\n       On main menu you choose if you are going to play Zeus on Poseidon - aka you cannot play Zeus campaign maps with Poseidon units/buildings.\n  [/list]\n\nCons\n[list]\n    [*]The game supports only the following resolutions :Full screen 800 x600 and 1024x768 and window mode.There is an unofficial patch for higher resolutions but when i installed it i couldnt click on anything on main menu.\n    [*]The Gods when they appear on the map and when they are fighting for you (e.x a monster) have ultra slow animation.\n    [*]Steam overlay does not work correctly on the game. If someone speaks to you on chat you have to alt-tab to see the message.\n    [*]The cheats work randomly.\n    [*]The default animation speed (in options ) is 90% ; if you put it to 100% the speed of units is so fast that you want to vomit.So it is usable for a limited time before passing out :)\n   [/list]\n\n*Edit 24-11-2017 - with some online searching you can find additional maps/scenarios even full campaigns to enrich your experience.*\n\nPeople are still playing it in 2017.Not that many games can boast this achievement.These HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS of people that have played this game CANT BE WRONG!

If you have not gathered by the names alone.  This game places you in the universe of greek mythology.  You are the new ruler of famous greek cities.  You build them, make temples for various gods, summon heros to battle monsters, work around and surive natural and godly disasture and protect your city from other hostle cities.  \n\nOk, so this is the game.  Before you buy take into account this is an old game.  Well over 15 years old.  I got it cause it was one of my favorite games back in the day and can be addictive.  It is a lot of fun if you like sim/city management games.  The little people also have lines of spoken diologe along with the gods.  The graphics are a little dated but considering a lot of the \"indie/early access\" games coming out lately.  The graphis are on par.  \n\nI love this game.  It was fun 15 years ago.  It is still fun.  It can even be a good challenge most of the time.  One map I was on was small with little room to build a city.  I had to also had less room to build if I wanted to prevent Talos (greek iron golem guy) from distroying my stuff.  I also had to work around the requirements needed to summon a hero to defeat Talos.  He required several battle ship ports which required lots of workers as well as elite horse soldiers in my city.  Elite housing took up space and did not provide extra workers.  Not to mention they require all the luxuries.  So basically I had to design a very tight and compact city to get me as many workers I could.  While leaving enough room to build luxary estates for the rich upperclass and keep them happy.  Doing all this on a small map while avoiding the attenion of a monster who would destroy everything I built.  \n\nThis was just one part of ONE adventure set you could do.  In the Zeus game.  That's not even part of the Poseidon expantion that included more stuff to build, pyramids, and even more challenges.  \n\nLOVE THIS GAME!", "timestamp_created": 1483040764, "timestamp_updated": 1483040764, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518972", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28790350": {"recommendationid": "28790350", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999134369", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3447, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513002693}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought this game on steam as I could not get it to run from CD with windows 10, now it does.

One of my top 5 games of all time recently got released on Steam. I can't tell you how many hours I've spent playing the main Zeus & Poseidon campaigns, let alone the custom-made ones. \n\nThe pinnacle of city builders that started with Sierra and ended with Impressions Games: The Caesar series, Pharaoh (& Cleopatra), Zeus (& Poseidon), Emperor - Rise of the Middle Kingdom, and even Children of the Nile (even though I never quite got into it). Pharaoh is also available in Steam now, so make sure you check it out, too!\n\nAs for Zeus - If you want the ultimate experience, make sure you get the following things right (you don't have to, of course, but they make the game run much better on modern systems):\n\n[b] 1. Widescreen fan-made Patch [/b]\n-Download the following file: http://www.wsgfmedia.com/jackfuste/Zeus/Zeus.7z\n-Extract it.\n-Choose the folder with the resolution you want\n-Copy paste the files in the Zeus installation directory (overwrite the default ones)\n-Make sure you set the resolution while ingame to 1024x768, as that will trigger the patch. That's it.\n\n[b] 2. The slow god animation bug fix (not everyone experiences it equally badly, though) [/b]\n-Download Cheat Engine: http://www.cheatengine.org and start it.\n-Start Zeus, alt-tab to Cheat Engine, and select Zeus from the apps.\n-On the right side, there's a speed hack option. Enable it and set the value to 1 or 2.\nAfter this, the game will run a bit slower, like back when it was released - which is actually what you want. Don't forget that after this, you can still change the ingame speed (90% works fine in all cases I've come across so far. It's neither very fast, nor slow).\n\n[b] 3. Lots and lots of custom-made campaigns/adventures [/b] http://zeus.heavengames.com/downloads/lister.php?category=adventures_pos \n\nIt's amazing to see there are people who are still working on custom-made campaigns. They also pay attention to the stories, so many of the campaigns feel like an integral part of the game. Seeing as there are new adventures coming out, it's fair to say that this game is eternal!\n\n*Lastly, I will copy a post explaining how to install the custom adventures:\n\"If you are downloading from the Zeus download page, there will be either a Y (indicating that it is an adventure requiring Poseidon Expansion pack), or an N (indicating it does not require the expansion). Secondly, you must create a folder with the EXACT name of the pak. file in the Adventures folder. Then extract all files to the newly created folder. Also, then you must copy the pak. file directly to the adventure folder itself. Just keep at it. I know it's confusing and a little aggrevating. I had this problem myself, and it took a few tries before I realized what I needed to be doing.\"\n\nStill, even if downloading custom adventures sounds too complicated, don't worry. Both Zeus and Poseidon have more than enough content to keep you going for days/weeks/months... There's even a sandbox mode where you can build cities and please the gods to your heart's content! It's the perfect combination of city building, monument building, resource management and humor. Believe me, there's lots of humor to be found while admiring the streets of your Ancient Greek cities! \n\nI'm sure I've spent hundreds of hours playing this gem. Now, I will only make those hours visible for others to see, all thanks to Steam! :D", "timestamp_created": 1482920003, "timestamp_updated": 1483045400, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 73, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.879051", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28734134": {"recommendationid": "28734134", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039853075", "num_games_owned": 1123, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 427, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511425881}, "language": "german", "review": "Endlich gibt es das Spiel auch auf Steam. Bei \"Herrscher des Olymp - Zeus\" (oder Englisch \"Zeus - Master of Olympus\" bzw. einfach \"Zeus + Poseidon\" f\u00fcr die Version inklusive Erweiterung \"Herrscher von Atlantis - Poseidon\") handelt es sich um ein Einzelspieler City Builder Spiel, welches aufgrund seines einfachen aber dennoch sehr spa\u00dfigen Spielprinzips  \u00fcberzeugen kann. \n\nDas Spiel ist schnell erlernt, man kann innerhalb von Abenteuern oder Sandbox Spielen verschiedene griechische St\u00e4dte aufbauen und beim Gedeihen zusehen. Die Abenteuer Szenarien sowie die im Spiel angerissene G\u00f6tter Welt ist sehr nah an der griechischen Mythologie gesidelt, weshalb man tats\u00e4chlich nebenbei spielerisch sehr viel dar\u00fcber lernt. Eine Besonderheit des Spiels ist, dass die Bewohner der Stadt, im Speziellen eben die verschiedenen Berufe durch die Stra\u00dfen wandern und sehr informative, wie auch humorvolle Aussagen von sich geben, sobald man auf diese klickt. Diese Aussagen geben einem vor allem Hinweise darauf, wie sich die Bewohner f\u00fchlen, also besonders auch, woran es deiner Stadt mangelt. Kernprinzip des Spiels ist es zu Wirtschaften. Als direkte Ressource gibt es nur Drachmen als Geldeinheit, mit der man haushalten muss. Sonst sind die Ressourcen eher lokal angelegt: hei\u00dft, Geb\u00e4ude besitzen einen bestimmten Funktionsradius und sind effektiver, wenn sie nah beieinander platziert werden. Ein Lebensmittelh\u00e4ndler braucht also einen nahen Bezug zu einem Silo, und kann nur einen bestimmten Teil der Stadt beliefern. Die H\u00e4user entwickeln sich Stufe f\u00fcr Stufe und verlangen mit der Zeit verschiedene andere Ressurcen, neben bestimmten G\u00fctern wie \u00d6l und Wein beispielsweise auch Kultur, welche durch vorbeilaufende Athleten, Schauspieler und Rednern (oder in der Erweiterung auch Wissenschaftler) in der Stadt verteilt wird. F\u00fcr mich ist dieses Spiel ein absoluter Klassiker, welchen ich regelm\u00e4\u00dfig mal wieder spiele und noch genauso liebe wie am ersten Tag. Es wird einfach nicht langweilig. \n\nLeider sind die Versionen, die als digitaler Download verf\u00fcgbar sind, ausschlie\u00dflich auf Englisch verf\u00fcgbar und grafisch ist das Spiel eben auf dem Niveau von 2001, also gar ohne Unterst\u00fctzung von 16:9 Aufl\u00f6sungen und generell sehr pixelig. Beide Mankos lassen sich aber durch von Nutzern erstellte Patches etwas entkr\u00e4ften, sodass man diesen etwas in die Jahre gekommenden Klassiker immernoch weitesgehend genie\u00dfen kann (siehe unten). \n\nIch kann es nur jedem empfehlen, dieses Spiel (oder die anderen, sehr \u00e4hnlichen Ableger der Sierra City Builder Reihe) einmal auszuprobieren. F\u00fcr mich pers\u00f6nlich ist Herrscher des Olymp - Zeus eines der besten, wenn nicht sogar das beste Spiel \u00fcberhaupt. F\u00fcr mich ist es unvorstellbar, weshalb man sich erst jetzt dazu entschlossen hat, das Spiel \u00fcberhaupt auf Steam zu ver\u00f6ffentlichen, oder weshalb man nie mehr aus der gro\u00dfartigen Reihe gemacht hat. Seit der \u00dcbernahme von Activision 2014 w\u00e4re dies eigentlich l\u00e4ngst \u00fcberf\u00e4llig gewesen. Es gibt leider keine aktuellen Spiele, die sich auch nur ann\u00e4herend damit messen k\u00f6nnen. Der neuste und letzte Ableger der Serie (Ceasar IV, 2006) war aber ja leider aufgrund der Abkehr von den die Serie definierenden Spielelementen sehr schlecht, weshalb man diese wahrscheinlich auch begraben hat.. \n\nEmpfohlene Downloads: \nDeutsches Sprachpaket - https://www.validstrategies.com/filebase/file/21-zeus-und-poseidon-german-language-pack/ \nHD Resolution Patch - http://www.moddb.com/mods/zeus-and-poseidon-full-hd-enfr#", "timestamp_created": 1482888589, "timestamp_updated": 1482888589, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504252", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28731545": {"recommendationid": "28731545", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989035962", "num_games_owned": 1605, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 298, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482921982}, "language": "polish", "review": "Zagrywa\u0142em si\u0119 w t\u0119 gr\u0119, gdy by\u0142em m\u0142ody.

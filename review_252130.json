Not a bad mobile port. In fact, its even a good port in some respects. But two glaring errors stuck out to me, the PC user. First one is nitpicking and doesn't affect anything but leaving a \"please rate the app\" screen at the end of the menus is just bad form. Then there was no resolution/windowed control. And this being a time-filler puzzle game it is primed for being played while consuming other media. Windowed mode (without 3rd party programs) should be considered a must. So alt+tab'ing ensued and I will note I suffered some framerate hiccups upon doing that. The game does look good at 1080p and runs at a solid 60 frames otherwise though. \n\nThe port issues aside, this game is great. The wacky theme and art. The tight puzzles. The bright color palette. It all works. The 150 puzzles are all well constructed in their simplicity. Each level features 9 or less platforms with three sets of requirements to clear. It starts with hopping sheep around. But ends up with wolves, pigs, lasers, meat eating octopus, portals, traps, flames, totems, and more. The game regularly provides new wrinkles to the puzzles. Right when one set of mechanics is wearing thin and you are in a groove you run into something new. If you go for all the \"stars\" on every level you'll find yourself with a solid 7~8+ hours of gameplay.

Gegeben ist in jedem der wohl 150 Level eine Welt voller benachbarter Insel bestimmter Gr\u00f6\u00dfe, bev\u00f6lkert mit Schafen und W\u00f6lfen (sp\u00e4ter auch Schweinen).\n\nAufgabe ist es, die Tiere in drei vorgegebenen Mengen in dieser Reihenfolge einer Rettung zuzuf\u00fchren.\n\nSchr\u00e4ger Humor lockert die ansonsten rein abstrakte Aufgabe erfreulich auf.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1152235525\n\nBei der Bewegung der Tiere von Insel zu Insel fallen nicht nur diese, die keinen Platz mehr finden ins Wasser und ertrinken. Auchh jeder nichtsatte Wolf frisst ein (1) Schaf, kann sich daf\u00fcr aber nicht mehr bewegen.\n\nKolletaralsch\u00e4den werden also billigend in Kauf genommen. Selbst halbierte Schafe werden angenommen und auf dem Rettungsboot wieder (mit einem G\u00fcrtel) zu einem Ganzen verbunden.\n\nDer Schwierigkeitsgrad steigt nach dem ersten Abschnitt (je 30 R\u00e4tsel) erheblich an.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1152236023\n\nBei der L\u00f6sung kommt es dem Spiel nicht darauf an, wieviele Z\u00fcge man ben\u00f6tigte, sondern nur das Ergebnis z\u00e4hlt. Eine perfekte L\u00f6sung wird mit drei Sternen belohnt, man muss aber nur ein Rettungsboot korrekt f\u00fcllen, um die ansonsten gesperrten nachfolgenden Level angehen zu k\u00f6nnen.\n\nDie Zwischensequenzen, die neue Spielelemente erkl\u00e4ren sollen, waren mir allerdings eher unverst\u00e4ndlich. Meist war es letzlich selbsterkl\u00e4rend, manchmal musste ich aber auch etwas rumprobieren, bis ich die Funktionsweise verstanden habe.\n\nDas Spiel bietet an sich nichts zu bem\u00e4ngeln. Es bedarf aber eine starke F\u00e4higkeit zu recht abstrakten Rechenspielen, um durch geeignetes hin- und herwerfen der Tiere auf genau die gew\u00fcnschte Anzahl an Tieren zu kommen. Auf die L\u00f6sung kommt man ja aber auch nicht so einfach, wie man die L\u00f6sung einer Gleichung finden mag, sondern es bieten sich mir einfach zu viele M\u00f6glichkeiten, um noch den Durchblick bewahren zu k\u00f6nnen. Vielleicht komme ich aber mit der Zeit weiter. Ich habe mir das Spiel zum Weiterspielen vorgemerkt. Immerhin werde ich aber alle Level wohl freischalten k\u00f6nnen. Immerhin.\n\nDie Grafik ist einfach und OK. S\u00fc\u00df und auch makaber mit den gro\u00dfen Blutflecken und \u00e4hnlichem.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1152238888\n\nDie Handhabung mit der Maus ist fast einfach. Es gen\u00fcgt allerdings leider nicht, die gew\u00fcnschte H\u00fcpfrichtung der Inselbewohner anzudeuten, sondern man sollte die Maus immer bis zur n\u00e4chsten Insel bewegen, ehe man losl\u00e4sst. Es hat eine Weile gedauert, bis ich das gemerkt habe.\n\nEs gibt sehr viele Errungenschaften, die nicht so leicht zu ergattern sind, aber au\u00dfer R\u00e4tsell\u00f6sen keine anderen T\u00e4tigkeiten erfordert, denke ich.\n\nPro & Contra:\n\n+ Ein sch\u00f6nes R\u00e4tselprinzip\n+ Am\u00fcsant-makabre Animation\n\no 150 teils sehr gute, teils sehr schwere R\u00e4tsel\n\nWertung: 8/10\n\nDas Spiel ist ein von der Idee und Umsetzung \u00fcberaus sch\u00f6nes Spiel.\n\nLetztlich gefielen mir viele der R\u00e4tsel doch nicht ganz so gut, weil sie mir (arme Mathematikerseele) zuwenig zielstrebige L\u00f6sungsverfolgung boten.\n\nAnsonsten h\u00e4tte es auch 10/10 erhalten.

Animali nuovi, piattaforme diverse, ecc.\n\nIl vostro compito \u00e8 sostanzialmente quello di risolvere gli enigmi (3 per livello) calcolando e spostando gli elementi nell'almbiente. Ogni elemento ha caratteristiche diverse dagli altri ed essi verranno inseriti e spiegati nel gioco durante il normale gameplay. Pecore, Maiali, Lupi, Trampolini, TNT... Tutti elementi che vi troverete ad usare per risolvere i puzzle.\n\nI principali obiettivi riguardano il portare alla zattera tot animali dello stesso tipo (es. pecore) facendo attenzione a non sforare mai, altrimenti l'obiettivo nn sar\u00e0 completato. La zattera partir\u00e0 solo quando abbastanza piena e se il numero \u00e8 corretto l'obiettivo sar\u00e0 completato.\nVi sono inoltre alcuni obiettivi pi\u00f9 particolari come l'uccidere gli animali (per poter trasportare le anime) o trascinare un totem fino alla zattera.\n\nIn tutto vi sono 150 livelli (30 ogni mondo, per 5 mondi), ognuno dei quali con 3 obiettivi rappresentati dalle solite stelle.\n\nIl gioco \u00e8 un palese porting dalla versione mobile, lo si nota bene nel men\u00f9 principale (e anche nel \"rate app\" in fondo ai livelli...), tuttavia la fattura \u00e8 ottima (non ho giocato la versione mobile quindi non posso fare paragoni).\nGrafica cartoonesca adatta, ambienti semplici ma ben curati.\nLa colonna sonora \u00e8 fantastica (solitamente nei giochi puzzle la disattivo perch\u00e8 troppo disturbante, questa invece l'ho trovata piacevole).\n\nHo riscontrato solamente un problemino... Se si resetta il livello mentre si stanno ancora muovendo degli elementi pu\u00f2 capitare che il gioco rallenti un attimo con tanto di effetti sonori fastidiosi.\n\nPer il resto il gioco \u00e8 facilmente completabile al 100% (basta raccogliere tutte le stelle).\n\nConsiglio assolutamente!

Las cuales debemos mover de plataforma en plataforma de distintos numeros de bloques. Si movemos 5 ovejas a una plataforma de 4, una oveja se perdera, si una oveja ya estaba ocupando un lugar, lo mismo se pierde una.\nLa dificultad esta en saber moverlas en el orden correcto para perder ovejas si es necesario y asi completar el numero requerido.

You can skip to the next level even if you cannot get to 3 Stars. Get 1 Star and you're free, and the vast majority of 1 Stars is easy.\n* Appropriate number of \"tools\". You have sheep, wolf, pigs, burning statue, TNT, wolf traps and fire traps. Each level will use a certain number of these, but they never seem overwhelming.\n* Appropriate number of goals. You can save sheep, wolves, pigs and/or statue, kill them, or feed them to a giant squid. Each level will indicate which goal to achieve. Keeps things fresh (like the sheep, mmm).\n* Funny too when blood is introduced (never expected that), but you can easily disable it.\n* Steam cards are adorable!\n\nCons:\n* Music can slowly get annoying if listened to for an hour or more.\n* Steam Achievements don't work.\n* Little replay value.

[/h1]\n\n\"Divide By Sheep\" ist urspr\u00fcnglich ein Androidspiel, welches auf den PC und auf Steam geportet wurde. Im Google Play Store kostet es nur 1,10 \u20ac.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nIn \"Divide By Sheep\" m\u00fcssen wir in der Vogelperspektive die exakt richtige Anzahl an Schafen auf das Boot kriegen, welches an einer Stelle im Level erscheint. Dabei haben wir in jedem Level immer 3 \"Auftr\u00e4ge\". Das hei\u00dft z. B. man muss 3,5,2 Schafe in exakt dieser Reihenfolge aufs Schiff bringen. Jedoch besitzt jede Insel, auf denen die Schafe umherh\u00fcpfen k\u00f6nnen, nur eine bestimmte Anzahl an Pl\u00e4tzen. \u00dcberz\u00e4hlige Schafe fallen runter, sobald der Platz voll ist und auch damit muss man dann kalkulieren. F\u00fcr jeden \"Auftrag\" gibt es einen Stern, wobei man eine gewisse Anzahl Sterne zum Weitermachen ben\u00f6tigt. Dabei kann man auch einen Auftrag versemmeln, z.B. durch zuviele Schafe. In diesem Fall kann man dann aber einfach den n\u00e4chsten Stern noch bekommen. \nBleibt das Spiel so simpel? Haha, nein! Das Spiel bringt laufend neue Mechaniken dazu: W\u00f6lfe, die man auch aufs Flo\u00df bringen muss und die Schafe fressen, Laserstrahlen, welche die Schafe in zwei H\u00e4lften teilen, Trennw\u00e4nde und vieles mehr. Die Spielmechaniken sind sehr ausgekl\u00fcgelt und fordern den Spieler jeden Alters. Dennoch reicht es, wenn man in dem Level nur einen Stern hat, damit man halt weiterkommt. Nur insgesamt muss die Anzahl eben stimmen.\n\n[b]Story[/b]\nStory ist nicht wirklich vorhanden. Der Sensenmann ist ein wenig unser Charakter, den wir verfolgen. Dieser kommt dann ab der dritten Welt ins Spiel und man muss genau die richtige Zahl an Tieren umbringen. Ansonsten versuchen die Schafe und W\u00f6lfe nat\u00fcrlich zu fliehen.\n\n[b]Grafik/Sound[/b]\nDas Spiel hat einen lieblichen Comic-look, der eine heitere und lustige Atmossph\u00e4re verspricht. Die Tiere und Animationen sind witzig gestaltet, so weinen die Schafe z. B. sobald man sie anklickt. Im Grunde h\u00e4tte ich gesagt, dass das Spiel kindgerecht wirkt, nur die zerfetzenden Laserstrahlen sind doch dann arg brutal f\u00fcr Kinderaugen. Aber lustig sind sie trotzdem.\nDie Melodie schlie\u00dft sich der Grafik an und verspricht Heiterkeit. Die Schafe bl\u00f6ken vor sich hin und die wenigen anderen Sounds sind auch gut getroffen. Die Musik ist nichts Besonderes, l\u00e4sst den Spieler sich aber entspannen.\n\n\n[b]Fazit[/b]\n\"Divide By Sheep\" ist ein lustiges kleines Puzzlespiel, bei dem man gut rechnen muss. Die Grafik und Musik sind lustig gestaltet und es kommen mit passenden Abst\u00e4nden immer wieder Ver\u00e4nderungen im Gameplay. Wer sich nicht die teurere Version auf Steam kaufen m\u00f6chte, kann ja im Google Play Store vorbeischauen. Einen Kauf ist das Spiel auf jeden Fall wert!\n\n\nWenn dir das Review gefallen hat, w\u00fcrde ich mich freuen, wenn du meiner Kuratorgruppe auf Steam folgst, um auch meine Reviews zu anderen Spielen zu bekommen: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Drakeschool\nMittlerweile ver\u00f6ffentliche ich meine Reviews auch in der Deutsch/Germany Gruppe auf Steam: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Deutschland-Germany#", "timestamp_created": 1498687944, "timestamp_updated": 1510311646, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517085", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32949133": {"recommendationid": "32949133", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014866888", "num_games_owned": 854, "num_reviews": 175, "playtime_forever": 186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498672601}, "language": "turkish", "review": "Yanl\u0131\u015f hamlede geri alma fonksiyonu olmal\u0131yd\u0131.

The premise is that Death is lonely, and decides to collect himself some animal friends. Thus, the game centers around killing cute, fuzzy creatures.\n\nReally, the game is at its core about manipulating objects \u2013 sheep, wolves, and pigs \u2013 around a 2D environment. There are a series of platforms laid out in a grid, and each platform has anywhere between 1 and 9 spaces on it for animals to stand on. If you boot an animal over onto another platform, and there isn\u2019t room for it, it will be ejected from it. If you put wolves onto a platform with sheep or pigs, or vice-versa, the wolves will eat the sheep/pigs and become fat and immobile, locking off spaces from landing on them. If you bounce pigs onto a platform with sheep, the pigs will land on the sheep and kill them. If anything is on a platform with a pig, only the pig will be ejected when you launch from it.\n\nThese simple rules, combined with a few other things \u2013 a fence preventing ejection between platforms; a laser cutter which chops sheep in half (but not other things), doubling the space they take up; TNT spots, which blow up if nothing is left on the platform, removing it from play; frying spots, which burn up one animal on them per move; burners, which are turned off by buttons on another platform; a portal platform, which teleports back excess animals instead of killing them; a bounce pad, which immediately ejects any animal which lands on it onto one or more adjacent platforms (some will eject onto two, splitting the animals evenly between them); and a totem, which kills anything else on the platform it is on but can be bounced around from platform to platform by the player and is otherwise invincible \u2013 make up the gameplay.\n\nThe goal is to ship out three sets of animals, in order. Boats come on the top-left of the screen, and your goal is to load exactly the right number of exactly the right kind of animal onto the boats. There are boats for each of the wolves, sheep, and pigs, as well as a boat for Death himself, which requires you to kill X many animals (making their souls appear on his boat), and a sea monster, which just requires X amount of any sort of animal (it isn\u2019t a picky eater). There\u2019s also a boat for a totem on a few of the levels.\n\nThe boats won\u2019t leave until they\u2019re filled (or overfilled), and while you only have to get one right to progress, you need to get almost all of the boats filled to unlock consecutive worlds.\n\nThus, the goal is to get exactly the right number of animals onto the boats using the various platforms and mechanics given to you. The game gradually introduces new mechanics over its length, adding about one new mechanic every 10-15 levels, helping it to keep itself relatively fresh as it adds ever more complexity to its puzzles.\n\nOverall, the game has 150 levels, spanning 5 worlds, and takes somewhere on the order of 6-8 hours to 100%. It isn\u2019t terribly hard, generally speaking, but a few of them levels require quite a bit of cleverness to solve; none of the levels takes more than a minute or so to solve correctly, but you may be stuck on them for ten times that long if you can\u2019t figure out the right trick. It is ultimately very much math-based, and oftentimes the process of elimination is necessary to try and figure out all the ways that clearly won\u2019t work, so you can figure out the one way that will.\n\nThis is a fairly decent puzzle game, and the mechanics work well for what it is. However, it is very simple, and unless you really enjoy simple puzzle games without much in the way of story or anything else, there\u2019s nothing else here for you. \n\nThat being said, this is really a game you will probably enjoy more on your phone than on your PC; it isn\u2019t a sit down and play it for hours game (though you can do so), it is more of a throwaway thing.\n\nOverall, this is very squarely directed at a puzzle game player \u2013 the sort of simple puzzle game you might play on your phone or a similar mobile device. If you like pure puzzle games, this is a decent game, but it is hard for me to muster much enthusiasm for it - while it certainly was clever at times, and its mechanics were simple and clean, I just was never wowed by it. It is just sort of a par for the course game - never quite dull, but never all that interesting, either. If you don\u2019t like pure puzzle games, or if you like plot or purpose or anything else, this game will likely bore you.", "timestamp_created": 1495369228, "timestamp_updated": 1495369553, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502806", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31879402": {"recommendationid": "31879402", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019209539", "num_games_owned": 516, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 604, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495361352}, "language": "english", "review": "Not sure how math this game is, but it sure is a puzzle game, and it was fun enough.

It might look a like cheap mobile port, but underneath there's a very solid and clever puzzle game.\n\nThe game starts simple enough. You just need to move groups of sheep between platforms and get the exact right amount of them on the rafts. But the game keeps adding more and more elements to this simple formula and soon enough you are also dealing with wolves, pigs, dynamite platforms, laser fences and many other complications. \n\nThe constant introduction of new gameplay elements keeps the game fresh and interesting. There's a good amount of content too, especially if you decide to get full three stars in each level.\n\nDespite the cute art style the game has some seriously dark undertones. Many of the levels actually require you to sacrifice a certain amount of cute animals and using the game's internal logic it makes perfect sense that a sheep cut in half by a laser fence still counts as one if you patch it back together.\n\nThe controls are clearly optimized for touch, but the mouse controls work reasonably well too. The game also has a rather prominent \"Rate this App\" link, which really should have been removed from the Steam release. On a positive note there are no microtransactions or gamebreaking powerups.\n\nOverall Divide by Sheep is a highly enjoyable math puzzle game with lots of clever ideas and interesting levels. I'd recommend it to any puzzle game fans.\n\nThe good:\n- Great puzzles\n- Does a good job of introducing new gameplay elements\n- Lots of levels\n- Cute art with a dark twist\n\nThe bad:\n- The tutorials can be somewhat confusing\n- Controls are optimized for touch\n- Prominent \"Rate this App\" link", "timestamp_created": 1488384771, "timestamp_updated": 1488384984, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.576190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30051256": {"recommendationid": "30051256", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080833647", "num_games_owned": 435, "num_reviews": 129, "playtime_forever": 37, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453525586}, "language": "english", "review": "A good game, good math puzzle concept.

Divide by Sheep has plenty of mechanisms that are more relevant to logic (wolves eating sheeps then blocking cells, pigs taking priority over sheeps, lasers cutting sheeps in half but not wolves, switching platforms, triggered burners, portals, and so on..). Each element appears around every 10 levels, which makes the game never boring and always fun all along the 150 levels.\n\nThe longevity is very good, it took me 18h to complete the 150 levels at 100%, which make an average of 7mn per level, please note that I'm very slow, and that around 20% of the levels can be solved in less than 2mn, while some other ones can easily take more than 10mn. One very good point is that the difficulty is not increasing continuously like in most puzzlers, instead, some levels are sometimes more easy than the previous ones, and I never been stuck or felt frustrated. Knowing that the next level can be easier is very motivating. When finishing the game you will be granted with a 100% achievement.\n\nApart from that, the graphic design is a total success with its colorfull look, animations are smooth and very fun, maybe one bad point is that the screen resolution is locked, but it's really not a problem. The game is also divided in 5 worlds, each one with his own graphic design, mechanisms and music soundtrack (variations on the main theme). The game was made with Adobe Air (which is a very solid engine for such games), and it was designed first for touchscreen (I imagine that a tablet version should exist, I didn't check), but works perfectly with the mouse as well.

Yes, you also divide.\nLet me get it out of the way: this is a blatant mobile port that nonetheless ends up working ok with a mouse.\n\nThe basic mechanics have you throw groups of critters from one island to the next, with the goal of satisfying 3 requests in each, be it save an exact amount of them or kill a certain number. These requests are tied to the layout of the map and require you to move around the animals until you've satisfied them all in sequence.\nYou can merge groups on a single island (2 sheeps + 3 sheeps = 5 sheep!) as well as \"decrease them\" by throwing more than an island can take and drowning the excess. I should also mention that you [i]literally[/i] divide sheep with laser grids. In half. A bloody half. And two halves make a whole, don't forget!\nThings get more complex as the game gives you more critters who interact differently with one another (wolves eat all others, pigs squash sheeps, the golden idol that exists somehow squashes everything...) as well as different types of islands that disappear when left empty or burn any visitor.\n\nWhile the game is fun, it doesn't have a very good progression; the difficulty varies wildly from one stage and the next, but it somehow manages to be fun for the most part. \nI have to point out that it does overstay its welcome by a couple dozen stages; the last world adds slightly uninspired elements that were most likely added just to increase the duration of the game. The achievement structure also suggests this: the \"get everything\" unlocks after the second-to-last world, with one more \"get everything\" unlocking after you're done with the last world as well.\n\nAll in all, Divide by Sheep is a cute puzzle game, but I wouldn't suggest it to those who don't already love the genre.\nTo such players, go ahead and get it during a discount for a few hours of fun; feel also free to let go when you get bored though: sadly, there's no majestic puzzle design waiting for you in its last phases.", "timestamp_created": 1480699813, "timestamp_updated": 1480699813, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586227", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28083015": {"recommendationid": "28083015", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012994966", "num_games_owned": 524, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 705, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480452304}, "language": "english", "review": "Cute (and gory) kinda-math-related puzzle game.

Death is a lonely little soul with a sheep fetish (maybe he\u2019s from Buxton, I don\u2019t know), he just loves those wooly little ruminants. Being an anthropomorphic personification of the slide into decrepitude and the inevitable surcease of life, he can only be friendly with dead things. As a result and in a leap of somewhat startlingly stark logic, he decides to kill everything. In a flood. Old Testament style. Sploosh.\n\nNow this is where you come in, it\u2019s your task to float the little darlings on to rafts and rescue them from his bony clutches. So far so simple, but wait, they are on islands, and some islands only hold so many sheep. If you get them to jump from an island that can hold, say seven sheep onto one holding only four, three of them will drown and spent eternity as the grim reapers fluffy playthings! Ah well, them\u2019s the breaks. Of course, just like islands, some rafts can only hold so many sheep, so you will have to strategically drown some of them anyway just to get to the end of the level.\n\nAnd so it goes, sheep drown, sheep live, and as the game progresses you get to slice them in half with lasers (they get duct taped back together on the raft, don\u2019t worry), bounce them off trampolines, and feed them to wolves. Of course, wolves need rescuing too, so them too get to bounce about like little black motes of soot. A fed wolf can\u2019t bounce as that would cause nasty vomitory complications so they just sit there looking happy while the raft floats off into the sunset. While you tax your brain trying to work out how to meet all three victory conditions for the level or at least one of them so you can move on and see what devilry has been set in store for you next.\n\nVisually, this game screams out what it is, a mobile game that has come to Steam. With blocky, voxel style graphics, cutesy sounds and music, and a user interface that screams out \u201cI was on an iPhone\u201d in a loud squeaky voice.\n\nNone of this detracts from the inherent addictiveness of flinging sheep at laser beams, fences and the occasional kraken however, in fact it enhances the dark comedic nature of the game and has you giggling at the animated cut-scenes that explain the latest twist to the game play with visuals of bisected ruminants, flying ungulates, and snapping canidae.\n\nOn the whole, Divide by Sheep is a cute, enjoyable, darkly comedic time sucker of a game. It has a real \u201cone more level\u201d appeal to it that has had me sit to play it, and then wonder why my freshly made coffee is now cold on more than one occasion. tinyBUILD have made a bit of a corker here, and it\u2019s well worth the 4 quid it costs on Steam", "timestamp_created": 1479941544, "timestamp_updated": 1479941544, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26882379": {"recommendationid": "26882379", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047214514", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 772, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442774532}, "language": "german", "review": "Herrliches Puzzle-Spiel mit Humor\n\nIm Spiel gilt es, eine bestimmte Anzahl von Spielfiguren (Schafe, W\u00f6lfe, Seelen...) auf ein Boot zu bekommen.

To do it, player has to move groups of animals between islands, increasing or decreasing (mostly by drowning) groups to make them fit into the raft. There are many types of islands, eg. ones that swap places of groups without them killing each other, there are lasers that work only on sheeps - they cut them in half, so you need two squares per helf of the sheep, and you need to deliver any 2 parts of the sheep to the raft. There are few more blocks, but these are just examples. \nEach animal have different relationship towards the others - Wolves eat sheep, pigs always kick their groups amount of animals from the island they land on and so on. \nLater in game there are more raft types; not only you have to deliver few animal types, but you have also ones that require you to kill specified amount of any animal, or deliver exact amount of any animals to the giant squid. \nOverally, this is a good game.

The visuals can be adjusted in the option menu.\n\n[h1][u]Game Audio[/u][/h1]\n\nI want to mentioned that the audio for this game is well done even if it's simplistic and somewhat repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the option menu as well.\n\n[h1][u]Gameplay[/u][/h1]\n\nThere are no difficult modes to choose from but each of the levels has their own difficulty.\n\nThere are five worlds with thirty levels in total six hundred levels. All levels has three stars to earn.\n\nThere's an option for resetting the level if an error has been made. All levels can be replayed to earn all three stars. The first world is automatically unlock but the other four worlds are locked. They required a certain amount of stars to unlock them.\n\nNew game mechanics are introduced into the game as it progresses. As it being said the puzzles will certainly get tricky to solve.\n\nThere nineteen achievements to earned but each has a requirement before they can be unlocked. \n\n[h1][u]Miscellaneous[/u][/h1]\n\nThere are total of six different trading cards. You only get the three of those cards from the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the trading card: Purchased from Steam's Market; Trade with friends; Booster Packs and it's Booster Pack Creator.\n\nFinal thoughts, I've found this game enjoyable to certain extend. The replay value for this game is low. I would recommend this game but not at the full price.\n\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/252130", "timestamp_created": 1466091331, "timestamp_updated": 1500842639, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.611694", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23545379": {"recommendationid": "23545379", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156216294", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491009672}, "language": "english", "review": "8/8 Love it", "timestamp_created": 1465866023, "timestamp_updated": 1465866023, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.464912", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23427440": {"recommendationid": "23427440", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119511211", "num_games_owned": 167, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512365511}, "language": "english", "review": "sheep\nyou kill the sheep\nyou cry over the dead sheep\nthen you get over it right away and kill more sheep\nrinse and repeat", "timestamp_created": 1465260471, "timestamp_updated": 1465260471, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.464912", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23381886": {"recommendationid": "23381886", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109119453", "num_games_owned": 475, "num_reviews": 264, "playtime_forever": 122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452686058}, "language": "english", "review": "Simple maths puzzle game.

Divide by Sheep proves that not every sheep is as innocent as the German proverb 'I am innocent like a sheep' says.\n\nThe goal of this puzzle game is sending the exact amount of sheeps to the life boat which is given at the start of each level. This is done by using the platforms the wooly animals are standing on and \"shooting\" them to neighbouring ones. However if the number of sheeps exceeds the space on the platforms, you can watch some sheeps taking a dive into the water. But ofcourse sheeps aren't the only characters you need to complete each level: as soon as you think that you get the gist of this \"easy\" game, you will meet pigs, wolfs and painful-sheep cutting lasers as well as other mechanis to not only fill life boats but also the ride of the grim reaper.\n\nThis game is a good way to get your logical thinking going, if you try to get a perfect completion on every single level. For people who aren't aversed to puzzle games that are repetitive in its main goal and are looking for a time killing challenge, Divide by Sheep is definitely a good game to get their brain cells going without having to rage quit too much.

They said they had no idea there was an issue and they'd look into it. Months later, no update, I email again and am told the devs have moved on. They just made a quick and dirty minimal work required port and have no intention of fixing any issues with it or ever revisiting this game ever again, despite the interest of many customers.

It is, at its core, a puzzle/logic game. Don't let the mathiness intimidate you, if you are wont to be intimidated by mathiness. Players are able to engage in unlimited trial and error to sort out each level, as needed. Nevertheless, there have been 2 times (so far) that I've resorted to YouTube'ing a level to complete it (that's 2xs out of 100+?). So, in my opinion, Divide by Sheep is well balanced; the difficulty increases at an acceptable, steady rate which maximizes fun and minimizes frustration.\n\nIt *does* get a little repetitive at times, but Divide by Sheep is the sort of game that you can spend a couple of days away from yet come back to again (as opposed to taking a couple days off and forgetting the game exists) because the game really IS fun. Beyond the gameplay, the graphics are another positive point. The design/concepts are pleasantly ironic; there is a certain (and non-morbid) amount of satisfactory stress relief in killing sheep. Well. Not killing. Delivering them to the reaper. *cough* The cuteness of the graphics provides the perfect offset and absurdity level for what you will need to do in order to complete the levels of the game, i.e. kill sheep. \n\nOne (albeit obscure) criticism is that the comic strip-like stills between levels, which sometimes appear to \"explain\" new features added to an upcoming level, are often rather opaque in the sense that they can be very difficult to make sense of. Thankfully, Divide by Sheep is highly forgiving - you can reset any given level after experimenting to learn about a new platform \"The Hard (but still amusing) Way\". Because of this the, at times confusing, explanatory stills do not pose a significant problem. Consider it a pet peeve.\n\nOne of the things I found very helpful (even if I didn't often avail myself of the feature because I am a stubborn completionist who will try and try again until I must YouTube because all of the stars) was the ability to wave a surrender flag if/when I was stuck. I appreciated that this was possible even if I did not take advantage of it.This feature would, in theory and practice, allow me to progress through the game (without needing to cheat YouTube walkthroughs) despite only being able to complete one or two out of three deliveries in a given level. The flag waving prevents stuck-ness and provides a lack of gated-ness that many modern puzzle games lack. This feature made Divide by Sheep more inviting and took the pressure off for a not-really-particularly-skilled-at-mental-math sort of person like me. (I'm better with theory. I swear.)\n\nI 100% recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a well-made puzzle game and to anyone who is more pedestrian about puzzlers as well. Divide by Sheep IS solidly organized, thought out, and skillfully crafted, yet it remains pleasing for those who are slightly less particular about puzzlers.  There is no game snobbery here. If you insist upon elitism in gaming or consider \"gamer\" as a status symbol, Divide by Sheep isn't for you, probably. This game is pure egalitarian entertainment with logic, fried sheep, half sheep, sheep souls, wolves, TNT, sticky platforms, pigs, YOU NAME IT.\n\nPS: As a professional educator, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the educational value of the game - whether for young math learners, older folks warding off the brain fog that comes with aging (I probably qualify for this category), or an ice breaker for ESL students (linguistic demand is low).

While at first glance it may seem like Yet Another Mobile Game, this is one that really shines on so many levels in so many areas.\n\nIts difficulty level is just right, its learning curve is just right, its pacing curve is just right. It's cute, but not overly so, with dark humour, that's not overly dark. Small artistic touches abound wherever you look. The music adds to the mood and never becomes irritating. The tune for the Dark World even made me stop playing for awhile just to properly enjoy it.\n\nFor me, it was 10 hours of gameplay over 10 or so sittings.

Just 'save' goals and duct tape (when you play you will see what i mean)\n\nit controls very well, being originally for ap stores, but works very nicely on here anyways. It also doesnt do any hand holding, just a easy stage for you to get how the new element to the puzzle system works then drops you right back into the brain teasers.

Divide by Sheep has one of the easiest concepts for a puzzle game but yet still manages to make your brain explode whilst still making you want to keep playing more and more. Although, I can definitely recommend buying this as it is really fun, it still has a few things which could be improved which I will explain in my Pros and Cons.  \n\nPros:\n\u2666 Great Gameplay that really makes you think without making you want to rage quit and never play again (There is the right balance here which makes it fun. It's one of those puzzles you just pick up and want to complete that no matter how frustrating it can be at times you never want to put it down until it's solved) \n\u2666 Decent number of Worlds and Levels (5 worlds, 30 levels a world, this is a good balanced number as it's not too few levels or too many. It doesn't leave you wanting more levels or make you feel like it's just dragging on and on becoming repetitive)\n\u2666 Awesome Cartoon Styled Graphics (This adds a nice edge to the style of the game)\n\u2666 Sound that just fits (Music and Sounds that can be listened to over and over again without sounding repetitive and annoying) \n\u2666 Decent Tutorials and Tutorial style (These are set of graphics/images before the level happens. They are well designed and detailed enough to understand what is going on which is awesome)\n\u2666 Not Repetitive (Each World looks graphically different from the last and incorporates aspects from the previous but adds something new. Also each level is scaled on from the last making each level a unique puzzle in its own. This makes the game fun and not repetitive)\n\u2666 Achievements are easy to get by just playing the game (Really easy to 100% if you can 100% all the puzzles)\n\u2666 Star incentive to keep trying a level until you 100% it (This is a nifty way to draw people into keep them playing a level until they 100% it and get all 3 stars for the level)\n\u2666 Awesome Graphical Story involving the Grim Reaper (For the minimal story in the game, it works)\n\u2666 Decent looking Steam Trading Cards, Emoticons and Backgrounds (Really well designed)\n\u2666 Controls just work (This is because the only thing you have to use is the mouse)\n\u2666 Worth the Price of $5 (At a $1 a world or $1 per 30 levels, you will definitely get your moneys worth)\n\nCons:\n\u2666 Don\u2019t have to rescue/kill all the sheep, pigs or wolves (I found this part a weird concept as it felt like I was completing a Jigsaw Puzzle for example without using all the pieces).\n\u2666 Ported from Mobile without 100% checking that everything is consistent for the PC version. (I say this as it says \"Rate this App\" in one of the tabs. This should say something like \"Review this Game\" and shows the Devs didn't bother checking it/changing it for pc)\n\u2666 Can't skip some cut scenes (Such as Intro Scene)\n\u2666 Some aspects seem randomly introduced such as Pigs (One second you\u2019re just playing with Sheep & Wolves and the next you know you have Pigs. I just felt they could have introduced them better in my opinion)  \n\u2666 Menu looks like Mobile still (This isn't a major issue as the game works fine, it would just be nice to have the menu looking more like a PC games to make it look more PC orientated then straight ported from Mobile)\n\u2666 No Graphics or Resolution options (This is annoying if you want to play in different size resolutions or change from FullScreen to Windowed Mode as this is the type of game that would suit Windowed Mode) \n\nSide Note:\n\u2666 Most people complain that this is a mobile port. In some aspects like the menus and options it is. However, if you can look past that fact, it is a really, really well made puzzle game that shouldn't fully be criticised on the fact that the Devs didn't fully change it for PC. With this said unlike some Mobile Ports, the Devs have made full use of the majority of Steam Features such as Achievements and Steam Trading Cards. Therefore, it's not just a straight Mobile Port in all aspects and the gameplay 100% works.\n\nOverall, even though there are a couple of cons, they are only minor things which could improve the game slightly. Therefore, as the game just works, has good graphics, a decent storyline, isn't repetitive and has a decent amount of levels, worlds and content that will keep you thinking and thinking...

There's no run and gun, there's no portals, there's no incentive to click as fast as you can, there's no minigames or leveling up. All there is, is a collection of levels with simple mechanics used in very clever ways, and a goal. That's right, it's just you and your brain. You can take as much time as you need, and retry at any time, but be prepared to do it a lot if you intend to complete every level perfectly. \n\nNever before has it been more difficult to simply kill one sheep, or feed a few dogs. In your quest to (sometimes literally) extract these cute animals, you will have to systematically divide, subtract, and add to the groups of critters. You have various tools at your disposal for doing so, including incineration, lazers that split individuals in half, drowning, replacing (and still drowning,) jump pads that split your group up and send them in specific directions, platforms that swap with each other, etc.\n\nSacrifice is the name of the game, here, and it's never been more cute or fun. Divide by Sheep starts off relatively easy, and with great pacing gradually introduces more features and difficulty, although sometimes a level or two might be easier or significantly harder than previous ones. All of the puzzles are completely solvable and require experimentaiton or calculation, but never abstraction; you will never have that moment where you have to look up a solution to a puzzle and then go \"How was I supposed to know that's what I was supposed to do?\" The design of the levels is brilliantly clever and you will find yourself feeling increasingly satisfied with figuring out how to beat them with a perfect score. Get ready, it's really addicting!\n\n[h1][b]Graphics[/b][/h1]\nThe graphics in Divide by Sheep are pretty simple, but very effective. It has a classic isometric style with modern design, with an almost vector art aesthetic. The menu transitions and navigation are smooth and simple, and I love how the UI stays almost completely out of the way, however, I will fault it slightly for clearly being intended for touch devices, and for having a rate this app page. There is also no option to change resolution. There is, however, a button to make the gameplay more child-friendly, which is really cool, and considerate of the developers, because this would be a great mental workout for any kid who can understand the mechanics.\n\nIf you've looked at the screenshots or trailers, then you know most of what you need to know about the game's graphics.\n\n[h1][b]Audio[/b][/h1]\nSo there's not a whole lot to say about the audio in Divide by Sheep, except that I like the music, and surprisingly at no point found myself getting tired of it or completely tuning it out. The sounds are pleasant enough, and there's good audible feedback for actions and navigation. There are also no problems with the quality of the sound itself. \n\n[h1][b]Conclusion[/b][/h1]\nDivide by Sheep is an exceptional puzzle game that will keep you busy for quite a while. It is challenging and engaging but never unfair. The content to price ratio is very good, and I am entirely comfortable recommending the game at full price...in fact, they could have charged more and I would still recommend it at full price. Seriously, treat yourself.\n\n[h1]======================================[/h1]\n\n[i]If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Original_Curators_Group#curation]Follow Original Curator Group[/url][/i]", "timestamp_created": 1443187832, "timestamp_updated": 1443188328, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.676633", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18179580": {"recommendationid": "18179580", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078231973", "num_games_owned": 6346, "num_reviews": 236, "playtime_forever": 248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472877434}, "language": "french", "review": "super bon jeux de puzzle  jai bien aimer", "timestamp_created": 1443143299, "timestamp_updated": 1443143299, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484081", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18178703": {"recommendationid": "18178703", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170641198", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 417, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443210045}, "language": "english", "review": "Divide by sheep....more like \"divide THE sheep\"!", "timestamp_created": 1443137229, "timestamp_updated": 1443137229, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500244", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18175283": {"recommendationid": "18175283", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023019827", "num_games_owned": 192, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 817, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443952728}, "language": "english", "review": "Overall: Good to Very good!\nDifficulty: Medium-low to Medium\n\nLikes:\n- Good variety of puzzle mechanics\n- Some levels are fairly challenging\n- Great music\n- Charming graphics\n- Pleasant, Relaxing\n\nDislikes:\n- Instead of having a good selection of well-designed puzzles, there are just a lot of levels, both good and okay.

But then I'm no fan of match-3 games either.\n\nThe one nice thing it does is that it lets you literally divide sheep in half (you can set the amount of gore from the main menu). Other than that, it's a straight-up puzzler that I think of as a \"labyrinth\" game: figure out the correct sequence of actions to reach your goal. Some levels have multiple ways to achieve that, but there's no reward for choosing one over the  other. I should also mention that the difficulty ramps up nice and even over the first 30 levels (of 150), and that new mechanics are introduced with little more than a picture hint and an opportunity for the player to research what they do in the next level (that's good).\n\nA small nigle [i](steam doesn't let me spell this word correctly)[/i] I hold against it is that the game seems to favor playing by trial and error: when I want to do it perfectly and figure out a master plan before starting to move the sheep around, the game slows me down by making me do each hop (and animation) separately instead of doing broad sweeps: I wish I could swipe a group of sheep over several hops at once, or maybe swipe a circle on a group of islands and have every group make a hop to the neighboring island. Instead it is hop-wait-hop-wait, and precisely because the game avoids such grander mechanics, it's casual. Oh, and if you didn't turn the music off after 10 minutes I admire your patience. [There's more information on the music in the comments.]\n\nI don't regret paying 0.99 for this game (it is 80% off), but I had hoped for something more memorable which it ultimately isn't.

Often times, I would ignore blatant low-effort ports published on Steam for just another cash cow to milk. However, Divide by Sheep did surprise me in terms of its intelligent puzzle design. It first starts out simple enough with you trying to rescue specific amount of sheep in a certain order. This can be accomplished by utilising the size of islands, splitting certain herds with jump pads and so on. Soon, Divide by Sheep becomes a mashup of devouring sheep, sacrificing wolves or sheep for their souls, all while trying to give whatever the upper left corner of the screen at the current time point demands. I was really pleasantly surprised by how well the game gradually introduces more and more mechanics, melds them into more demanding puzzles and keeps you engaged and challenged throughout your playtime. At the same time, Divide by Sheep never pressures you, as the cute art style and relaxing soundtrack trot along with your gears doing the calculations. Should you be amongst the vast amount of people who never enjoyed maths in school though, you might not particularly desire to add, divide and plan ahead in Divide by Sheep. I personally enjoyed my time a whole bunch, except for the missing undo a move button, which led to me redoing a bunch of levels, as I out of idiocy did the wrong move a tad too early or too late. So yes, an undo button would have been great.\n[h1][u]VERDICT[/u][/h1]All in all, Divide by Sheep will probably not lead to you falling asleep while counting.

Even more so for saying I was actually going to ENJOY it, of all things. That was yesterday. Today we have Divide by Sheep, a hilarious little puzzle game that is full of charm and some very challenging puzzles.\n\nNow I feel before we move any further, we should really note something. This title is extremely App friendly in design. If you are somebody who gets easily bugged by that type of thing, you are going to grind your teeth as you gain 3 stars and see a complete lack of options menu. With that aside, I love Divide by Sheep. The game is disguised beautifully, but its all about math and putting numbers in the proper order to get the outcome you want. Using sheep, pigs, wolves, lasers and more, you will send the adorable little animals on their voyage to the hands of Death.\n\nThat's right, Death is lonely and wants a friend, but I mean Death is adorable, who wouldn't want to be his friend?\n\nSmall plot aside, the aesthetics and charm of Divide by Sheep is what got me hooked. This is incredibly important aspect to the game, otherwise it's just a math puzzle game. The dark humor is what kept me smiling, even when I got frustrated. So much so as a matter of fact, that if you are not a fan of math, you may not enjoy this title as much. You must bounce sheep or an assortment of animals to a raft that requires a specific number. Sometimes it's easy and sometimes it can be incredibly complicated. The difficulty scales rapidly and there have been more than a few times that Divide by Sheep has made me scratch my head and made my eyes go cross. More elements are introduced to complicate matters, such as limited number platforms, wolves that eat sheep, laser grids that divide sheep hilariously in half, and bouncing platforms that send your helpless animals flying.\n\nThat isn't to say that Divide by Sheep is too hard to beat or play though. If you can match just one of the numbers you are allowed to progress to the next level. Getting stuck is never an issue, and the challenge is one you set on yourself. Go for three stars or just say screw it and come back to it later, just like a real math test. Divide by Sheep has a large assortment of levels all with the 3 star challenge. The aesthetic of the levels does change from grassy halls to frozen tundras but for the most part, level design is always the same. Some floating platforms, which is your puzzle, and a raft to put X number of animals on.\n\nOn occasion after beating a number of levels, you are rewarded with an adorable piece of art, that usually explains a new up coming element in some manner.\n\nIt really is hard to find a fault with Divide by Sheep, because it's a very simplistic game. That in itself may be an issue though, because sometimes lets face it, math sucks. Mind you, this is why I'm a writer instead of a Architect or something that actually pays. But I digress. The point is, if Divide by Sheep had a fault it would be that it's a one trick pony. It doesn't exactly claim to be anything else than what it is, so this isn't a fault to the game. You should be more than aware what you're getting into if you buy this game. Aside from that and the App like nature of Divide by Sheep, it's bug free and is very fun to play. The replay value comes from trying to get 3 stars on every level, which unless you're very clever, is going to be long and challenging.\n\nThe options menu for the most part is non-existent, however there are parental controls if you wanted to leave the messy parts of the game out, like sheep being cut in half and leaving bloody messes. This feature while not incredibly important, is rather nice to be included and makes this game also a great learning tool. The music and soundtrack of Divide by Sheep are absolutely adorable and jaunty, matching the games almost carefree tone. It never really got grating on my ears or did any painful repeats. The music changes from area to area of the game thankfully so there is always something new to listen to around the corner.\n\nI have played plenty of puzzle games but none that actually made math fun for me. I am not huge fan of Sudoku or other games of its nature. That in itself is an incredible compliment to the games level design. After being stuck on a level for a while and finally beating it, you get the \"aha!\" feeling that is quite addictive. Divide by Sheep may not be incredibly innovative but I haven't seen many games like it.\n\nThere are some areas that Divide by Sheep could've added a little bit more to make the game user friendly. There is no hint button or any hand holding whatsoever, so if you bang your head against the wall, you are heading to Youtube or a forum for help. While there is a quick start over button, a undo last move button would've been very nice for some of the more complicated puzzles that involved many steps. While these puzzles are rare they do happen, and having to start completely over again left me a little wanting. \n\nDivide by Sheep is available on Steam and mobile markets, the price is representative of that fact at $4.99. This makes it an absolutely steal if you love puzzle games, plus hey, Steam achievements are always fun. You can always nab this game for on the go at $2.99 on the iTunes store. This game makes a great traveling companion. So if you are in the market for an incredibly adorable puzzle game that is going to give you plenty of bang for your buck and more than likely make you scratch your head, I can't think of a better game than Divide by Sheep.", "timestamp_created": 1438247717, "timestamp_updated": 1438247736, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.591889", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17285881": {"recommendationid": "17285881", "author": {"steamid": "76561198190855035", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501999699}, "language": "english", "review": "Hi, i saw jacksepticeye play this game.

There are a tonne of different mechanics it seems as I'm only 20 levels in and already seen 6 different mechanics that add a lot of thought into the game such as little rat things that swallow your sheep. The game is laid out very mobile like but controls very well.\n\n*Gameplay*\n\nYou jump your sheep across islands that can only fit a certain amount of Sheep, if your sheep can't fit then they fall off to their death which may be nessesary. Like I said there are a tonne of mechanics that change the way you think and play.\n\n*Conclusion*\nThis game is very fun and easy to learn and I highly recommend picking up the game. I give it a 9/10 for being, fun, addictive and just awesome.\n\n*YouTube*\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knF0_gD8u3c", "timestamp_created": 1435854876, "timestamp_updated": 1435854876, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.604756", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16845809": {"recommendationid": "16845809", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987930658", "num_games_owned": 1686, "num_reviews": 85, "playtime_forever": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1435785501}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is cute a s hell but also has some pretty dark homour it is out-standing on the music front and the cartoony graphics only add to whats already a really great package.

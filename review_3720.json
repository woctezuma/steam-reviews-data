I still have the cd-rom package from '04, but the disc got destroyed :(\n\nYou get to pick an Austin Powers -esque persona and play as an evil genius and try to fulfill your doomsday mission. All of the character sprites or minions/henchmen are interesting to watch, with a unique art style, and there are plenty of fun interactions with base objects to look for. The gameplay consists of building a mountain dungeon, sending your henchmen to the board-game style overworld, and having they steal plans/art/machines to further your ambitions. Some of the art you steal is returned to your base for your henchmen to admire (for a loyalty bonus), and the nations of the world send their agents to retrieve them. Your notoriety increases as you steal more, and the agents become more gooder and tougher and more frequent. Eventually you steal all of the items necessary to complete your doomsday object, and you win!\n\nThere are some hurdles along the way:\n-You need to dispose of dead bodies.\n-Tourists come to the island to... tour. And then they freak out when they see dead bodies or guns.\n-You need to train your workers into different careers paths: soldiers, scientists, or social people. Scientists research new items for your base (traps or security features or rec room items), social minions are better suited for non lethal diversion of enemies. Soldiers more effetively arm themselves.\n-Super-agents are sent to kill your evil genius, and they each have a unique scenario to defeat them. They will judo-chop your minions all day long if you try to get rid of them like other enemies.\n\nI am very excited for the sequel announced this year. Sierra games was a good publisher.\n\n\nLikes:\n-Base building. There is a ton of freedom to build however you like. Of course, the game doesn't really provide you with much help either. The starting build area is small, but your options improve in the future. I like using the console to enable debug mode to allow more creative building. Do this at your own risk, you can bork your save.\n\n-Traps. They're buggy, but it's fun to set up a room to release bees on unsuspecting investigators. You have to tie a trap with a sensor, and the sensors occupy space, which can limit some designs. Sadly, some agents are too smart and they either won't fall for tripping the trap sensor, or they start attacking and causing the traps to explode. Whomp-whomp.\n\n-Soundtrack. Omg. Just run the OST on Youtube when you're bored at work.\n\n-Modding. The games files are a library of notepad-editable xmls. You can tweak the properties of anything or even define new base items to build. You can go further and add textures to create your own characters. \n\n\nUnlikes:\n-Controls. Your base consists of you (the evil genius, 1 life), your elite henchmen (limited #, 3 lives), and your minions (unlimited # to hire, 1 life). The minions are assigned to tasks in the background and you cannot re-order a minion to a building task (I.e. if they're right next to a box that need to be moved). Your henchmen can be told to move anywhere and kill anyone and they will, but they don't build. And your evil genius can be told to move anywhere; but, he can't attack, can't build, and his only plus if he produces a passive AoE bonus to your minions (loyalty +, perception +).\n \n-Tutorials. Yeah, they suck. The interface for the help videos is also trashy. There's not much in the game that's difficult conceptually, but there are some issues with building that may not be intuitive. I.e. you cannot destroy a room that is the only access path to a deeper room.\n\n-Money. The method for generating cash is by sending henchmen to the world map, in an overworld boardgame-styled menu. Here, any henchmen set to \"steal\" will produce X amount of dollars per minute. The game with place enemy agents in the region, and there are behind-the-scene dice rolls to kill your henchmen. I don't have much for suggestions in replacing this; but I've always found the # of henchmen required to be on the overworld stealing money at the rate I want to spend it was absurd. There are cheat codes to add $.\n\n-Population cap. I'm not a fan of these, and they're easily editable with the .ini config file, but your pop cap is 100 henchmen. I usually set this to 500. If you need to send 40 of them to the overworld to generate money, it limits your base functionality. There is a slider in your base menu that controls the rate at which you hire new lv 1 henchmen, which can be changed from 1 / min to 1 / sec (w/ a hefty cash penalty).", "timestamp_created": 1514996767, "timestamp_updated": 1514996767, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39005272": {"recommendationid": "39005272", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131764748", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 78, "playtime_forever": 203, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514973662}, "language": "english", "review": "good old game", "timestamp_created": 1514973248, "timestamp_updated": 1514973248, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38984043": {"recommendationid": "38984043", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063083279", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3556, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504716061}, "language": "english", "review": "uninstalled the game, reinstall it lose all my save files. around 40+ hours\n\nit's a shame because it's a great game", "timestamp_created": 1514919222, "timestamp_updated": 1514919222, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38951809": {"recommendationid": "38951809", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966752859", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 698, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514862797}, "language": "english", "review": "You cannot go wrong with this for the 2.49 price tag.

snazzy, theme-appropriate graphics to style to soundtrack, this game is a masterpiece that should be enjoyed & known by many, yet the gameplay flaws, cumbersome UI, lots of bugs and quirky AI of your minions (coupled with VERY high difficulty and frustrating jugling between your base and world domination screen) lower the appeal of what would've been (with a fair bit of polish) a game with a reputation higher than the fabled Dungeon Keeper!\n\nStill, I would wholeheartedly recommend Evil Genius to all you aspiring evildoers, because this is currently THE ONLY game that puts you properly into the shoes of a megalomaniac from JB movies, with lots of humour be it written or perceived (the animations are really well done and funny!), PHENOMENAL soundtrack, and full to the brim with 60's spy movies style.

Here you take the mantle of a Evil \u201cjames bond type\u201d Genius. And you must built your lair, with traps against special agents, and influence world events by placing spies and much much more!\n\n[h1] Pros: [/h1]\n\n+ You must build your own lair on an Island! Complete with lasers and dumb minions!\n+ Survive the constant attacks from the world greatest super agents! And capture them!\n+ Plan your lair carefully, provide sufficient energy, give things for your minions to do, train those same dumb minions and make real henchmen out of them. \n+ Manage everything from energy to motivation! But above all else, keep your Evil Genius alive!\n+ Nostalgia (at least for me)\n+ Conquer the world, and gather new unit types. And thru Acts of Infamy raise your notoriety in the world, but beware, you\u2019ll attract attentions from the all the \u201cgood guy\u201d agencies!\n+ Extremely funny animations and pure comedy effects. \n\n  [h1] Cons: [/h1]\n\n- Absolutely none, despite being an oldie game, be aware that the graphics are up to date!\n\n[h1] Final Review [/h1]\n\nI had to have this game in my library and its one title I display with pride. One of my favorite games in the strategy/management genre. I took the mantle of an Evil Genius and I wore it well for many hours, as I captured agents and forced them to tell me what they were hiding. And created a neat lair riddled with incredible traps that would make 007 run in the opposite direction. I have to give this game a perfect 10 in my book, and I wish there would be an Evil Genius 2. It would be glorious!\n\nEnjoy Guys and Girls, and if this review helped you in any way please leave me a Thumbs up, i would appreciate it immensely.

There USED to be a place for various mods, called Evil Planet, but it has shut down, so try your luck at Reddit, while THOSE links last.\nThere are also talks about versions 1.02 and 1.03, but they're apparently Italian language packs and really horribly edited UI textures.\n\nFor design flaws, I bet you want to save your game, apart from the autosave.\nWell, it turns out that, while you can access the Load menu simply by pressing Escape, the SAVE menu is hidden away under the shortcut Ctrl+L (or F5 for a quick save). ...but later on the Save menu magically turned up for me, under the Load menu, so I'm still scratching my head about that one, considering I'm not the only one having trouble finding it.\n\nYou also have a minion limit cap that's ridiculously small, minions that refuse to deploy for missions, minions getting stuck in cages, agents firing at various furniture they don't like, et cetera. It's a mess.\n\nThe pace is also DREADFULLY slow, even with the soothing music playing nonstop. It's a constant wait for your minions to eat, train, sleep, fetch, and so on.\n\nAlso, the game explains at the start, that there are two bars: Red is heat, which is bad, while green is notoriety, which is good. ...only that's bad as well. If you do evil deeds on the world map, that doesn't involve looting loot, then you'll start unlocking SUPER agents, which will only make the game harder. ...so you get nothing from doing evil deeds in this game.\n\n...but it's the progress stopping bugs, that really kills this game. All the characters in this game, can get randomly stuck in their AI programming. It happens randomly, seemingly mostly at the hotel (so avoid building that), and if any one of them get stuck, out of the hundreds on the map, then you will have a stuck transport. ...and if you get two stuck transports, then you can't deploy for missions anymore.\n...and so you have to find which one is stuck (which is a \"Where Is Waldo?\" game of its own) then open up your save game file in a text editor, and try to figure out the coding, so that you can safely delete the bugged parts, without it crashing the game.\n\n...and if your save isn't completely bug free at the halfway point through the game, at a certain key point, then your game will crash, and if you can't debug this game's code then, then you have to begin a new game, and just hope and pray that the game won't bug out THIS time.\n(Luckily I was handed a bugfree save from another player at the forums.)\n\nDoes this sound fun to you? :(\n\nIn short, this otherwise lovely game, needed A LOT more polish and support.\n\nStill, I hear there is an Evil Genius 2 game in the works, and I'm really looking forward to it.\n...but it better be more bugtested than this game.\nMaybe you should hold on to your money until either Evil Genius 2 is released, OR they release a proper bug patch.", "timestamp_created": 1518676291, "timestamp_updated": 1519911249, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.703418", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39960062": {"recommendationid": "39960062", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088577558", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 12738, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 516, "last_played": 1521403296}, "language": "portuguese", "review": "Evil Genius, um jogo de estrategica e poder para poder desfrutar.

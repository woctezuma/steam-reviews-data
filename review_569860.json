Is it good? Yes! Does it reach greatness? No... Is it \"open world\"? Nope!\nI sorta fell for the open world gimmick. That's the dream, an open world adventure game. Any game that advertises that I HAVE TO SEE IT. Hopefully i'm part of a very niche market so I never waste too much money, Sadly there should be more adventure games, so I'm not complaining. And this is a GOOD adventure game. As good as in the golden years of LucasArts, so it's worth it, a good old romp in a time capsule, without bikes or mad scientists.\nThe game, without a doubt, misses both. Unless you're an older gamer and understands the refernces, you'll be missing out half the experience. If you're a f nerd, you'll be all right. \nIt's adventure game for an old generation by the old generation. If you've never played Full Throttle or Day of the Tentacle, get those first. They're harder, but theyll make this game a whole lot easier and less cryptic. \nGraphics? Good. Not great, everything makes sense, but it shows that the open world thing didn't work out: the characters look great, but the backgrounds, though detailed, are just too flat and uninteresting. This 2D aspect should have made it easier to just link stuff together, but this game, as it stands, is not a sandbox, there's nothing to do besides solving puzzles. I suppose that the LucasArts adventure directive, that you can never die, just doesn't go well together with sandboxes. \nThat's not to say that the art direction isn't good, it's fantastic. Given this game's self imposed limitations, some parts look awesome: the parts with depht. Some settings are presented in perspective, and they really stand out. Also, some of the details are beautifully designed and well thought out. If the whole game was like that, it would've been great.\nThe sound design is amazing, though. Fantastic voice acting for wonderfull characters. Incredible music: nice, moody and jazzy, sometimes whimsical, which adds to the game's atmosphere. Sound effects are just right as they should be.\nThe very soul of this game lies in its sense of humor, and the fact that it doesn't takes itself too seriously, though it takes it too far by the end. No spilers here, just saying that it should've had a more satisfying ending. It's not bad, it's just... not great.\nAnd that's the sad conclusion, this game could've been great, it almost touched greatness, yet it's just good. There's just something missing... maybe a bike or a mad scientist. Though it features a scientist, he's just not mad enough. This game went too far, but not far enough. That's the overall feeling about it, it's not great, it's not mediocre, it's just... good. Too well behaved. Too wholesome. Old adventure games had this dark sense of humor, this one just feared taking things too far.", "timestamp_created": 1515571361, "timestamp_updated": 1515571361, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39194300": {"recommendationid": "39194300", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014263869", "num_games_owned": 453, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 854, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 334, "last_played": 1515379374}, "language": "english", "review": "As an older gamer who grew up playing Maniac Mansion on a friends C64 and Monkey Island, this game was great.

Unfortunately, there are only two of those moments, and they are not enough to change the rest of the game.\n\n3) Good facial animation, lyp sync, lighting, and wonderful art. (We don't count Garry Winnick's shitty art that can't blend in with the good art made by the real artists). Anyway, if you see something badly drawn (inventory items, secondary characters, the world map) that has jarring colours, boring shapes, lack of volume and material definition, you know it's drawn by Winnick. Still, his stuff is under the sanitary minimum so the real art done by Mark Ferrarri and Octavi Navarro remains good overall. \n\n\nCONS\n\n1) None of the freedom, consequences and living NPCs that Maniac Mansion and Zak McKracken had. \n\n2) Bad writing that heavily relies on parody and \"jokes\" as an excuse for how weak the dialogue is. (Shows you how weak Ron Gilbert's writing and storytelling is by modern standards).\n\n3) Mediocre, but difficult puzzles (in the second half of the game). Solving them doesn't feel satisfying (I'm saying this as someone who solved every single one fairly). They're just not interesting or meaningful even though they are better designed than the ones in Broken Age.\n\n4) Nihilistic, disappointing, meaningless and shallow story. I've seen other stories deal with the same subject and they are much stronger both morally and philosophically. Here... it's cringeworthy.\nCan be considered a spoiler, but you should better read it. All this work to make a gameworld and characters that inhabit it... and then tell the player - [SPOILER] actually, this isn't real, this is just a videogame, it's all fake, you have wasted your time. You invested in this world emotionally, but it's all worthless. \nOh, and by the way, because these characters aren't as real as you, and because their existence is limited within the game constraints, it's better for all of them to just die and for their fake world to burn. This is how the murderer in the story also justifies his murders, but then this same nihilistic motivation is used by the main protagonist. And then you're told - oh, wait, even that's not possible, you can't really destroy the gameworld and that's sad. That's the level of philosophical and ethical maturity the author has. Disgusting. [/SPOILER]\nLast, but not least, this is a total violation of the contract between player and creator. You trust that the creator won't suddenly say \"Oh, I'm tired of all this, you know what, fuck it\" and throw his story in the trash. I can't understand what thought process made Gilbert and the others to believe even for a moment that such a choice is going to be okay.\n\nAnyway. I'm finally done. I don't think I'll support another Ron Gilbert game ever again. I'd support something else by David Fox, though, but sadly, I don't think he'd make another \"Zak McKracken\" (that is, another living and breathing adventure that doesn't follow the bad convention established by Gilbert in Monkey Island - convention, followed by everyone else until the genre got completely stuck in the mud with the static, boring, unresponsive characters and unconvincing worlds that this type of design generated).\n\nI will play some more modern and old adventure games though, to remove the bad taste.", "timestamp_created": 1515200896, "timestamp_updated": 1515872924, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525692", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39102342": {"recommendationid": "39102342", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997528003", "num_games_owned": 317, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2005, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 82, "last_played": 1515379663}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game especially if you've played any old Lucasfilm point and click adventures.

It feels as if years of developing point-and-click adventure games has culminated in a truly polished product. However, the ending was godawful. It's as if every single popular game since Drawn to Life has pulled a cop-out fourth-wall breaker. One Shot, Undertale, and similar games all have the presumption to try and become a personal investment on the players' part, yet there's no justifiable reciprocation for this, since the game developer doesn't actually know you. They haven't built a personal relationship with you. They're merely infringing on your personal space with this creepy metaphorical feel-copping. Harry Potter readers will probably remember a line the deceased Dumbledore gives toward the end of the series, something along the paraphrased lines of \"Just because it's in your head doesn't mean it's not real.\" Solipsism. It's actually not quite so bad with Thimbleweed Park, but it is a trend that tired rapidly and feeds on the sad cult of celebrity people still shamelessly buy into. It's a fun game to play, it's just that the pay off is as worthless as watching through Lost. Rebuttals will likely quote that it's about the journey, but as I've just stated, the journey through the game is enjoyable. It's just, you really end up only spinning your wheels the whole time. \n\nThe call-ins and books from the Kickstarter backers were pretty sad, although a much-needed break from sitting through eleven-hour credits sequences crediting every sap who paid a dollar before any work was put into a product.

It lends itself to strict criticism on account of the disclaimer provided in-game that the providers are responsible for their own content. \n\nFun game.

Aber langsam, aber sicher brach schon damals f\u00fcr mich eine neue Zeit auf - die \u00c4ra der Adventures mit kompaktem Aktionsmen\u00fc, das quasi nur noch \"Gucken\", \"Nehmen\" und \"Verwenden\" sowie \"automatisch in Ansprechen\" umgewandelte Aktionen - quasi kontextsensitiv - anbot. Monkey Island 3 war so ein Kandidat... und seither sind direkt verwendbare \"Verben\" wie \"Gehe zu\", \"Schaue an\" und \"Nimm\" Museumsschaukunst, die mir so schon lange nicht mehr vor die F\u00fc\u00dfe kam - bis Thimbleweed Park erschienen ist.\n\nAufgrunddessen wurde vermutlich der gro\u00dfe Nostalgiefaktor bei vielen Kickstarter-Backern perfekt angetriggert, die (erwartungsgem\u00e4\u00df) diese Pionierjahre als \"goldene Zeit\" archiviert haben. Aber kennt ihr das, wenn ihr das einstige \"makellose goldene Werk\" noch einmal viele Jahrzehnte sp\u00e4ter anzockt - und all die Erinnerungen an der eiskalten Wand der Realit\u00e4t zerschellen? Wenn ihr merkt, dass ihr all die Fehler und Nervigkeiten verdr\u00e4ngt habt, die ihr schon damals kacke fandet? Oder all die Verbesserungen dieses Spielegenres bis heute als selbstverst\u00e4ndlich hingenommen habt und ihr sie gar nicht mehr in Relation mit den damaligen Unzul\u00e4nglichkeiten seht? Oder euch bewusst macht, dass ihr euch selbst ans \"Heute\" angepasst habt und es nun mal gewohnt seid, dass heute \"Komfort\" mehr auf der Tagesordnung steht?\nIch f\u00fcr meinen Teil bin mir sicher, dass \"Thimbleweed Park\" bei vielen sehr viel besser abschneidet als es heute noch \"state of the art\" ist. Klar will es das auch nicht, aber das wischt ja die Fehlerchen nicht rein. ;)\n\nWarum es trotzdem ein gro\u00dfartiges Spiel ist und was mich so st\u00f6rt, folgt jetzt: Erst einmal haben wir die grandiose Pixel-Grafik, die nat\u00fcrlich nicht so farbarm und platt wie damals bei MM oder ZmK aussieht, aber schon sehr reduziert daher kommt, aber genau dadurch seinen Charme hat. Die Geschichte f\u00e4ngt solide an, l\u00e4sst uns sehr behutsam in das kleine Dorf und die Geschichte reinfliegen, gibt uns noch nicht die ganze Stadt zum Erkunden frei und stellt auch noch nicht die ganze Palette an abwechselnd steuerbaren Charakteren zur Verf\u00fcgung - denn ja: Es gibt sp\u00e4ter eine Map mit Schnellreisefunktion zu allen m\u00f6glichen Orten - die Karte ist also nicht ganz klein und ja, ihr steuert insgesamt 5 Charaktere gleichzeitig - alle mit ihren individuellen Dialogoptionen, R\u00e4tseln, Eigenschaften usw. - und meistens k\u00f6nnen sie genauso \u00fcberall hin wie jeder andere, sich Items austauschen usw. Es kommt also nicht nur das Thema \"9 verschiedene Verben\" auf euch zu - sondern auch noch eine gro\u00dfe Spielwelt, viele redundante Laufwege sowie viele M\u00f6glichkeiten mit den entsprechenden Figuren des R\u00e4tsels L\u00f6sung auf die Schliche zu kommen. Das ist nicht ganz unkomplex.\nGut gelungen ist aber, dass die 9 Verben alle via Shortcut nutzbar sind, sodass man auch mal Brute Force testen kann. Aber nicht immer ist klar, was gerade zu tun ist - und mit der M\u00f6glichkeit auch noch ein gigantisches Telefonbuch zu integrieren, wo man ingame auch diverse Nummern zur R\u00e4tsels L\u00f6sung anrufen muss, macht es nicht immer sofort klar wie es weiter geht.\n\nDie Story schien mir zwei-aufgeteilt zu sein - aber in sich mit ihren liebevollen Charakteren, witzigen Dialogen und vor allen Dingen gesellschaftlichen sowie Retro-Seitenhieben - nat\u00fcrlich auch in sich selbst (Referenz zu Entwicklerlegende Ron Gilbert, Maniac Mansion, Artstyle, Retrospiele, Nerdkram usw.) wundervoll unterhaltsam.

The humor is still there, but probably not as witty as the sword fights from Monkey.  What is easier, is that the game provides an in-game help line(for free--no paying for a guide book like the old days) that has multiple levels so if you need a bit of a hint, it will provide it without having to be spoiled with a thorough walkthrough.

I truly hope that they will continue to make great games like this. All of us adventure game dorks need a Mansion Mansion series! The difficulty option was awesome, wish I had that when I was a kid. Love how they have a hintline number to call in game, these kids nowadays with their internet guides, they don't know what it's like to charge mom $2.99 a min to get past a puzzle, ha! \n\nAll the reference's are fantastic! \"here's some gum for your collection\" ha!

Two out of town federal detectives team up with the PD of a secluded town up north to find a murderer. You venture through the town, discovering its backstory and the story of it's residences.\n\n[b][i]Overall[/i][/b], Do you like Twin Peaks?\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nIt follows a traditional point and click format with action keys and items at the bottom which are then used to interact with the world. The intergration of hotkeys for actions, items, swapping between players, makes the game much more fluent that if it weren't there at all. The gameplay feels fresh even considering the fact that it uses a very old, out-dated style of gameplay. Given that, the vast majority of the game is walking and talking. If you're familiar with Point and Click games, this should be no surprise at all.\n\n[b][i]Overall[/i][/b], very fluent gameplay for using a very outdated style of Point & Click!\n\n[h1]Sound, Voice, & Music[/h1]\n\nThe audio is done very cheaply. None of the sfx or dialogue is processed to accomodate for the settings. So hearing someone speak so clearly under a bridge or in a hectic inventor's laboratory or in a extremely large, crowded circus tent full of music and sounds and people. It just sounds really cheap and not thuroughly put together. There were very rare times where it seemed as though sfx were missing or had sequencing issues. There would also be points where pieces of dialogue only came out of one channel and then would came back out through all channels.\n\nThe voice acting isn't very good. A good handful of the voice acting is monotone and unconvincing. At its hightest moments, its merely passable. Nothing is done here with the intent of surpassing expectations. There were a few moments where I thought, \"You couldn't do another take?\" Was there really no one in the studio that thought, \"Can we record that one more time?\"\n\nThe music... Do you like Twin Peaks? \n\n[b][i]Overall[/i][/b], Sound was inconsistent and lacked continuity. Voice acting was bland.\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\n\nThe visuals is probably the best part of this game for me. Altough it is pixel art, this style of pixel art is incredibly clean and detailed. Information is presented very clearly and details in the enviroment and characters add a very respectful amount of imersion. There is tons of diversity within the settings, the objects necessary for interaction are contrasted perfectly with the background.\n\n[b][i]Overall[/i][/b], This is abolutely the best presentation of pixel art I have seen within a game!\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\n[b]Twin Peaks The Adventure Game.[/b] If that sounds funs to you, scroll up and add to cart. But for real, I enjoyed this game a lot! Even with all the grips, I cannot deny that I had a smile on my face while I was playing this.

However, sometimes too many open threads made me feel uncertain what to do next. It's all good, albeit slightly protracted. In the later stages I found myself calling the hint line to speed things up a bit.\n\nThe interface could have been streamlined and updated.

I get that this is Ron Gilbert, SCUMM, and in the LucasArts camp (which had a rivalry with team Sierra back in the day) but it's kind of obnoxious. It doesn't seem light-hearted either, it seems pointed and mean. Especially after so much time has passed, and doubly so that nobody from Sierra is still involved to carry on the rivalry; it comes across as petty and ungrateful to the people who built the genre that allowed games like this to exist.\n\nIf hard mode takes you 10 hours, by the end literally about an hour will have been spent waiting for elevators, and another hour in back-tracking. \"Hard mode\" for some reason only gives you 1 quick travel map between 4 characters, meaning you either end up passing the baton a lot or backtracking a LOT. This doesn't make anything harder, it simply wastes the hours of your life, and was a poor choice of difficulty mechanic.\n\nAchievement hunting in this one is another totally un-challenging time-waster. Full achievement completion requires going through the game twice (even if you beat hard first), and also poring through kickstarter contributor content. Not fun, not challenging, not interesting. \n\nYou can skip these complaints by playing casual mode, skipping achievements, and keeping \"in-jokes\" turned off, but then it's a little light on content for the price tag ($20).

graficas de finales de los 80 y principios de los 90 creadas por lucas film games, posteriormente lucas arts, y por ello es una cita inexcusable para todos los que disfrutamos con juegos como los maniac mansion o los monkey island de los que bebe directamente. No es una obra maestra pero es una gran aventura con puzzles y di\u00e1logos a la altura de sus predecesores.\n\nMe han encantado la historia, la ambientaci\u00f3n y los personajes ya que recupera todo de aquella atm\u00f3sfera tan loca, tan extra\u00f1a, tan inmersiva, tan... no se como explicarlo pero os aseguro que en algunos momentos me he sentido viajando atr\u00e1s en el tiempo, jugando con mi 4,86 cl\u00f3nico y derriti\u00e9ndoseme el cerebro con algun puzzle absurdo mientras una dulce melod\u00eda sint\u00e9tica no dejaba de sonar una y otra vez.\n\nNo todo van a ser flores y creo que alg\u00fan detalle se deber\u00eda haber cuidado un poco m\u00e1s como la estructura narrativa, considero que la fragmentaci\u00f3n de la aventura en cap\u00edtulos no era la mejor forma para avanzar en el juego, y por otra parte creo que la interacci\u00f3n de los personajes no est\u00e1 bien desarrollada, provocando alguna confusi\u00f3n o mostrando falta de coherencia en algunos momentos. En cualquier caso son detalles que no empa\u00f1an un resultado muy satisfactorio para la experiencia del jugador que en ning\u00fan momento se va a ver arrinconado en un callej\u00f3n sin salida ni a tropezarse con un bug como los de la \u00e9poca.\n\nEn resumen, una aventura gr\u00e1fica larga y divertida, dif\u00edcil (ni se os ocurra jugar el modo casual, por favor...) pero justa, y sobre todo entra\u00f1able.\n\nOs la recomiendo.\n\n\nSaludos,\n\n[b] [i] Eoghan[/i][/b]", "timestamp_created": 1505407908, "timestamp_updated": 1505407908, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.615385", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34947115": {"recommendationid": "34947115", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045901831", "num_games_owned": 476, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1052, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508268579}, "language": "german", "review": "Vielleicht wegen meines fortgeschrittenen Alters kommen hier nostalgische Gef\u00fchle hoch.

It's a classic point and click game with a good dose of humor, likable (though perhaps a bit cliche) characters and challenging puzzles.\n\nYou will likely be stuck on a puzzle or two, at least in the \"hard\" mode, but they don't feel too absurd or \"guess the arbitrary reasoning\"-like. Most puzzles seem to be fairly reasonable and logical, sometimes it's \"why haven't I think of that before\" thing. All I can complain about is that the puzzles are sometimes exposed to the player too early, so you waste some time trying to solve them without the required items and then forget about them later, when it's time to solve them. On the other hand, it doesn't feel like it's the design's fault and there's also an in-game hint hotline, which is pretty well designed. It doesn't spoil everything right away, but tends to give you vague hints first.\n\nThe art itself is solid, but the way it's displayed in the engine bothers me. Uneven pixels in pixel art games are my pet peeve and this game has plenty. It simply doesn't care if, for example, it displays the character in half of the background pixel or scales it so the background pixels are bigger than the character's. I don't get why modern pixel art games don't care about being self-consistent pixel-size-wise, all it takes from the technical point of view is a simple render target that's smaller than the screen.\n\nOverall, I had fun playing the game, but the ending felt lazy and WTF-ish. [spoiler]I really wanted to solve the murder's case, but the game's universe just \"blew up\" instead. Possibly innocent Willy was jailed 'til the very end (it seems to be optional to free him) and everyone started to care about their personal goals. When you solved the character's goal, the character stopped being playable, possibly just ceased to exist (?).

Maybe even the time gap between 2 games of a series.\n\nBut..this end here is weird in a kinda disappointing way because it does exactly that. \nI do love self referencing humor and when characters in games say \"oh hey, we live in a video game\" but they still live further than what they did in this game.\n\nAnd probably one of the most disappointing things is that you think \"oh, this guy seems suspicious / Oh i wonder what happens to the murder case\" and some other things. But you don't know unfortunately because of how the game ends.\n\nIt's a shame they might not make a sequel to fix it a bit.

Den Meister d\u00fcrfte ich vor 2 Jahren sogar h\u00f6chstpers\u00f6nlich auf der Adventure-Treff-Party in K\u00f6ln, anl\u00e4sslich der Gamescom, kennenlernen. Ein brillianter Point-And-Click-Adventure-Entwickler mit besonderem Humor und absolut freundlicher, zur\u00fcckhaltender Mensch, der gerne \u00fcber seine Ideen und Konzepte diskutiert. Unheimlich inspirierend f\u00fcr junge Entwickler und sehr hilfsbereit. \n\nAuch Thimbleweed Park\u2122 tritt in die Fu\u00dfstapfen seiner gro\u00dfartigen Vorg\u00e4nger. Die Pixelgrafik wirkt so unverbraucht und gleichzeitig so altbekannt, heimisch, dass man sofort in die Zeit eines Maniac Mansion und Zak McKracken zur\u00fcckgeholt wird. Die Charaktere sind fantastisch: zynisch und naiv, launisch und selbstbewusst, witzig und auf den Punkt - einfach sehr lebendig und in der Gesamtwelt stimmig.\n\nDie Geschichte baut wie in den Vorg\u00e4ngern klar und unkompliziert eine Spannung auf und man legt gleich los mit der Point-und-Klick-Orgie. Hoffentlich findet man alle versteckten Punkte, denn man will auf gar keinen Fall irgendeinen Gag verpassen in der Geschichte, die in kleinen Nebenepisoden (Flashbacks) die Hintergr\u00fcnde erkl\u00e4rt. Eine ausgesprochen neugierig machende und selten genutzte Erz\u00e4hlweise in Abenteuern. Das erzeugt im Spiel eine sehr abwechslungsreiche und spannende Handlung, die den Spieler in \u00e4u\u00dferst unterschiedliche Charaktere schl\u00fcpfen l\u00e4sst - gro\u00dfartig!\n\nWarum gebe ich dem Spiel nach dieser Einleitung und nach so kurzer Spielzeit eigentlich einen Daumen runter?\n\nGanz einfach:\n\nDie Lokalisierung zur deutschen Sprache im Interface und in den Untertiteln - eigentlich komplett - hat mich in den Wahnsinn getrieben! Grauenhafte, von Fehlern strotzende \u00dcbersetzung! Die nimmt den Vibe und Glanz, den das Spiel aus alten Zeiten verspr\u00fchen wollte v\u00f6llig weg! Ich glaube der \u00dcbersetzer hat keines dieser Games aus damaligen Zeiten gespielt! Der Witz geht v\u00f6llig verloren und w\u00e4re die englische Sprachausgabe nicht dabei, h\u00e4tte ich nach 5 Minuten schon ausgeschaltet. Echt schade - total vermurkst dadurch! Sieht man leider immer \u00f6fter, dass Spiele grottig und schlampig und meistens 1:1 \u00fcbersetzt werden und damit der Wortwitz und Sinn verloren geht. Das macht echt w\u00fctend und daf\u00fcr muss es einen Daumen runter geben, weil wir ja hier das Spiel auch auf Deutsch genie\u00dfen wollen! \n\nJedem, dem es genauso ergeht wie mir, der kann sich an dieser Diskussion beteiligen:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/569860/discussions/0/1290690926868614723/\n\nRate ich von dem Spiel grunds\u00e4tzlich ab?\n\nAuf gar keinen Fall!

It does have some deep nostalgia (one of the characters runs a Commodore 64) as well as a number of 80s pop-culture references. There is plenty for geeks to love, including a classic Con with sexy Riker. The storyline, particularly between Dolores and her father Franklin, is complex and actually quite moving. It was really interesting to see the way these five character's lives came together and how they had to collaborate to achieve individual ends. With only a handful of exceptions, the solutions to the puzzles made a lot of sense (I was particularly proud of figuring out the county map puzzle all on my own.) \n\nEven though I'm new to these kinds of games, I played on Hard mode and made it through okay, in about 22 hours of play time. I did use the HintTron3000 maybe seven times, and in every case I was extremely close to having figured it out on my own. A lot of my errors were stupid ones that were probably more a result of not having played this style of game before. I like that the Hint machine starts out very vague, then slowly gets more specific, so it's not like it just hands you the answer straightaway.\n\nI had so much fun playing this game, but I have to admit, the ending was a letdown. It was clever, unexpected, and a great homage to game development in general, but it was emotionally unsatisfying. After growing attached to the characters and wanting to help them, it felt like an unfair twist. The C64 terminal scene at the very end of the end credits, while also amazingly clever, makes the sense of disillusionment even worse.

The result of this being that some puzzles and story elements just feel really \"light\" and not fully developed to their full potential.

I\u2019ve always have had a problem with Ron Gilbert games.  I feel he tends to go overboard with jokes.  That being said I do love Monkey Island 1 and Maniac Mansion.  However, I always despised the ending of Monkey Island 2.  I loved Monkey Island 1 so much.  I adored the cast of characters and the insane quirky pirate adventure they were on.  I immediately picked up Monkey Island 2 and loved everything about that\u2026until I got to the ending which I found to be horrendous.  Ron Gilbert set up such a great tale and was literally everything I wanted in a Monkey Island sequel\u2026but that ending, my god.  I\u2019m not even sure how it\u2019s possible to blow an ending so bad.  I hated everything about it.\n\nThat is until now.  The ending of Thimbleweed Park literally somehow manages to be worse than Monkey Island 2, it\u2019s just garbage and because of that I can\u2019t recommend it and would go so far as to say it\u2019s pointless to ever play a Ron Gilbert game ever again at least for me.  Which is a real shame, because until that ending I would say Thimbleweed Park is one of the best modern day adventure games.  \n\nThe presentation is gorgeous.  The artwork and individual screens just look stunning.  The puzzles are almost border on that line of impossible and just right.  The biggest stumbling blocks can be figuring out where you are even supposed to go as opposed to figuring out the actual puzzles.  The fact you need to switch between multiple characters does complicate things, but it all works out very well.  The only puzzle that really just completely confused me was the trampoline puzzle, I just could not figure it out.  After looking up the answer I felt real stupid.  Which is basically how you want to feel when playing an adventure game.  What you don\u2019t want is too look up the answer and say, \u201cthat is the dumbest solution I ever heard of in my life, the person who made this game is dumb and should never be allowed to ever make a videogame again.\u201d  No puzzle in this game ever made me feel that way, so this game was by far exceeding all my expectations.  \n\nI also felt the game was funny, genuinely funny\u2026well for the most part anyway.  I don\u2019t know what they were thinking with the character of Ransome the clown.  I didn\u2019t find it funny at all, all of his scenes were quite arduous to get through.  Maybe someone likes him, but I didn\u2019t find it funny at all and despised his entire character.  I do wish the 2 FBI agents got to interact more together, because I enjoyed their banter immensely.  I also did enjoy all the voice acting a lot.  Everyone just did a stellar job.\n\nWith all that being said I got to now start dumping on the game, because the story is what caused me to not recommend the game.  The start is exactly what I want.  It sets up a wonderfully quirky murder mystery with a strong Twin Peaks/Xfiles vibe.  The game starts with 2 FBI agents coming to the small town of Thimbleweed to investigate a murder and then they start digging into the towns dirty laundry.  In my opinion the best adventure games are either straight up murder mysteries or some other type of mystery so I was super on board with this games story. During the game you meet a cast of bizarre/quirky characters that join your party and you can switch back and forth between them.  I guess the rest is spoilers:\n\n[spoiler] So you go through the whole game trying to solve the murder of 3 people really.  The Town\u2019s billionaire, the billionaires brother, and a mysterious traveler.  Weird things keep happening with a very David Lynch vibe.  People are constantly watching you from the TV.  By the end it seems pretty clear that the sheriff of the town is assuredly a robot and was murdering all these people.  So it\u2019s not the best murder mystery, but I was fine with that.  Then in the very end they go for a bs meta ending just like Monkey Island 2.  It\u2019s so painfully stupid.  They pull back and say everyone is in an adventure game and that game is going to be deleted and everyone will have to start over.  Everything is wrapped up within seconds and the characters choose non-existence by deleting the world (I'm not sure i would even believe these characters would pick deletion over existence).  It\u2019s such a cheap ending.  I would almost say they ran out of money or time, I don\u2019t know why else they would do something so painfully bad.  I guess I should have known Ron Gilbert would do something stupid like this.  Someone really needs to tell him meta endings don\u2019t really pack any kind of punch anymore, they are really just meaningless.   [/spoiler]\n\nDue to that I just can\u2019t recommend this game, no matter how good the rest of it is and the rest of it is very good.", "timestamp_created": 1503209254, "timestamp_updated": 1503532493, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.407748", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34349541": {"recommendationid": "34349541", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093794134", "num_games_owned": 307, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 2652, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496271742}, "language": "english", "review": "Some of the humor's a little dumb, but it's worthwhile over all.

De spellen van Lucasarts behoorden tot mijn favorieten, door de combinatie van de graphics, humor en puzzels. Tim Schafer en Ron Gilbert zijn verantwoordelijk voor de meeste van mijn favoriete spellen uit die tijd, zoals de Monkey Island reeks, Day of the Tentacle, Grim Fandango en Full Throttle. Toen ik een paar jaar terug las dat Tim Schafer 3 mln dollar had ingezameld om een nieuw spel te maken, was ik dan ook dolblij. Tot ik Broken Age uiteindelijk speelde en ik vooral teleurgesteld was (maar dat is voor een andere review). Toen ik las dat Ron Gilbert ook zijn doel voor een vergelijkbaar Kickstarter project had gehaald, waren mijn verwachtingen dan ook niet al te hoog gespannen.\n\n[b]Wat Thimbleweed Park goed doet[/b]\nGelukkig is de humor en satire van Ron Gilbert niet verminderd sinds Maniac Mansion en Monkey Island. Door te concentreren op de inhoud en niet op de graphics, heeft Ron Gilbert op een budget van 6 ton voor elkaar gekregen wat Tim Schafer met een budget van 3 mln niet lukte. Hoewel de graphics sterk doen denken aan de stijl van Zack McCracken en Maniac Mansion, ben je dit na een paar minuten spelen vergeten, door de vele details, de goede stemacteurs, grappige dialogen en vele, vele verwijzingen naar eerdere spellen van Ron Gilbert en naar wat hip was in de jaren tachtig. Er zijn ook de nodige achievements te verdienen, zoals tegenwoordig gebruikelijk is. Net als in Maniac Mansion en Zak McCracken (en later ook Day of the Tentacle) heb je ook hier de mogelijkheid om tussen verschillende personages te wisselen en dit is ook noodzakelijk om sommige puzzels op te lossen. Wat ook indrukwekkend is, zijn de ruim 1000 boeken die je in de bibliotheek kunt lezen en die door Kickstarter backers zijn geschreven. Hetzelfde geldt voor een vergelijkbaar aantal antwoordapparaat berichten dat door een andere groep Kickstarter backers is ingesproken. \n\n[b]Wat Thimbleweed minder goed doet[/b]\nHoewel je met vijf verschillende personages kunt spelen, zijn ze 90% van de tijd volledig gelijk. Slechts voor een handjevol spellen moet je een specifiek personage (of combinatie van personages) gebruiken, maar in de meeste gevallen maakt het niet uit wie je wat laat doen. Hoewel we van een aantal personages wat meer te weten komen over hun verleden en hun motivatie, geldt dit niet voor allemaal. Franklin, de vader van Delores is een spook en heeft het minst van allemaal te doen, omdat hij het hotel niet kan verlaten. Hij speelt wel een cruciale rol, maar gedurende het merendeel van het spel is hij nutteloos. Hoewel de meeste puzzels redelijk voor de hand liggen, zijn een aantal puzzels tamelijk vergezocht. Gelukkig kun je in het spel een hint hotline bellen, waar je specifieke hints krijgt voor de puzzels waar je op dat moment mee bezig bent. Deze hint hotline is toegevoegd in een update op vele verzoeken van spelers die hopeloos vast zaten. Het eind van het spel komt onverwacht en voelt gehaast aan in vergelijking met de rest van het spel. Een beetje alsof ze geen geld/inspiratie meer hadden en besloten om er maar een eind aan te maken.\n\n[b]Conclusie[/b]\nHoewel de graphics op sommige momenten duidelijk te geavanceerd zijn om door te kunnen gaan voor een spel uit de vroege jaren negentig, voelt het over het algemeen alsof iemand een onuitgebracht Lucasart spel heeft gevonden en besloten heeft deze alsnog uit te brengen. Ondanks wat kleine minpuntjes is dit een spel dat laat zijn dat point-and-click adventure games nog geen verleden tijd zijn en dat je met 25 jaar oude graphics toch een leuk spel kunt maken.", "timestamp_created": 1502049469, "timestamp_updated": 1502049469, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497288", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34066614": {"recommendationid": "34066614", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059308458", "num_games_owned": 314, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 717, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502045891}, "language": "english", "review": "FINALLY!! a new adventure game with the excellent taste of a classic one.

Anyone familiar with this game genre of this era will feel right at home-a-reno with 'Thimbleweed Park', and will probably dive head first into it at the hard difficulty level like I did-a-reno. Those who are new to it can still enjoy it in the Casual mode.\n\nYou can tell that the game developers-a-boo have put a lot of thoughts into the game's puzzle designs. For the most part, the puzzles that you'll need to solve are clearly presented, and you'll have sufficient clues-a-boo to figure out what to do. A few puzzles near the end of the game can be challenging, if not obtuse, but most puzzles are logical given the contexts-a-boo. I needed to seek out hints about five times when playing in Hard mode; but upon getting them in many cases, I could see where I had been neglectful.\n\nThe setting and story-a-who of 'Thimbleweed Park' are mysterious, with many clues to the strange happenings in the town for you to discover, and intrigue waiting for you to unravel. All the while, Gilbert, Winnick et al.-a-who hold no punches with their commentaries on adventure game design, especially unfair game deaths in adventure games, as well as with references to the 80s pop culture, which happen to be inspirations-a-who for 'Thimbleweed Park'. For achievement seekers like I, there are enough-a-who here to warrant a extra playthrough or two.\n\n'Thimbleweek Park' may not be as flashy as its contempor-a-renos, but it's full of great and smart writing, snide yet self-referential commentary, dry humour, great voice acting, as well as engaging puzzles. It's packed full of nostalgi-a-reno for those of us familiar with 80s and 90s PC adventure games, and it's a modern introduction to the greatness of these games to those who are not. I highly recommend 'Thimbleweed Park'-a-reno to everyone.\n\nP.S. Having played through the game in both Casual and Hard modes, I highly recommend playing in the latter for the complete experience and challenge. Casual mode has a lot of the fun puzzles, character interactions and scenes cut out, all of which make 'Thimbleweed Park' a richer, better game.", "timestamp_created": 1500792416, "timestamp_updated": 1500956509, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539474", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33721890": {"recommendationid": "33721890", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988512156", "num_games_owned": 291, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 755, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500722175}, "language": "english", "review": "Very nice game, not at the level of monkey island, The thing that I liked less is to have to take care to follow the story of all the character, I like more to have a protagonit that I can focus on.", "timestamp_created": 1500733235, "timestamp_updated": 1500733235, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33717532": {"recommendationid": "33717532", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960334445", "num_games_owned": 466, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1028, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499697268}, "language": "english", "review": "You know that feeling when you find one last exemplar of your favourite chocolate bar under your bed?

Humour is good... well, most of it. Graphic and animation are great. Music is birlliant! Plot is nice and intriguing. Puzzles are nice. Ending is shit. Pretencious, depressing, dissapoitning and overall pretty lame. I don't like it at all. Well, maybe Ray's segment wasn't complelty terrible, but I'm still not satisfied. But, I guess where's not so much what I can do about it, Ron Gilbert? Except maybe... not buying some of your new games in the future? I guess this is all what really matter for you in the end? This twist... was executed much smoopher in Stanley's Parable and Pathologic. But, I got to admit - this wasn't Deadly Premonition level of bad writing, but it's still pretty bad. I hate this ending. I guess I still recomended to play it, but I'm not happy. The rest of the game is okay and even good. But, the ending is shit.

It is truly a throwback to the excellent point and click adventures of days gone by.  What this game has above those that came before is the puzzles.  \n\nI've played many of these games in the past and found that most had puzzles that were completely illogical.  That's not the case with Thimbleweed Park.  Sure, I got stuck several times for a bit, but that's the fun of it.  You really need to think in this one.

Not really a spoiler, but it kind of gives away part of a puzzle later in the game. Read if you want.\n[spoiler]The puzzles don't really make sense at times. For example, you eventually have to fix a certain machine at the sheriff's office. You think to yourself, \"ok I'll go to that store that sells those parts because that makes sense.\" But no. The store doesn't have them. For some reason, a character that hasn't even been to the sheriff's office has it. And what's more confusing is you just walk to the sheriff's office to fix it. You're thinking, \"why would she even bother to go to the sheriff's office, and better yet, how did she know that machine was even broken? And better yet, why would she pick up the part in the first place? She has no reason to carry it around?\"[/spoiler]\nBut anyway, yea that's my only beef.

I discovered it accidentally on Steam, and I really love point and click adventure games so I thought this would be right up my alley, but playing it felt like a waste of time. The further I got in the game the less I enjoyed it and just wanted it to end, and boy did the ending suck balls.\n\nIt wasn't funny, the voice acting was mediocre, the overall aesthetic was mediocre with its half-assed attempt at being retro while not really pulling it off at all, but all of that could be excused it the game was good, but it's not. The game starts off exciting, but it just gets lamer and lamer the further you get. And I really hated the hive mind approach to how you controlled all the characters in that the only way to progress in the game was to treat each character as if they shared the same mind, ie. mine. That completely removed any sense of immersion for me. Having to deal with the quirks of the characters in an adventure game is often one of the best things about them, but here they all share the same goals and objectives and even though none of them know each other they are working together as if they were the same person just because I'm controlling them that way.\n\nAnd there were so many loose ends and wasted potential in this game. There were interesting characters in this game that weren't used for anything interesting and it makes you wonder if this game was rewritten multiple times before shipping and you're just seeing bits and pieces of different games in the final product. I'm not going to spoil any of the story, but I just finished watching season 1 and 2 of Twin Peaks for the first time ever before I found this game on Steam and I was super excited to play it because it looked sort of inspired by Twin Peaks, but just like Twin Peaks this game plays as if it was cancelled midway through.

I did use the in-game hints several times, because I'm not a very patient gamer, but when I  did I was almost always already on the right track.

As\u00ed que cuando vi que se iniciaba un Kickstarter para lanzar una nueva aventura gr\u00e1fica con todo el esp\u00edritu Scumm, me involucr\u00e9 sin dudarlo. La espera fue larga, con meses de retraso, pero al final lleg\u00f3: recib\u00ed mi prometida clave que, por 20 d\u00f3lares, liberaba adem\u00e1s mi alma de haber cometido pecados innombrables en los tiempos en los que el disquete era lo m\u00e1s xD\n\nYa han pasado unos meses desde que termin\u00e9 el juego, y creo que a\u00fan tengo dudas sobre si hacerlo o no, porque no tengo muy bien las ideas claras acerca de mis impresiones finales pero... All\u00e1 vamos.\n\nPROS: \n-Es un revival total del sentimiento Scumm, con m\u00faltiples gui\u00f1os a juegos m\u00edticos. Podemos incluso encontrarnos con viejos conocidos que ahora viven en Thimbleweed Park. Las referencias son muy amplias, y para pillar algunas tienes que ser animal observador y seguidor de la trayectoria de los autores. Alguna que otra roba sonrisas.\n-El juego tiene una din\u00e1mica bien hilada entre los distintos personajes, los cuales poseen momentos de protagonismo clave en algunos puntos de la historia.\n-Algunos mensajes del list\u00edn de tel\u00e9fono son realmente hilarantes.\n-Aunque las voces est\u00e9n en ingl\u00e9s, est\u00e1 traducido a much\u00edsimos idiomas.\n\nCONTRAS:\n-Me duele decirlo, pero.... Aunque los personajes est\u00e9n bien definidos y tengan cierto carisma, sus historias me resultaron indiferentes. No empatic\u00e9 en absoluto con ninguno (excepto en un punto determinado emotivo, cerca del final).\n-El potente humor absurdo del que hac\u00edan gala los Monkeys o El d\u00eda del tent\u00e1culo, y motivo por el cual me hice fan total de los t\u00edtulos, pues... Brilla por su ausencia. S\u00ed, hay chistes, pero mucho menos frescos y espont\u00e1neos; en este juego el cinismo es el rey.\n-El modo dif\u00edcil hace honor a su adjetivo. Tuve momentos en los que me ve\u00eda con los \"chopocientos\" personajes y ni pu\u00f1etera idea de qu\u00e9 hacer, y la metodolog\u00eda para seguir adelante fue hacer combinaciones aleatorias de todo con todos (reconozco que en el Hotel y el conserje tuve que tirar de gu\u00eda *Shame on me, SHAME ON ME!*)\n-Hay mucha l\u00ednea argumental desaprovechada: cosas que parecen que van a tener sentido, cuando terminas el juego ves que s\u00f3lo era relleno y te quedas un poco as\u00ed como :| \n-El final.

Do not be turned off by the fact it was a Kickstarter game. Ron Gilbert of Monkey Island fame was one of the primary designers of the game. It is clear that while the gameplay style is an older varity his experiences in game design have been advantage of with newer technologies to produce challanging puzzles intergrated well into the games main story.\n\nOften point and click adventure games stuggle with smoothly intergrating story into puzzle design. This has lead to older games having some, odd requirements, to solve puzzles. I did not feel like I encoutered this at all. \n\nThat game also has an interesting feature for hints if you are unable to decipher the games clue. The game features an ingame phone system allowing you to call a few different ingame characters and have conversations. They used part of this feature to build an in game \"hint line\".\n\nYou pick up the phone and dial the number for the hint line. The game will then contextually pick up on where you are in the game's story and provide hint options on what you might need help with. The hints start off gradually soft. They dont want to ruin the puzzles for you completely. This is useful so that you know if you are head in the right direction. You can keep pressing for a more detailed hint. The game will break the puzzle down for you more and more making it clear what you need to do.\n\nI recommend that you only do this if you are truly lost however. The hint line was built after the game was completed. You are essitnatlly ruining the game experience if you do.\n\nThe one big complaint i have about the game is that [spoiler] the game 4th walls at the end and tells you you need to watch the kickstarter video for a hint to beat the game  I did find that gimmick a little interesting. if the video becomes unavailable however it will ruin the gimmick.\n[/spoiler]\n\n\nAnyways, I enjoyed this game very much.

For those of you who are not familiar with adventure video games from that time: They were awesome. LucasArts produced iconic games like Maniac Mansion, Monkey Island, Day of the Tentacle, Indiana Jones games based on the movies and many more. These games redefined what adventure games were supposed to be and they have a large followership to this day.\n\nThe question is of course: Did Ron Gilbert succeed in creating another such game in 2017? The answer is \"yes, but\". And here comes the even better part: While the old LucasArts games were great, they still had quirks in them and the games industry has learned from it's mistakes in the past 20 years. Therefore Thimbleweed Park is not only a genuine spiritual successor of the old adventure games, but it also implements the current state of the art conventions in the adventure game industry. The puzzles are of good quality and if you are totally stuck, there is even a hint system within the game that you can use to get some pointers.\n\nIf you like adventure games then I can wholeheartily recommend this game. If you are familiar with the old LucasArts classics, you will enjoy the game even more because it is full of in-jokes about the old classics and the 80's.\n\nThis game is a work of love. Of love for adventure games. This one is special. While I doubt that it will have the same massive impact as the classics from back in the day, this game is certainly something that should be in the collection of a modern day's adventure gamer.", "timestamp_created": 1498976739, "timestamp_updated": 1498976739, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.573081", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33115721": {"recommendationid": "33115721", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025413558", "num_games_owned": 741, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 491, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498972996}, "language": "english", "review": "Very enjoyable.

The first one was a good game. And It was funny.\nMonkey Island 2, which he also directed, was as full of stupid \"meta\" jokes and narcissistic crap like that as Thimbleweed Park. And them puzzles also sucked(pick up a fucking dog, Ron, seriously? not funny). Everyone seem to have forgotten about It. Maybe they were distracted by exellent visuals and epic scale. I know I was until I decided to play It again a couple years back just to have my good memories shattered.\n\nSo, yeah, this is Ron Gilbert's game alright. Idk why I was surprised to begin with.\n\nThank god he didn't direct Day of The Tentacle.

If you're a fan of classic point-and-click adventures, you'll love it. If you don't know what \"classic point-and-click adventures\" are, then this is a fantastic introduction. \n\nLike so many detective stories, it begins with a body. \n\nThe player controls five characters (beginning with FBI agents Ray and Reyes) as they explore the strange, surreal backwater town of Thimbleweek Park, and the shadow cast over the town by recently-deceased pillow factory owner Chuck Edmund. For the first two minutes I was worried that this was going to be a rehash of Twin Peaks (a influence cited by co-designer Ron Gilbert), The X-Files and Welcome to Night Vale, but it quickly becomes apparent that this is far more than just a police procedural. Despite the weird setting there's real emotion here too. \n\nThere are a few small criticisms: I found the two FBI agents a lot less engaging that the other three playable characters, and at times there is a bit of backtracking involved, which can get slightly repetitive. The size of the game means there's definitely a few plotholes, but what ultimately emerges is far more than the sum of its parts: a panoramic view of a town and it's population. The locations are beautiful, the sound design is en pointe (echoes of the classic scores from Monkey Island) and I loved the way some puzzles required teamwork between multiple characters to successfully complete them.  Without wanting to give away any spoilers, there's even an exploration of the idea of video game characters' free will. \n\nAll in all, it's a beautifully realised video game. At times you'll be ripping your hair out in frustratation (BACK AWAY FROM THE ONLINE WALKTHROUGH, CHILDREN), but Thimbleweed Park really is worth investing your time in. \n\n8.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1497223253, "timestamp_updated": 1497223278, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32351629": {"recommendationid": "32351629", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961308584", "num_games_owned": 279, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497213304}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Una obra maestra de las de anta\u00f1o !.

There's a certain degree of obtuseness that comes with the territory of puzzle games, but nothing feels particularly unfair and the game makes it a point for everything to be discoverable - no pixel hunting (well, except for the joke achievements) or easily overlooked locations. Sequencing can be challenging in one of the later acts as it's not clear ahead of time how the puzzles for some of the characters dovetail into the others, but in general the game does do a clever job easing newer players into puzzles of expanding scope in the early acts with the flashbacks and chapter structure, so folks who are new to the genre should not feel intimidated. Pacing at the end is also helped by tightening the scope and focus of the puzzles again. \n\nWhere YMMV is the writing: it banks heavily on referential humor, which can get old, though I got a kick out of it. That choice is somewhat justified by a reveal at the end, but it's also a reveal that trivializes a lot of the story/character setup from the rest of the game. Ultimately, it feels like an excuse not to pay off a lot of threads in more interesting ways (e.g. the sheriff/coroner/manager connection, the signals conspiracy etc.) Even the main characters feel shortchanged because there's no emotional investment in their goals (and in Delores' case, her ending feels particularly Twilight Zone ironic.) \n\nIf you came for Day of the Tentacle plot shenanigans, you should instead be prepared for cynical Maniac Mansion by way of David Lynch.

It is meant as a meta-loveletter of sorts to games of this type, like Monkey Island and Maniac Mansion, but unfortunately misses the mark in several key ways.\n\n- PCs who seem to have too much out-of-character knowledge and the player, despite the inclusion of a to-do list, has no clear indication of what they're current goals are.\n\n- Horrible, third-rate voice acting. Seriously, it's so ameteurish that it harkens back to the early CD-ROM days when they would get any old nobody to provide the voices for the characters. The male federal agent in particular is supposed to have some kind of Latino accent but it mostly comes across as a grating lisp performed by someone who watched a telenovella once.\n\n- Several involved, non-sensical puzzles. And not in a \"non-sensical in a funny adventure game way\" but non-sensical in a \"this is unituitive and no player would think in this way\" way. There are puzzles you can only solve by going to locations that the character you have selected would have no reason to visit in the narrative.\n\n- All this could be forgiven if the game was funny and/or well-written a la Monkey Island, but it isn't. It is, in fact, unfunny in the most tragic way: it winks at you the whole time as if it's self-awareness is supposed to make up for the fact that the writers can't write funny dialogue. \n\n- Of the 5 different PCs, only one of these characters, the young game-enthusiast, is at all likable, and the female federal agent character stands out as being particularly nasty for no established reason, other than the fact that the writers thought it would be funny to have a \"sardonic\" character and then wrote no funny lines for her.\n\nI backed this game on Kickstarter because of the genre it pays homage to and pedigree behind it's developers.

The first two playable characters are satirically based on Fox Mulder and Dana Scully from The X-files. Agent Angela Ray is the senior, experienced \"no nonsense\" detective, while Antonio Reyes serves as the young, aspiring detective. Both detectives are charged with investigating a murder that happened on the bridge outside of town. Including the two agents, there are 5 playable characters total, but the other 3 come at a later time.\n\nThe characters are interchangeable, though their dialogue only changes slightly when asking questions. In most adventure games, I often find it tiresome and odious when I'm required to switch characters to do certain puzzles while carrying specific items, but Terrible Toybox nailed this concept down. It doesn't matter which character is carrying what, since all puzzles can be solved by any character. Items can be traded with characters as well.\n\nThe biggest feature of this game is that there are no game overs, you cannot die, and you cannot screw yourself over by putting yourself in an unwinnable situation (*cough* King's Quest 5 *cough*). Terrible Toybox specifically tailored the game so that you will be able to solve any puzzle without consequence. The game has two modes, Casual and Hard, but this only means that there are more complicated puzzles to solve in Hard. Some puzzles can be difficult, but all of them are logical, so there's no need to use items on every single corner of the screen like in the old days. The game's characters are interesting and well-written with pretty good voice acting. Everyone has their own little quirk, and the writing is clever, snarky, and funny at the same time. Willie ended up becoming my favorite character. \n\nMy grievances with the game are slight. Personally, it took some time for me to get used to the UI and commands. Commands like \"push\" and \"pull\" felt redundant when you can simply right click on something to do the action with \"use\". There are some items in Casual mode that are only used in Hard mode, and will sit in your inventory for the entirety of the game. \n\nAdditionally, there are a few puzzles in Casual mode that might cause you to overthink. For a non-spoiler related example, early on in the game Ray and Reyes need county maps in order to explore the rest of the tri-county area. You can find a genuine county map, but it needs to be printed. The printer says that it requires a nickel to use. In order to get the nickel, you need to recycle a bottle at the Quickie Pal. Since I had a whiskey bottle in my inventory, I tried to trade it in at the clerk, but had no luck. I spent about 20 minutes looking for a different bottle before I realized that I could just print the map with no cost. Perhaps I was overthinking it, but I felt like an idiot for trying to solve a puzzle that wasn't even in my game mode.\n\nFinally, there's the ending. I'm not going to give it away, but I think it's going to leave some people dissatisfied; not because it's poorly written, but because it's so...unorthodox.\n\nBarring some minor frustrating details, this is the most fun I have had with an adventure game for a long time.

Probably literal weeks out of my life were spent trying to reach every conceivable ending. And I became a bit obsessed with Green Tentacle, I'll admit. Back then, there were no walkthroughs available at the click of a mouse button, so it meant trial and error with tons of backtracking and enduring endless repetitive dialogues.

I think that if you didn't grow up playing adventure games (I started with simple text-based ones on my Commodore 128D), then this game might feel too slow or repetitive. For those of us who remember the classics, all the references (both subtle and overt) to old adventure games -- Maniac Mansion especially (the broken ketchup bottles!!!) are totally delightful. I absolutely love this game. I've only made it to Part 3 so far on hard mode with no walkthrough or hints, but so far, it's brilliant. My only regret is that I didn't find out about it until after the Kickstarter ended -- otherwise, I would have backed this game to the max. I think that the best way to enjoy Thimbleweed Park, in my opinion, is to just take your time and explore everything. Collect those dust specks! Click on the same thing again...and again...just to see what happens.

The characters and setting are nearly perfect, the game and puzzle design are well thought out, the tone and experience are great, and even the graphics, sounds, and music are quite well done. Ransome the bleeping Clown and Delores truly shine as characters and the rest are good too. There's a number of in jokes for fans old maniac mansion and other lucasarts games, but they're not core to the story. The game leans pretty heavily on the 4th wall, which you'd expect from a Kickstarter fueled by nostalgia.\n\nOverall I loved this game, but the overall story is where things go a little awry. The story relies on tired tropes near the end and completely discards the murder investigation thread without a truly satisfying ending to it. Things ultimately make some sense, but there's a growing number of plot holes surrounding some of the game's events once the antagonist is revealed.\n\nAll characters have their arcs nicely tied up in some fashion, and it's a satisfactory conclusion, but the ending went in a different direction than I had hoped and the events of the story didn't make sense in retrospect (some of this is explained by the nature of the ending, but I find that a bit of a cop out for something that presents itself as a murder mystery)\n\nAnyway, buy, play, and love this game.

They pitched it on Kickstarter as a forgotten point and click adventure from the early 90s, and that's what they delivered. The engine and UI are quite a bit better than those earlier SCUMM-engine games, but it feels right. I admit I never played Maniac Mansion, the inspiration for Thimbleweed Park, but I can see I probably would have enjoyed it. In Thimbleweed Park you control five separate characters, each introduced gradually in the early stages of the game. At first they almost feel superfluous, the first two characters Rey and Reyes are interchangeable and even say the exact same things when you interact with objects. I found this rather disappointing, especially as half the fun is hearing all the responses you get from interacting with the world in different ways. In some ways the game might have been better with just one character at first. Fortunately things quickly improve as more characters are introduced, and each takes on their own personality. It won't be long before you realise you're getting quite attached to them.\n\nThere are plenty of puzzles to solve, often involving more than one character, but fortunately each character has his/her own diary which keeps track. I never found myself completely stumped about what to do next, although I did get somewhat stuck in a few places. Most of the time I came back the next day and figured it out, and only once did I have to check a hint guide (incremental hints) which gave me enough of a clue on where to go next. I can live with that!\n\nThe ending is going to be divisive. Frankly my initial reaction was one of disappointment once the game's intentions were revealed, perhaps because it felt like a cheap way of resolving a few of the town's mysteries. Yet playing through those final moments, knowing where it was all going, ended up being quite satisfying, even emotional.\n\nI played two point and click adventure games lately, this and Paradigm. Both are excellent in different ways. Paradigm is considerably funnier, but Thimbleweed Park has better puzzles. Both are recommended.

However, if you're under 23 at least a third of the jokes will probably fly over your head unless you were home schooled by a computer nerd like Ron Gilbert.", "timestamp_created": 1494129697, "timestamp_updated": 1494129697, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31593649": {"recommendationid": "31593649", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004693272", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1294, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494120184}, "language": "english", "review": "Ladies and gentlemen, as someone whose teenage years as a gamer were totally defined by [i]Monkey Island[/i], [i]Grim Fandango[/i] and related games, let me tell you something: this just might be the definitive adventure game of all time. 10/10, would defy the sheriff-a-reno to escape to the sewers and hunt shrooms for a bitchy old psychic again.\n\nTo be sure, it's got a few flaws if you search for them, as some reviewers have: a few too many clever '80s references, a couple of minor but irritating bugs (e.g. the on-off status of the caps lock key randomly influences whether keyboard shortcuts work), and a couple of logical leaps where the different playable characters have to read each other's minds-- though honestly, this is a damn adventure game, so just be glad you aren't making a fake moustache out of cat whiskers or trampolining off of a rubber skin costume stretched over a manhole. But overall, this game takes everything that has ever defined the very best of this genre, puts it all in one place, and uniformly improves on it.\n\nPlay it on Hard mode, the way God and/or Ron Gilbert intended it, and you'll find an enormous network of brilliantly intertwined puzzles that range from \"easy but clever\" to \"spend 2 hours hunting for the solution in-game, then wake up at 2 a.m. and sneak out of bed to crank up your PC as the solution bursts forth from your Thimbleweed-fevered subconscious\". What's really amazing about this game is that every single one of the puzzles is completely logical and accessible if you just pay enough attention. You can pick up, manipulate, and get interesting descriptions etc. out of tons of objects that you won't actually use-- so interactivity isn't automatically a hint that it matters to gameplay. Red herrings abound. But each interaction leads you gently along to the next, and you'll still get enough subtle hints from descriptions and even fail responses (\"I can't do X with Y\") that you'll eventually figure it out.\n\nI never played [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] or [i]Day of the Tentacle[/i] back in the day, and when [i]DotT: Remastered[/i] came out, I couldn't get into it at all because (among other things) coordinating the multiple characters seemed like way too much of a pain. Here, not only are the individual characters handled beautifully (all well-written, with comedy props to Ransome and infinite all-around identifiable coolness points to Delores), but their puzzly interactions all work smoothly, and a few of them even have well-written stories that they share between them-- Franklin and Delores in particular.\n\nFor all the complaints about excessive nod-and-wink references, over-the-top fan service (taken to a literal extreme in one case near the end), and breaking of the fourth wall, the game pulls it all together at the end in a sort of hypercube-level breaking of the fourth wall squared that is truly a delight to experience. Not everyone will like the ending, but it's impressively well executed, like everything else in this game. If you love adventure games, buy it today. If you don't love adventure games yet, try this game on for size, and if you don't like it, then consider that as definitive proof that this genre is not for you-- because this game captures everything that's great about adventure games, and adds to it, right down to a uniquely great soundtrack and voice acting. 10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1494120232, "timestamp_updated": 1494120747, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31590932": {"recommendationid": "31590932", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088946812", "num_games_owned": 167, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1037, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494105414}, "language": "english", "review": "Did not see that coming.\n\nNot saying I liked the ending, but definitely did not see it coming.\n\nI regret not sending in an answering machine message...\n\n---\n\nAlso, the game is not entirely bug free (nothing game breaking, though).

Wer diese klassischen Spiele, wie so viele, geliebt hat, dem kann ich Thimbleweed Park ans Herz legen. Wer sie nicht kennt, f\u00fcr den mag es Besseres geben. Und sei es, die Klassiker endlich nach\u00adzu\u00adholen.\n\nMan m\u00f6chte meinen, die Spiele-Publisher h\u00e4tten inzwischen be\u00adgriffen, dass sich mit Nostalgie Geld verdienen l\u00e4sst. Oder vielleicht wissen sie es, aber Gilbert wollte sich nicht von einem Publisher abh\u00e4ngig machen. Jedenfalls ist auch dieses Retro-Projekt mit den Geldern tausender Kickstarter-Unterst\u00fctzer entstanden.\n\nHerausgekommen ist ein Spiel, das ich mutig nennen w\u00fcrde. Pixelig bis zum Anschlag und, seit wohl zwei Jahrzehnten nicht mehr ge\u00adse\u00adhen, mit einer Liste von Verben. W\u00e4hrend ein modernes Adventure einem oft nur zwei M\u00f6glichkeiten zu jedem Gegenstand anbietet, \"Kuck\" und \"Mach\", kann man bei Thimbleweed Park wie in der guten alten Zeit \u00f6ffnen und schlie\u00dfen, nehmen und geben, dr\u00fccken und ziehen, ansehen, benutzen und ansprechen.\n\nDas erm\u00f6glicht R\u00e4tsel und spa\u00dfige Bemerkungen, die ein modernes Adventure schlecht bieten kann. Ich war mir nicht sicher, ob ich mit etwas so Altmodischem und Ungewohntem noch zurecht\u00adkom\u00admen w\u00fcrde. Doch in den ersten Minuten war ich dann nicht etwa von der Vielfalt an M\u00f6glichkeiten herausgefordert, sondern entt\u00e4uscht, dass sie bei erster Gelegenheit nicht funktionierten. Will man die Person, die man im allerersten Bild trifft, ansehen, wird sie statt\u00addessen angesprochen. So habe ich mir meine neuen alten M\u00f6g\u00adlich\u00adkei\u00adten nicht vorgestellt - und [url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/03/31/everything-wrong-with-thimbleweed-park/]dieser Herr[/url] von \"Rock, Paper, Shotgun\" schon gar nicht. Das Problem, dass man Figuren nicht ansehen kann, zieht sich leider durch das Spiel. Eine vertane Chance. Aber ansonsten ent\u00adwickeln sich die Interaktionsm\u00f6glichkeiten gut und ich bin auch schnell wieder reingekommen. Nach dem Durchspielen bin ich ge\u00adspannt, ob ich das n\u00e4chste moderne Adventure nicht als zu simpel empfinden werde.\n\nApropos \"simpel\", der Schwierigkeitsgrad l\u00e4sst sich in zwei Stufen einstellen. Ich habe nat\u00fcrlich die h\u00e4rtere genommen, und bis auf eine Stelle, an der ich mehrere Tage gehangen habe, waren die R\u00e4tsel nie zu schwierig. Ich wollte an dieser Stelle partout nicht in eine L\u00f6sung kucken (die ja heutzutage verf\u00fchrerisch schnell er\u00adgoogelt sind), in der Bef\u00fcrchtung, dass es sich als unn\u00f6tig erwiesen w\u00fcrde und ich es die n\u00e4chs\u00adten 25 Jahre (bis zum n\u00e4chsten Gilbert-Adven\u00adture?) bereut h\u00e4tte. Ich bin dann zum Gl\u00fcck drauf gekommen, und ja, ich h\u00e4tte mir 25 Jahre lang in den B\u00fcrzel gebissen, wie Onkel Dago\u00adbert so sch\u00f6n sagt.\n\nDie Geschichte entspinnt sich an einem Mord, den man mit zwei Polizisten aufkl\u00e4ren soll. Bald gesellen sich weitere spielbare Fi\u00adguren hinzu, meist kann man zwischen 5 Charakteren frei hin und herschalten. Einige Bereiche oder M\u00f6glichkeiten bleiben einzelnen Figuren vorbehalten, der gr\u00f6\u00dfte Teil l\u00e4sst sich mit einer frei ge\u00adw\u00e4hl\u00adten Figur erkunden. Wobei es leider h\u00e4ufig auch keinen Unterschied macht, zu vielen Gegenst\u00e4nden haben sie gar keinen unter\u00adschied\u00adlichen Kommentar parat.\n\nDas Adventure ist nicht nur sehr retro in seiner Steuerung und Grafik, es dreht sich auch stark um die 80er, in denen es spielt, und um Adventures. Eine Figur ist Adventure-Programmiererin, man trifft Mitarbeiter an den alten Lucasarts-Adventures \"pers\u00f6nlich\" und es gibt Seitenhiebe auf den damaligen Konkurrenten Sierra. Das Spiel macht mehr Spa\u00df, wenn man sich damit und den Achtzigern all\u00adge\u00admein ein wenig auskennt, und an zwei Stellen wird solches Wissen auch in R\u00e4tseln \"abgefragt\". Stellenweise durchbricht das Spiel die \"Vierte Wand\" (die imagin\u00e4re Wand zwischen Schauspielern und Publikum im Theater, die daf\u00fcr sorgt, dass die gespielten Figuren die Zuschauer nicht wahrnehmen). An einer Stelle gegen Schluss f\u00fcr meinen Geschmack allerdings zu brachial.\n\nDas Spiel bietet eine englische Vertonung und deutsche Texte. F\u00fcr die \u00dcbersetzung ist Boris Schneider-Johne verantwortlich, der auch die klassischen Adventures des Autors \u00fcbersetzt hatte. Ich habe aber lieber mit Vollvertonung gespielt und auf die deutschen Texte ver\u00adzichtet.\n\nThimbleweed Park l\u00e4uft problemlos unter Linux.\n\n[i]Nachtrag: Es gibt jetzt eine Option f\u00fcr Insider-Witze.

In a sense, it feels like an anachronism and a relic carefully handled and newly enshrined in some dark corner of a videogame museum which only exists in the Elysium of a very distinctive and largely maligned videogame genre, yet it reminds us of just how immersive and rewarding those old formulas still are when they are executed with as much thought, care, flair and brilliance as has been captured by Terrible Toybox with this shining title.\n\nThe mastery of this title is manifold and all the individual points of excellence combine symphoniously to create an experience which is ultimately hugely rewarding -- and this is a viewpoint largely agreed upon by those who have finished the game but for one huge sticking point which has been a buzzkill for many: the ending. Yet, how the game ends has been built to meticulously throughout the whole intertwining journey of the happenings in Thimbleweed County and the narratives and sympathies of the lead characters. \n\nTaking place in a neo-noir setting in 1987, the clues constantly present themselves about the gnarly fate of Thimbleweed County, and the pacing of the unfolding of this grand tale -- from a simple murder story transmogrifying surreptiously into musings on the meaning of life and determinism -- is both exquisite and mysteriously undermining, leading to a climax which might best be described as being startingly harrowing, empty but yet purposeful.\n\nThe puzzle design is among the best and most consistent ever seen in a game of the genre, with every solution being well led to and well thought out and a total absence of what we call \"moon logic\" (completely irrational puzzle solutions). The nature of the puzzles and how they flow and interlink help move the story along at a very satisfying pace and the game continuously incentivises one to explore and truly listen to what characters in the game have to say. The ambience and mystery of the story is likely to stir the player, which is one of the big reasons why the ending is so divisive -- the gamer becomes truly immersed in the world and is very invested in the \"answers\". In this sense, the game has knocked it out the park and then into and out of orbit with its execution of interactive and dialogue driven gameplay. \n\nAll of this is achieved even in dealing with five different playable characters who each have their own purposes, problems and goals.The story pacing brings us to their plights and their journeys within the meta-world of an evil (or is he?) genius rather than just clinging onto the red herring of a simple murder mystery plot -- one involving an individual who we are never told much about, nor meet people who sympathise toward him.\n\nThe visuals and sound certainly help to bolster the wholesome experience of the game, and though the music in the game isn't as memorable or melodically tuneful as in many other games, it is completely apposite. The pixel art is truly a feast; especially with the use of multiple layers of parallax scrolling, which is something we simply didn't see with the old classics from the 1990s.\n\nThe game is flooded with various in-jokes and references which fans of old classics will typically enjoy, and I'm no different. However, when playing it did occur to me that it can at times verge on being something which panders to an echochamber of the already converted, and I wonder if enough has been done to pull in a new audience to enjoy a genre of game which in the case of Thimbleweed Park has been mastered and even surpassed the old golden standard.\n\nMy main concern for this game is that the gem won't be played by as many people as it should be. Forget that it relies fundamentally on old core values and specific execution and remember, rather, that it's an outstanding game -- period. At least, that's what I'd like to convince people of, and especially those who have not delved into the world of point-and-click adventures who, if they'd just give it a shot, might be rewarded much more than they could've imagined.\n\n\n+++++ The ending (others might give it a 5-minus score).\n+++ Outstanding gameplay with nigh on flawless puzzle design and flow.\n+++ Immersive and intriguing dialogue and story which links in seamlessly and intrinsically with the puzzle design.\n++ Super production value all around, with very few negative quirks in the design.\n++ Fantastic pixel art graphics and a memorable set of locations and scenes.\n++ Tremendous details; most notably the huge library with more than a 1000 readable 2-page books in the Mansion Mansion.\n+ Excellent sound and very fun and appropriate voice acting -- it doesn't take itself too seriously and strikes a great balance.\n+ Casual mode is a very good introduction for those who are new to the genre who might be daunted by a very different way of thinking in gaming.\n\n\n+- Self referential nature (in an overarching point & click meta sense) of the game will likely be divisive and there's a likely disconnect there for a newer audience.\n+- The ending has proven to be extremely divisive. It's a brave ending which is balls to the wall, but certainly meticulously crafted and intended. Nonetheless, it has been jarring for many -- and perhaps that just adds to the intrigue.\n\n- The one big minus I would wager is the overall holistic view of the game, in that I'm not sure it's ignited a new furore over the genre of point & click adventures that one might have hoped for.\n- For all the puzzle brilliance, perhaps we could have more puzzles involving pushing and pulling things (where use specifically doesn't work) given that the options are there.\n\nScore: 9.5/10\n\n\nIn closing:\n\n\nYou should buy this game.", "timestamp_created": 1493434056, "timestamp_updated": 1493791121, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488918", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31429176": {"recommendationid": "31429176", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996841467", "num_games_owned": 288, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 908, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492509830}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Como aventura gr\u00e1fica es muy buena, y salvo por el final, todos los puzzles tienen sentido y en muy pocas ocasiones me qued\u00e9 trabado.

A partir de este punto, empieza una historia genial en la que cada uno y de manera particular tiene su propio objetivo que cumplir aunque tengan alguna meta en com\u00fan, como suele ocurrir en las mejores historias, nada es lo que parece en un principio.\n\nEl aspecto visual es maravilloso, la riqueza de colores y la composici\u00f3n hace que la inmersividad en el t\u00edtulo sea completa, puedes quedarte embobado solamente paseando por el juego, todos los detalles est\u00e1n muy cuidados y no hay ning\u00fan detalle dejado al azar.\n\nLos ambientes generados en cada pantalla son diferentes y crean diferentes sensaciones.\n\nPor la m\u00fasica recordaros que hace poco os la traje al Blog y cuyo enlace os voy a dejar aqu\u00ed mismo con una playlist incluida desde la que pod\u00e9is escuchar la banda sonora genial de este juego, muy a la altura del resto del t\u00edtulo. Pinchad en este enlace para acceder al art\u00edculo.\n\nLa dificultad del juego est\u00e1 muy bien medida, no es un juego extremadamente dif\u00edcil y si est\u00e1s atento al juego y eres cuidadoso con todo lo que va sucediendo no tendr\u00e1s problemas en completarlo en Modo dif\u00edcil, hubo pocos puzzles en los que me qued\u00e9 muy atrapado y debo decir que al resolverlos una sensaci\u00f3n de absoluta felicidad recorr\u00eda mi cuerpo a la vez que dec\u00eda \"\u00a1Claro! \u00a1Como no lo habr\u00e9 visto antes!\". No vais a tener que probar todos los objetos con todos los objetos, la clave es prestar atenci\u00f3n y utilizar la l\u00f3gica.\n\nNavegando por internet he visto algunos que dicen que el juego se puede hacer extremadamente dif\u00edcil y no queda otra que tirar de gu\u00edas porque puede llegar a desesperar, esto no es m\u00e1s que un problema que tenemos hoy en d\u00eda con la dificultad de los juegos y la necesidad inmediata que tenemos por completar los juegos, en serio, disfrutadlo, mirad los detalles, leed todas las l\u00edneas de texto, viajad a todos los lugares, \u00a1sacadle el jugo! No pens\u00e9is que por estar un par de horas dando vueltas pensando como completar un puzzle vais a desesperaros porque esto no es real, al contrario, cuando lo resolv\u00e1is os vais a sentir encantados y os va a emocionar \u00a1Que tambi\u00e9n esto es parte de las aventuras gr\u00e1ficas!\n\n\nComo ocurre en otras aventuras como Monkey Island 2, el juego ofrece dos niveles de dificultad \u00a1No descartes jugar primero el Modo casual!\n\nSi hay algo que criticar, es que al usar los personajes puedes interactuar entre ellos, pasar objetos de unos a otros, pero sin que entre ellos exista ning\u00fan tipo de relaci\u00f3n previa, simplemente vas de uno a otro y les pasas objetos porque s\u00ed, esto no est\u00e1 explicado de ninguna manera y aunque es algo que ocurre en otros juegos pero en este que est\u00e1 todo tan mascado es llamativo que no expliquen este punto.\n \nPor no crear Spoilers, no tratar\u00e9 el tema de los gui\u00f1os del juego, pero m\u00e1s adelante cuando ya tenga m\u00e1s tiempo, si me gustar\u00eda hacer un art\u00edculo donde sacar los gui\u00f1os con otros juegos que he visto y explicarlos por si no los conoc\u00e9is.\n\nPara los que pusieron su granito de arena y dieron apoyo al juego a traves de la campa\u00f1a de crowfunding que hubo en kickstarter, hay cabida en el juego en forma de mensaje de contestador autom\u00e1tico  a los que se puede llamar desde las gu\u00edas de tel\u00e9fonos que hay en el juego o de t\u00edtulo libro en las diferentes bibliotecas, un detalle muy bueno que adem\u00e1s su traducci\u00f3n es la original, osea si el t\u00edtulo lo dejaste en ingl\u00e9s sale en ingl\u00e9s.\n\nAlgunos mensajes son buen\u00edsimos, pasar un rato probando contestadores tambi\u00e9n es un atractivo del juego.\nEn definitiva, este es uno de los grandes t\u00edtulos de 2017, si te consideras jug\u00f3n, gamer o videojugador deber\u00edas jugar Thimbleweed Park sin dudarlo y si eres de los de vieja escuela, decirte que si este juego hubiera salido en 1995, sin duda ser\u00eda uno de los grandes a d\u00eda de hoy.\n\n\u00bfY t\u00fa? \u00bfVes las se\u00f1ales?\n\n\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1Nos vemos pronto!!!", "timestamp_created": 1493148433, "timestamp_updated": 1493148433, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31362504": {"recommendationid": "31362504", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045018918", "num_games_owned": 214, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1621, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492585029}, "language": "english", "review": "If you love Maniac Mansion, you will love this. I get the feeling it takes place in the same town during the same time period, though it's not ever explicit. If you enjoyed Secret of Monkey Island, you'll probably also enjoy this.\n\nMy first playthrough took me 27 hours, but I am pretty slow and thorough and got hung up for like 6 hours during trying to solve one puzzle about a cotton swab and fingerprint tape. I predict I could speed run it in less than three hours now, maybe less than 1, if I made no mistakes. Maniac Mansion has a similar play style, and you can speed run that game in 6 minutes.\n\nIt has some cool multi-character puzzles like Maniac Mansion does (distract a baddie with one character and have the other sneak by, for instance). I am not sure if the game has multiple endings like Maniac Mansion, but the one I got was really interesting and hefty.\n\nThere are tiny things that seem cut due to not enough dev time. An Arcade in town, you can't go in. Ron Gilbert said they wanted to add a patch after release to allow that, so we'll see. There are a few security camera style cut scenes that hint at some arcs and character development that doesn't really happen and leaves some loose ends in my mind. These are minor complaints, but as always with me, if I imagine something will be in your game and you don't include it or hint at it but don't include it, I become disappointed.\n\nI am glad I bought this game, and there's even an easy mode with fewer or simple puzzles for casual players, and I want to try it out, too. For $12, this would be a great steal.\n\nI played this right after The Sexy Brutale, a Groundhog Day mansion-based murder mystery on Steam that's also great.

Maniac Island?  Monkey Mansion?? It truly plays like a forgotten LucasArts game... well, other than the METRIC *BEEP*LOADS of shade thrown on practically EVERYTHING, like \"the futuristic year of 2017\"...\n\nWhat I like best is how all the puzzles, for the most part, make sense.  Sure there are comical elements (for instance, how to start a fire in the fireplace), but there aren't any \"hypnotize a monkey with a banana\"-style solutions.\n\nWhat I dislike--sort of--is how the characters have this bizarre hive mind once they all become active, which I suppose is from how awkward it would be to have them talk to each other for every little thing so that anything any one character does, the rest will know.  There's not really a better solution, and it's only jarring at first (and also sort of explained away at the end anyway).\n\nWhat bothers me is the dialogue is for the most part unskippable, and all the loose ends don't get tied up because, ultimately, they don't matter.  That's fine, though, because once you get a certain item, you can make a satisfying BOOM whenever you're feeling frustrated.\n\nI heartily recommend a playthrough if you're a fan of adventure games (and who isn't??).  It's fun to play, and you'll feel smart when you don't have to consult a walkthrough because, really, the only hints you'll need is \"thoroughly check EVERY ROOM\" and \"try EVERY ACTION on EVERYTHING.\" I only got stuck in two places: where to find an object I knew I needed (didn't look closely enough) and how to use an object (didn't try the correct verb).\n\nAlso, it's fun reading in the library and calling everyone in the phone book!

The pixel graphics are lovely -  the modern touches that they included work really well, without taking away from the aesthetic. And the voice acting is mostly fantastic - although playing with 5.1 surround sound, occasionally the odd line would come through only one rear speaker, very quietly. But withstanding (presumably fixable) audio playback bugs, the game is clearly a labour of love - and I'm very glad I backed it on Kickstarter.\n\nWith all that said, I felt the game lacks much of the soul that made a lot of the classic LucasArt point & clicks so endearing. With the exception of one playable character (arguably two I guess), the majority are flat and uninteresting. The dialog spends far too much time on making jokes about old adventure games or \"fan service\", which although sometimes smile inducing, rarely got any honest laughs. The storyline starts interestingly, but peters out well before the game actually finishes - and I think the actual ending is a lot less clever than they thought it would be.\n\nAll in all, I strongly would recommend all point & click adventure game fans play Thimbleweed Park, if just to see what technical excellence in the genre looks like. If you're not already a fan, I'd suggest looking elsewhere first, such as Day of the Tentacle, Grim Fandango or the Monkey Island series - which on the whole I'd say are more compelling games.", "timestamp_created": 1492762814, "timestamp_updated": 1492763087, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.674421", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31263237": {"recommendationid": "31263237", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042207288", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502710709}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Rese\u00f1a completa en espa\u00f1ol: http://www.ruraltex.org/2017/03/la-otra-dimension-resenatron-3000.html", "timestamp_created": 1492721026, "timestamp_updated": 1492721026, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31256685": {"recommendationid": "31256685", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053712604", "num_games_owned": 133, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 718, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492697104}, "language": "german", "review": "Wie fr\u00fcher!

Later ingame you need to interact between characters wich never had any interaction ever and it just makes no sense at all.

There is one thing, I would like to mention, which the other reviews did not focus on: If you compare it to adventures from the last ten years, it beats them in a crucial aspect which lacks games nowadays: All characters have depth. Their biographies are both interesting and complex, you can understand why they act like they act and that gives their world credibility. You follow them with the same affection you felt with Frodo, Harry Potter, Luke Skywalker or any other of your heroes on their journeys to fulfill their quests. You want to help them to get over their problems and you can do it without trying this and that by chance, but by thinking and combining. It's not just a retro adventure, it's a modern classic in combining the comfort of modern gameplay with surprising story twists, lovely characters, clever puzzles and an intriguing setting.

I played pretty much everything LucasArts put out and loved it at the time.\n\nThe non-spoiler version, I guess: if you're a die-hard fan of the 1980s/1990s style of games and wish we were back there, this would completely be the game for you. And if I were the me of that time period, I'd love this game and recommend it to everyone that played adventure games because it's a solid game that exemplifies everything we know and love about the genre as it was then.\n\nThe problem is, that's exactly what it is: a love letter to that time, unfortunately 20-odd years too late. I'm not the person I was 20 years ago and in fairness, it is exactly what it seems to be. I wasn't missold on it being a retro-themed game. I'm just bitter that it feels like it violates every one of Gilbert's own 'how not to design an adventure game' rules, whilst piling on the nerd/fanboy references.\n\n-----\n\nNow we've got the tl;dr version out of the way and the people who care about being spoiled are also out of the way, I want to look at what is wrong with this game, and why it is not the game I hoped it would be.\n\nGraphically, it's exactly as presented. I'm a huge fan of the pixel aesthetic and this really shines. The fact that they can use the power of modern graphics to do things not doable in the real resolutions of the day is actually cool; the ghost effects when playing as Franklin after his initial flashback works rather well to set the mood. The tilting of Ransome's trailer gives you a sense of immersion not previously really doable in such games.\n\nBut from the off, it sets itself up in so many other bad ways.\n\nFirstly, the references. I'm a fan of the old games. Yes, I know Sandy and Dave were in Maniac Mansion. Yes, I know about the 1138 stuff. Yes, I know who Bernard is. I know about the SCUMM engine. The in-jokes asked at one point which profession was involved, be it flooring inspector, pirate, or leather jacket salesman. I got these. I got them all because I remember.\n\nI don't even mind the occasional wink to the audience, but when it's done gratuitously like this, where you can't move for references to things. It stops being an adventure game with a plot and starts being a love letter to times long ago. And if that's what you want in a game, sure, go for it. Unfortunately I wanted a game with a plot, with the occasional nod to the audience for fun.\n\nSpeaking of the plot. The plot is a mess. I get the mechanics of the multi-player making it very hard to have, say, cross-person dialogue. I accept the mechanics required everyone to know things that they individually shouldn't be able to know. I even grudgingly accept the additions to each characters' todo lists to reflect things even when sometimes those things didn't actually reflect the individual character's motivations or goals. But at the same time, the plot is paper thin in places, and obtuse throughout pretty much the story's second act onwards where people do things because the game insists they do them, without rhyme or reason behind it other than the player can direct them to do things. Of course, this does make some grudging sense given the climax, but it's such a cop-out to hand-wave everything in this fashion. More, possibly, of a cop-out than any explanation given after the ending of Monkey Island 2. Big Whoop indeed (even referenced in this game)\n\nThough, I'll add, the todo list was a nice quality of life addition, with this many characters and potential lines of inquiry, it was a nice to have rather than expecting the player to track everything.\n\nThen we have the puzzles. Holy monkey bladders. I will admit up front that I'm clearly insane and tried it in hard mode, and that possibly explains why the puzzles are that obtuse but I refuse to believe this was anything other than bad game design - Gilbert's own list and various articles of his outline what good game design should look like, and I see no reason why this should not extend to the 'hard' version.\n\nThere are puzzles that are definitely in the 'why didn't I think of that sooner' territory. And there are puzzles that I simply would not have solved without trying every object with every object in every location because it's simply not that obvious. I mean... the location of the secret bunker. There are so many things in that puzzle that just don't fit together as things you'd logically do to solve it. (SPOILERS AHEAD)\n\nLet me break it down. So there is a secret bunker in the forest. I was vaguely aware this was a thing. But to have to take Delores' trophy, collect some radioactive waste, put it in the puddle in the trailhead, wait for someone to walk through it and then follow the footprints. This is something that would have seemed like a \"logical\" puzzle in the 1980s. Unfortunately it's 2017, as the game helpfully jokes about on multiple occasions about what life might be like.\n\nAnd the problem with that being, the genre has moved on. What is considered 'acceptable' by players has moved on. Players who thoroughly favour the illogical hoops to jump through are firmly in the minority now - anyone who has played the Wadjet Eye Games will see the difference; none of those have anything like the guess-the-thing-to-use-with-the-thing games going on.\n\nI still remember the Old Man Murray article that Gilbert referenced on occasion, that 'adventure games killed themselves' with the breakdown of a puzzle from Gabriel Knight. This is exactly what this feels like, a series of things that just happen to work together that don't actually connect except laterally. Gilbert himself stated on multiple occasions that he wanted to set up for the style of puzzle where the player has a problem and has to go find the thing to solve it, rather than being expected to collect everything along the way and somehow be expected to know when to use it - but here even tagging everything along didn't help in the slightest. I don't, for example, know if pewter can withstand radioactive waste - it certainly wouldn't have occurred to me as a first, second or even third thought.\n\nThen there's the thimbleberries. I find this particular puzzle annoying for the wrong reason. I haven't tested it but I find it suspicious that the route to the thimbleberry bush is eeriely similar to a certain set of instructions that could be dancing lessons from a map written in 1990... It was the first thing I tried and it led me straight to them. To say that was disappointing...\n\nAnd this leads me onto the ending. The ending is horrible. Utterly horrible. It undermines everything the game set itself up for. We had a cast of characters that were annoying to various degrees - but I at least cared about the outcome of them. I wanted Reyes to get his closure. I wanted Ransome to get redeemed (hoping that the interview with Natalie would somehow do this). I didn't know until quite late what Ray's real objective was, and finding out actually undermined her, she seemed like a good agent for the most part (though where she said that all she did was as little work as possible didn't help her at all!)\n\nBut I had a cast of characters I had some investment in. And then the finale killed whatever investment I had. Closure for Franklin was nice but overshadowed by the Big Reveal. Reyes getting his closure by way of the newspaper was valid, though it irked me that he didn't keep his promise to Willie and that we didn't actually 'solve' Boris' murder as far as the sheriff-a-reno was concerned. (Also, the a-reno, a-who and a-boo thing was stupid. Very stupid. And it didn't really answer the point from the journal that the coroner had been fired and replaced. Though the coronor was even worse at his job than the sheriff, and that irked me too)\n\nLots of nice ideas and some technically excellent execution but it's the wrong end of a time warp for me. Wrong end of a time warp and in search of a plot. Shame, too.

Thimbleweed Park certainly delivered that nostalgia, but exceeded my expectations by proving to be an addictive, mysterious, amusing little adventure in it's own right.  On a technical level, the game is a delight, the pixel style being reminiscent of those old adventures but clearly updated in a way that makes it shine and not look dated in the current day. Sound and voice-acting was excellent too.\n\nI loved the atmosphere of this game. Something I've heard Ron Gilbert talk about in interviews is giving the game a sense of \"place\" and that's something I really felt, the town intrigued me and was a joy to explore. It definitely has that creepy Twin Peaks vibe. I enjoyed meeting all of the odd and zany characters, especially the main ones you can switch between - Ransome and Delores were particular stand-outs, and I found their individual stories contained some touching moments as well as amusing ones.\n\nPuzzle-wise, I am often worried about getting stumped for hours on illogical puzzles in point and click adventures, but I'm happy to say I didn't feel like that with Thimbleweed Park. I played on \"hard\", though I would describe it more as the normal mode for those familiar with these sorts of games. I found the majority of the puzzles to be at a good level of logic, and I found that a lot could be solved by paying attention to the details of dialogue and conversations. A few got me stumped for a while but mostly in a way where I could go away and ponder on it, then come back with a new idea, and felt satisfied when I figured them out. Nothing seemed too obscure to me, nor too easy, so I felt the puzzles were at a really good level.\n\nThere are so many cool little touches in this game too, particularly for fans of Monkey Island and Maniac Mansion, and even the fact that there are 100s of books in the game written by the fans who kickstarted it. Very cool.\n\nOverall my only complaint with the game is that the later parts felt a little rushed in comparison to the first parts, but it still took me 18 hours overall which felt like a decent length for the adventure. \n\n\nI would give Thimbleweed Park 8.5/10 just because of the latter part feeling slightly rushed, but all in all I loved this game!\n", "timestamp_created": 1492261584, "timestamp_updated": 1492261584, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507389", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31153809": {"recommendationid": "31153809", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012138472", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 814, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492172562}, "language": "english", "review": "A really delightful game, which is an amazing blend of clever puzzles and great dialogue.

The scenes and animations are quite well done and are full of life and detail. So long as you dig the kind of retro aesthetic the game is going for, it's a title that really nails what it's aiming at and I enjoyed it a lot.\n\nThe sound is a little up and down, music and sound effects are great, but some of the voice work is a little dodgy. I should be clear, there is nothing game breaking here, just some of the characters sound off. For the most part the cast is well voiced though.\n\nAs to the gameplay, it's classic old school fare, requiring you to examine things carefully and talk to all the characters to get clues. Most problems are of the use item on item variety and for the vast majority of them, they are very logical. Some of the old school games required great leaps in logic (Or a total absense of logic), Thimbleweed park is a game where in nearly every case, the solution makes sense. There are two difficulty modes, hard for those who prefer more challenging puzzles, and casual for those who would rather just persue the story.\n\nI'm not going to say too much about the story actually, as it's best experienced. It begins with a murder and two FBI agents investigating it. Both characters are playable and as the game goes on, 3 more will be added to the roster. Having 5 different characters makes for some interesting puzzles and you will need your team to work together to finish some of them. If you ever get stuck there is always something to be doing with another character, and its possible that furthering another characters path could open up the solution that was stumping you. Overall I found the story to be quite engaging and it gets deeper as the game unfolds.\n\nMy only minor complaints for this one are some patchy voice acting and the inability to skip dialogue you have already heard.\n\nA really solid adventure. 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1492165455, "timestamp_updated": 1498095057, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558777", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31131600": {"recommendationid": "31131600", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019661035", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 781, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491832168}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good game.

Show me some details around Franklin's demise!  Where is the resolution between Ransome and the occult bookstore woman?

Thimbleweed Park kept me engaged from start to finish, with colourful characters, well-crafted puzzles, and a meaty mystery to get invested in. It's a classic adventure game where you play as multiple characters that initially set out to solve a murder, but as the story progresses the focus shifts much more onto the main characters and their (sometimes!) dark histories.\n\nThe art and sound are top notch, and in classic adventure game fashion reward you with beautiful new locations whenever you solve a new puzzle. Steve Kirk's soundtrack also adds a subtle level of atmosphere to the whole experience, invoking old television series themes and weaving them with tunes that feel right out of the LucasArts (Mmucusphlegm?) games of yore.\n\nThe puzzles themselves are very well designed and generally logical. I got stuck a couple of times, but there is so much content that it was never boring to revisit previous locations looking for missed items or dialogue choices. It never took long to find a clue to help point me in the right direction, and each character having a journal always gave me a sense of what I was trying to accomplish.\n\nDon't let the retro style and pixel art fool you! There are a lot of refinements to the general adventure game formula, with fast travel, dialogue and cutscene skipping, quest logs (in a sense), and other clever little quality of life improvements that make the whole experience smoother. The game is designed in such a way as to avoid the old adventure game trap of getting stuck on a single puzzle. With a multitude of player characters each with their own goals, if you ever get stuck you can just switch to another character and start trying to solve a different set of puzzles. You can also tackle many puzzles in whatever order you choose, and as a result there were very few of the bottlenecks that have so often made me turn off the game in the past.\n\nThis game is a MUST for adventure game fans, and will delight and amuse you with all the nods and winks to the mighty and venerable genre we know and love. It's also a great game to sit and play through with friends, since the story hooks you in and keeps you guessing right to the incredibly satisifying end. Some of the references might go over the heads of the uninitiated, but that just made the game feel that much more special to me.

I'd probably reccomend playing the casual version to someone if they don't want to go through hard mode scowering the map for a nickle; It took me a really long time to realize that *SPOILER*, if you look past where the guy in the Quickie Pal typically stands, theres a sign that says they'll take a bottle off your hands and give you five cents. Much of the time, the puzzles weren't too bad. You can often figure out what to do based on the name of the current chapter, which dialogues keep reappearing when talking to various characters, and comments your character says. However, there were quite a few moments like the one I mentioned with the nickle. Another example is *SPOILER* how you are supposed to find ice cream (i-scream?) ghost cake. Well, you're not. You're supposed to freeze regular ghost cake. Also, why would I *SPOILER* ever pour toxic/radioactive waste into a puddle? Well, the answer is, I wouldn't. Just like I wouldn't normally pick up specks of dust whenever I see them. But that's the thing about this game; you have to do things you wouldn't normally think to do.\n\nOverall, this game is creative, has a wonderful storyline, and requires some out of the box thinking. At times, I wished there were some more hints as to which direction to take (if you go down the wrong train of thought, it can take a bit to realize that it's time to switch gears), but for someone who doesn't rush through games for the storyline like I do, this would be a great purchase.

And most of all, it's a *deconstruction* of the classic adventure game, more than it is a reproduction of it. \n\nAnd it actually works absolutely marvellously. The quirky, funny and also slightly eerie tone of the game is complimented by some of the best adventure game puzzle design I have seen in years.

For once, I found myself truly transported back to my childhood, with puzzles and obstacles lingering in my mind throught the workdays and nights, but never stumping me or forcing me to give in to hints in pure frustration, as is so often the case. Instead, I only felt joy and pure fun from the challenge of thinking out different solutions in my head. \n\nTowards the final couple of chapters, though, the puzzles starts to lose some of their brilliance, and the fun somewhat dries up. Sadly, the story also sort of loses a bit of its charm in time for the last act, with the story taking a meta-turn that is funny in a way, but also sort of dampens the previously built-up tension and engagement in the story. \n\nAs a whole, though, TP is a glorious return to form for Ron Gilbert, and a superbly entertaining 80's romp that hopefully makes way for more Ron Gilbert adventure games to come.", "timestamp_created": 1492022113, "timestamp_updated": 1492022113, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31101929": {"recommendationid": "31101929", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997203991", "num_games_owned": 925, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 857, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491592091}, "language": "english", "review": "Must-play for adventure game fans.", "timestamp_created": 1492020908, "timestamp_updated": 1492020908, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31096046": {"recommendationid": "31096046", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040899012", "num_games_owned": 205, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 957, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514481526}, "language": "english", "review": "Thimbleweed Park is exactly what it says it is: a SCUMM styled point and click adventure game made by the original SCUMM team!

Without giving out spoilers, I'll give an example that was used in-game.\n\nVery early on in the game, there is a moment where the fourth wall is broken and they reassure the player that Thimbleweed Park is not like Sierra games where the game can suddenly end and you'll need to back track through saves. But there actually *is* one instance where, KABOOM, game over, you shouldn't have done that, reload.\n\nWe, the players, are given fourth-wall-breaking information that is purposely false. While at first I thought this was just tongue-in-cheek stuff to laugh at older P&C tropes, instead I'm now thinking that there is an added layer of mystery that we're supposed to figure out?\n\nThe first half of the game starts with a Mystery Murder whose protagonists have hidden agendas themselves. During the course of the game as you reveal the plot, I almost feel like the mystery inverts itself. Like the information that we're given as players is, once again, false. \n\nThat is to say, I think there are multiple endings, but I've only experienced one. I experienced the one where I thought the fourth wall breaking information was truthful. \n\nNaturally I could be WELL over-thinking things, but having experienced an ending that was kind of lackluster and re-thinking events that happened in the game, I have to wonder if there aren't more layers.\n\nAnyhoo, Thimbleweed Park is solid even if you take everything at face value in the game. \n\nSide-note: the voice actor for Leisure Suit Larry uses the Larry voice in the game.

Avevo paura che s'infrangessero altri miti di giovent\u00f9: Ron Gilbert, Gary Winnick e David Fox, i factotum degli anni d'oro di LUCASFILM. Beh, mi sbagliavo: gallina vecchia fa buon brodo! ;-D\n\nLe atmosfere alla Twin Peaks e X-files fanno da contorno a un'avventura esteticamente ineccepibile, che sotto i suoi pixel nasconde meccanismi solo accennati nella golden-age per ovvi limiti tecnici. Ecco quindi il parlato per tutto il gioco, tonnellate di contenuti creati dai backers, un'apparente libert\u00e0 di movimento (potrete affrontare gli enigmi nell'ordine che preferite), tanti effetti grafici e personaggi a schermo, senza dimenticare quel costante sfondamento della [i]quarta parete[/i] che negli anni '80 e '90 ci ha regalato gran divertimento.\nOvvio che la comicit\u00e0 e i tormentoni di Gilbert&Winnick siano figli di un'altra epoca e possano non piacere a tutti, ma per chiunque abbia adorato e conosca a memoria le avventure LUCASFILM & LUCASARTS, Thimbleweed Park \u00e8 pieno di riferimenti, autocitazioni, strizzate d'occhio ed enigmi tratti dai precursori del genere punta e clicca che non potranno lasciarvi impassibili. Il tutto sostenuto da una trama intrigante che si dipana lungo quindici/venti ore di gioco, supportata da una grafica low-res, successivamente upscalata ad arte.\nLa scelta dei verbi a schermo fa riaffiorare quelle idee di emancipazione ridimensionate solo nel '93 dall'interfaccia grafica di Sam&Max e rinforza l'idea di antica discendenza. Gli shortcut da tastiera fungono come 30 anni fa, compresa la lumachina durante la pausa e qualche gradita aggiunta come il TAB per evidenziare gli oggetti a schermo (come l'F11 di Simon the sorcerer!), ma la cosa bella \u00e8 che oltre al mouse si pu\u00f2 tranquillamente usare un gamepad... e funziona egregiamente! :-)\n\nTirando le somme (ahia!), da superfanatico risolutore di avventure quale sono ed ero vi posso dire: COMPRATELO SENZA ESITAZIONE! Se avete ancora nel cuore un po' di quell'omino dorato in piedi sulla gigantesca \"L\", questo titolo far\u00e0 l'effetto della torta della nonna che non mangiate da vent'anni.

Some of the background tunes make it very apparent early on, that it borrows from influences like Twin Peaks. It pays a huge amount of fan service to earlier LucasArts games. Which is either incredibly awesome or won't really strike a cord with you if you're a new comer of Ron Gilbert's games. \n\nMuch like the original Maniac Mansion you're put in control of multiple characters. Personally, out of them all. I find Ransome the Clown the most enjoyable to explore and go through the dialogue tree's with. Unfortunately alot of the times each character will basically just repeat the same dialogue without adding anything new or commenting from their own unique perspective. \n\nAs seems to be the case alot of people find the ending to be rather weak. Personally it doesn't bother me for the fact that it leaves alot of options should a sequel or expansion dlc be released. Most of the puzzles aren't to insane to figure out compared to the older games. Once in awhile you will come across a bit of a head scratcher but with a bit of thought an persistence it's nothing you can't overcome. \n\nMaybe the biggest complaint is a part of the game that requires you to go back and watch a very early kickstart video of this game. Which could be incredibly annoying to come across if you were playing the game offline for instance. That or just don't feel like searching the web to go back and find it. Not quite sure what the reasoning was for including that as a in-game clue... \n\nAll in all the music is superb, the writing and voice acting very well done and fitting.

On the other hand, the expectation for the game's qualities was also very high.\n\nTo me, Thimbleweed Park(TM) has ticks in all the boxes: it presents a rich and colourful world, an intriguing plot and many interesting characters. It builds on the reputation of the adventure game classics and pioneers, but the execution works well  for the modern desktop, and I can imagine it fits into living room or mobile platform just as well.\n\nThe designers' choice was to go for a pixelated 16-bit-like graphics. This is in no way a downside, because it manages to pull off many beautiful screens and backgrounds. It also adds to the visuals features like dynamic character lighting and shading, which would not be doable 30 years ago.\n\nThe puzzles are all solvable as long as you pay attention, remember the places and characters and apply logical thinking. I got stuck only a handful of times, but to my own oversight. The player does need to apply some sense to the game, so I would not call the game trivial and easy, at least not on the hardcore mode.\n\nI did find it a bit annoying at the beginning that the game seemed to have been stealing control over the current character in the many of the introductory flashbacks. But in the long run (and by that I mean 15 hours gameplay and more), these introductions were well worth it, because we do get to meet and know these characters better. I particularly liked being able to revisit the town and its inhabitants with the newcomers, getting fresh perspectives on their own background and the backround of the locals.\n\nI think we have come a long way with the adventure games.

This game is freaking awesome. I love it. I actually started it on 'casual' mode, but after reading some reviews and the discussion threads, I started over (mid-chapter 2, about 3 hours in) on hard mode, and I am SO glad i did! I was afraid it would be too difficult, and I'd become frustrated and end up (as I often do with games of this type) just going to the walkthroughs every time I started having trouble, and would eventually lose steam and lose interest...I still havent finished DOTT because the switching of characters and inventory items between characters was too overwhelming...but I did not find that to be the case in Thimbleweed Park.  Instead, I have been so engrossed by this game that I only went to the walkthroughs once (I don't WANT to go to the walkthroughs, it ruins my experience almost every time)... I thought I was totally stuck in the sewer, but the answer was right in front of me. If you love point and clicks like Monkey Island and the other LucasArts games, etc then PLAY THIS GAME! Just do it! This is the first Steam game I have ever paid full price for, and not only dont I regret it... I probably would've paid more. Mark my words, this game will go down in history as one of the best point-n-click adventure games EVER. It has just the right level of difficulty, is so entertaining, and the characters are fantastic (especially Ransome).

The puzzles in this game are a lot more logical than the older games and the overall game sees the benefit of having veteren adventure game developers make the game. \n\nThe story is overall pretty interesting though maybe some weak parts at the end. The interesting story and puzzles carry the game. The humor isn't quite as strong when compared to the older, more cartoony point and clicks. It's got the same kind of quirky and tongue-in-cheek absurdity of Full Throttle I'd say. The story this time is a mystery and that's probably what dicated the feel of the game. The older games were never shy about referencing other games, but this game definitely pushes the references harder; maybe a bit too much.

Even if I grew with old MMucasFlem, ehem, LucasArts games, I feel I moved on from some of the ideosyncrancies games like this one.\nFor those you have not noticed that already, the game UI and art style evokes an era around 1990. You get a bottom side of the screen with both the verb list and the inventory. For those you did not live through that era, the developers even matched the verb list with the keyboard shortcuts. The story itself is also set in 1987, so it is hard not to think of nostalgia. Computers like the C64 are in the game.\nThe problem I see is regarding the innovations the developers tried for this game. One of them that you will notice is that almost every location spans over one screen. I get that you can now make every location stretch, unlike earlier games like Monkey Island, where pan movement of the camera was a truly first for a game like that. However, it makes traversal slower. Add to that that stretched locations do not add much to the game at all, with them being empty. Cemetery is especially aggravating. Developers added some tricks to make traversal faster - and even so I feel it is a little bit slow to my taste.\nAnother inguriating feature of the game is the multiple characters you take into control. This feature, when done correctly, does add something extra to the game. You shall expect actions that can only be done by a character, like the computer game designer being proficient with computers. There are a few situations where two characters need to do two separate things based on a timer, but that is all that it is. There is no direct interaction between characters except for transferring inventory items. Motivation of the different characters working together is non existant. One annoying feature of the game is that various characters do tell the same lines, just with different voice actors. There is an in-game joke that plays at the end of the game regarding that, although by that time I was alread past the annoyed phase.\nAs with any graphic adventure game, inventory and dialogue puzzles are the centre piece of the game elements. They are OK, nothing too stravagant or anything like that. I need to add that puzzles can only be solved in specific acts inside the game. You might already have all the components, but you cannot get past that hurdle until the dialog option opens. Apart from that, they are not too far fetched. That is, if you assume characters are telepathic or something.\nThe story is OK, although I do not particularly agree on how it is split.\nI am sure that those that Kickstarted the game like things like appearing in the phone book. As a non backer, I have mixed feelings about that. I feel it pads the game with unnecessary and distracting info. The worst idea is that you more or less need to watch an early video at the Kickstarter page in order to know how to solve a puzzle.\nI hope this review tells you which kind of game you are getting into. I was disconnected from the characters during most of the game, thus not really wanting to see what is next.

Put it this way- I got really stuck twice and in the end I was literally over thinking it both times. That's refreshing from a genre where more often than not you could rip hair out over-thinking and still not come to grips with what the game wanted. Not in this game. It's intuitive and I think I got held up or stuck when I treated it like adventure games past, only to realize I skipped an obvious or simple approach and find that was the solution. \nThe characters and story intertwined beautifully both as an epic journey and as a puzzle solving team.

I both enjoyed this game and was deeply annoyed with it the entire time I was playing.  I wish there was a third option between thumbs up and thumbs down.  Maybe a shrug.\n\nThe good:\n-The puzzles! There are some really excellent puzzles in this game that require a bit of lateral thinking, but even when I was stuck the solution never felt unfair.  For the most part the game lets you figure out the solutions without too many hints, which is refreshing.  \n-Multiple playable characters.  The townsfolk react differently to different people, which is fun and adds an extra dimension to the puzzle solving.  It's also fairly easy to  move between different locations, so haiving the wrong person in the wrong screen isn't really a problem.\n-The art and animations are really well done\n\nThe bad:\n-The writing is a mixed bag.  The constant in-jokes and fourth wall breaking are really heavy handed - it's a steady stream of \"nudge-nudge wink-wink\" that gets to be obnoxious after an hour or so.  We get it.  We know who Ron Gilbert is, we know we're playing an adventure game (and if you don't, you aren't going to get the joke anyways).  I realise this is personal taste though and YMMV - if you love this sort of humour then you're in for a treat.\n-The \"plot twist\" is telegraphed from a mile away and is pretty cliche - it also makes the mysteries you've been trying to solve up until that point irrelevant, and the ending feels rushed.\n-The voice acting is wildly uneven.  I ended up turning it off and cranking up the text speed. \n\nIf you love old-school adventure games and have played every game in the LucasArts catalogue multiple times, you've probably already bought the game.

The backgrounds in particular look really nice. Overall, the graphics looks like a LucasArts adventure game made today if they were completely oblivious to the introduction of 3D graphics and high resolution monitors. In other words, it's how graphics should have evolved.\n[*]Since it was a low budget game, I expected the duration to be short, but it ended up being fairly lengthy.\n[*]Though I don't think it comes close to games like Monkey Island 2 and Day of the Tentacle, the dialogue is pretty well written. What drags it down is an unnecessary barrage of references, and some character quirks which become tiring after 5 minutes. *bleep*-a-reno indeed.\n[*]Verbs! Dialogue trees! Inventory with tons of items to pick up! It's extremely old-school mechnically but works very well. A reminder that a lot of modern adventures have gone a bit too far with streamlining and simplifying the genre.[/list]\n\nCons:\n[list][*]Story has an intriguing start, but the direction it goes in feels very arbitrary and the ending especially is very lackluster.\n[*]Not many interesting characters, and the playable characters in particular feel very one-sided and uninteresting. Please don't let make me play as that *beeping* clown again.\n[*]The act structure works against the game. The entire game takes place in the same area but the game arbitrarily denies you access to certain rooms until you hit certain story points, so many puzzles you can only half-way finish until you finish up other puzzles first (and it's not always apparent which sequence of puzzles the game wants you to work towards). The structure feels like a weird mix of Maniac Mansion and Monkey Island 1 when it should have gone all in with one of the styles.\n[*]The multiple playable characters feel like an extremely underused feature. Most of the playable characters could have been removed with minimal effect on puzzles, dialogue, and story. Especially the clown. Oh, why is the clown there. Just please let me buy some DLC which removes the clown from the game.[/list]\n\nDespite the many flaws I enjoyed the game overall, and I hope the developer continues making more adventure games.

El asesinato en cuesti\u00f3n queda relegado a un segundo plano con una rapidez tremenda, y el aut\u00e9ntico misterio pasa a ser la f\u00e1brica de almohadas, abandonada tras la reciente muerte del respetado magnate de la industria almohad\u00edstica local.\n\nThimbleweed Park es pr\u00e1cticamente una aventura antigua adaptada a tiempos modernos. Volvemos, c\u00f3mo no, a la interfaz SCUMM, considerada un retraso ortop\u00e9dico por unos y una reliquia siempre bienvenida por otros (entre los que me incluyo), pero con algunos retoques; haciendo click derecho sobre un objeto siempre se elegir\u00e1 la opci\u00f3n m\u00e1s l\u00f3gica (pero no necesariamente correcta) y las diferentes acciones tienen atajos de teclado personalizables. \n\nVolvemos a esos puzles de probar a usar las decenas de objetos de tu inventario, pero con un nivel de l\u00f3gica lunar mucho menor. Los puzles en Thimbleweed Park son bastante l\u00f3gicos. Relativamente. Desde luego no son el bigote de Gabriel Knight 3. El dise\u00f1o del juego es bastante abierto, y hay muchos puzles que se pueden resolver al principio del juego, o pr\u00e1cticamente al final del mismo. Las primeras horas son bastante directas, hasta que desbloqueas a todos los personajes jugables y las posibilidades y combinaciones se disparan. De las 19 horas que necesit\u00e9 para pasarme el juego, aproximadamente 5 son de quedarme trabado. Pero no hay nada que digas \u201cesto necesita gu\u00eda s\u00ed o s\u00ed\u201d. No hay que usar monos como llave inglesa.\n\nEn esta investigaci\u00f3n, adem\u00e1s de a los dos agentes, podremos controlar a otros tres personajes: Delores (literalmente una versi\u00f3n joven de Ron Gilbert pasada por la regla 63), Ransome (un payaso malhablado cuyo show consiste en insultar al p\u00fablico) y Franklin (el cobardica padre de Delores, que quiere usar la f\u00e1brica de almohadas para abrir una l\u00ednea de ositos de peluche). El principal objetivo de todos estos personajes, por un motivo u otro, es entrar en la f\u00e1brica de almohadas. Y aqu\u00ed es donde viene uno de los defectos del juego: no hay suficiente interacci\u00f3n narrativa entre los personajes. Salvo por Delores y Franklin, el resto de personajes no se conocen de nada, y el juego requiere constantemente intercambiar objetos entre ellos, o usar a varios para resolver un puzle \u00fanico. M\u00e1s que un grupo con un objetivo com\u00fan es un grupo de individuos resolviendo cachos de puzles relacionados cada uno por su cuenta. \u00bfEs una queja muy autista? Quiz\u00e1s. Pero siento que con simplemente a\u00f1adir algunos di\u00e1logos se hubiera podido justificar mejor la interacci\u00f3n entre el quinteto.\n\nDurante una de las sesiones de brainstorming de Maniac Mansion, a Gary Winnick y Ron Gilbert se les ocurri\u00f3 un puzle que utilizase uno de los anillos aislantes que provocaron la tragedia del Challenger. Decidieron no incluirlo por ser \u201ctoo soon\u201d. Treinta a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s, Thimbleweed Park incluye un chiste sobre dicho anillo. Y uno de los personajes dice que es \u201ctoo soon\u201d. Porque Thimbleweed Park ocurre en 1987.\n\nCreo que esto es un microcosmos de lo que ofrece el juego. Thimbleweed Park puede parecer una amalgama de referencias a aventuras gr\u00e1ficas sin ton ni son, pero hay algo m\u00e1s; tiene un claro car\u00e1cter autobiogr\u00e1fico. Es un juego que se disfruta especialmente si se conoce a Ron Gilbert, sus juegos, su forma de ser y su forma de ver y vivir la industria del videojuego.\n\nDecir que el juego tiene alguna que otro gui\u00f1o ser\u00eda quedarse cort\u00edsimo. El juego funciona en un extra\u00f1o nivel de meta-continuidad con respecto a Maniac Mansion: Dave y Sandy son personajes interactuables, Bernard aparece mencionado y hasta Chuck, la planta, hace aparici\u00f3n en una mansi\u00f3n an\u00e1loga a la del juego cl\u00e1sico. Hay referencias a Maniac Mansion, Zak Mckracken y Monkey Island a lo largo de todo el juego, hasta el punto en el que a mucha gente le resultar\u00e1n m\u00e1s molestas que otra cosa. Si tu tolerancia al humor autorreferencial tiende a nula, este juego no es para ti.\n\nSi este tipo de humor no te molesta, es muy f\u00e1cil recomendar Thimbleweed Park. Si bien la recta final es muy divisiva (como lo fue en su \u00e9poca la de Monkey Island 2), el viaje para llegar hasta ella es uno que merece la pena recorrer. Es honestamente todo lo que se podr\u00eda pedir del concepto de \u201caventura gr\u00e1fica cl\u00e1sica\u201d. \n\nBueno, no.

No mega-monkey excrement here.\n\nThe first 30 minutes are absolutely turgid with callbacks and in-jokes, and one'd be forgiven to think it's gonna stay on that level. They do tone it down.\n\nOn the Lucaslike sliding scale it's much closer to Maniac Mansion than Day of the Tentacle in about every respect, and that's a YMMV good thing. The soundtrack is maybe the single most notable part to clash with the package: It does the job, but it's basically a slow bass guitar riff all the way and there's nothing you're gonna remember in there. VA is prett-ty good, but it seems to divide opinions - but Reyes has a really cute accent. At first I was thinking about turning the VA off entirely and just taking in the text, but the whole thing grew on me.\n\nYou probably either hate or love the ending.

island, though it was maybe slightly less engaging than the latter which is a shame since the first two monkey island games were pure magic. that said, this game really does capture old school adventure games perfectly, down to the sometimes maddenly random puzzles that are more arbitrarily mashing items together vs actual puzzles. i love how the kickstarters are integrated into the game (through the library, phone book, and ranom's swear jar), the graphics are great, the world is beautiful, the humor is good...that said, i don't like playing 5 characters, at times it felt cumbersome. some clearly have skillets that are necessary, but i would've preferred to have one character that i maintained an emotional attachment to and just run with them for 10 hours.  i'm curious to see the differences between hard and easy mode (i played on hard) just since that was never an option in the past though i can see it being a cool way for people who are first getting into the genre. i will say i thought the ending was both cool and kind of eh though, which i know is a contradiction but somehow it managed to both get me back into the game but also feel like a cop-out. just go with me on this one. \n\n\n\nso yeah, if you loved lucasarts and sierra games, you're gonna like this. is it the second coming of monkey island? sadly no, but that's not a bad thing, it's it's own thing and

This Review is for Casual Mode\nI remember when Thimbleweed Park was first announced several years ago, when all we had was a simple concept art of Agent Ray and Reyes. And now look at the masterpiece this game has become..\n\nThimbleweed Park is game that has two mysteries in one: figuring out a murder mystery and solving the mystery of the Pillow Factory Fire that occured before the events of the game. \n\nRon Gilbert and Gary Winnick have done an amazing job with immersing players into the decrepit and spooky town of Thimbleweed Park. Oftentimes, I find myself getting the chills looking at the run down buildings. The graphics fit the game perfectly.\n\nThe soundtrack of Thimbleweed Park is also memorable. I find myself humming the game's theme song. The sound effects like opening and closing doors, hearing footsteps, and even the ambient environment noises like the wind blowing in the distance, crickets chirping at night, or a fire hydrant splashing water really add to environment, further immersing players into this world.\n\nWhat really drives Thimbleweed Park foward are the characters. Agent Reyes and Agent Ray share a unique relationship with each other. Neither one trusts the other, but they choose to work together. Delores is the perfect programmer/nerd girl with a passion for following her dreams. Ransome the Clown is obnoxious and full of sarcastic remarks. Franklin the Ghost is depressing, but also adds an entire layer of puzzle solving an already amazing adventure game.\n\nThe gameplay in Thimbleweed Park takes a step back from modern adventure games and lets you do all the work in figuring out what to do in your environment. Playing this game makes me realize just how much modern adventure games hold our hands and silo us down a typical path. One of the things that I love is being able to test and experiment around with different commands. This usually pays off in very interesting or unexpected results. I found myself stuck in the game multiple times only to do something weird and solve the puzzle! I feel like a lot of the puzzles in this game are either predictably logical, or they require you to think about it from a different perspective to figure out. I was never stuck for too long, and having that \"Ah ha!\" moment was always worth it. I was able to finish Casual Mode in 12 hours. \n\nPerhaps one of the things that I enjoyed the most about Thimbleweed Park was the immersion itself. Never did I feel impatient on wanting to progress the plot further. Sometimes, I would just sit in the cafe and take in the welcoming environment. Other times, I would sit in the Edmund library and just peruse the tons of books that the game has to offer. There's just so much in this tiny world worth exploring, that I never felt bored expecting something more to do. Even as something as little as revisitng areas to look for collectable specks of dust. Yes! Specks of dust!\n\nGripes. There were a few things that did make Thimbleweed Park frustrating to play. Thankfully, there wasn't too much, but I do need to address them:\n\n- Some characters in the game share task lists. This isn't a problem, but if you have multiple playable characters, it can be annoying having to make sure both characters meet up to give each other items. It immediately reminded me of Gilbert's The Cave game, where characters had to constantly backtrack to give each other items. The map item resolves problem pretty fast.\n\n- At some points in the game, I found that the Part I was in prevented certain tasks from being completed. For example, Franklin's task list had goals that he needed to accomplish, but I had to wait until I was in a later part of the story to accomplish that specific task. Don't include the task in that part of the story until it's needed. It would have saved me a lot of time! \n\n- I found it quite strange that playable characters couldn't communicate with each other. If Agent Reyes and Agent Rey are in the same room, why can't there be some conversation topics that they can share between themselves? Even if it doesn't necessarily pertain to the plot. Another example of this is when Agent Rey goes to the Edmund Mansion to speak to Delores, but Delores dismisses her. Agent Rey never has a future conversation with Delores. I know that these characters are all on their own storylines, but the only real cohesion between them was at the very end of the game. Maybe this was on purpose? Perhaps we are supposed to feel this disconnect between the characters, because they are all operating on selfish gains? And the very end of the game causes all of them to work together? I don't know. I can't really peg this as a gripe -- maybe I was just expecting something else. \n\nOverall, Thimbleweed Park was a joy to play. Playing the game felt like I was binging a Netflix show. Ron Gilbert did a fantastic job grabbing players into this world and holding them tight in figuring out the mysteries. Even after finishing the game, I still find myself excited to go back and play the Hard Mode, ready to check out all the puzzles and different locations I missed from my first playthrough. \n\nI highly reccomend this game to people that love adventure games; you are in for a welcoming and truly wonderful treat.", "timestamp_created": 1491437854, "timestamp_updated": 1491495052, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30970591": {"recommendationid": "30970591", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980672613", "num_games_owned": 149, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511485563}, "language": "french", "review": "Un tr\u00e8s bon point and click, qui rappelera pas mal de souvenir aux plus nostalgique de l'\u00e9poque des jeux lucasarts tel monkey island, day of the tentacle etc .....", "timestamp_created": 1491437163, "timestamp_updated": 1491437163, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30970437": {"recommendationid": "30970437", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071929839", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1308, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505754102}, "language": "english", "review": "Get it if you are old school and love real adventure games.

It was funded on Kickstarter in 2014 and raised around $626,000, resulting in the game not only being funded but also reaching a number of stretch goals including voice acting and mobile ports.\nI backed this game on Kickstarter and recieved a Steam key when the game launched.\n \n[h1]Premise[/h1]\nThe game takes place in 1987 in a small town called Thimbleweed Park. There, a body was found and two FBI agents - Angela Ray and Junior Agent Antonio Reyes - are dispatched to investigate the murder. However, not only does the Sheriff try to prevent them from solving the case, they also find out that some strange things are happening in Thimbleweed Park...\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\nThimbleweed Park features a style similar to the ones seen in older [strike]LucasArts[/strike] MmucasFlemm games. But, instead of relying on \"soft\" edges like in Monkey Island 2, the art is crisp and detailed, utilizing an neat color palette across the various areas of the game. Some areas even make use of parallax scrolling, emulating \"depth\" where none exist.\nThe level of detail seen in the background art is quite fantastic. Many signs across town are actually legible, individual leaves are visible, fireflies are buzzing around, tufts of grass are moving in the wind, broken lights are flickering...the list goes on.\nThe characters are even more resemblant of Maniac Mansion than the backgrounds, mainly because their heads are larger than one would expect, allowing for neat facial expressions despite the technically \"low\" resolution of the character sprites. As a little extra, there's even some form of dynamic lighting being applied to the character sprites, making them seem more \"in place\" when walking past lights.\n\nOverall, I can't find anything wrong with the visuals, although the big-headed characters might be off-putting to some people.\n\n\n[h1]Sound[/h1]\nHonestly, I didn't have any expectations when it came to sound. In fact, I completely forgot that the game recieved voice acting, which was a nice surprise when I started playing.\nThe music fits the theme of the game very well, being reminiscent of film noir - dark, slow and moody.\nThimbleweed Park also utilizes quite a few ambient sounds, including but not limited to wind rustling, grills chirping, dogs barking and so on. None of it ever seemed out of place.\nAnd while the voice actors overall do a great job, I'm not entirely satisfied with the audio quality. I assume it's deliberate, but the voice acting sounds like it's played back from a cassette tape - one that has been used quite a bit. The audio is not \"slurring\" but the heights aren't as crisp as they could/should be. Again, it might be deliberate but I'm not too fond of it.\n\n[h1]Writing[/h1]\nThe game is able to keep the tension while at the same time being pretty much littered with dry jokes that very much remind me of Gilberts and Winnicks previous works. It made me laugh out loud several times - now, that may seem like a pointless thing to mention but it's actually quite difficult for games to make me laugh.\nThimbleweed Park also drops quite a few references, not only about older LucasArts games but about adventure game tropes in general. It doesn't take itself too seriously which works very well.\nI don't want to go into much detail in order to avoid spoilers, but the story might be the only somewhat polarizing part of this game. But I did find it very enjoyable.\n\n[h1]Puzzles[/h1]\nPeople looking for a classic point and click adventure experience will enjoy this game. On \"hard mode\" (which is more like normal mode) the game requires you to think outside the box very often, but without relying on blatant moon logic. And there are loads of red herrings that you can pick up. You *will* get stuck on hard mode but you can do it. Try to not look up a walkthrough, okay?\nCasual mode is a very nice addition. In that mode, roughly half of the puzzles in the game are pretty much skipped, allowing beginners to enjoy the story and get through the game without getting stuck too often. A great way to make the game more accessible without compromising the original experience.\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\nA very good, super entertaining point and click adventure game that oozes charm and features a tremendous amount of puzzles, hilarious dialogue, diverse areas as well as likable and fun characters. The only drawbacks are (possibly deliberate) voice quality issues, some slightly unbalanced puzzles and a few questionable story decisions.\n\n[b]8/10[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1491432267, "timestamp_updated": 1491432282, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502463", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30969488": {"recommendationid": "30969488", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999866270", "num_games_owned": 531, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 58, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490947225}, "language": "english", "review": "Your first five minutes:\n\nA statement about socialized health care and it's importance\nA statement eco-shaming people for throwing out trash\nA dissertation on how to make a game the 'right' way by eliminating deaths and dead ends.\n\nSeriously, if this is what Ron Gilbert has to turn to in order to voice his political and social opinions then I'm simply not interested.

Really important. Especially after #GG (what is that? I have no idea). An what is really an achievement? Likeable DIVERSE main characters! Without feeling artificial or forced. I COULD'NT BELIEVE IT A FIRST! They did it! Generally: Likeable characters with most of the time understandable, interesting, reasonable backgrounds and motives. Without being just stereotypes or trends. Or even if it happens and something seems a little bit stereotype'ish or trend'ish, even then it's likeable. Example: At the beginning of the Delores stroy. When Delores looks at her poster of Ada, and says that Ada is her role model, I was a bit like 'Uh, oh, here comes the SJW train... *chooo*\" [Even if there is nothing wrong or untrue or unbelievable about the facts, I dunno why, but I had this thought. It's about something in the past I guess.] Oh, how wrong I was! Delores turned out to be probably the character I liked most in the end. While I liked all of them. I love Mexicans!\n\n[b]+[/b] Great writing! [see above] Writing is funny, honest, sometimes self ironic, sometimes meta. I'm not too good in writing about writing. So, in general: writing is top notch!  \n\n[b]+[/b] 80s!! 80s music! (ok, one short radio song..., but still!) 80s games! Chapter names always with \"THE...\" at the beginng like in 'Stranger Things'. Eventually even an upside-down world thingy! (like in 'Stranger Things'!) Story takes places in the 1980s! Like in 'Stranger Things'! I love it!\n\n[b]+[/b] TRUE SCUMM'esque interface! With Retro options even! You can look at all the things! You can try to combine all the things! Sometimes it gives a funny hidden joke. However one tiny minor criticism: It behaves and feels and plays like with the classics and they really delivered it! But it is not as 100% consistent as with the LucasArts adventures. I at first was disappointed that I couldn't look at other person. In the olden times the main character then would tell me what he or she thinks or feels or discovers about another character. Like \"Look at Willie\"; \"This man looks like he had seen better times.\" Example. This is sadly *not* implemented. (NO, I DIDN'T READ THE RPS ARTICLE BEFORE!) Secondly I was a bit disappointed that my main characters could not talk to each other. It is a bit strange at the beginning or first half of the game when one main character is missing for short/some time and comes back and the other main character doesn't react in any way. However this is just nit-picking and some healthy scepticism I developed about recent Kickstarter adventures games. *cough* 2+ million $ *cough*. Ha! With more time into the game and finally having finished it on normal/hard mode, they really did a great job here. It definitely is a classic graphic adventure game! It definitely feels and play like a SCUMM game! Yes!\n\n[b]+[/b] 99% Great German translation by Boris \"Doc Bobo\" Schneider-Johne! I played my first playthrough with all Retro options, no voice, and German texts. Just like the first time I played Monkey Island when I was 8-10 yrs old or so.  It felt like the good old days! Some minor tiny mistakes I found like sometimes \"das\", where it has to be \"dass\", or missing comma etc. But I'm no grammar nazi. No, I'm really not. (NO!) Translation is great, witty and funny. However very small mistakes or 1-2 missing letters at end of words however stretch through the entire game. Really tiny and only if you look closely. When you think about that Boris did the whole translation for just 1 (one) USD, this translation is his best and gets a 11/10 from me!\n\n[b]+[/b] If you use no hints you can get 15-20 hours out of this game! I needed 22 hours. But I wanted to see everything, every line. Still haven't.\n\n[b]+[/b] For a classic adventure game it is all I ever wanted. Having played all the old adventures with walkthroughs (shame on me). This is the first real graphic adventure game I played through all by myself. It's perhaps only slightly easier than the old ones like Monkey Island. But never too easy or cheap. Clever good puzzles, with great difficulty. \n\n[b]Thimbleweed Park\u2122 is a love letter to the old classic graphic adventures and it really is one of its kind.\nVerdict: STRONGLY RECOMMENDED.[/b]\n\nPS: I'm a 75$ backer.

Por lo que este proyecto llevaba siguiendolo desde hace un largo tiempo. Para aquellos amantes de las aventuras gr\u00e1ficas este juego no decepciona nada, y su aspecto retro lo hace revalorizarse mucho m\u00e1s.\n\nEl juego se considera el sucesor espiritual de Maniac Mansi\u00f3n, aventura gr\u00e1fica en la que manejabamos 3 personajes (algunos con habilidades unicas) en una casa sin mucho movimiento de escenarios (a diferencia de otras aventuras gr\u00e1ficas donde vas avanzando la historia), este juego imita en parte al Maniac Mansi\u00f3n, desarrollandose en un peque\u00f1o pueblo y sus inmediaciones (aunque no tienes un acceso completo desde el principio y se va desbloqueando seg\u00fan avanzas).  \n\nLa historia comienza con un asesinato cerca de Thimbleweed Park, donde dos detectives (que recuerdan a Mulder y Scully de Expediente X), Reyes y Ray deben investigarlo, pero ambos esconden otras motivaciones que le llevan aquel pueblo.  El juego tiene un gran sentido del humor (no es un juego precisamente serio) y esta lleno de easter eggs relacionados con Maniac Mansion, Monkey Island y en menor medida indiana Jones y la \u00faltima cruzada.\n\nEl juego al igual que ocurrio con el monkey island 2 y 3, tiene dos modos, uno sencillo y otro dificil donde los puzzles son mucho m\u00e1s sencillos, mi consejo personal es que jugueis mejor directamente el dificil ya que se van a ver muchas m\u00e1s cosas que simplemente el sencillo, si hay algun  momento que no avanzais podeis consultarme por privado o seguro que poco a poco ya habria videoguias en youtube.\n\nRecomendado para los amantes de las aventuras Gr\u00e1ficas.", "timestamp_created": 1491247927, "timestamp_updated": 1491247927, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30928740": {"recommendationid": "30928740", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043020289", "num_games_owned": 244, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1289, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492254555}, "language": "english", "review": "This is next to monley island 1&2 the best adventure game of all time.\nLove the music.\nLove the puzzels.\nLove the beutiful graphics.\n\nIf only i could play this on my Amiga 500+ with a Vampire 500 v2+ card id be in heaven.", "timestamp_created": 1491245526, "timestamp_updated": 1491245526, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498292", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30928681": {"recommendationid": "30928681", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987178952", "num_games_owned": 236, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 786, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491245265}, "language": "german", "review": "Ein wundervolles Spiel, viel liebe zum Detail, mit 13 Std. recht lang, am\u00fcsant und sehr originell", "timestamp_created": 1491245393, "timestamp_updated": 1491245393, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500998", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30928390": {"recommendationid": "30928390", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977597748", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1086, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491297679}, "language": "french", "review": "Vous avez aim\u00e9 les jeux d'aventures Monkey Island, Days of the tentacle et autres productions de LucasArt?\nSi oui, vous aimerez tout autant Thimbleweed Park!\nUne histoire originale et bien men\u00e9e qui vous embarquera pour un bon bout de temps.\nIl m 'aura fallut 18h pour le termniner sans trop buter sur des \"puzzles\".", "timestamp_created": 1491244439, "timestamp_updated": 1491244439, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30928350": {"recommendationid": "30928350", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004101165", "num_games_owned": 811, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 296, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491241656}, "language": "english", "review": "I'd like to recommend the game, but it has a LOT of usability issues that make playing the game a chore, and in it's current state it is diffucult for me to recommend it. Maybe if the devs spend enough time fixing these issues it's playable and I can change this review.\n\nThe devs really have spent too much time reminiscing about what was so good about the good old days, and too little learning about how modern point & clicks have evolved.\n\nHere's my long list of complaints, some of them bigger, some of them smaller, but the sheer number of them is the most worrying thing. Mostly they are usability issues, things making the game more clumsy and annoying to play, but there are a few issues with the game writing, voice acting, etc. as well.\n\nRoughly in order of most to least annoying:\n\n---\n\nIt feels like the game regularly fights against you, you know what you should be doing, but the game just refuses to acknowledge you're even trying the right thing. Then it turns out some really uninteresting detail to the player is the key to progressing.\n\nSeriously, this is bad. The *ESC* key does not open the menu. Ctrl+O does. This has to be a bad, sick joke. Right? Ha ha, april fools is gone. Fix this. Now.\n\nThe game depends on you retrying the same thing multiple times - INCREDIBLY bad adventure game design.\n\nYou have to open each and every drawer separately, to the point where you just repeatedly hear \"Nothing.\" and go on autopilot, and fail to notice that some of them actually had contents in them.\n\nAll machines supposedly have a speech interface (you can TALK to them), except the only one you really want to use. It doesn't seem to be possible to use the machine until you need it, even though you can find it, and only after you need it can you activate it using the USE verb.\n\nThe game seems to make jokes about pixel hunting by having \"specks of dust\" littered around, and then uses pixel hunting as an actual necessary mechanic.\n\nAt one point you have to go through *10* identical scenes in order to find the one with the thing you need. There is no reason given for this, or any hint as to where you might find your thing, or even a reason for you to go searching, you just have to do it to progress.\n\nMost of the time the characters are not dumb enough to e.g. require you to USE stairs, you just walk to them, but there is *ONE* exception where the game requires you to use the USE verb at the bottom of the stairs to climb them. You aren't even required to activate the verb to get back down. These are not the first stairs you encounter.\n\nThere are regularly sound volume issues, some sounds are very loud, sometimes they play really quiet.\n\nThere are multiple long winded scenes that seem to have been made just to waste your time. Long sections of manual walking with exactly NOTHING to interact with or anything to see. It's like the devs just had a brainstorming session about how to waste the most player's time.\n\nThe game backseat games itself with \"I should really be ...\" -timed dialog lines, worst of all it's done when the player is not stuck. Quickly becomes incredibly irritating.\n\nCharacters regularly interrupt each other and themselves with timed dialog lines. You try to click on something and the text + speech gets cancelled by something you really don't care at all about.\n\nThe default action for interacting with items is often intuitively \"wrong\", not what you'd expect or want to do.\n\nYou have to remember various things people say or you read to pick the correct choice in dialog trees, OR you might even have to just guess them (codes, model numbers, teen slang, ...).\n\nThe journal (notebook) system is confusing - different people's notebooks have mostly identical content, but some of it is different so you always have to check what everyone wrote in their notebook, and sometimes the UI controls for them are different. Things not being said or done appear only in the notebook.\n\nSometimes there are timed animations, e.g. a few moments after exiting an elevator the doors close. During this animation the game stops responding to your controls and even hides the cursor.\n\nInteractable things regularly get hidden behind foreground graphics, there can literally be a door behind a giant pillar blocking your view.\n\nVerbs sometimes just deactivate if you don't use them quickly enough.\n\nThe area edges are poorly highlighted on the cursor, easy to miss the highlight completely when moving the cursor slightly past the edge.\n\nThe characters regularly walk the wrong way and have other odd path finding issues when you're just walking on a straight line. They often complain \"I can't reach that\" when trying to click on an exit.\n\nThe game is made in a retro style, which is cool, but in many parts they've made it \"worse than retro\". E.g. even back in the early 90s the point & click games with lots of verbs had keyboard shortcuts to activate them so it wouldn't be so clumsy, Thimbleweed Park does not. You have to click on the verb every time you want to do something, which is really annoying to an adventure game veteran like myself for whom pressing P for pickup is in the backbone.\n\nWith text + voice enabled, the dialog often continues unexpectedly - you first see a few words, and when you hear the guy finishing on that you click on the next thing but he surprisingly had more things to say. More text fits on screen, so it could've been there, or they could have a \"...\" indicator or something for when they are going to continue.\n\nText in dialog mode doesn't wrap when it reaches the edge of the screen, but scrolls horizontally when you hover over it. I'd of course want to see all of the text at once.\n\nSome of the few keyboard shortcuts the game does have stop working if you have caps-lock on, even the one on the \".\"-key.\n\nIt seems the writing sometimes contradicts itself, e.g. a guy mentions 3 machines, and then speaks of \"the 4 machines\", or a salesperson asking for a \"2 character code\" for a part, and then you find a 3 character code for a part of that type.\n\nA good modern point & click should have an easy key to highlight all interactable items on screen.\n\nScroll-wheel doesn't work for browsing through the inventory.\n\nSometimes the voice actors read the text you click on in dialog mode, other times they don't. It's inconsistent.\n\nOne of your characters (an agent) keeps telling everyone to not leave town for no reason, which seems odd.\n\nThe voice acting seems clumsy at times, and the voice directing is off - often the voice acting just doesn't seem to fit the intent of the lines.\n\nThe GIVE -verb does not recognize every person as a possible target.", "timestamp_created": 1491244325, "timestamp_updated": 1491244325, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.336054", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30928315": {"recommendationid": "30928315", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009575730", "num_games_owned": 271, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1332, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506707319}, "language": "english", "review": "*Beep*ing brilliant game!

Ron Gilbert ha creado un t\u00edtulo con olor a a\u00f1ejo que se convertir\u00e1 por m\u00e9ritos propios en un cl\u00e1sico atemporal inmediato tanto si eres un aventurero experto como si eres un reci\u00e9n llegado. Si el juego hubiera salido en 1988 en vez de 2017, a d\u00eda de hoy se le considerar\u00eda uno de los grandes de las aventuras gr\u00e1ficas igualmente.\n\nPorque una de las mayores virtudes con las que ha dotado este genio de los videojuegos a este pueblo de nombre impronunciable de 80 habitantes es que dejar\u00e1 satisfecho tanto a los nost\u00e1lgicos que disfrutaron en su d\u00eda de Maniac Mansion o Monkey Island, como a aquellos que no tuvieron la suerte de poderlo disfrutar en su d\u00eda, cuando las aventuras gr\u00e1ficas eran la punta de lanza en los juegos de PC.\n\nCasi todo en este juego raya a un grand\u00edsimo nivel. Su argumento, sus puzles, su aspecto gr\u00e1fico, su doblaje, su m\u00fasica o su humor est\u00e1 a un nivel alt\u00edsimo. Desde el comienzo de la aventura se despertar\u00e1 nuestro inter\u00e9s y no decaer\u00e1 hasta el final de los cr\u00e9ditos.\n\nAdem\u00e1s, todo est\u00e1 en su justa medida. El juego tiene gran cantidad de cameos con otros juegos de Ron Gilbert, como Maniac Mansion o Monkey Island, o con el mundillo de las aventuras gr\u00e1ficas en general, pero no abusa de ello. Tiene la virtud de ofrecer siempre la justa medida de las cosas y siempre arrancar una sonrisa en el jugador, sin abusar y sin quedarse corto, y eso aunque parezca f\u00e1cil es todo un m\u00e9rito. Realmente creeremos estar jugando a una aventura gr\u00e1fica desarrollada en los a\u00f1os 80.\n\nEn el juego, sin spoilers, nuestro papel ser\u00e1 investigar un asesinato que se ha producido en un pueblucho de apenas 80 habitantes. Para ello tomaremos el control de dos agentes federales, cada uno con sus propios intereses como ya nos advierten desde el primer momento en su diario. \u00bfCu\u00e1les? Eso no lo sabemos, y es la gracia del asunto. O parte de ella m\u00e1s concretamente.\n\nCon posterioridad tendremos que controlar hasta un total de 5 personajes, y ah\u00ed todo se complica. Multitud de objetos, situaciones, y personalidades que har\u00e1n que tengamos que escoger a uno u otro personaje para poder seguir avanzando en la historia e ir descubriendo los secretos que esconde cada uno de los lugares y personajes de esta aventura.\n\nLamentablemente, este punto de aventura coral es algo que no se ha ejecutado correctamente desde un punto de vista argumentativo, y muy probablemente sea el \u00fanico fallo del juego. \n\nVer\u00e1s, durante la aventura tendremos que compartir objetos entre los personajes, pero algunos personajes no se conocen de nada y no han hablado nunca entre ellos y, sin embargo, se ofrecen entre ellos los objetos de su inventario sin ning\u00fan tipo de problema. A nivel argumentativo es un fallo bastante grande, y le resta cierta credibilidad o consistencia a la historia general y el devenir de la aventura.\n\nM\u00e1s a\u00fan, algunos personajes no se llevan nada bien entre ellos, y no tienen problemas en regalarse objetos unos a otros. Esto resulta algo bastante artificial y poco natural. Hubiera sido muy f\u00e1cil solucionar este punto con un par de l\u00edneas en la que acordaran  colaborar unos con otros en pos de un objetivo com\u00fan. Pero no, esto no pasa. Y en algunos momentos provoca situaciones un tanto chocantes y poco cre\u00edbles.\n\nEsta inconsistencia tambi\u00e9n afecta directamente a la resoluci\u00f3n de algunos puzles, muchos de ellos de hecho. Por ejemplo, sin spoiler, un personaje descubre un n\u00famero de tel\u00e9fono en un sitio al que solo \u00e9l puede acceder, y luego tendr\u00e1s que seleccionar a otro que est\u00e1 en otra punta del mapa para que marque ese n\u00famero de tel\u00e9fono. Pero era imposible que lo supiera.\n\nEn cierta manera, y desde un punto de vista argumentativo, esto es totalmente rid\u00edculo. Ya que ese personaje no pod\u00eda saber esa informaci\u00f3n bajo ning\u00fan concepto. Y eso hace que aunque los puzles est\u00e9n muy bien ideados, algunas veces se le vean las costuras porque no est\u00e1n argumentativamente bien planteados. Es cierto que al final del juego podemos encontrar una cierta \"l\u00f3gica\" a esto, pero a\u00fan as\u00ed es algo que podr\u00eda haberse solucionado de una manera m\u00e1s elegante con un planteamiento argumentativo m\u00e1s comprometido con la resoluci\u00f3n de puzles.\n\nSin embargo, estos son los \u00fanicos puntos negativos del juego, el resto es realmente genial. Es una aventura gr\u00e1fica bastante dura, en modo d\u00edficil, y avanzar ser\u00e1 un \"suplicio\" a partir de un momento determinado de la aventura. Lo bueno es que estos puzles no son incoherentes, aunque alguno de ellos sean algo rebuscados, pero siempre l\u00f3gicos.\n\nThimbleweed Park es una aventura que vale cada c\u00e9ntimo que gastes en ella. Es un juego redondo, con una grand\u00edsima calidad que te har\u00e1 disfrutar cada una de las muchas horas que inviertas en \u00e9l, y con total seguridad no te drefraudar\u00e1 en absoluto.

I was mistaken. I have just finished the game. I have just spent 14 hours or so finishing this thing and I really don't know why I did it. It felt annoying after the first hour. Here's a brief list of pros and cons:\n\nPros\nNostalgia satisfaction\nSometimes clever references\nSome of the art\n\nCONS\nThe Story - The story is disjointed, makes little sense, is intertwined in a nonsensical way, and is ultimately uninteresting. There is no real connection between the characters, nothing that really drives them at least (except for a ghost and his daughter), yet they are all working towards the same goal through you. Some of this is explained at the end, but by the time you reach the end, you will no longer be interested in the story at all. Throughout the game I kept asking myself why I was playing this. What is the point? What is the goal of the game? You only find out what the point is in the last five minutes of gameplay making the entirety of the game rely on a feeling of nostalgia and a hope that, somehow, Ron Gilbert MUST have come up with something better than this and, perhaps, if you keep digging deeper you will find it.\n\nIn other adventure games you would at least have a sense of what the goal was, of what you were trying to achieve. For example, Guybrush Threepwood wants to become a pirate and later rescue Elaine; Indiana Jones wants to stop the Nazis from getting to Atlantis; Bernard, Hoagie and Loraine want to stop Purple Tentacle from taking over the world; Even Dave and the other two tuna heads want to rescue Sandy in Maniac Mansion. Thimbleweed Park, however, has no drive.\n\nFurthermore, the ending is extremely disappointing. There is no resolution and is exclusively meta.\n\nThe Characters - The characters are flat. They have two-dimensional motivations. One of them is entirely propelled by expletives. There is no endearing character, no relatable one.\n\nI don't know... I'll leave it here.

It's been a very long time since I played the classic LucasArts like Monkey Island, Indiana Jones, Day of the Tentacle etc... But what I've kept from these after all these years was the humor, the atmosphere, the consistency of the story. In TWP I've only smiled a few times, was rarely really pleasantly surprised at a situation, rarely thought that one puzzle or another was actually wicked. There's a lot of foul language that IMHO shouldn't have been used (\"crap\" and \"dick\", for instance, aren't words I expect to be hearing, and the *beep*ing for the even fouler phrases doesn't really help). The characters are rather bland -- it's actually really disappointing that, even though you can control up to 5 characters, in most cases most of them react exactly the same way to similar situations, have the same conversation lines, etc. Makes you wonder why they give you this many, also because the stories behind each character (and the role they play in the game) are rather weak and feel unfinished. I've fallen in love with Guybrush Threepwood, or even with the hamster in DotT, but none of the characters in TWP have given me that feeling. Honestly, the best moments in this game were when stumbling across one of the ((too?) many) references to one of the olden games, and the memories these brought back (\"I'm selling these fine leather jackets\" :-D must've missed the three-headed monkey though!). But there's nothing of the sort I will remember from TWP.

If you enjoy puzzles, weird, secretive towns, and/or old-school adventure games, I would definitely recommend it. \n\nIt was fun exploring the little town of Thimbleweed and learning what happened to put it in its current state. The apparent conspiracy going on also kept me interested throughout my playthrough. I wondered what was going on with the \"signals\" mentioned by the Pigeon Sisters and others. \n\n[b]Here's a short look. I don't think there are any open spoilers below really, but proceed with caution? [/b]\n\n[b] Pros:[/b] \n-Fun puzzles, just challenging enough, not too nonsensical.\n-An interesting setting and premise. \n-Likeable characters (even Ransome, at least it was fun playing him). \n-Great soundtrack and nice, retro graphics. \n-Entertaining jokes. \n-I left feeling sad that my time with the main characters had ended.\n\n[b]Cons:[/b] \n-Many NPCs seem flat (har har) and static not providing much interaction. \n-The ending may be disappointing or unsatisfying to some. \n-There are also plot inconsistencies via comments made by characters that I noticed. I won't mention them here, because they were kind of frustrating when I was trying to get into the game. If you don't notice them, that's for the best. They were minor things, but still. \n\nAlright, here's the essay I accidentally wrote:\n\nI was really looking forward to this, and my playthrough just revealed so much untapped potential. It felt very flat in some ways, like my interactions with NPCs seemed to be lacking depth. I know you have to carefully consider what lines you want characters to say because they have to be recorded, but... I would have loved to seen more. More from Madam Morena, who barely seemed to feature at all. More from the Pizza guy (Chet, I think?)\n\nMaybe I'm just being greedy. I did love the little touches, and most of the jokes, the call-backs. There were moments that made me laugh pretty hard. Think [spoiler] Franklin trying to be \"hip.\" [/spoiler]\n\nI went in with high expectations, but I also went in wanting to love this game with every fibre of my being. I watched the process of it being made and just knew it was going to be something special. And it is. It's definitely unusual. \n\nBut like others have said, I felt the ending was a cop-out. Maybe that's in the tradition of similar mystery/sci-fi/x-files-esque media? Just like Twin Peaks, really.\n\nHonestly, I almost wish you had been able to choose one character at the beginning and then stick with them. Or at least talk to the others. I wanted to see Delores interact with the agents, Ransom, etc., which never really happened. \n\nThinking about it, I just wish the game would developed the conspiracies a little better. I know there are only so many avenues you can take with a plot like this, but by the end it hardly seemed like Ray and Reyes, the original characters from the Kickstarter, mattered at all by the end. It almost seemed like two games spliced together. One with the agents, and one with Dolores where the agents are just vessels to move items around and help with puzzles. (Sorry, Reyes. I still love you.)\n\nEither way, I would play it again. I really hope it makes enough money for them to produce more and better games. The talent is there!

I did enjoy it.  It was more than long enough to justify the price.  It definitely felt like a good balance of oldschool mechanics and modern (superior) adventure game conventions.  Not particularly atmospheric in terms of graphics or music, but it more than gets the job done.  The characters were more interesting than I expected.\n\nBut there are problems here, particularly with the ending.  The ending breaks the fourth wall more dramatically than anything I can recall having seen before.  That's more or less fine, but it completely takes the place of a proper ending, which the game then, simply, lacks.  This is frustrating because, to make it that far, you have to really keep the goals and objectives of all five characters in mind and play to resolve them.  As a (somewhat spoiler-y) example, [spoiler]the only \"resolution\" which REALLY occurs is an arrest to wrap up the murder case the plot opens with.[/spoiler]  That occurs halfway through the game, and, just in case you happened to find at least that bit satisfying, the game eventually makes it clear that all you were really doing there was [spoiler]helping the villain frame the wrong guy.[/spoiler]  Further, it's possible (if not extremely likely) that you'll simply complete the game with the character who's most obviously making progress first, which will then cause the game to end without any resolution for the other four characters at all.  This seems fine at first -- the ending isn't entirely unpleasant -- but it sneaks up on you later.  \"Wait.  There was no ending, really.  It's like they just tried to ship the game on time by not making one, and just repurposed what was originally intended to be an easter egg to stand in for one.\"\n\nAside from that, there are things that the game does well.  It makes very good use of the \"multiple characters\" puzzle mechanic (even if it frequently does so despite there being NO WAY these characters could even be aware enough of each other's problems to work together in the first place).  It's often goofily funny, which, coming from me, is high praise indeed, because my sense of humor usually has different preferences.  Puzzle logic is thoroughly sensible, even in cases where the puzzles themselves are kinda not.  Making progress after being stuck for a bit feels really rewarding.\n\nAll in all, a good experience.  You will likely want to go back and play it again because you're annoyed with it -- an odd, mixed statement of praise, but praise nonetheless.", "timestamp_created": 1491154489, "timestamp_updated": 1491154489, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.721728", "comment_count": "9", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30906346": {"recommendationid": "30906346", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014545698", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 911, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491035649}, "language": "english", "review": "A lot of challenging puzzles and a (slightly) updated old-school adventure game.

For \u00a314.99 I would say it's worth the money (Unless I finish within the next hour). I went straight into hard mode and I would suggest this for anyone who has played through a point and click adventure game. Two hours in and I am finding the puzzles a little on the easy side so far. However, the team behind the gamedo usually have a good dificulty curve and without giving any spoilers the way the game is designed I can see how it will (hopefully) become much more difficult.\n\nIf you are new to adventure gaming, I would suggest playing Day of the Tentacle / Monkey Island first and here's why\n\nCons:\n\n- The games biggest downfall so far, it sells itself as not being a walking simulator, and i'm afraid so far that's how it can feel. I'm ploughing through puzzles but scenes such as the cemetary are stupidly long- winded and drawn out. Although you can double- click to run it does make my have to take a deep breath to continue playing it. Compared with Tentacle which is set in one area with scenes quickly accessible. I would worry that new comers might get bored of all the walking.\n\n- As mentioned, so far the puzzles haven't been as challenging as i'd hoped (so far!)\n\n- A minor gripe, a couple of the characters really grate on you after a while, you'll know who I mean when you play.\n\n- So far I haven't actually found it too funny.\n\nPros:\n\n- Great voice acting\n- Amazing visuals (mimics classic PaC's of the 80's/90's\n- Brilliant story which draws you in\n- HUGE scenes and levels which as mentioned above is both good and bad\n- Puzzles although simple so far, make sense and are smart. There's none of this 'Take the apple and mix it with the hair of a badger to make a stuffed toy' nonsense (not a real puzzle)\n\nThe pro's outweigh the cons for me, and you can tell straight away that a lot of love has gone into making the game. It's not easy to square up against monkey island or tentacle and this game manages it, falling short in only a couple of minor areas.\n\nI would recommend to anyone - 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1491131795, "timestamp_updated": 1491131795, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30898731": {"recommendationid": "30898731", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028008584", "num_games_owned": 425, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1177, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491237761}, "language": "english", "review": "After finishing the game, overall I would say the game was pretty good. Puzzles were nice, but I was hoping there would be a bit more humour in the game like in the Monkey Island. Although unlike in Monkey Island, I would say that every puzzle in the game made sense and the solution was reasonable. I liked the graphical art style, it really looked good, how there were some new stuff used for old style pixel art and the music was good as was the voice acting. I did also like the references to other games.\n\nI found it awesome that even the keyboard shortcuts for the commands were still there, like I remembered back in the days of old school point and clickers, such as q,w,e,a,s,d,z,x and c.\n\nStill though it is not a perfect game and here are some of the cons I had: \n[list]\n[*]Some huge issues for me were, the talks were unskippable, or at least I never found a key (which I figured would be esc), to skip any of the talks. Only in some minor parts you could skip cutscenes with esc-key. Talking the 6th time to same person and waiting for 20-30 seconds before you get into choosing dialogue is not something I really enjoyed.\n[*]Another thing which in my opinion should be in the game is actually support for mouse wheel. I can understand that maybe it was in a sense trying to mimic the old inventory system, but for real no mouse wheel support for scrolling inventory in 2017?\n[*]Third thing that I honestly wished the game didn't have is one puzzle that kind of requires you to do some pixel hunting. For myself I was kind of lucky that I actually accidentally spotted this, but I can honestly think there will be some people who will be stuck because of not having spotted this one item. A spoiler the item is:  [spoiler] Chainsaw [/spoiler] \n[*]And finally fourth issue I had was that I actually got into a situation where I had to load a save file because I did something and got into a dead end, where I couldn't finish the game, despite this being advertised so much in the game that you can never lock yourself up. Luckily a) I had a save file 1 hour back, and b) I could guess what one was suppose to do instead of being stuck forever. I sent a bug report to support for this issue, so hopefully it will be fixed. The bug/deadend was: [spoiler] At least with Delores while wearing the hat, you can give it away to at least Ken Thien, but only if you are actually wearing it. [/spoiler]\n[/list]\n\nStill overall I do think it is a great game even with the small quirks, and hopefully some patches will be made for example being able to skip some texts and maybe the less minor issue of no scroll wheel support.", "timestamp_created": 1491131794, "timestamp_updated": 1491135419, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503476", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30898724": {"recommendationid": "30898724", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117842459", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1085, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492355771}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Llevo m\u00e1s de hora jugando y me encanta. tiene un mont\u00f3n de gui\u00f1os a otras aventuras gr\u00e1ficas, chistes, di\u00e1logos que te hacen retroceder atr\u00e1s en el tiempo.

It is amazing. The story was the best I've seen in a game in a long time. This was mostly because of the characters. The characters were all really fleshed out and memorable. The puzzles were difficult but not over the top. There wasn't really any obscure puzzles (monkey island STILL LOVE) and pretty much doable if you really think about it. There is some pixel hunting sometimes but this was few and far between.  There is also two modes, easy and hard, so if your new to the point and click genre you can jump right in. I haven't played the easy mode yet because I wanted to get the full experience, so this review is coming from that stand point. Ron Gilbert and Gary Winnick  really produced something special and you should support them so they keep making amazing games.

Ich habe das spiel zwar vorab gebacked m\u00f6chte das endg\u00fcltige Produkt aber dennoch fair bewerten. \n\nIch bin mittlerweile in Kapitel 3 und die Story ist fesselnd genug um mich weiter an den Monitor zu fesseln. Die Qualit\u00e4t der Sprachaufnahmen entpsricht nicht unbedingt heutiger Technik, evtl. ist dies aber auch absicht um der retro-optik gerecht zu werden.. DIe Pixel-Optik ist meistens sehr sch\u00f6n, manche Sachen fallen aber wiederum etwas ab (wie z.b. die Landkarte, die deutlich gr\u00f6ber ist). Das ist aber kein Problem und man kann problemlos dr\u00fcber hinwegsehen, schlie\u00dflich macht ein Spiel mehr aus als nur die Grafik (Die retro-optik ist nat\u00fcrlich geschmackssache, sollte aber interessenten nicht abschrecken).\n\nIch spiele momentan auf schwer und finde die Schwierigkeit ok, es ist zu einfach, aber hat bisher auch keine extrem um die Ecke gedachten R\u00e4tsel. Sch\u00f6n ist, da\u00df die Welt gr\u00f6\u00dfer ist und die R\u00e4tsel sich nich nur ein auf einen kleinen Bereich beziehen (da w\u00fcrde ich z.b.als Vergleich (das dennoch sehr gute) deponia doomsday heranziehen, welches in neuen abschnitten das inventar immer wieder nullte) sondern sp\u00e4ter die komplette Stadt erkundbar ist. Trotzdem sind die R\u00e4tsel bisher sehr logisch und nachvollziehbar und es stellt sich immer wieder das Gl\u00fccksgef\u00fchl ein, wenn meine eine vermeintliche Kopfnuss doch noch geknackt. Auch scheint es f\u00fcr bestimmte Probleme verschiedene L\u00f6sungswege zu geben, da\u00df kann ich jedoch noch nicht 100prozentig best\u00e4tigen, da ich noch nicht zum 2. mal gespielt habe.  Story- und R\u00e4tseltechnisch gibt es also nichts zu meckern und befindet sich am gehobenem Niveau.\n\nNeben der Grafik wei\u00df vorallem der Sound zu gefallen. Ob z.b. die stimmungsvolle Er\u00f6ffnungsmusik (die mich irgendwie an Twin Peaks erinnert),  oder generelles sounddesign (wie z.b. die quietschenden Schuhe des Clowns) sind sher gut gemacht und machen  einen sehr wertigen Eindruck.\n\nIch kann nichts wirklich negatives \u00fcber das Spiel sagen, was mich wirklich st\u00f6ren w\u00fcrde. Die Anspielungen an alte Lucasarts-Klassiker war nat\u00fcrlich zu erwarten und ich finde sie gelungen, weil sie imo nicht die Geschichte oder Story bestimmen. Man muss sie nicht gespielt um das Spiel zu verstehen, es ist eigenst\u00e4ndig genug. Das Durchbrechen der 4. Wand gab es auch schon bei Monkey Island 2 z.b. (Telefon-Supporthotline, 20 \u20ac f\u00fcr ein Computerspiel, Das 'Ende'). \n\nMan hat manchmal an alten Spielen eine besonders tolle Erinnerung, die auch die Meinung dar\u00fcber beeinflusst. F\u00fcr micht ist Thimbleweed genau das alte Point'n Click Adventure der damaligen Zeit, was ich noch nicht gespielt habe. Man f\u00fchlt sich irgendwann heimelig und zur\u00fcck in seine Kindheit versetzt und genau das hatte ich mir erhofft. 20\u20ac sind hier super aufgehoben (auch wenn ich mehr bezahlt habe).", "timestamp_created": 1491063191, "timestamp_updated": 1491063313, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30880012": {"recommendationid": "30880012", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970584894", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 917, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492874380}, "language": "swedish", "review": "Riktigt bra Peka-klicka \u00e4ventyr precis som man minns det f\u00f6r 30 \u00e5r sedan :-) K\u00e4nns som att det h\u00e5ller fortfarande.

It doesn't entirely trade off the back of nostalgia, and there is enough new stuff here, and enough understanding of how to properly execute the old stuff, that there is plenty of value added.\n\nThere are a few places where the game is a little rough around the edges and there are a few things I could nitpick (like, the menu resolution should really be the same as the game resolution) but that is to be expected with such a small development team. Make no mistake, this game is however a masterpeice of the point-n-click genre and easily stands alongside the greats.\n\nI really feel like this game needs to be the first in a series, because it feels like a game that is just breaking the ice on something. I know a custom engine was built for the game, and I really hope the team use it in the future to produce more games. I'd be really interested to see what kind of gameplay mechanics and puzzles they can come up with from this starting point.\n\nHighly reccomended.", "timestamp_created": 1491061404, "timestamp_updated": 1491061404, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.414198", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30879208": {"recommendationid": "30879208", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961464258", "num_games_owned": 531, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 570, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491058336}, "language": "english", "review": "Utterly fantastic", "timestamp_created": 1491060886, "timestamp_updated": 1491060886, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30879107": {"recommendationid": "30879107", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972673983", "num_games_owned": 1102, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 1296, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491685547}, "language": "english", "review": "\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\n\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2588\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2588\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2588\u2591\u2588\u2591\u2584\u2580\u2591\u2588\u2580\u2580\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2580\u2588\u2580\u2591\u2588\u2591\u2588\u2591\u2588\u2591\u2588\u2580\u2580\u2591\u2588\u2591\n\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2588\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2588\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2588\u2591\u2588\u2580\u2584\u2591\u2591\u2588\u2580\u2580\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2588\u2591\u2591\u2588\u2580\u2588\u2591\u2588\u2591\u2580\u2580\u2588\u2591\u2580\u2591\n\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2580\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2591\u2580\u2591\u2580\u2591\u2591\u2580\u2591\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2580\u2591\u2591\u2580\u2591\u2580\u2591\u2580\u2591\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2591\u2580\u2591\n\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\n\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2584\u2584\n\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2588\u2591\u2591\u2588\n\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2588\u2591\u2591\u2588\n\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2588\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2588\n\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2588\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2588\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2584\u2584\u2588\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2584\n\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2588\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2588\n\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2588\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2588\n\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2588\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2588\n\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2588\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2588\n\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2588\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2588\n\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2588\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2580\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2580\u2580\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2580", "timestamp_created": 1491060591, "timestamp_updated": 1491060591, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.428571", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30878868": {"recommendationid": "30878868", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009614661", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1277, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491653564}, "language": "english", "review": "Tons of humour, and a lot of puzzle fun!

So you're forced to pick a verb and then click the object, for things that have an obvious action (which is most objects). A number of objects are packed close together and have small hitboxes, so this is even more aggravating when you have to pick a verb and then slightly miss the object, even on a 30\" screen.

It brought the game to a standstill and it was my least favorite puzzles so far.\n- While the game world is huge, it feels pretty empty. Most things in scenes cannot be clicked on; even just to give some humorous text (even generic, if VO cost was a concern). Coming from just playing the DOTT remake where almost everything responds to the player, this was a big letdown.\n- It references maniac mansion and other LucasArts games WAY too much. Wink wink lampshading is fine, but there is way too much of it.\n- It is WAY too easy so far. Not the good kind of easy; the bad kind of easy where puzzle solutions are spoiled, or are super obvious. Probably the result of too much playtesting/panicking (note: I am playing in hard mode; I can't even imagine what easy would be like..)\n- The music in some parts of the game is really annoying\n- I'm not sure what the point of the multiple characters is, so far. 3 chapters in, only one puzzle action required using more than one character, and it was super obvious / automatically done by the game. Everything else in the game is literally the characters saying the very same thing when you do the same action on an object.\n\nOverall, this game is such a rare treat that I highly recommend buying it right away and trying to sip it (rather than swallow ti whole) so you can really enjoy it. A lot of things are disappointing considering who made it, but since this is such a rare entry in the genre, that makes up for the flaws, I think.", "timestamp_created": 1491041274, "timestamp_updated": 1491042051, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507864", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30872415": {"recommendationid": "30872415", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994765320", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491495202}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing point and click adventure.\nNostalgic and yet worthwhile on its own.\nWould recommend to anyone who vaguely enjoyed point and click adventures.\n", "timestamp_created": 1491040433, "timestamp_updated": 1491040433, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30871879": {"recommendationid": "30871879", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129472065", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 890, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491625446}, "language": "english", "review": "Thimbleweed Park is a magnificent game and the very first pont and click game like this I have ever played using verbs to do actions.

Por lo que, si alguien es capaz de crear un juego que nos transporte a aquella \u00e9poca, sin duda son ellos!\n\nY vaya si lo consiguen! Como dir\u00edan los ingleses \"back to 80's!\" Porque este juego no solo transcurre en esa \u00e9poca (1987 para ser m\u00e1s exactos), sino que su est\u00e9tica pixelada y su estilo de juego es perfectamente reconocible para todos aquellos que vivimos nuestra feliz ni\u00f1ez o adolescencia entre los 80 y 90... Una \u00e9poca donde hab\u00edan pocos juegos y cada juego se exprim\u00eda y se disfrutaba al m\u00e1ximo jug\u00e1ndose una y otra vez para descubrir todos sus secretos... \n\nLa historia del juego transcurre en 1987 y nos situa en un peque\u00f1o pueblo de USA llamado Thimbleweed Park, un lugar donde nada es lo que parece. \n\nTodo empieza cuando durante una noche hombre es citado en un lugar preciso a las afueras del pueblo, tras inspeccionar la zona es asesinado por alguien (o algo)... A raiz de ese misterioso suceso llegar\u00e1n al pueblo la veterana agente Ray y el Junior agente Reyes para investigar el caso.\n\nApenas he tenido tiempo de jugarlo una media hora y desde el primer momento te sientes totalmente familiarizado con esta aventura gr\u00e1fica al m\u00e1s genuino estilo cl\u00e1sico, tanto en la jugabilidad (point and click) con el inconfundible men\u00fa de acciones a la izquierda y el men\u00fa de objetos a la derecha, al estilo del m\u00edtico SCUMM de las aventuras gr\u00e1ficas de LucasFilm y LucasArts. \n\nDebo decir que el principio del juego me ha recordado claramente al inicio del primer Monkey Island, cuando veiamos a Guybrush Threepwood descender de aquella colina para adentrarse en las calles de la isla Melee para convertirse en un gran pirata... Y es que no tardaremos en encontrar numerosos gui\u00f1os y referencias a los cl\u00e1sicos Monkey Island o Maniac Mansion en los dialogos, algunos de los personajes, objetos, etc. Algo que por otro lado era t\u00edpico en la \u00e9poca y formaba parte del humor de las aventuras gr\u00e1ficas de LucasArts.\n\nY de humor tambi\u00e9n nos evoca al estilo de la \u00e9poca, se nota la mano de Ron y Gary, ya que el juego combina el misterio con situaciones surealistas, chistes con los juegos de palabras, con las opciones de dialogos, con la mentalidad de los personajes, con los posibles usos de los objetos...\n\nEn definitiva, un juego completamente recomendable a todos aquellos nost\u00e1lgicos de las aventuras gr\u00e1ficas de los 80 y 90, pero tambien para quienes nunca disfrutasteis de aquel g\u00e9nero y sint\u00e1is curiosidad por saber como jugabamos y disfrutabamos los ni\u00f1os de aquel entonces :)\n\nGracias Ron y Gary! A big Thank You!\n\n\nPD: Puedo decir con orgullo que soy uno de los contribuidores a que Thimbleweed Park exista ya que har\u00e1 unos 2 a\u00f1os hice una donaci\u00f3n de 50$ en kickstarter para que el proyecto se lanzara... En pocas semanas se hab\u00eda superado con creces el objetivo y el proyecto se puso en marcha. Como curiosidad a\u00f1adir\u00e9 que en mi donaci\u00f3n, adem\u00e1s de una copia del juego y banda sonora... se inclu\u00eda la opci\u00f3n de dejar tu nombre en el listin telefonico del juego y un mensaje de voz a modo de contestador que se escuchar\u00eda si alguien llamaba a ese numero del listin dentro del juego...

The look turns out to be not quite as retro as one might think when seeing still shots, as the game runs very smoothly, using parallax scrolling and light effects. This way the creators managed to allow a great freedom concerning what they wanted to show and what options the player has. This turns out to be a great strength.\n\nWhich leads to the main difference between this game and other games trying to appear classic: the puzzles are nifty chains of causality. Rather than having a limited number of items and hotspots, this game has lots of them. In a surpringly nonlinear way up to five characters solve puzzles alone and together, exploring a world instead of a string of rooms. One can do many things which do not advance the plot, creating the feeling of a immersive reality which has become untypical for this genre. \n\nThe casual try-everything-with-everything strategy of most new adventures fails here. Rather than thinking what items can be used with each other, the player has to think about what he wants to achieve. This is sometimes tough, but never unfair. For players who never encountered real adventure games there is a casual mode, veterans can start directly in normal mode.\n\nThe focus lies on the gameplay. The story is refreshingly zany (but never just for the purpose of being zany) and the character fullfill their function. But the games does not spend too much time on subtleties easily missed. There is a more hands-on approach. Thimbleweed Park tries to be a first class game rather than a second rate movie. \nThis game is closer to Monkey Island and Zak McKracken than to Broken Age or Blackwell, concerning the puzzle quality, but also the humour and the characters.\n\nWhile there is a lot of optional dialogue, well acted by good voices, the hints are never buried in some blink-and-you-miss-it dialogue option. There is never a minute long conversation. It is showing instead of telling in the best sense of screenwriting. The solutions are not only logical, very often they are also intuitive.\nThe puzzles are rooted on the plot. The motivation for solving them is always clear, first comes the riddle, then the solution. There is never the situation of something having to be solved just because it looks like a puzzle, dropping a random object. Every character has a list of open tasks in their inventory, preventing from getting lost in the many open quests of the five characters. \n\nHighly recommended for gamers who liked Monkey Island, Indiana Jones, Maniac Mansion and Day of the Tentacle. \n\n(Also this game contains some lessons a lot of adventure designers apparently still have to learn.)", "timestamp_created": 1490996695, "timestamp_updated": 1490996695, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499600", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30861962": {"recommendationid": "30861962", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044082594", "num_games_owned": 180, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494357920}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is like a lost LucasArts adventure game.

Thimbleweed doesn't have that. This is the only disappointment I had, really. Otherwise, it is beautiful, it is huge, it is funny and captivating.\n\nEDIT #1\n\nApparently, there are keyboard shortcuts for the verbs after all, but, unlike the ones found in the original Lucas Arts adventure games, they are not very intutitive. If in most LA quests they were just the first letters of the verbs: O - open, W - walk, U - use, and so on, in Thimbleweed Park it's Q, W, E, A, S, D, Z, X, C. WIth Q mapping to \"open\". There is some sense int that - as the 3x3 square of keys on the keyboard can be directly translated into the verbs displayed on the UI. Still, the original system was more user-friendly.

Which is of course a good thing. \nThe atmoshere, the graphics, the dialog and the mystery. Every since my childhood was over I have not played so many point and click adventure games. I didn't have the time or motivation to get into a stories. If that depends on the story itself or the fact that I have growned up and don't have time for computer games in general - that i don't know. How come that this game has swollowed me right into it's story? Well of course the knowledge that the game was made by the same guys that made MM and Zak and the Monkey island is a factor of course. It's more hyped and the expectations has been huge! It's an opportunity to once again feel the same as I did back when I was 13 years old. It's called nostalgia and it's not an all positive feeling in general. But when it comes to this game I all in for the nostalgia trip and I can gladly say that it's there, every single moment!\nThe era of point and click adventure games sadly belongs to the past for many reasons. I'm happy that I had the chance to experience all these fine games that I mentioned, but everything have it's time in the history books.\n\nThe negative parts of the game:\n- The voiceacting is not stellar. The volume of the voices are not in sync. Sometimes the voices feel like they dont belong to the character. This is small things and overall they are great!\n- Sometimes when you switch character and try to do something that you already tried with the other the sentences are exactly the same only with another voice! This is kind of impersonal and generic.\n- Maybe i have missed something or i have not progressed into the game enough but it is a long walk to go to the crypt in the cemetary (will this change when I get a map?)\n\nWell not much as you can se, I had to really think hard to come to think of these.\nEverything else is top notch and now I don't have time more to write.

M\u00e1s adelante recibimos una copia del juego para analizar, as\u00ed que la tarea de probar el juego ha ca\u00eddo, de manera voluntaria, sobre mis hombros y ya sab\u00e9is el dicho \u201cSarna con gusto no pica\u201d.\n\nLa gente que siga leyendo \u00e9sto se preguntar\u00e1: \u00bfDe qu\u00e9 va Thimbleweed Park? Pues bien, nos hallamos en 1987, en Thimbleweed Park, el t\u00edpico pueblo americano de interior, con su cafeter\u00eda de estilo americano de los 50, sus espesos bosques, su mastod\u00f3ntico hotel y su cad\u00e1ver flotando en el r\u00edo. \u00a1Todo muy del estilo Twin Peaks!\n\n\n\nLa introducci\u00f3n del juego nos permite llevar a un personaje, pero r\u00e1pidamente cambiaremos a los agentes Reyes y Ray, federales, los cuales est\u00e1n en Thimbleweed Park para tratar de resolver el caso del fiambre en el r\u00edo\u2026 Pero ocultan motivos personales para estar all\u00ed que de momento desconocemos.\n\nAdem\u00e1s de los federales, durante el transcurso del juego, podremos controlar hasta un total de cinco personajes a la vez, como son:\n\nDelores: Una programadora que trabaja para una compa\u00f1\u00eda de videojuegos que es un trasunto de Lucas Arts. Es la sobrina de Chuck, el due\u00f1o de la \u201cMansi\u00f3n Mansi\u00f3n\u201d (Se supone que Maniac Mansion), y due\u00f1o de la f\u00e1brica Pillowtronics, que adem\u00e1s de fabricar almohadas fabrica dispositivos de alta tecnolog\u00eda con tecnolog\u00eda de tubos de vac\u00edo.  \n\nEstos aparatos disponen de unos tubos de vac\u00edo que invent\u00f3 Chuck y que le dan un aspecto de futuro alternativo al juego bastante chulo, de un tono verde Matrix.\n\nDelores se fue del pueblo habiendo discutido con t\u00edo Chuck, el cual quer\u00eda que siguiese con el negocio familiar, pero Delores prefiri\u00f3 ser dise\u00f1adora de videojuegos y qued\u00f3, de esta forma, fuera del testamento de su t\u00edo.\n\nHa vuelto al pueblo para la lectura del testamento de su t\u00edo y se encuentra con que su hermana quiere quedarse toda la herencia de t\u00edo Chuck y con que su padre Franklyn ha desaparecido.\n\nSe aprovecha bastante que Delores trabaje de dise\u00f1adora de videojuegos para hacer bromas acerca de la inform\u00e1tica de los 80-90 y el mundillo de los videojuegos.\n\nRansome: Un payaso maleducado, que hace bromas crueles de todo el mundo y que estando a un paso de la fama y la fortuna, decide insultar a una bruja en mitad de su espect\u00e1culo, cosa que le acarrear\u00e1 recibir un maleficio que le impide quitarse el maquillaje de payaso y salir de Thimbleweed Park, adem\u00e1s de perder pr\u00e1cticamente todo lo que posee.\n\nAhora es un payaso amargado y desahuciado que todav\u00eda vive en su caravana de circo y se dedica a soltar un taco en cada l\u00ednea de di\u00e1logo que tiene (como m\u00ednimo) que en el juego han sabido censurar, sabiamente, a base de pitidos.\n\nComo personaje jugable es muy peculiar ya que nadie en el pueblo lo quiere cerca, adem\u00e1s lleva un globo permanentemente en su mano izquierda y zapatos de payaso que hacen ruido a cada paso.\n\nFranklyn:  Franklyn es el hermano de Chuck y padre de Delores, es socio de Chuck en la f\u00e1brica Pillowtronics aunque realmente es un pintamonas al que Chuck no le hace ni caso.\n\nEl sue\u00f1o de Chuck es el de vender ositos de peluche que se transforman en coj\u00edn, idea que horroriza a Chuck.\n\nFranklyn no dudar\u00e1 en tener reuniones secretas con inversores extranjeros para conseguir su sue\u00f1o, aunque no salga muy bien parado de ello y es que Franklyn\u2026 \u00a1Muere durante el juego y pasa de ser un personaje jugable a un fantasma jugable!\n\nEn este caso tenemos un gui\u00f1o a aquella muerte famosa de Guybrush Threepwood en el primer Monkey Island, cuando pod\u00edamos ahogarnos y los verbos de acci\u00f3n de nuestro personaje cambiaban para adecuarse a nuestro nuevo estado de fiambre. En el caso de Franklyn ahora ser\u00e1 capaz de hacer cosas tan espeluznantes como \u201cgemir\u201d, \u201csuspirar\u201d, helar (l\u00edquidos), soplar o provocar chasquidos el\u00e9ctricos que encender\u00e1n o apagar\u00e1n aparatos.\n\nPor supuesto las puertas cerradas ya no ser\u00e1n un problema para Franklyn, pero no podr\u00e1 acabar su existencia sin antes poder despedirse de su hija Delores.\n\nBueno, hemos explicado un poco el trasfondo de los personajes, pero\u2026 -\u00bfQu\u00e9 hay del juego? Pues bien, el juego es una aventura gr\u00e1fica CL\u00c1SICA de Lucas, con sus verbos en la parte inferior izquierda de la pantalla que servir\u00e1n para que nuestro personaje interact\u00fae con el escenario y dem\u00e1s personajes y un inventario visual al lado de los verbos.\n\nEl inventario es con los objetos visibles, no palabras como en Maniac Mansion.\n\nEl juego tiene muchos puzzles y muy variados, casi todos implican realizar varias acciones con diferentes personajes, ya que hay algunos personajes que no pueden entrar en determinadas zonas, por ejemplo Delores es la \u00fanica capaz de entrar en la mansi\u00f3n familiar o Ransome es el \u00fanico capaz de entrar en su camerino.\n\nEl apartado gr\u00e1fico es exquisitamente cl\u00e1sico, una evoluci\u00f3n del pixel art de las aventuras gr\u00e1ficas de los 80-90 con una resoluci\u00f3n espectacular. No se puede pedir m\u00e1s en este sentido sin cambiar de estilo y, creedme, el estilo es el adecuado.\n\nPor \u00faltimo nos queda el gran protagonista del juego, que es el gui\u00f3n, un gui\u00f3n con multitud de situaciones graciosas, contestaciones simp\u00e1ticas y gui\u00f1os a la historia de los videojuegos, sobretodo a los de Lucas en los que estuvo involucrado Ron Gilbert.

The failure that was Broken Age made me weary of yet-another-old-dev-bringing-back-the-magic. I did not donate to the kickstarter at that time but closely observed the making of the game through various media. The closer the premiere the more I felt like it was a good investment.\n\nThe game is weird, but in a good way. I expected a bit less surreal humour, but instead of something akin to Maniac Mansion, I got something closer to Zak McKraken. It has that nice touch of horror/tension to it. Even with the 4th wall breaking humour it has that aura of creepiness that X-Files/Twin Peaks had of small Americana towns where the outsider is usually not sure what to see as weird and what to see as normal.\n\nThe gameplay is a throwback to classic SCUMM adventure games with the same array of verbs at our disposal, but don't be fooled - this game was not written in AGS, but has been coded from grounds up, which is an achievement cause it looks damn gorgeous at times. The only thing I can find negative is that when you're doing pixel art, don't make it move so smoothly, ruining that whole chunky pixel feeling.\n\nAs far as the sound design goes - props to voice actors. Very good voice acting - Reyes newbie enthusiasm, Ray's sarcastic and tired veteran commentary, Ransome's Krusty-like voice... the characters are very much alive thanks to all of that. Music is quite good and gives the nice atmosphere, but sometimes, just sometimes it's way too faint to hear it properly. Sound bug?\n\nAs for the story... can't say much - it's a murder mystery but I'm loving it so far. The biggest problem so far is that sometimes the 4th wall breaking jokes get a bit too tiresome in one conversation. There's a lot of nice Lucasfilms tribues that anyone that follow Lucasfilms/Lucasarts should recognize but the subtle references are better than the in-your-face ones. There's a ton of side-stuff to do and the dialogue options are great to explore so definitely a good game in that regard. Oh and no character deaths... yet.\n \nSo the bottom line is: Was it worth it? Is it worth it? For adventure game fan? Yes. For a newbie... no. The game requires a certain logic. Mind you I have not checked the causal mode because I always went for the Mega-Monkey in Monkey Island games, but it might be a bit easier there. Overall the game just requires you to think in that surreal fashion like back in a day. Analyze the clues and work out solutions. It's not that hard but a newbie is gonna quickly get lost.\n\nThe pricing of a game could be $5 dollar lower IMO, or at least the Euro price could be adjusted so it's lower than $20. But I'm not complaining. These days a $20 game can have so little content it hurts. This is not the case.\n\nPros:\nMany playable characters\nAmazing atmosphere\nGorgeous pixelart graphics\nGreat voice acting\nInteresting plot that pulls you in\n\nCons: \nThe graphics are a bit too smooth for the resolution they try to imitate \nSome of the fourth-wall breaking jokes a a bit annoying and overdone\nIn Europe you need to pay over $20 to get it, breaking Guybrush's law.", "timestamp_created": 1490950705, "timestamp_updated": 1490950705, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565850", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30849184": {"recommendationid": "30849184", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961559444", "num_games_owned": 251, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 813, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491687102}, "language": "french", "review": "Enfin le retour de l'Adventure Game type LucasArt !", "timestamp_created": 1490950185, "timestamp_updated": 1490950185, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.617138", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30849011": {"recommendationid": "30849011", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002563273", "num_games_owned": 602, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 978, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493683732}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is the best thing that have happened to adventure games since Blackwell series.

I am a big fan of the game (and LucasArts adventures), so I was eager to fall in love with it. This review was originally published in Retronator Magazine (and it's way longer there).\n\nThimbleweed Park delivers on the promise of being a true old-school point-and-click adventure. It\u2019s as if Maniac Mansion 2 wasn\u2019t developed by Tim Schafer, Dave Grossman and others, but stayed in the hands of Ron Gilbert, Gary Winnick, David Fox and Mark Ferrari. Lucky for us, since both games fucking rule, I\u2019m glad the two alternative histories both live in our lifetimes.\n\nThis comparison hits closer to home than expected. Just like in Day of the Tentacle, in Thimbleweed Park you don\u2019t choose which characters will be part of the story\u200a\u2014\u200athey all slowly unlock as the plot develops. Except instead of three, we get 5 of them.\n\nYou start with the two federal agents: experienced (and bitter) Ray and younger (and eager) Reyes. They are mostly interchangeable and give a nice choice of a cynical or cheerful commentary of the game\u2019s world. Even though their lines are the same for the most part, the voice actors did a great job at breathing different life into each character.\n\nYou soon meet the supporting cast, which is an unexpectedly pleasant mix of bizarre, weird and humorous-a-reno.\n\nAs you investigate the murder, you cross paths with the other three playable characters and soon take control of their fate. Whereas the agents can both do the same things (with rare puzzles that involve both of them), the others are more specific as their backgrounds tie deeply into the history of Thimbleweed Park (the name of the degenerating town where the game takes place).\n\nFirst we have Delores, a lovable game developer who\u2019s in town for the will reading of her late uncle.\n\nFranklin is Delores\u2019 dad. Like the uncle, he is also dead. But still plenty kicking, even though he lacks a bit in the self-confidence department.\n\nFinally, we have Ransome the Fucking Insult Clown. Ah, Ransome. I need to give a special shout out to Ian Corlett who voiced the offensive clown. The hilarious writing together with his delivery make Ransome one of the best characters in the game\u200a\u2014\u200aand I hate clowns, so this means a lot. In the game, all Ransome\u2019s lines are beeped out, but Ian actually went all-out swearing in the recording sessions, so there\u2019s a chance we\u2019ll get an uncensored version at some point. I\u2019d replay the game for that.\n\nThe five character arcs develop in parallel, but are mostly independent. Time-travel interactions in Day of the Tentacle were much more involved in that regard. \n\nEach of the five characters is equipped with a list of goals that progress their story further. Some goals are shared (especially between the agents), and you\u2019ll occasionally have to hand over an item from a character to another to help them out. Thimbleweed Park is very clear like that\u2014you always know what you\u2019re trying to do. In 1989, Ron Gilbert wrote an article titled Why Adventure Games Suck where he laid out rules of thumb he used while designing Monkey Island. Thanks to his rules, Monkey Island did away with stuff like dead ends, dying and arbitrary puzzles.\n\nIf Thimbleweed Park follows Maniac Mansion in its setting, the puzzle design clearly follows the later predecessor. While Monkey Island still had a sour monkey wrench in there or two, Thimbleweed Park perfects Ron\u2019s philosophy.\n\nI don\u2019t remember when I last finished an adventure game without looking at a walkthrough at least once. Maybe even never. I finished Thimbleweed Park without any help though. That is not to say the game is easy. I was playing on fucking Hard mode, alright?\n\nIt\u2019s true that I was forced to not look at walkthroughs, since there weren\u2019t any by the time I finished it (what with the game not being released and all). I was handed a real simulation of the eighties. Back then, if you got stuck in a game, you wrote a letter to your favorite magazine, they would print the letter in the readers section and if you were lucky, another reader who solved the puzzle would respond in the next month\u2019s issue. It was kind of like having Internet with the latency of two months. Not something you can use when you have two weeks to write a review. The press were given a walkthrough a few days before the release though (when I\u2019ve already licked all my fingers), so be suspicious of cheating bastards at other journalistic establishments.\n\nBut my success did not come (just) because I was forced to think with my own head (as you know, once you look up a single walkthrough clue, it\u2019s an instant drug addiction and every time you get stuck, you go for the easy way out). No, puzzles in Thimbleweed Park simply make sense.\n\nWhen I say puzzles, don\u2019t forget that this is an old-school adventure game. Gameplay is a never-ending (well, after-15-hours ending) sequence of well-designed hurdles the game throws at you, mainly the townsfolk refusing to do what you want, or missing an item to do it. Coming up with solutions is most alike riddles: you have a setup with a bunch of clues, and when you figure the item or action that fits the problem, you feel really clever.\n\nYou always have a few open problems at hand, but it\u2019s never so overwhelming that you\u2019d have to resort to old-school frustrations such as trying to combine every possible item in your inventory. That will get you nowhere since there are no arbitrary solutions.\n\nWhen I depleted my ideas on all loose ends, I simply turned off the game for the day and next time, with a fresh motivation to retrace my steps, the solution would always show up in a clue I missed. I can\u2019t stress how much pride you get from being able to solve everything on your own.\n\nWithout getting into spoiler territory, I\u2019ll say that the game\u2019s ending holds up to a 10/10 rating for me. It\u2019s not exactly the love/hate plot twist of Monkey Island 2, but close enough and it left me completely satisfied. Catharsis was strong.\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to have a warm fuzzy feeling thinking about the game. I fell in love with the weird-a-reno town, and as funky as it is, I was always delighted to return. I don\u2019t think I need to praise the art and voice actors any more (the art is fantastic, and I go into it in great detail in my Retronator Magazine article), but the music also contributes majorly to the Twin Peaks vibe the authors set to recreate. It\u2019s a perfect match.\n\nThe tongue-in-cheek humor had me chuckling all throughout. It\u2019s full of what we in the education space call multiple planes of engagement. Newcomers to adventuring will simply enjoy the puzzles and exploring, but there\u2019s also another plane (get it?) of self-referencing writing that will reward the more demanding veterans of the genre.\n\nThanks to Kickstarter backers who were crowdsourced (=exploited as unpaid labor) to write in-game books and record answering machine messages, there\u2019s even a ZX Spectrum mentioned in the game!\n\nGameplay, art, audio, writing \u2026 10/10.

Giocare a Thimbleweed Park \u00e8 come fare un salto indietro di 25/30 anni, l'epoca d'oro delle avventure grafiche. Riferimenti e citazioni si sprecano, lo humor \u00e8 quello inconfondibile di Gilbert, il gameplay \u00e8 stracollaudato e - alla faccia delle produzioni ultramilionarie di oggi - ancora attualissimo. La trama, l'ambientazione e pi\u00f9 in generale la storia decisamente intriganti (giudizio limitato chiaramente a quanto visto finora). Ottima anche la traduzione in italiano dei sottotitoli, peccato solo che il doppiaggio (ottimo anche lui) sia solo in inglese: un doppiaggio in italiano come quello fatto all'epoca per Sam&Max sarebbe stato epico.\n\n[Edit dopo aver terminato di gioco - !!! ATTENZIONE POSSIBILI SPOILER !!!]\n\n...\n\n... precauzione spoiler ...\n\n...\n\n... precauzione spoiler ...\n\n...\n\n\nOk, veniamo all'aggiornamento dopo 16 ore di gioco e i titoli di coda del gioco appena terminati. Che dire? Premetto che cercher\u00f2 di dare un giudizio spoilerando il meno possibile ma chiaramente \u00e8 impossibile non farlo neanche in minima parte.\n\nPartiamo dal giudizio finale sul gioco: decisamente bello, da 7 1/2 in pagella. Non di pi\u00f9? No, purtroppo non riesco a dare di pi\u00f9 (per quanto 7 1/2 non sia poco). I pregi elencati all'inizio ovviamente rimangono: \u00e8 un gioco di Ron Gilbert e questo riassume credo un po' tutto. Humor ottimo, riferimenti al passato - intesi come precedenti titoli Lucas ma anche pi\u00f9 in generale, vedi i richiami al Commodore 64 - onnipresenti e graditissimi (la foresta e il \"tesoro\" di un altro gioco o i travestimenti alla Zak sono solo due dei tantissimi), grafica e sonoro molto validi (anche se chiaramente non sono questi i punti su cui si regge il tutto).\n\nCosa c'\u00e8 quindi che impedisce al gioco di prendere un bel 10? Essenzialmente tre cose.\n\nPrimo difetto: la caratterizzazione di alcuni dei personaggi, Ray e Reyes in primis. OK, Ray non \u00e8 male, con quel sarcasmo e il suo non sopportare Reyes, ma sono sicuro non passer\u00e0 alla storia, le manca quel carisma di cui trasudano Guybrush o Zak. Reyes peggio ancora: anonimo. Di Ray mi lascia perplesso anche il background (molto meglio la \"missione\" che muove Reyes). Oltretutto sono due personaggi che potevano tranquillamente diventare uno: quello che pu\u00f2 fare Reyes pu\u00f2 sostanzialmente farlo anche Ray, usare uno o usare l'altro ai fini del gioco \u00e8 pi\u00f9 o meno uguale, perch\u00e9? A che scopo farne due? E questo vale in parte anche per gli altri personaggi (Franklin escuso ovviamente): le occasioni in cui emergono - ai fini del gioco e degli enigmi - le peculiarit\u00e0 di un determinato personaggio sono poche e a volte neanche \u00e8 chiaro realmente il perch\u00e9. Ad esempio, il perch\u00e9 solo Delores pu\u00f2 decodificare il testamento \u00e8 ovvio e sacrosanto, ma perch\u00e9 \u00e8 solo Ransome che pu\u00f2 salire sull'antenna? E perch\u00e9 Delores non vuole entrare nelle fogne? Alla fine i personaggi che pi\u00f9 si distinguono dagli altri (anche perch\u00e9 realmente possono fare qualcosa di \"unico\" nel gioco) sono Delores (che ammetto di adorare) e Franklin (anche lui mi \u00e8 piaciuto molto). Lo stesso Ransome, che poteva essere un po' lo \"Stan\" del gioco, non riesce a mio avviso a decollare realmente, ad avere quelle battute da farti cadere dalla sedia. Infine, come dir\u00f2 anche dopo in un'altra forma parlando della longevit\u00e0, ci sarebbe dovuta essere anche maggiore interazione tra i personaggi ed invece si va avanti come tante piccole avventure indipendenti dentro una avventura pi\u00f9 grande: non si avverte il motivo per cui i 4 debbano effettivamente collaborare cos\u00ec strettamente, manca questo collante che dia l'idea di essere una squadra (a maggior ragione uno come Ransome, non esattamente una persona \"socievole e amante della compagnia, non si capisce perch\u00e9 dovrebbe seguire gli altri).\n\nSecondo difetto: la longevit\u00e0. Ho completato il gioco (livello pi\u00f9 diffcile ovviamente) in 16 ore, forse un po' troppo poche. Ok, sono cresciuto a pane e avventure, ancora oggi mi ricordo quasi a memoria tutto Zak McKracken e potrei recitare tutte le battute di Guybrush senza sbagliarne una: \u00e8 chiaro che molti enigmi per me erano del tutto \"naturali\", un neofita dello SCUMM impiegher\u00e0 con tutta probabilit\u00e0 pi\u00f9 tempo, per\u00f2 rimangono sempre e solo 16 ore. Gli enigmi hanno il pregio di non essere mai assurdi e irritanti ma ne mancano a mio avviso di realmente brillanti, di quelli che ci sbatti la testa contro per ore e poi, capita la soluzione, ti viene da dire \"geniale, come ho fatto a non pensarci prima\". Gli enigmi di TP sono tutti \"mediamente complessi\" senza particolari tocchi di genio salvo (troppe) poche eccezioni. Anche il fatto di controllare 5 personaggi contemporaneamente poteva venire sfruttato meglio: di enigmi in cui c'\u00e8 bisogno della collaborazione contemporanea di 2 o pi\u00f9 personaggi si contano sulle dita di una mano, una occasione persa a mio avviso.\n\nTerzo difetto: il finale [ATTENZIONE SPOILER]. Forse sono io, ma non l'ho gradito. Intendiamoci: l'evoluzione della trama lungo tutto il gioco \u00e8 bellissima ma a mio avviso crolla proprio alla fine. L'ho trovata un misto di \"gi\u00e0 visto\" (una sorta di Matrix in chiave Scumm) e di \"non so come uscirne al meglio\", un po' una forzatura all'insegna del voler stupire a tutti i costi: a me ha lasciato l'amaro in bocca, senza considerare che rimangono dei punti incompiuti per me gravi. Uno su tutti: quand'\u00e8 che Delores ha la certezza che Franklin era stato ucciso? In albergo le viene detto che era scomparso ma nessuno le dice effettivamente che \u00e8 morto, ma nella scena finale, nella stanza segreta, tutto avviene come se fosse la cosa pi\u00f9 ovvia di questo mondo. Oltretutto non viene neanche chiarito chi esattamente l'ha ucciso. E ancora, nelle ultimissime battute Delores pu\u00f2 ancora andare da Willie ma senza per\u00f2 spiegare nulla e senza poter far nulla per rilasciarlo lasciando di nuovo un senso di \"non finito\". Anche il fatto che Ransome debba consegnare il biglietto di scuse alla tipa del fast food e non alla maga francamente mi ha lasciato perplesso.

Just beat the game on casual difficulty. The puzzles were great, challenging yet fair, especially for newcoming consumers of adventure games.

Agent Reyes - young and ambitious, ready to prove himself and his honor. Ransom the Clown - hating and hated person around the thimbleweed park. Delores - an aspiring game developer, who searches for answers about what hapenned her uncle and her dad. And Franklin - the ghost, who just wants to move on to the afterlife.

Achtung ... Spoiler-Inhalt ... Achtung !!! <<<\n\n\n\nZun\u00e4chst muss ich sagen das mir Thimbleweed Park schon sehr gefallen hat. Leider muss ich auch sagen das ich ebenso entt\u00e4uscht wurde. Andere werden es vermutlich anders sehen ... jeder ist halt verschieden in seinen Ansichten ... aber f\u00fcr meine Verh\u00e4ltnisse bleibt dieses Spiel weit hinter den vorherigen Meilensteinen von Gilbert/Winnick zur\u00fcck. \nDennoch kann ich dieses Spiel empfehlen f\u00fcr alle Retro-Fans. Alle Retro-80er-Fans jedoch seien gewarnt und sollten wissen das sie nicht die 80er bekommen die man sich erh\u00f6fft hatte.\n\nMeine Gedanken zu Thimbleweed Park:\n\nAls erstes ist da das urspr\u00fcnglich angepriesene 80er Feeling. Dieses will nicht so recht aufkommen. Es werden immer wieder ansatzweise Gags und Andeutungen gemacht bez\u00fcglich des Jahres 1987 wie beispielsweise die Polaroid-Kamera oder das Ascii-Plakat in Delores Zimmer oder der Kalender der 1986 aussagt. Ebenso Mmucasflemgames als Andeutung auf die damalige Spielefirma mit \u00e4hnlichem Namen. Leider wirkt die Szenerie nicht so wirklich wie das Jahr 1987 sondern eher als w\u00e4re man in den sp\u00e4ten 90ern. Man hat eher das Gef\u00fchl es wird einem gesagt es w\u00e4re 1987 und optisch hat man sich in den 90ern verheddert. Als ein Kind der 80er und nach der Wartezeit von 2 Jahren Programmierung hatte sich nat\u00fcrlich eine gewisse Erwartung und Vorfreude aufgebaut. Diese wurde halt nicht erreicht. \n\nDann sind da die Bedienungen der unteren Wortleiste. Die Engine ist nach wie vor eine geniale Erfindung und hat nicht nur was f\u00fcr Retro-Fans. Ich f\u00fcr meinen Teil w\u00fcrde mir w\u00fcnschen das weitere Spiele in der Hinsicht erscheinen in der kommenden Zeit. Egal ob 80er-Feeling oder nicht. Allerdings wurd das Potenzial dieser Bedienung kaum genutzt. Zumindest f\u00fchlt es sich so an. Das Reden der Personen wird mit einem Rechtsklick auf die jeweilige Person gel\u00f6st. Ein Klick auf Reden und dann auf die Person mit der man kommunizieren will hat sich somit erledigt. Auch die anderen Worte im Men\u00fc kommen kaum zum Einsatz. Zu 90% benutzt man immer wieder \"nutze\" oder \"nehme\" und alles Andere bleibt mit Spinnenweben verhangen und ungenutzt. Das war eine weitere Entt\u00e4uschung die ich sehr bedauerlich finde. Man h\u00e4tte somit die W\u00f6rter im Men\u00fc auf 3 bis 4 minimieren k\u00f6nnen. \n\nDann das Inventar und die Dinge die man sammelt. Es wurde kaum auf Kombinationen eingegangen. Wenn ich mich recht erinnere geschieht dies vielleicht um die 4 mal und das war es dann auch. Ich h\u00e4tte mir mehr Knobelei gew\u00fcnscht. Wie schon erw\u00e4hnt geht es \u00fcberwiegend darum zu klicken \"nutze\" X mit Person oder \"gebe\" X an Person. Sp\u00e4testens nach 2 Stunden \u00f6det das an. \n\nDie Story ist eine andere Sache. Nach den Filmen \"Lucy\" und \"Transcendence\" etc. ist die Geschichte zum Schluss nicht sonderlich einfallsreich. Siehe ebenso die Textpassage aus Edgar Allen Poe: \"Ist alles was wir sehen oder scheinen nur ein Traum innerhalb eines Traumes?\" Alles halt schon vorher gesehen oder geh\u00f6rt. \n\nDie Grafik hat mir gut gefallen. Pixelgrafik welche liebevoll gezeichnet ist und doch irgendwie zeitgem\u00e4\u00df erscheint. Wie gesagt hat die Engine so wie sie ist viel Potenzial und schreit nach mehr Spielen. Ich pers\u00f6nlich finde die Grafik am Ende des Spiels mit Delores und dem letzten Schritt des deaktivieren des Computers fast noch besser als die Grafik die \u00fcberwiegend w\u00e4hrend des gesamtgen Spiels gezeigt wird. Dies liegt nat\u00fcrlich daran dass es dann optisch bzw. grafisch exact wie in \"Maniac Mansion\" wirkt. Aber das liegt halt am \"Real back to the 80s Feeling\" den die primitive Grafik symbolisiert. Was beweist ... Optik ... egal ob in Filmen oder Serien oder Spielen ... macht kein gutes Spiel. Ich pers\u00f6nlich bin \u00fcberzeugt das selbst ein neues Spiel komplett in solcher Optik ein Hit und Kult werden kann. Sheldon aus Big Bang Theory hatte Recht ... Zork und \u00e4hnlliche alte Games ... sind und bleiben ein Klassiker. ;-)\n\nAbschlie\u00dfend sage ich das ich Thimbleweed Park schon empfehlen kann. F\u00fcr den Preis von 19,99 Euro ist man nicht entt\u00e4uscht. Wer sich aber den gew\u00fcnschten 80er-Retro-Trip erhofft wird bitter entt\u00e4uscht werden. Alle Anderen Retro-Fans werden aber ihren kurzweiligen Spa\u00df haben.

El resultado es Thimbleweed Park, lo mejor de los cl\u00e1sicos en una nueva aventura llena de puzles locos y personajes m\u00e1s locos todav\u00eda.\n\nVerano de 1987. Un fiambre ha aparecido en los alrededores del tranquilo pueblo de Thimbleweed Park. Hasta all\u00ed se han desplazado los agentes especiales del FBI Reyes y Ray para investigar el extra\u00f1o asesinato. Sin embargo, al llegar al pueblo descubren que el lugar es un agujero donde solo viven paletos, fracasados y hasta dise\u00f1adoras de videojuegos. Los agentes tendr\u00e1n que colaborar junto a Delores, Ransome y Franklin con el fin de descubrir los oscuros secretos que oculta Thimbleweed Park.\n\nLos puzles se basan en combinar objetos con m\u00e1s o menos l\u00f3gica. Los jugadores que disfrutaron de una feliz estancia por la mansi\u00f3n de los Edison, encontrar\u00e1n algunos puzles extremadamente familiares, as\u00ed que conf\u00edo en que sepan extraer con elegancia un sello.

Te vas  a atascar, eso est\u00e1 claro, as\u00ed que no te cortes y prueba las habituales combinaciones absurdas por muy rid\u00edculas que parezcan.\n\nEl humor estar\u00e1 muy presente durante todo el juego y puedes contar cu\u00e1ntas veces ves la palabra Edna en pantalla o incluso llamarla, nunca se sabe si querr\u00e1 encerrarte en la celda para abusar de ti.

I get it, you were there when it all began and you designed maniac mansion or some such, enough already.\n\nShort version:\n\nNegative rating due to unrealistically high difficulty and frustrating game mechanics.  Also is not a pixel graphic game, just lazy pixel graphics pasted on top of game elements.\n\nLong version:\n\nDifficulty:     Yes I know, there is an in game hint system.  But in my personal opinion, this is not something the developers throw in there to \"appease the masses\" as they would say.  Its because of the crazy difficulty.  And yes, I know most of the puzzles are logical, and I applaud the puzzle designers.  But if the player so much as misses or forgets one clue, there are a crazy amount of possibilities for the most basic question \"what do I do next?\" \nLets see:  five playable characters, I think.  At least two I know of have access to mechanics the others don't.  I think maybe 20+ items spread across all of the characters at any given time, which wouldn't be so bad if the items weren't trasferable to anyone. \"Oh, so and so has a wrench but I don't see where he can use it, maybe so and so can because they're at where ever.\"  Now imagine the above with about 15 locations that i can think of, most with multiple rooms, some with more than ten rooms.  Then, add on the fact that instead of every adventure game designed since around 1990, they decide to throw in the origional nine action verbs that multiplies the difficulty yet again.  I had plenty of time to think about this as I spent three hours failing to progress the story at all because I don't enjoy puzzles that someone has to solve for me. And I read somwhere that the designers intended the hint system to be completely optional, only there for casual players.\n\nGraphics:    Advertized as \"pixel graphics,\" it is not.  You can tell from the opening scene with the boat on the water, or the waves, something like that.  Anyway the \"pixels\" rotate and change size, both of which pixels cannot.  They are just pasted on a 2D cutout mechanic.  And the characters, their pixels never change, again they just change size or rotate like you or me wearing pixel covered clothes.  Its just such a cheap, shortcutted knockoff of the games this one is supposed to be paying homage to.  Just youtube any 90s adventure game and see what you think.\n\nMechanics:    This goes along with the difficulty.  Basically it boils down to the isanely high number of options at any given time.  Its higher by at least 10 fold than any other adventure game I've ever played, in 25 years of playing them.  Similar games have many ways of helping progress the story: limiting the play area until a puzzle is solved, verbal clues, visual clues, limiting availability of inventory items, and limiting number of actions [most games have four at most] In my experience this is much more fun than giving up and having to look up a walkthrough.\n\nThe good:   I enjoyed the colors on the graphics, pixel or no.

Lovely idyllic sceneries with a comforting soundtrack make this game a very good experience and shows how nice pixelated looks can be.

I must admit i didn't like it and hope there will be a sequel or something to compensate.\nBut well, this is only a minor issue, all in all it feels like a great classical thriller adventure with good characters good storyline lots of humor, grat dialogs and programmers jokes and many references and homages.", "timestamp_created": 1516475102, "timestamp_updated": 1516475102, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39591763": {"recommendationid": "39591763", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031521418", "num_games_owned": 188, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1268, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 283, "last_played": 1516822576}, "language": "english", "review": "A must buy for fans of the classic point and click genre.

The characters themselves are very interesting and the story overall is a good one. The final portion of the game is a bit jarring and certainly devisive, either you love it or you hate it, but I enjoyed how it played out. \n\nSince I played the game the first time they have added an in-game hint system which is really cool.

I hesitated buying this game at first because the combat didn't look very good and the game didn't look too polished. BOY WAS I WRONG.

The swordplay is incredibly polished and I can tell the developer spent a long time perfecting it. It's the most satisfying thing to defeat an enemy in this game. The room scale implementation works well, as you can actively dodge attacks by quickly moving around and lean in for a closer attack on a more exposed area of an enemy.\n\nI can't quite say it'll be worth it for everyone to buy this game for 20 bucks for only a few hours of gameplay, but I sure think it is, although I bought it on sale because I didn't think it was gonna be as good as it is.

Enemy arrows and projectiles become nothing but a reason to strafe back and forth as you throw arrows back at these enemies. Bosses desperately try to backpedal from you as you walk into them so that they can actually hit you, allowing the player to hold one joystick forward as they wiggle their wrist, defeating the enemy boss at little to no cost.\n\nEnemy AI is also distressing; the first couple enemies will spawn in close to the player with an animation, but once this stops, enemies begin to show up standing lifelessly in plain view as they wait for the player to approach them; melee becomes a second thought as the ranged options of the game always overpower enemies who cannot or dare not approach, even with their occasional attempts to block and sidestep incoming arrows.\n\nI have multiple other issues with this games' design, such as some assets not really matching the rest of the game or the gold system, but the aforementioned are the primary reasons.\n\nAdmittedly, as this is made by a small team, or single person, I couldn't say I expect them to cover all these bases, and I don't know how many of the mechanics in this game are stock unity assets from the store, but some of these systems are worth praise for a solo developer.\n\nHowever, the size of the development team clearly hasn't affected the size of the hole in my pocket. This game is certainly not worth \u00a315, nor do I think it's worth the \u00a39 on sale; the rose-tinted goggles of VR itself have definitely lowered the bar of quality for games, because this game is certainly not deserving of its' overwhelmingly positive reviews.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1516254110, "timestamp_updated": 1516254110, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550913", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39429079": {"recommendationid": "39429079", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043014458", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 186, "last_played": 1516251187}, "language": "english", "review": "Overall, this is a fun adventure game that kept my interest.

I have to say, it is one of my favorite VR games now. \n\nThe combat takes some getting used to. It can feel clunky at first, but during the game I grew to really like it. Sure, it's not perfect, but once you know how it works, it actually feels really cool to block or parry enemy's swings and hit him right in the weak spot. Enemies are invulnerable on armor and carry shields they know how to use, so you have to think a little to get hits in. Feels great if you manage to win a 1v2 flawlessly, or defeat some of the stronger enemies.\nRanged weapons are good, but I believe it is MUCH better with a decent play space. Moving furniture, I got to around 2m x 2m which was great. More is probably useless, since the game doesn't actually allow you to move freely, moving away from the center will pause the game. It can be annoying, but it was also helpful to stop me from running into walls. It still allows enough movement to dodge ranged attacks by sidestepping them or getting behind cover. Shooting an enemy while leaning out of cover is a cool thing too.\n\nThe world is built beautifully for VR, there's stuff to explore, things to interact with, and the path, while kinda linear, feels like a journey. The only part I disliked is the \"maze\", because it is very dark and VERY cramped. I'm sure that's what they were going for, because I have to admit, I was just too much of a pussy to play through it. It was scary for me, I had to have my wife next to me watching it to get through. Felt great to get out of it too! And actually using a torch in an rpg with your actual hand to light stuff up feels great too.\n\nIt's on the shorter side I guess, with 2.5 hours of play time for me for the normal story mode. There is a hard mode which I have yet to try.

This is like a hybrid of Zelda, Ultima Underworld and D&D. The ability to manipulate your environment is vastly superior in this game to other VR dungeon crawlers that I've tried. The feeling of combat is just right (maybe a little more feedback from the controller when blocking or striking but otherwise great). If I had to nitpick, I'd say I would prefer just tapping the right stick to snapturn as opposed to holding it down and moving it left or right. That makes your thumb really sore after extended play. Also, just a personal preference, but I prefer using a button on the right controller for teleport as in most other games that support teleportation. Those could be easily added as options I would imagine. Maybe a little bit better save management would be nice. Other than that, this game is a masterpiece. It is exactly what I always dreamed a VR dungeon crawler could be. I love the scrolls you find and the way you handled secrets, traps and puzzles. The atmosphere is spot on. Very old school but in a really welcome way. It almost feels like you're playing an early Moldvay-Cook D&D module. (I know...I really dated myself there).\n\nIf you ever create a sequel I'd love to see classes to choose from, even more interactivity (maybe NPCs, more formalized quests etc).

You need to remedy that immediately.  Like, stop reading reviews and go buy this thing.\n\nVanishing Realms is [i]the[/i] game that's mentioned every time a dungeon crawler or RPG in VR is mentioned.  And for good reason.  The game is highly polished and incredibly fun.  if you're worried about the pricetag, don't be.  It's worth every penny.  This is the game that all the others in this genre are trying to imitate.\n\n[table]\n  [tr]\n    [td]Value[/td]\n    [td]7/10[/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]Originality[/td]\n    [td]10/10[/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]Controls[/td]\n    [td]10/10[/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]Graphics[/td]\n    [td]8/10[/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]Sound[/td]\n    [td]7/10[/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]Fun[/td]\n    [td]10/10[/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td][b]Overall[/b][/td]\n    [td]10/10[/td]\n  [/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[b][u]Value - 7[/u][/b] - The only reason I didn't give it a higher score, is that I realize the price is kind of high.  Also, even though the game is tons of fun, it is a tad short (shouldn't take more than a couple of hours for a first playthrough, and they can be done in maybe 45 minutes after that).  Replayability is a bit on the low side as well.\n\n[b][u]Originality - 10[/u][/b] - As I said before, this has become the standard for this adventure genre in VR.  There's some similar types of games in non-VR (perhaps Skyrim... but more linear.. a good example isn't coming to mind).  \n\n[b][u]Controls - 10[/u][/b] - Pretty much every imaginable control scheme has been implemented at this point.  You've got teleportation, gliding, umm... some others (a combo of teleportation and glide is all I use).  Sword fighting (and archery) are both well done.  Movement is smooth, and hits on the enemies are accurate.\n\nOne thing in particular I thought was fun, was if you're at a place where a melee enemy can't reach you and are shooting it with arrows, after a hit or two they begin side-stepping your arrows.  It's still possible to hit them, but it makes for a difficult tactic.\n\nAlso, after a bit you get a mining pick and these little ore nodes become another source of income.  Mining them is quite fun and feels very Minecraft-y... but there's not so many nodes that it becomes tedious.\n\n[b][u]Graphics - 8[/u][/b] - The graphics are a bit cartoony, but it works.  Generally, I prefer a cartoony look to badly-done realism.  Gives a nice buffer where you can excuse things that aren't quite right.  Enemy models aren't overly stiff, and move well; although combat feels a little basic.  The terrain layout and textures are good as well.\n\n[b][u]Sound - 7[/u][/b] - Sound is ok.  Sounds effects are what they need to be.  Enemies yell at you a little and make some noise.  I can't recall if there's background music or not (which I suppose isn't a good sign).  I don't recall if there's ambiance sound effects either.\n\n[b][u]Fun - 10[/u][/b] - The game is pretty good at making you feel like a badass with a sword and shield.  Enemies are just tough enough (unless you're a Gorn expert... in which case combat won't be too difficult).  There's a good mix of melee skeletons, archers, spell casters, and giants to fight.  You end up armed with a sword and shield, bow, fireball wand, and 2-handed axe (which is a bit difficult to get the hang of... and again having played Gorn would be helpful here).  \n\n[b][u]Overall - 10[/u][/b] - You spend just enough time exploring and poking around in boxes and burning piles of leaves/straw on the floor looking for treasure with interspersed combat to keep things from getting to tedious or boring.  Level layout is good.  Just complex enough in places to make you feel a little lost, without being too difficult to actually find your way through.  \n\nDo yourself a favor and make this game happen.", "timestamp_created": 1512344351, "timestamp_updated": 1512344409, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.604216", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38041777": {"recommendationid": "38041777", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047765040", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1057, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491441412}, "language": "english", "review": "Love this game. easy enough to beat in a couple hours.

Control wise, it's very smooth and fluid, and barring the times the controllers got lost (due to myself being in the way of the sensors), the mechanics and swordplay feel really well done. The tone of the game is well established, and although not quite to my personal taste, still well done.\n\nMy only major issue is that there's no way to turn around without physically turning your body, which caused the disconnection of the controllers. If our HMDs were wireless, this wouldn't be an issue, but due to the current limitations of being tethered to our computers, it's practically imparitive that we are able to use the controller to turn (via a joystic on the touch controllers, or on of the vive's trackpads). \n\nSomething else I'd like to see is smooth locomotion as an option. I should be able to move out of the way of the enemy's attacks without having to teleport. I know teleportation is a major gameplay neccessity for those gamers who get motion sickness, but for those of us who don't, smooth locomotion give a much more immersive experience. \n\nThere are other tweaks and improvements that could be made, for example the UI seems a little odd in my opinion, having to look down while in a fight to check your health. A suggestion i could make would be to layer a health/mana bar in the top left corner of the player's view so they could look at it when they need to, without losing focus on the enemy. This was done successfully with your score in RoboRecall, where you would look at the bottom corner to check your points, without actually moving your head. \n\nAlthough I definitely have suggestions, and there's only one major issue I can see, this game is definitely worth it's salt and the creators should be proud.

Even without the torch there was only one place i struggled to see clearly. sounds and music added to the dungeon feel. Kudos to the designers.\n\nGame play was very enjoyable with accurate aiming and pinpoint swordplay. you are not going to wildly swing your weapon and expect results. The peril level is fairly low with very few \"startling moments\" an no \"horror\" , making this adventure excellent for children. As an adult and veteran gamer I may have asked for more but that is not a criticism. \n\nThere were some times that melee  felt a little lackluster. Here's why.....\nEnemies were for the most part activated by proximity not line of sight. you could often stand quite close and just stare at them, so they lacked a \"threatening\" attitude. It was also easy to stay out of the areas of multiple enemies and engage them one at at time, and too easy to run away. Maybe slow the teleport dot even more than it already moves ( a good feature that is a clever way simulate player run speed)\n\nLastly, while there were elements of puzzle play most were easy (very easy) and the bosses posed only moderate challenge. I never ran out of health and had ample food to regenerate.

I do have suggestions though.  And this may not be what you want for your game but I think it would add so much to your next chapters.  More traps.  Maybe snakes in vases that give you 3 seconds to move or strike them and your posioned and die slow unless you rehealth up.  I like the health mechanism and feel it's not used enough.  Statue traps.  If you choose to grap an oddly placed gem on a huge statue it comes to life and strikes you.  Maybe you can't kill it.  You just need to get out of the room once you grab the gem or you're dead.  How bout since you've added climbing, a snake or monkey falls on the rope as your climbing across. If you don't slay it without cutting the rope you fall and die.  I realize these additions could make players move quickly and you may be trying to avoid that so if this is something of a concern then maybe only put these in the hard setting.

For a mere $13.99 (current sale price) you get a game that pushed the boundaries of what one could expect in a VR title.  This is a complete VR experience.  Don't let the negative reviews or the status of EA or lack of constant updates stop you from getting this game.  This is a MUST buy VR title.  If you own a Vive, Oculus, whatever, you owe it to yourself to experience this game.\n\nA lot of the negative reviews mention locomotion.  Well, you're not teleporting anymore unless you want to.  You can mostly move freely using your touch controller's joystick.  It's not perfect, you have to click down to go faster or to turn. But it's done very well. \n\nA lot of the other negative reviews mention lack of updates.  Well, this game is pretty much a finished product.

I have not experienced any bugs on the Oculus Rift w/ Touch.\n\nThe dungeons are so well designed and intuitive.  The puzzles are logical (no having to search for a  key that's hidden in some vase under a cabinet type crap).  The riddles are creative (yes, riddles).  You have different tools at your disposal, including food, pickaxe, torch, sword, shield, bow & arrow, or wand.  Also, climbing up the ropes or chains is just so much fun to get that extra bit of loot or spoiler alert [spoiler] burning curtains to get the items hidden beneath or breaking barrels with your sword to get more coins [/spoiler]\n\nAdmittedly, the weakest part of the game is probably the melee combat.  I didn't find it very challenging.  But I did enjoy using the bow and arrow.

Dud\u00e9 un poco por dos cosas. Primero, el juego est\u00e1 en early access. Y segundo, solo da soporte a HTC Vive. Pero os puedo decir que el juego es perfectamente jugable. No he encontrado a\u00fan nig\u00fan motivo para el estado de early access, excepto un peque\u00f1\u00edsimo parpadeo al teletransportarse. Segundo, el juego es completamente compatible con Oculus rift + oculus touch (con la configuracion experimental de 360 grados con dos sensores). Simplemente ver\u00e1s en tus manos los mandos de Vive al principio, aunque r\u00e1pidamente ser\u00e1n una bola de luz con la que puedes hacer todo lo que haces con los mandos de htc vive. As\u00ed que si tienes oculus no tendr\u00e1s problemas para jugar. \n\nAdicionalmente es recomendable un area de juego de al menos 2x2m pero no es obligatoria. Tienes un teletransportador que te permite jugar en un area un poco menor. \n\nEl juego est\u00e1 en ingl\u00e9s sin subt\u00edtulos. Para mi no es un gran problema, aunque he visto que los acertijos te dan las pistas en un ingl\u00e9s con rimas que puede ser un poco dificil de entender para algunas personas. A\u00fan as\u00ed no hay mucho texto en el juego, as\u00ed que no es que te vayas a pasar todo el d\u00eda mirando el diccionario. \n\nEn lo referente al juego en s\u00ed es bastante inmersivo, Me sorprendi\u00f3 mucho verme a mi mismo esquivando flechas, poni\u00e9ndome en guardia frente a un enemigo.

I felt very immersed and rather surprised at the depth the enemies had when fighting. I had to learn the move sets of each enemy and know how to properly defend and attack. Looking for openings was the most fun because the enemies even adapted to my fighting style. They would cover and dodge almost as well as the player can. The layout of the dungeons were rather fun to explore. I often found myself wondering if I was going to stumble into a place I wasnt yet prepared for. The map design does a rather good job of encouraging exploration and discovering secrets. Finding all the hidden treasures was my favorite activity because hiding spots become so much harder when you actually have to duck behind things and look above into the rafters. I was throwing rocks before I bought a bow to knock items off of ledges. The things in this game are rather simple in comparison to a AAA RPG but experiencing them makes all the difference. These simple activities become very fun. Seeing a video does not do this game justice, it must be experienced in VR. The art style is also well done in my opinion and is pretty to look at while not making the enemies completely horrifying. While I thouroughly enjoyed this game and it is my favorite. I did feel it was lacking. I just want more, more to explore, more secrets to find, more to discover, more enemyu types, more locomotion options, other NPCs to interact with and buy from. It has a decent weapon selection and the inventory and player information system is by far the most natural and intuitive than any other game I have played. I just want more because it is so good. However considering, as far as I am aware, that this game is made by as single developer I am quite impressed with the game in its current state.

This game is awesome! I can't believe I put off acquiring it for so long! And I can't believe I still think it's awesome now, when it came out way back when Vive was brand new and the bar for content was so low.\n\nThis is really excellent. I just spent 90 minutes in it for what was supposed to be a quick look around and just...couldn't leave.\n\nOk. Criticism. The swordplay feels a bit arcade-like. And it's got the same problem that sword fighting games always have in VR. And I think I have some advice, that I've been handing out to every developer I've found who's working on this kind of thing.\n\nChange your swordfighting mechanic so that it's like when you draw the sword you go into an altered state.\n\nObviously, this means slow motion. Which is how we all instinctively did sword fighting when we were kids. Because you aren't going to have serious swordplay at real sword-swinging speeds and be able to actually intercept stabs and slashes in a realistic way. Not at speed. Which leaves us with this really imprecise version of swordfighting that's been dumbed down. But that takes the joy out of the swordfight itself! I mean, it's still cool because you're in a mystic cave and you're fighting a skeleton and so on, but the swordfighting part gets old fast because of everything I just described.\n\nSo slow it down. Make the swordfight work on a flexible timescale very much like the basic mechanic in SuperHot. When you pick up your sword, everything should slow down to timescale slaved to how fast you move. And if you try to stab your sword through their shield or armor or a wall (i.e., you don't stop swinging when it hits a barrier and you see sparks fly and the controller buzzes in your hand or whatever), you drop your sword and have to duck down and scoop it up (which isn't life threatening in slow-motion...but it's a setback and you probably won't do it too many times in a row).\n\nThen you can make the hitpoints go way, way up in both directions - a hard slash across the belly should be fatal (for the player or the NPC's). Smooth out and polish the animations a bit so they pass muster in slow motion. That especially goes for the animations when you kill them. Maybe work in some halfway-there maiming scripting - if you cut off an arm or leg, they're pretty much done for, but not before they make one or two last clumsy attempts to kill you with their remaining limbs.

bislang gespielt habe.\n\nHier meine positiven und negativen Punkte des Spiels. Unten dran h\u00e4nge ich dann auch noch einige weitere Ideen, welche ich h\u00e4tte.\n\nPositiv:\n+ Grafik im Comicstil. Man taucht schon in der ersten Sekunde vollkommen ein in diese Welt.\n+ Gameplay. Die Waffen funktionieren unglaublich gut und die Schl\u00e4ge sind sehr Pr\u00e4zise. Man hat das Gef\u00fchl, man w\u00fcrde       tats\u00e4chlich ein Schwert f\u00fchren oder mit dem Bogen zielen\n+ Shops. Es gibt mehrere kleine \"Shops\" in denen man verschiedene Waffen kaufen kann.\n+ Waffenarsenal. Die vielfalt an Waffen ist unglaublich gut. Es gibt 3 verschiedene Schweter, einen Hammer, 2 B\u00f6gen, einen Zauberstab (Der Mana ben\u00f6tigt) eine 2-Hand Axt und nat\u00fcrlich einen Schild\n+ Atmosph\u00e4re. Die Atmosph\u00e4re ist d\u00fcster gehalten und stimmt zum Setting.\n+ Mining. Man bekommt im Verlauf des Spiels eine Spitzhacke, mit der man Erze abbauen kann. (Die Erze werden entweder zu Gold oder zu Mana)\n+ Das 1. Kapitel. Das erste Kapitel ist unglaublich Detailverliebt, man findet \u00fcberall interessante Dinge und kommt h\u00e4ufig aus dem Staunen nicht raus. (meine Spielzeit betrug f\u00fcr das 1. Kapitel knapp 3,5 Std. was aber auch daran lag, dass ich mir Zeit f\u00fcr das Spiel genommen habe und nicht durchgerusht bin)\n+ Teleportieren. Ich hatte nicht ein einziges Mal einen Anflug von Motionsickness.\n+ Die Gegner. Es ist ein unbeschreibliches Gef\u00fchl vor den Gegner zu stehen. Besonders die Minibosse, welche gut 2,5 - 3m gro\u00df sind, sind beeindruckend!\n+ Die K\u00e4mpfe. Wenn man mit dem Schwert nicht gerade hin- und herwedelt als sei es ein Staubf\u00e4nger sind die K\u00e4mpfe wahnsinnig gut. Spielt man das Spiel mit Blocken/Parieren - Angreifen, dann fordert einen jeder Kampf aufs neue. Ich habe immer darauf geachtet, was der Gegner als n\u00e4chstes plant, den Angriff bestm\u00f6glichst mit dem Schild geblockt oder dem Schwert/Hammer pariert und dann zugeschlagen. Unglaubliches Gef\u00fchl!\n\nNegativ:\n- Das 2. Kapitel. Nach dem unglaublich guten Start des 1. Kapitels ist das 2. dann wirklich eine gro\u00dfe Entt\u00e4uschung. Meine Spielzeit betrug gute 30 Minuten, dann war es schon vorbei. Es ist leider nur eine Arena mit allen bekannten Gegnern, welche Wellenartig mit einem im Ring stehen.\n- Die 2-Hand-Axt. Das K\u00e4mpfen mit dieser Waffe ist eine einzige Tortur. Ich verstehe die Idee dahinter, aber es funktioniert leider so gar nicht :( Schade.\n- Nach einem Neustart des Spiels \"spawnen\" alle Erze und \u00c4pfel etc. wieder in der Welt. Das macht einige Erfolge etwas unsinnig.\n\n\nMeine Ideen f\u00fcr Chapter 3 oder Upgrades von Chapter 1&2\n\u25cb Crafting. Man bekommt schon im Spielverlauf eine Spitzhacke in die Hand gedr\u00fcckt, wieso also nicht auch verschiedene Erze abbauen k\u00f6nnen und vielleicht an einer Schmiede (Welche irgendwo eingebaut werden k\u00f6nnte) sich seine eigenen Waffen bauen?\n\u25cb Interaktion mit den Feuerschalen. H\u00e4ufig findet man Feuerschalen in einem Raum, das Entz\u00fcnden bewirkt leider gar nichts. Die Schalen k\u00f6nnte man auch daf\u00fcr benutzen um G\u00e4nge freizuschalten oder T\u00fcren zu \u00f6ffnen, statt immer einen Schl\u00fcssel oder Hebel zu suchen\n\u25cb NPC's in Shops. Was mir sehr gut gefallen w\u00fcrde w\u00e4ren NPC's mit denen man interagieren muss um Gegenst\u00e4nde zu erwerben.\n", "timestamp_created": 1490556467, "timestamp_updated": 1490556467, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30753256": {"recommendationid": "30753256", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972246176", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 316, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501591651}, "language": "english", "review": "Best VR Game in my opinion!", "timestamp_created": 1490540920, "timestamp_updated": 1490540921, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30709270": {"recommendationid": "30709270", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970712562", "num_games_owned": 320, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 650, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494722247}, "language": "english", "review": "Ever wanted to actually be Link, inside of a Zelda game?

Nope, instead it was the exact opposite. I'm being completely honest here, this game is literally one of the best VR games I've touched on the Vive, all bullsh*t aside. The only other game I've played that actually felt like a FULL game and not a tech demo experience was Lucky's Tale on the Oculus Rift. \n\nVanishing Realms took me almost 6 hours to beat, and while that may sound small, that's actually pretty long for a VR title. Honestly I became so immersed in the game that it felt a little bit longer than it actually is due to the sense of presence. In this game you actually FEEL like you're in another world due to the sense of presence, which is most VR titles I think, but this game actually makes you feel like you're a warrior on a quest in a virtual world, it feels legit. The graphics are a bit cartoony but honestly who gives a sh*t? Not this guy.\n\nYou fight skeleton warriors, mages, bosses, etc. You can mine ore, use a magic wand, use 3 different types of swords, an axe, hammer, 2 different bows. There's traps to avoid, chalices to collect, not really any puzzles (personally I hate puzzles). The game seems super easy at first, but it starts to get quite challenging. It's not too difficult, but difficult enough that you can't just stand there like a statue swinging your vive controller like an idiot, it requires a bit of tactic and you actually feel like you're fighting a real battle. The enemy AI isn't that great and seems a bit cheap-ish, but I think fighting in this game feels really nice regardless. I used mostly sword, shield, and a bow. The enemies try to swing at you in different ways with their weapons if you fight up close, you can block the incoming attacks with your sword or shield and it feels like you're actually blocking everything, it's very responsive. The game will make you move around a bit (if you have space), and potentially make you work up a sweat lol\n\nI applaud the devs for this, you guys did a really good job. The game isn't super amazing, but it's still a really well made VR title that deserves some attention I think. This is probably the closest thing you're gonna get to an \"Elder Scrolls\", \"Legend of Zelda\" kind of experience on VR at the moment, and for 20 bucks it's not bad.

The enemy designs are all really cool too. Threatening in a cartooish way that doesn't come off as silly.\n\nWhat this game nails though is the overall mood and feel of each area. The spooky castles, the swamps, grand halls filled with fire mages. Each new fight is a new challenge and the backdrops can really add to the tension in some areas.\n\nI've played through the campaign twice now (and will be going through again on Hard Mode soon).

There are only so many wave shooters you can play before you need a taste of something sweeter. Vanishing Realms is the cake, with the cherry on top.\n\nI love the enviroments and spent an age just gazing up at the sky or celling. The game experience may be short but I had a blast from the opening screen right to the end. It's the little touches that I loved. That gold cup stood high up on a plinth. Grab a rock, knock the bugger down. Trophy trapped on a wall in a web, burn it free. I felt involved. In an early part of the game I was laying on the floor crawling past some axe's, much to my wife's amusement. The wand feels great to use, blocking attacks with your sword or shield is cool, but the bow and arrow for me is the stand out weapon in the game. It just felt right.\n\nSure it's not perfect. Combat feels a little simple. Definitely helps to have a large play area. Mine is fairly large at 2m x 4m and the 2m can cause movement issues. You will find yourself teleporting often just to get where you need to be, but please don't let that put you off. I have played in a 2m x 2m area before I relocated the vive and it still plays fine.\n\nTo sum up. Buy this game. If you don't enjoy the genre then walk around the area's and look about.

I can only imagine in 5 years time the way VR is going we're going to have more games like this featuring multiplayer, playable classes and much bigger open worlds.\n\nVanishing Realms is essentially a dungeon crawl hack and slash game with combat, looting and puzzles there isn't any real story or character leveling though. You explore a vast dungeon/castle solving puzzles and collecting treasure which allows you to buy various weapons and armour along the way to help fight skeletons and other monsters. Combat is fun featuring melee and ranged but difficulty wise only a few of the enemies are hard.\n\nThink Knightmare mixed with a little bit of Zelda and you have this game!\n\nThe combat features blocking and attacking in various ways like stabbing and slashing with range weapons as an option like bows. As I said the combat is not highly skilled by normal RPG standards but it's still very fun and engaging requiring timing to block or dodge attacks. I can only imagine what I must look like in my VIVE swinging my hand around to stab and raising my other hand to block with my shield. The standard enemies are simple enough to beat but the bosses and bigger ones prove more difficult. That said when you encounter more than one enemy at a time it keeps you on your toes.\n \nThis game has all the usual dungeon crawler puzzles and challenges to workout along the way. The fact the devs added climbing and different movement options recently has made the game better. I'd love to see character classes and more open world stuff added one day.\n\nI initially downloaded a torrent copy but after my first 20 minutes I went and bought it and I am happy to support the developer if they make more games of this standard.

Das Teleportieren hilft gerade am Anfang sich an VR zu gew\u00f6hnen im Gegensatz zu Titeln wie Yore VR oder Onward. \nDie Motionsickness ist je nach Spieler bei Vanishing Realms abh\u00e4ngig. Mir machte es nach 2 Std nix mehr aus also eine 2/10 f\u00fcr Motionsickness. (Durch das Game wurde auch meine Motionsickness bei Spielen wie Onward besser also Trainingsgame falls ihr Motionsickness anf\u00e4llig seid)\n\nSpielerlebnis\n\nes gibt viel zu entdecken in Vanishing Realms. \u00dcber Geheime R\u00e4ume bis zu versteckten Gegenst\u00e4nden. Und sogar ein Schatzkarten R\u00e4tsel. Es gibt Spitzhacken zum Abbau von Material. Achivment Gegnest\u00e4nde. uvm.\nDie Gegner sind unterschiedlich man muss sich einstellen. Es gibt \"Standart Soldaten\", \"Hauptm\u00e4nner\" , \"Zwischenbosse/Berserker\", Und auch Heiler und Magier. Also f\u00fcr Abwechslung ist gesorgt. \n\nGegner sind zwar meist wenig bewegungsfreudig vor allem die Standartgegner aber.... nach einigen Versuchen sie mit nem Bogen zu snipern waren ihre Ausweich Dashes 1a. Auch die Angriffscombos der \"Hauptm\u00e4nner\" bleiben zwar relativ gleich aber sie haben 2-3 Moves die einen echt in Bedr\u00e4ngnis bringen. Also man brauch schon einen Gewissen Platz um auf die Angriffe zu reagieren. Ich w\u00fcrde die Spielzone definitiv auf 2 x 2 Meter einrichten. Sonst gibts bei st\u00e4rkeren Gegnern wie z.B Berserker da ihr euch viel bewegt probleme das ihr irgendwo gegen klatscht.\n\nSound\nSehr stimmig. Es gibt keine Fehler wie fehlende Sounds oder Delays. Die Stimmen die verwendet werden passen sehr gut tragen gut zum erleben dieser Welt bei. \n\nGrafik\n\nFinde sie erinnert mich vom Aussehen her an Torchlight. Finde sie aber sehr stimmig und passend es gibt 1-2 Sachen die mir aufgefallen sind wo man paar Probleme merkt aber im Gegnsatz zu anderen Early Access Titeln ist das echt zu vergeben. Die Gegner sind sch\u00f6n gestaltet wenn man den Stil mag Und auch Landschaftlich finde ich die Grafik ansprechend. Sonst h\u00e4tte das Spiel es nicht geschafft mich volle 4 Stunden zu fesseln.\n\nFazit\n\nSolides Early Access Spiel wenn man sich erstmal in VR zurecht finden muss und erstmal gucken will was die Spiele k\u00f6nnen. Die 19,99 \u20ac sind finde ich gerechtfertigt es kommen ja noch Episoden dazu. Und finde es gibt andere VR Games die Early Access sind und nen Haufen Geld verlangen aber ich finde ungerechtfertigt. 30 - 40 \u20ac f\u00fcr paar Level oder sogar nur eins ist ein wenig viel \u00dcbertreibung\n\nAlso klare Produkt Empfehlung.\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1487681494, "timestamp_updated": 1487681494, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30071783": {"recommendationid": "30071783", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966535390", "num_games_owned": 452, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 588, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506289324}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the game I dreamed about when I first saw VR back in college when it cost 100s of thousands dollars for the technology.

They were building something that we all desperatly wanted.  They were the first in an emerging technology and art form.   As expected the games were limited by the tech, rough around the edges, and simplistic in the delivery.  There needed a forgiving partnership that filled the hours with enjoyment.  I the consumer would contribute to the game as I played.  I would flesh out their stories, fill in the gaps and use my imagination to create things that were not there to imerse myself in the world they created.  \n\nAs I play Vanishing Realm I feel like this partnership is a chief requirement to my experience.  Vanishing Realm is once again the realization of a child of the 80s dream.  Like I was so many years ago I find myself needing to fill in the gaps and flesh out the world to make it work.  \n\nVanishing It is obviously a small project, in an emerging technology, by an indie developer.  As expected it is short in content, rough on the edges, and simplistic in the delivery.  If I left it there my sleep-deprived-UltimaIV younger self would die a painful death.  With the short comings aside this game is absolutly a thrill that I have been waiting for years to play.  It is everything I hoped a VR RPG could be, and sets the stage for so much more to come.  This game plucks the heart strings of my 80s inner child.  It is that dream of D&D on the computer and playing in a fantasy world turned into being inside the RPG game.\n\nWhen I play vanishing realm I see the past, the present and the future at the same time and it is a glorious experience.

The backstory to this particular chapter involves some lost realm in dire need of exploring and an undead king that\u2019s become a nuisance of some sort. Oh, and lots of skeletons.\n\nInitially the game presents itself as a bit of a puzzle-solver but after some exploring and coin collecting you eventually get your first weapon and are plunged into combat. The sword swinging mechanic requires that you make short quick movements with your wrist or arm for the game to register it as an attack. The angle of attack matters as well since most enemies will parry or block your attacks if you swing into their defenses rather than waiting for an opening to strike. That isn\u2019t to say that silly tactics like dual wielding swords and swinging wildly aren\u2019t still feasible, but you will also take a lot of damage in the exchange.\n\nBe forewarned that this particular VR title has a history of performance issues, many of which I resolved simply by disabling running processes (windows update is a big culprit) to get CPU usage down to under 20% and also setting the CPU priority of the program to high in the task manager. You will likely still see some significant FPS drops in certain areas but it will be way more manageable. Obviously having a cutting-edge rig (e.g. anything with components better than my older i5 and gtx 980) will also mitigate these issues and you can always check the community discussions if you are unsure.\n\nAnyways, I\u2019m glad to have stuck with this game after initially trying to refund it (for the aforementioned issues). It\u2019s pretty fun and yet another good game for showing off what the vive can do since it features melee and ranged combat along with exploration and puzzle solving all in a very nicely detailed environment.

Not as hard core as either as you don't move per block as grimrock with hardcore puzzles nor do enemies come charging at you. You can dodge easily with well timed teleports thus the immersion of full rpg like skyrim is not there along with enemies only being triggered at their areas.\n\nI think this is where vanishing realms shines, it knows the sacrifice it is taking, making gameplay as such, because it wants to deliver exactly what I described above and to be honest, I do prefer to have one RPG reflecting Legend of Grimrock more in VR, and this game is probably it if it had more levels, more intricate stories, more spells, more complex around the chapter puzzles, more bosses, more maps and the ability to combine at least one type of thing, say a rune/gem or crafting certain consumable items or even quest items, might as well add more diverse quest items.

And I played a lot of VR games so far.\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n\n+ the most immersive experience yet, never have I felt so involved in all of the gameplay and atmosphere\n+ combat is spot on, you can block, you hit enemies and everything feels so good and right\n+ various weapons\n+ a lot of optional secrets\n+ various enemies to fight\n+ its not just about hitting foes, you also have to evade traps and use your wit\n+ inventory system is sweet, you got everything on your belt\n+ loot is everywhere and you really have to look for it, I absolutley loved that, turning skulls and stuff to find some coins\n+ you can use your gold coins to buy stuff\n+ dungeons and leveldesign looks cool\n+ no hand-holding, you gotta figure out stuff by yourself\n+runs very smooth and I had no technical issues whatsoever\n+ they included an awesome system that will stop the game and ask you to go back to the center of your playarea, so you wont hit a wall (because you move a lot)\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n\n- I played it through in 3,5 hours with additional exploration, which is a little bit short\n- enemies will sometimes strangely keep some distance and do nothing, which you can exploit to kill them, but I never did that, you just have to roleplay and get your sword out and fight like a man\n\n- I sadly have to say that it doesnt have as much replayability, there is a hardcore mode, but in the end its a one time experience I think\n\n\nI absolutley love this game, its seriously the best you can get on Vive. Everything feels so right and behaves like you would expect. If only this game had procedurally generated dungeons or a map editor, so you could download other players adventures, that would have made this game legendary. I wanted more immediatley after finishing it.

Amazing!\n\nGraphics are crisp and well-defined.\nThe game itself has some puzzle elements, but nothing too complicated.  (E.G. Figure out how to get to a treasure, Find a key, figure out a riddle, etc)\nSkill-based fighting \n- Melee: If your opponent swings high, you block or parry directly on their blade or duck.  Try to counter when you can see something open or just wait for the opportune time\n- Ranged:  Using a bow and arrow feels really natural, there's no hiccups trying to grab the bow or nock an arrow, it's simply draw, aim and loose.  Having a ranged battle involves doing some ducking and moving or using short teleports between cover.\n- Magic:  Not really implemented (at the time of this review) beyond a wand you'll have to buy during your travels.  It operates much the same as a fired explosive following an arced trajectory.\nGreat ambiance and fitting mood for the area you're in.\nThe ending really made you feel like you accomplished something.  Granted, right now there is only one chapter to the game (rite of steel), but it's a pretty long one!\nSwitching between weapons was a bit cumbersome at times since you have to look down at your belt while you fumble for your weapon.  In a few situations where you're surprised, that's nearly a death sentence.\nCombat difficulty scaled as you play through the chapter.  Their moves became more complicated and faster with less hints at which way they would swing.  Overall it was still fairly easy if you have a shield.  Multiple enemies without a shield is pretty much a death sentence.\n\nThis is the type of game we dreamed about as kids.

Some thoughts:\n\nPros:\n- Blocking attacks with the shield or parrying with a sword / hammer / axe is a lot of fun. You can even pretend you're Legolas and dodge arrows, which is really cool. You can also block arrows, which will stick to your shield for a while.\n- Enemies are fairly varied. There are lots of variations for the standard sword & shield guys.\n- The one really big boss fight towards the end is fun, and will get your blood pumping.\n- You not only get melee weapons, but bows and a magic wand as well.\n- You can finally mine rocks in VR :P\n- You can dual wield swords, or a combination of other weapons.\n- There is a 2-handed axe, which is interesting to use.\n\nCons:\n- Swordplay is not nearly as tight as it could be. Actually landing hits on enemies can be.. Hit and miss. Their hitboxes are pretty bad, in my opinion. When you get used to it and don't flail about like an idiot though (like I tend to do) - it's not too bad.\n- Maybe I just suck, but using the bow well is very hard. I'll add that I have no problems whatsoever in the archery demo in The Lab (played that one quite a bit).\n- Teleportation. I personally dislike this; probably because I don't get motion sick when playing games with analog movement.\n- Backtracking is a pain because of the teleportation movement system. Oh, how I wish devs would implement alternative control schemes. The touch pads on the Vive controllers would be just fine for moving forwards and back. The Oculus Touch controllers are probably even better for this.\n\nSummary (TLDR):\nIf you like RPG's and have a VR headset, you should probably buy this.

If you wanted to experience an adventure, solve puzzles and fight monsters, this is the game for you.\n\nSound/Graphics:\nTo me, I love the style and how everything in the game looks.  They style is kind of cartoony and it works really well for this game.  There is a \"level\" or area inside of a crypt that is flooded and from the water dripping to the echos of distant noises plus the need to use a torch to help with the darkness, this game really hits the mark.  In areas where you are exploring outside, you can hear the crickets chirp whil looking at the dark moon light things up.  It is a beautifully well done game and an amazing VR experience\n\nInterface:\nThe developer really hit a home run on this one.  From the moment I jump inot the game, everything is very intuitive and self explainitory.  There is a tutorial level to get you going for new users but I would love to see this type of interfacing as the norm for adventure games.  Pulling items from your inventory, dropping and movement is extremely simple and really helps you to forget that you are in a game.  The simplicity really helps with immersion combined with the sound and the graphics, I really felt like I was in this world, even after taking off the VR headset.  Well done!\n\nGameplay:\nI have read people compare this to Zelda type games, which is one way to describe it.  the way I see it is, if you took an old school point and click adventurgame like Lucas Arts or the old Sierra games, converted it to a 3D VR space and added additional elements of combat, this is Vanishing Realms.  It was so fun to play (I spent about 3 hours from start to finish trying to explore every nook and cranny) there are so many \"hidden\" things to do in this game from looking in the hollow part of a log to find treasure to solving riddles and finding solutions to progress to other areas.  This aspect is very immersive and fun.  I caint wait to see more from this game and I hope other adventrue games follow suit with Vanishing Realms\n\nCombat:\nCombat is split into two categories, melee and ranged and I must say, I was pretty impressed by the combat and the AI.  In melee, you may get a few hits in if you start randomly swinging at a monster, but they block, set back and move out of your way so you can't use that as a go to strategy.  The different monsters do have patterns and once you figure it out (by watching how they hold their sword, and if you react quick enough, you can easily defeat the monsters.  It takes time to learn this, makinc one on one combat a joy... that leads to much more challenging scenarios when you face multiple opponents at the same time.  You really need to look and block and move and avoid being surrounded in order to win otherwise they will chop you up like diced tomatoes ;) this is where you need group based combat strategies... i.e. move arround your opponents and do not get surrounded... you can also use other enemies to help kill each other.  I was fighing a Giant skeleton, who has a ball and chain type weapon with a few other skeleton creatures facing me.  I would manuver myself between a smaller skeleton and the swining ball and chain from the giant one, and have him crush my opponents for me. It was fun and you have to try it :) you can also pick between dual wield, sword and shield and two handed weapons, which really change up how you play and works great in different scenarios.\n\nRanged combat is well though out and I really felt like I was pulling back on a bow.  If you try to shoot monsters from a distance, they will move or block and, while you have unlimited arrows, it can be pretty challenging to bring a creature down that is protected and is moving out of your way.  Using the terrain around you to protect from incoming projectiles was another fun and tactical way to deal with enemies from a distance that were shooting back at you.  I know I spent more time on melee combat but doing things like shooting apples from a tree, cutting wires with my arrows to give me access to a bridge or shooting pesky mage ghosts as fireballs streak past me... this was insanley fun.\n\nOver all:\nGet this game, you will not be disappointed :) \n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1483294899, "timestamp_updated": 1483294899, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28906522": {"recommendationid": "28906522", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032539426", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483628976}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u9019\u662f\u76ee\u524d\u73a9\u904e\u6700\u597d\u7684VR\u5192\u96aa\u985e\u904a\u6232\uff0c\u8cb7\u4e86\u7d55\u4e0d\u6703\u5f8c\u6094", "timestamp_created": 1483285303, "timestamp_updated": 1483285303, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478833", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28900473": {"recommendationid": "28900473", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963988521", "num_games_owned": 1516, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 35, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483272503}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game, one of the best VR experiences.", "timestamp_created": 1483273121, "timestamp_updated": 1483273121, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28895533": {"recommendationid": "28895533", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027285180", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 199, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507579014}, "language": "english", "review": "Great example of what future RPGs can build upon for VR.

There's a section in game where there were a number of ore clusters around, and I was wondering if I would be able to mind them later on. Sure enough, a few areas later I found a few pickaxes.\n\nPuzzles were challenging, but didn't make me want to take the headset off and quit.\n\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n\nPresently in game, there's an auto-pause feature. This may have been more of an issue with my cobbled settup, but I was experiencing the auto-pause going off a lot during combat and exploration, despite me not going out of sight of my base stations. I tried turning it off, but whenever I did go out of range of my base stations I got pwnt by the enemies.\n\nCombat is good for the most part, but hit detection needs a lot of work. I managed to complete both chapters, but not without combat grinding to a halt because of auto-pauses, or constantly having to flail and reposition due to the auto-pause throwing my character out of position, and rendering me unable to hit anything.\n\nCall me a noob, but I was having extreme issues with archery at long range. There's a section where you need to fight a skeleton wizard, a skeleton cleric, and a skeleton juggernaught. Attacking the fire wizard or the juggernaut doesn't work because the cleric  heals them. Trying to dodge fireballs and hit the cleric repetedly was almost impossible due to how archery works. I wish there was a proper sight on the bow, or at least something to assist with aim.\n\nLater on in game you have the opertunity to gain a two-handed axe as a weapon. While it deals good damage, I found myself going back to my battleworn sword that was dealing less damage due to the outright clunkyness of the mechanics. Again, this may have been an issue with my settup rather than a game issue.\n\nInventory management for weapons was something that I almost tore my hair out at. Trying to swap from sword to axe, or vice versa, was a trial in patience, since if you click on the axe with your sword equiped, it causes them to stack rather than swap. I ended up getting hit a lot because I was trying to swap to my sword, and ended up stacking it on top of the axe, leaving my unarmed in my main hand, rather than swapping to the proper weapon.\n\n\n\nAll in all, Vanishing Realms is a good game, but it does suffer from issues that can be solved with a bit more polish, and a bit more work setting up your play area.\n", "timestamp_created": 1483128734, "timestamp_updated": 1483128734, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28840928": {"recommendationid": "28840928", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962037068", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3203, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484455045}, "language": "english", "review": "This has been my favorite VR game to play so far. The ambiance in the game makes you feel like you're really alone in a dark magic world. A big part of that feeling comes from the ambient noises and music. Deep rumbling, droning noises, and occasionally noises from monsters in rooms nearby as you creep around. It's not a horror game but it will make you jump sometimes as a skeleton pops out of something unexpectedly.\n\nThe combat in the game is fun even though getting used to teleporting in combat is a little weird at first. I especially liked the enemy arhcers because it was unnerving seeing their arrows flying right at your face. I liked the rush as your instinct kicked in to prevent you from getting an arrow shot through your face because your brain didn't know it was only VR. I would have liked the enemies to be a bit more agressive in chasing me. I haven't tried the hard mode yet, maybe they do then?\n\nMining wasn't something I was expecting to see in this game but was pleasantly surprised. There is a lot of future potential here. Resource gathering and crafting would be cool. Another interesting concept to see in VR was the destroyable object: burning or smashing things to find hidden items. Lastly, some items were in plain sight but required solving a puzzle or finding a clever way to knock it down. I found myself picking up candles and throwing them at the ceiling knocking down goblets.

And that's the first and only negative aspect I see for this game: The overall play time you'll get for paying 20\u20ac. The first playthrough (Nearly non-stop, I just had to sleep and eat something on occasion..) provided me with nearly 4 hours of fun. A few euros less and you'll get a very polished and well made game for your bucks. Since I got this game during Steam's Winter Sale it cost me 14\u20ac which looks like a reasonal price to me. But this is nitpicking. Paying more than that just helps the developer to provide us with a third chapter.\n\nAnd this what I'm looking for. The third chapter. Or put simply, again, MOOAR content!\n\n- I want to smash bigger and more challenging creatures (Though, I have yet to play this game on \"Hard\" and fighting against multiple opponents IS already challenging!).\n- I want more stories which evolve the same way as the one from the first chapter. (And please, again using rimes which match the atmosphere so well!)\n- I want more (bigger?) items to throw around, maybe even ones you can utilize in combat. (Throwing a bottle at the enemy and then set him on fire using a torch...)\n- I want more magic. One wand is not enough. (Though there's magic, after all!)\n\nFor those who still hesitate:\n\n- You really need the required play space. I played the game on a 3.2mx1.7m space and if I had not only a couch which limits me to 1.7m but a solid wall I guess I already had to buy a new motion controller after the first fight. If not after the first 1 vs 1, then definitely after the first 1 vs 2 engagement.\n- The graphics are not what you'll see in the usual games today. It's rather a more modern Spyro or any similar jump'n'run from the past, graphic wise. But it's not the graphics what makes truly great games great! And that's even more the fact for this game.\n- The teleportation system works very well. It's not like in other games or \"demos\" and limits you how far you can teleport in a nice way. I can't properly describe it, but it just works and does not feel that different than using your own feet. And since the required play space is already fairly big, you'll have enough chances to use your own feet nonetheless.\n- It's VR.

I wish I had played it before Arizona Sunshine, then I would have rated it as an excellent game. Playtime approx 2hrs and I don't think I missed much (got all the chalices and shot half the apples off the trees)\n\nAlthough the gfx are cartoon there is a lot of good stuff in this game. Looting, Mining and setting fire to just about everything that looks like it will burn. The story is good and well thought out and the devs have turned a dungeon crawl into something compelling to play for 2hrs. The AI is not completely stupid as in other sword fighing titles. They back off, have a variety of attacks, dodge arrows and even push you back if you get too close (Bone Hulk). So all in all, good. As for the fighting, be careful you don't need to swing wildly and well timed, aimed strikes will enable you to take out your opponents quicker and with ease. The bow/arrow are good and the collision detection is excellent. The two handed poleaxe is... well, a little unwieldy as you would expect a 2H poleaxe. If you keep good distance its fine, but lacks the precision of the sword.\n\nI would like to see the devs expand this to include some spellcraft (casting runes in order to throw magic) and maybe multiplayer co-op.\n\n* SPOILER ALERT BELOW *\n\n\n\n\nThe only down side I found was that, as a cautious fighter, I entered most large areas with caution, the mobs spawn and I can then pepper them with arrows from range and they didn't advance on me. In the show down with the king I took out all the mobs and half the kings health from just inside the door way with my bow/wand. Note to devs: Maybe don't allow me unlimited arrows.

Wegen der Hoffnung auf solche Spiele habe ich mir eine VR-Brille zugelegt. \n\nHier werden die M\u00f6glichkeiten von VR in tollen Situationen aufzeigt, an welche ich noch immer zur\u00fcckdenken muss. Z.B. wenn man sich zum ersten mal bei einem PC Spiel dabei ertappt, wie man sich auf den Boden legt, um durch t\u00f6dliche Fallen hindurchzurobben und einen Schatz zu bergen oder sich kurz aus der Deckung herauswagt, seinen gespannten Pfeil abfeuert und wieder hinter der Ecke versteckt. \nBei schwereren Gegnern kommt man tats\u00e4chlich au\u00dfer Puste und turnt wie ein Irrer durch das Wohnzimmer, um Schl\u00e4gen auszuweichen und eigene zu platzieren. \nDas alles ist eingebettet in eine handgebaute wundervoll atmosph\u00e4risch d\u00fcstere Welt, welche sowohl Innen- als auch Au\u00dfenareale bietet, die  liebevoll gestaltet wurden und erst durch das Roomscaling richtig zum Leben erwachen. Die Grafik ist h\u00fcbsch anzusehen und wirkt sehr immersiv. \nIm Kampf gegen die verschiedenen Gegnerarten hat man unterschiedliche Waffen, welche man nach und nach gegen gesammeltes Gold eintauschen kann, das an den unterschiedlichsten Orten versteckt ist in Form von M\u00fcnzen, Pokalen und Edelsteinen. \nGesteuert wird das Ganze mit den Vive-Controllern, wobei jeder Controller einen Arm darstellt, sodass man beispielsweise Schwert und Schild halten kann, oder eben beispielsweise einen beidh\u00e4ndigen Bogen. \nWenn man es sich einfach machen will, dann kann man Gegner recht m\u00fchelos mit dem Bogen ausschalten, da die Gegner eine schlechte Wegfindung haben und sich quasi \u00fcberhaupt nicht an den Spieler ann\u00e4hern. Daher entwickelt das Spiel seine wirkliche St\u00e4rke im Nahkampfsystem, wenn man Gegner mit dem Schild oder Schwert pariert und dann zum Gegenangriff auf ungesch\u00fctzte Stellen ausholt, oder den Gegner umt\u00e4nzelt und von der Seite angreift. Die Gegner greifen zur Zeit relativ langsam an, was dennoch sehr viel Spa\u00df bereitet. \nSeit dem letzten Update gibt es jedoch einen Hardcore Modus, welcher daf\u00fcr sorgen soll, dass die Gegner den Spieler verfolgen, schnelller attackieren, Hiebe gezielt parieren und Combos einsetzen. Getestet habe ich das bisher noch nicht. Au\u00dferdem wird das Spiel durch Updates um neue Areale erweitert, welche auchim normalen Modus verf\u00fcgbar sind. \n\nDie Sendeboxen sollten f\u00fcr dieses Spiel gut ausgerichtet sein, damit sie die Controller auch in geduckter Haltung und an m\u00f6glichst jeder Ecke des Spielbereichs einfangen k\u00f6nnen, da sonst die Verbindung abbrechen kann. Den vom Spiel voreingestellten automatischen Pause-Modus f\u00fcr diesen Fall kann man im Spielmen\u00fc deaktivieren, was ich jedem empfehlen w\u00fcrde, da die Controller in der Regel sofort wieder gefunden werden und man meistens nichts davon mitbekommt. Die Pr\u00e4zision im Kampf ist beeindruckend, sodass man wirklich das glaubt die Wucht eines abgewehrten Schlages zu sp\u00fcren. \nDie Fortbewegung geschieht mittels Teleportation oder freiem Bewegen im verf\u00fcgbaren Raum. Das Teleportieren wirkt dabei nicht st\u00f6rend, Motion Sickness war bei mir ebenfalls kein Problem, wobei ich auch relativ unempflindlich daf\u00fcr bin. \n\nZum Spielumfang kann ich noch nicht viel sagen. Ich habe es noch nicht durchgespielt und zudem befindet es sich ja noch im Early Acces Modus. Dennoch bekommt man bereits jetzt ein toll ausgearbeitetes Spiel, welches manch bisher noch nicht erlebtes Spielgef\u00fchl aufkommen l\u00e4sst und den Preis meiner Meinung nach vollkommen rechtfertigt.

Being a fan of RPGs, all signs pointed to Vanishing Realms as being the game of choice. Several minutes in and I wasn't disappointed. This immersive environment, while having a slightly cartoonish, Dragon's Lair-type quality, was extremely fluid and believable. While it doesn't have the same level of interactivity of games like ES:Skyrim, there is enough to keep you conscious of your environment (it's easy to set your floor on fire if you carry that torch too low!).  \n\nI was extremely skeptical of the system of movement (teleporting) at first. Quickly I realized that with even a marginal play area, the mechanics worked very well. Being in the habit of smashing every container in site and wrecklessly grabbing every item in site with a mouse point or controller, the realistic action of picking up every item/coin/treasure and placing it in a \"pocket\" added a fun level of realism that made me appreciate the difficulty of being a \"hero\". \n\nCombat is simplistic, and yet precise all at the same time. There is a variety of weaponry, but I was fairly disappointed that there were no real physics or damage differences (that I was aware of) based on the weapon type (bashing hammer damage vs. slashing sword damage). I found the ability to duck and dodge while conducting archery combat to be extremely entertaining. The enemies become a little simplistic once you've gained some familiarity with the system, but the combinations present a challenge and keep things fresh.\n\nThe game has an intensity to it, when entering unknown caverns and labyrinths, that is completely lost in standard PC/Console gaming. Peeking shyly around corners, uncertain as to what surprise may lurk there. The sweat of actual combat! Hacking and slashing at a horde and wondering if maybe retreat is the right decision!\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Vanishing Realms! It's a quick playthrough and I'm anxious for additional content! The possibilities are incredibly exciting and worth the investment.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1481763958, "timestamp_updated": 1481763958, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.713298", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28362105": {"recommendationid": "28362105", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053037737", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 747, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 33, "last_played": 1515295014}, "language": "swedish", "review": "Absolutely fantastic game.

I've had lots fun and been amazed with The Blue and delighted with Google Earth, as well as numerous other titles.  I am 100% sold on VR, and am excited to begin my own development for the Vive platform.  (I'm an old software developer by profession.)\n\nOne of the titles that kept popping up online when I searched for top rated VR content was Vanishing Realms.  I was hesitant at the price at first, however, as I've discovered that there is a lot of content that, quite honestly, isn't enjoyable.  But, I'm a big \"sword & sorcery\" fan and Vanishing Realms gets lots of good reviews, so I paid my $20.00 and...  Promptly forgot all about it.\n\nA couple days later (yesterday, in fact) I was looking through my growing VR content library and saw that Vanishing Realms was in there.  I fired it up and put on the Vive headset.  That was a mistake...  I had a list of chores to do around the house and didn't get to any of them.\n\nThe first thing I noticed about Vanishing Realms was how polished it was, compared to other experiences I had sampled.  The Vanishing Realms menu system was very intuitive and responsive.  I often see some frame drops when using the Vive, but noticed none while playing Vanishing Realms.  I was worried that the somewhat \"cartoon\" (versus photo-realistic) graphics would detract from the experience, but I ended up really liking the graphics.  (The \"monsters\" were realistic enough to cause me to jump back in exclamation on more than one occasion!)  I'm afraid that trying to go too photo-realistic with the graphics would result in frame loss which would ultimately detract from the virtual reality experience rather than add to it.\n\nThe game's audio is great and really helped define the game's atmosphere, whether it be the sound of wind blowing, the crackle of a torch, or the clang of sword on sword.\n\nI was already somewhat familiar with the \"blink\" movement system from playing with The Lab, where it works very well.  It works equally well in Vanishing Realms, although, at times, it can make some combat \"too easy.\"  An arrow coming at you?  Just blink over a bit to dodge it.  Fighting a nasty creature hand-to-hand?  Blink in, hit, and blink out.  During gameplay, to \"even the odds,\" I tried to force myself not to blink too much in combat, as it seems like cheating in some way.\n\nSpeaking of movement, my play area is slightly smaller than the required 2m x 2m (I'm at 2m x 1.8m or so).  This did hamper my ability to reach certain items -- I would have to physically back up to the edge of my play area, and then blink closer to the object to be able to reach it.  This isn't the fault of the developer, however, and I am enlarging my play space which, I suspect, will solve this issue.  Also related to my smaller than required play space, sometimes, in the heat of \"battle,\" I would step out of bounds which paused the game, causing a brief \"disruption\" of the virtual reality play experience.\n\nI really like the inventory system in Vanishing Realms.  I like that it takes a moment to fumble around switching weapons in the face of an enemy -- it's much more realistic than just clicking a button on a control pad to switch from bow to sword.\n\nAs mentioned previously, I paid just at $20 for the game.  After playing the first chapter I consider my $20 very well spent.  When compared to the cost of going to see a movie (which lasts only a couple of hours), the cost for Vanishing Realms appears to be a bargain.  I would be willing to pay for additional chapters and/or expansions upon my completion of the game.\n\nAll in all, I don't have many complaints regarding Vanishing Realms.  Sure, I wish there was MORE (more levels, more monsters, more scenes, etc.), but, again, the game is only $20 (compared to $60 I've spent for Xbox One games).  I also wish that the game was more difficult, but I understand that it needs to be accessible to a large audience and not just hard-core \"swashbucklers\" like me.  As it is, I know that my 11-year old son will enjoy the game without getting frustrated that he is getting killed every scene. \n\nAll in all, I highly recommend the game and can't wait to play the next chapter.  I will also be keeping an eye out for updates and additional titles from the developer.", "timestamp_created": 1481220792, "timestamp_updated": 1481220792, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.652667", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28254299": {"recommendationid": "28254299", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031379352", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 550, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514450831}, "language": "german", "review": "Vanishing Realms ist eines meiner Lieblingsspiele f\u00fcr die HTC Vive, wenn nicht sogar das beste VR Spiel, dass ich bis dato gespielt habe.

The vivid lighting effects & majestic God rays are a sight to behold & made me stop on more than one occasion to take them in. The teleporting nature of gameplay feels good and controls become intuitive almost immediately. Shooting the bow is especially addictive & fun.

It's more like an  hour if you're speed-running on easy, and more like 4 - 5 if you're playing seriously on hard. You could easily stretch that into 10 (or even 16+ like me) by going through and really exploring on hard.

One of the best games for the Vive so far, and the best VR RPG hands down. Can't wait for the next installments.\n\nIt's short, but not too short. You won't get through it in a single session, most likely it will take several, depending on your VR stamina.\n\nPros:\n\n- Great use of the Vive with some interesting mechanics that play out really well, like throwing things to knock treasures off of high ledges, and the utility belt approach to inventory.\n\n- Several weapon choices that offer different playstyles for each one, from the sword & board, to the bow, to the dragon wand (nuclear option), and a couple of others. This lends some replayability to the game that otherwise might not be there... I want to replay it just to master the 2-handed battle axe, which is probably the toughest weapon to master in the game. Not due to poor design, it just takes some practice to get right, and your first time through you'll probably gravitate to the easier weapons.\n\n- Well-balanced gameplay. The difficulty seems appropriate at each level of the game, and it's never too easy or hard. By the time you hit the trials, you'll be swashbuckling and teleporting like it's second nature, but you'll still need to be fast on your feet while staying on top of your situational awareness to win.\n\n- It's got some flavor. Just the simple act of lighting all the candles and torches you find is deeply satisfying (plus there's an achievement for it). There's some treasure that's pretty well hidden too, look absolutely everywhere. Burn stuff. Shoot apples.\n\n- Combat is very fulfilling. Some of the enemies are downright tough, and order some replacement foam rings right now, because you're going to break a sweat. Sidestep to flank, teleport behind, low shot under the shield, duck and cover, come over the top with the battle axe... all valid tactics, and you're going to want to use them.\n\n- No stability problems or gameplay issues. Smooth and easy.\n\n- You haven't lived until you've dodged a fireball three inches from your face.\n\nNot much in the way of Cons, but I'll try:\n\n- It's linear. As mentioned before, the various weapons offer different playstyles for each, but essentially there is nothing procedural or random about the game. However, the overall experience is enough fun that I'll play it through a few more times anyway.\n\n- ALMOST too short, but I'm going to give Indimo a hall-pass here because, relatively speaking, it's the most fulfilling RPG out there so far IMO. They have also laid the groundwork for some really playable (and replayable) mechanics that I hope to see more of in future releases.\n\n- Some of the lore poetry is pretty hokey.\n\nAll in all, with the state of the art as it is, Vanishing Realms is an absolute must-buy, and hopefully soon turns into a franchise that I'll be sticking with for the duration.\n\nHighly recommended 9.5/10.", "timestamp_created": 1478991800, "timestamp_updated": 1478991800, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26563726": {"recommendationid": "26563726", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026800915", "num_games_owned": 399, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478972390}, "language": "english", "review": "I just finished the first two chapters of this game. This game is great. It is not perfect but it still a great game to have on VR. I'm excited to see what is in store for the rest of the game. There are pointless parts of the game. In the game, you get three swords. The problem with that? You get the second one at the same time as the third unless you backtrack. There is no reason to use the second one. There is a second shield but I could not tell you why it is better than the first.\n\nI would suggest you have a massive play area to use this. I have 2.5m x 2.5m space and this is too small, way too small. I recommend 3m x 3m or larger. Also, you will be moving around quite a bit when using this game. Make sure your headphones are on secure.\n\nAs far as suggested features, co-op multiplayer would make it amazing. A training mode would be awesome or just a mode to mess around with all of the weapons. Overall, I would give this a 4/5. The game works fairly well. I haven't seen any bugs but it does feel like an early access. If you want an awesome VR game, I suggest you pick this up. Someone said it was like a combo of Zelda and Skyrim.

In anderen Situationen (Nahkampf) funktionieren K\u00e4mpfe aber wie gew\u00fcnscht und machen dann auch Spa\u00df.\n\n(-) Zur Fortbewegung muss man sich in kleinen Schritten durch sehr gro\u00dfe Areale teleportieren. Problem: St\u00e4ndiges Teleportieren ist suboptimal. Es bringt einen aus der Spielwelt, da der Kopf ab einer gewissen H\u00e4ufigkeit die Umgebung als \"nicht real\" wahrnimmt. W\u00e4ren die Areale anders gestaltet, w\u00fcrden sich die Teleports pro Zeiteinheit reduzieren. Andere Titel machen das besser. \n\n(-) Der H\u00f6hepunkt des Spiels ist eine kleine Arena. Diese muss man sch\u00e4tzungsweise acht mal durchlaufen, um das Spiel zu knacken. Das Schema ist dabei immer gleich. Beim 3. mal war ich der Arena leider bereits \u00fcberdr\u00fcssig.\n\n(-) Ich habe sehr langsam gespielt und komme auf eine Spielzeit von knapp 3 Stunden. Sehr wenig f\u00fcr 20\u20ac, zumal auch viel Leerlauf und Wiederholungen dazwischen sind (=>Arena).\n\n(-) Das Inventar ist fummelig und dort platziert, wo in der echten Welt der Bauch w\u00e4re. Problem: Es ist immer am unteren Linsenrand --> Das Inventar ist grunds\u00e4tzlich unscharf, da au\u00dferhalb des Sweet Spots. Das strengt die Augen an.\n\n(-) Schwertk\u00e4mpfe funktionieren auf zwei Arten: Man tut was das Spiel von einem will, oder man fuchtelt einfach wild und ohne Ziel rum. Leider funktioniert beides.\n\n(-) Wenige Gegnertypen mit wenig \"Charakter\". Die einzige Sprachausgabe in diesem Spiel ist \"hoooooh\". Das geben Gegner von sich wenn sie zuschlagen.\n\n(-) Es existiert leider keine nennenswerte Story abseits von englischen Texttafeln.\n\n==================\nWas am Spiel positiv ist:\n==================\n\n(+) Die Schwertk\u00e4mpfe machen durchaus Spa\u00df\n\n(+) Bogenschie\u00dfen ann\u00e4hernd wie bei \"The Lab\" umgesetzt.\n\n(+) Man kann eine Spitzhacke finden, mit der man Kristalle, Edelsteine abbauen kann. Das macht so lange Spa\u00df bis man merkt, dass es im ganzen Spiel vielleicht 10 Stellen gibt, wo man diese einsetzen kann.\n\n(+) Mancher sch\u00f6ne Aha-Moment im Spiel f\u00fcr Leute mit noch wenig VR Erfahrung.\n\n(+) Es ist ein VR Spiel\n\n=====\nFazit:\n=====\n\nOhne Virtual Reality w\u00e4re dieses Spiel wohl nicht relevant. Umfang gering, Grafikstil recht austauschbar, viele Designmacken. Virtual Reality macht daraus dann eine interessante Erfahrung, die aber ausbaubar ist.

Vanishing Realms ist das erste Vive-Spiel, das ich gespielt habe und das keine Tech-Demo ist oder nach 1h langweilig wird. Den Reviews auf Steam bei VR-Games traue ich schon lange nicht mehr. Alle scheinen immer sofort begeistert zu sein, aber haben meistens nicht mehr als 1h gespielt. Nat\u00fcrlich ist der erste Eindruck meistens wirklich bombastisch (ist halt VR), aber der Spielspa\u00df l\u00e4\u00dft oft schnell nach. Das ist bei Vanishing Realms anders. Dazu komme ich sp\u00e4ter.\n\nErstmal die Spiele, die ich f\u00fcr Vive besitze und aus denen ich meine Erfahrung sch\u00f6pfe:\n\nFantastic Contraption: K\u00f6nnte f\u00fcr manche interessant sein, aber ich mag das Spielprinzip nicht. Puzzle sind nicht mein Ding.\nJob Simulator: Macht ein paar Stunden Spa\u00df, aber kein Wiederspielwert.\nMIND Path to Thalamus: Wird schnell langweilig. Stundenlanges Rumgerenne ohne etwas tun zu m\u00fcssen, aber sch\u00f6ne Welten.\nOut of Ammo: Wave Shooter mit noch zuwenig Content, Spielspa\u00df h\u00e4lt nicht lange an\nPool Nation VR: Leider eine Entt\u00e4uschung f\u00fcr mich. Miese Steuerung.\nThe Visitor: 5 Minuten Spielzeit\nZombie Training Simulator: Das ist wirklich gut und macht zwischendurch Spa\u00df, aber leider immer das selbe und zuwenig Content. Trotzdem guter Wave-Shooter.\nThe Blue: Sch\u00f6nes Erlebnis, aber nur 10 Minuten Spielzeit\n\nVanishing Realms hatte ich zuerst nur relativ kurz angespielt, bin aber recht weit gekommen (hatte bereits den Bogen). Ich fand es nicht schlecht, aber auf Dauer eher lahm, bis ich mich vor wenigen Tagen intensiver mit dem Spiel besch\u00e4ftigt habe und noch einmal von vorne angefangen habe.\nDabei ist mir aufgefallen, dass Vanishing Realms vor Secrets nur so wimmelt. Ziel sollte es sein, soviel Gold und Secrets zu finden, wie m\u00f6glich. Nur dann bekommt man die beste Ausr\u00fcstung. Beim ersten Durchlauf konnte ich mir nur das schw\u00e4chste Schwert und den schw\u00e4chsten Bogen leisten und fragte mich, wie zur H\u00f6lle soll ich an soviel Gold kommen?\nJetzt habe ich festgestellt, dass unter dutzenden Steinen, B\u00fcchern, Kerzen,... M\u00fcnzen versteckt sind. Au\u00dferdem kann man Vorh\u00e4nge, Teppiche, Stroh, usw. mit der Fackel verbrennen und auch dahinter verbirgen sich Secrets. Man kann Kisten, F\u00e4sser, Vasen, Sargdeckel und alles m\u00f6gliche zerschlagen. In den R\u00e4umen h\u00e4ngen in den Ecken Spinnweben mit Goldkr\u00fcgen. Wenn man die Spinnweben verbrennt, fallen die Kr\u00fcge in Reichweite. Es gibt geheime Orte. Dieser hier ist wirklich super: [spoiler]Auf der Insel, wo man eines der 3 Schwerter kaufen kann, ziemlich am Anfang, sollte man sich alle Inseln drumherum anschauen. Man findet u.a. einen roten wertvollen Krug (ingame Achievement) und auf einer entfernten Insel steht ein Grabstein mit einem R\u00e4tsel: Man soll ein Leuchtfeucher auf der Klippe entz\u00fcnden. Es gibt eine M\u00f6glichkeit, dort hinzukommen und hinaufzukletter. Dabei findet man noch mehr Sch\u00e4tze auf dem Weg (Boot). Viel Spa\u00df beim Suchen. [/spoiler]\n\nMan kann und sollte also jeden Stein umdrehen und sich alles genau anschauen. Und bei der L\u00e4nge des Spiels (es gibt viele Kapitel) ergibt sich daraus eine enorme Spielzeit. Au\u00dferdem gibt es ingame Achievements, die man unlocken kann, z.B. Entz\u00fcnde 75 Kerzen, finde 30 rote Kr\u00fcge, schiesse 20 \u00c4pfel von B\u00e4umen, etc. Auch das motiviert, alles m\u00f6gliche zu versuchen. \nIch habe jetzt mit dem Spiel neu angefangen und bereits wieder fast 2h am St\u00fcck gespielt und bin noch weit am Anfang (noch nicht mal da, wo ich beim ersten Mal Spielen nach nicht mal einer Stunde aufgeh\u00f6rt habe), weil ich 100% erreichen will und ich habe dabei soviel neues entdeckt. Mein Tipp: Probiert alles aus, untersucht jeden Stein. Man kann z.B. mit Steinen oder Sch\u00e4deln, usw. Goldkr\u00fcge von hochgelegenen Vorspr\u00fcgen werfen, usw.\n\nNebenbei sind dann noch die K\u00e4mpfe mit Schwert/Schild und Bogen, die auch wirklich Spa\u00df machen und auch da gibt es oft M\u00f6glichkeiten, K\u00e4mpfe zu umgehen oder starke Feine auf andere Art zu beseitigen. Die Physik im Spiel gef\u00e4llt mir sehr gut, ebenso der Sound und die Sprachausgabe.\n\nIhr merkt, ich bin echt begeistert von dem Spiel und ich werde es definitiv weiter und durch spielen. Es ist f\u00fcr mich das ersrte \"richtige\" Spiel f\u00fcr die Vive und keine Techdemo ohne Langzeitmotivation. Ich hoffe, dass noch mehr dieser Spiele entwickelt werden.\n\nTop Spiel.

Like playing the first Spyro game on the PS1 - except a hundred times cooler because it's a first person dungeon crawler in VR.\n\n- The controls are very intuitive and natural feeling. I'll roll up to a table, toss all the candles over my shoulder, swipe up all the pennies hidden underneath, and chuck the apples in to my backpacks - and it all feels super smooth. \n- The inventory system works great. I can switch up my equipment on the fly really easily, even the stuff in the backpacks. It was occasionally hard to get in the right place, and I often found that I couldn't access it at all while crouching, but most of the time I didn't even have to think about it.\n- Moving is done through teleportation, which is pretty standard for a lot of games. Works just fine for this :) Though I did find that it made dodging projectiles and traps super easy! \n- Some really cool events/encounters and interweaving level design (made me think of Dark Souls, coming back out in a familiar places etc).\n- Difficulty curve was just right\n- Pacing felt right on too - the first chapter didn't drag on but also didn't feel like it zoomed by!\n\nSomething that I really appreciate is that is the ability to play this game with a left handed loadout!\nSure, it automatically wants you to put your shield in your left hand and sword in the right, but who says you need to do that? Swap em over and beat those skellies senseless - southpaw style!\n\n\nThe only thing that I felt let me down was the second chapter.\n\nChapter 1 was wonderful, and I really felt a sense of accomplishment when I finished it. When I moved on to Chapter 2 I saw this cool environment and I was super stoked about the idea of exploring this sun-soaked, temple-looking place - anticipating further challenge with new enemies and maybe some gear upgrades! Building on the content I'd already experienced.\nBut then it ended up basically just being a series of arena \"kill the dudes\" challenges and nothing more. It felt more like the kind of thing you'd access from the main menu as a separate challenge mode mini-game. I certainly couldn't call it a chapter.\n\nThis does nothing to diminish the fun I had in C1, but I hope that the next instalments are more like that than C2. \n\nHad a whale of a time and this is still my favourite VR experience yet!\n I'm looking forward to seeing what further content is like ^^", "timestamp_created": 1477616353, "timestamp_updated": 1477961114, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26251585": {"recommendationid": "26251585", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025241288", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 565, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485728646}, "language": "english", "review": "This is, without a doubt, the best game I have ever played in my life.

This is not a criticism of the game. As a broad first attempt to get swords, shields, bows and magical items into the hands of players who must use them to block, thrust, parry, dodge and aim while maintaining situational awareness, this game succeeds very well.\n\nWhat VR demonstrates is that this type of action can be tiring and sweaty work. While it isn't [i]Dance Revolution[/i], having a mask strapped to your face while you are flailing around with toy-like 3D weaponry can result in a lots of facial moisture, foggy eyepieces (no ventilation) and tired arms to accompany the silly grin on your face. Fortunately there's an in-game pause button that allows you to take off your headset, wipe your brow and reach for the adventurer's mead (aka Gatorade). [i]Also it's far more deadly to learn a good stance and sweeping motions instead of trying to bat enemies with wrist flicks. You're using a sword, not a fly-swatter![/i]\n\nGiven that this is first-gen VR, this game can also be forgiven for it's cartoon-like world. We're likely some ways off from having Skyrim-esque settings in VR, but if you play this and imagine that one day you might be able to fight Draugr underneath some forgotten cairn in the middle of a snowy pine forest, then it's worth noting this game helped get us there.\n\nStory? Meh. You have no real identity in this game and there is no world to discover, just a series of locations and quest objectives. There's a few easy puzzles to figure out. And for the final act you get to do several rounds of timed arena combat (the Rite of Steel).\n\nI recommend this game with reservations. It's clearly one of the front-runners of the current pack of Vive games that attempt to be more than a demo, yet it still feels demo-like: short, no story and focused on introductory mechanics. One chapter is currently available with another promised to complete the game and a possible third as DLC. That might give it enough length to justify the full price if it happens in the near future. The game won't keep this front-runner position for long as other, newer titles inevitably push beyond those boundaries.\n\n[b]Rating: 7/10\nA good intro to first-gen VR gaming, but lacking a fully fleshed-out experience.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1476601472, "timestamp_updated": 1476762205, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.714336", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26060917": {"recommendationid": "26060917", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087631548", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 537, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480483259}, "language": "english", "review": "What realy sucked me in where you encounter an enemy for the first time.

Maybe it's because I'm only a few hours into my VR journey and the novelty has not worn off yet, but this game kinda blew my mind. It's a bit simplistic... this is true... but this experience has changed the way I feel about gaming forever.  Like I said... this is one of my very first VR experiences, so perhaps if I wrote this in the future after spending a couple hundred hours in VR experiences, I'd not write so enthusiastically about this... but for now, I love this game.\n\nI'll try to be objective though to hopefully help someone make a decison about whether or not to buy this.   The setting is kinda cartoony and the enemies look a little Zelda-ish, but when engaged in a sword fight with enemies slightly larger then me, the innocence of their looks temporarily fades away and they feel a bit more menacing.  And that cartoony setting has a real sense of scale and of being a real place.   From the slight vertigo I feel looking over an edge to the floor below me, to feeling moon beams soaking into my skin... It all comes together quite nicely. \n\nThe only criticisms I have are that melee combat is a little easy and repetetive.  Block, strike, block strike... it's hard to mess up. Regardless, it's still fun.   And there are other combat options such as a ranged bow which are fun to use.\n\nAnother minor gripe is that enemies seems to just stand around and wait for you to approach.  Would be much cooler if they were a bit more aggressive and plentiful.  But then again, for a VR noob like me, maybe it would be a little too fast paced. \n\nMy biggest overall complaint is that I want more. \n\nBut, none of these things stopped me from having one of the best times in recent memory.  I can't wait to see more games of this type!  Bravo! Well done!\n\nSo, if you are new to VR like I am and the VR experience is still fresh, I think it's worth the money to try this one.

I like it because it's a high-fantasy dungeon crawler. \n\nI managed to complete the first level. The combat was interesting enough, and I like the fact that I got to try out some melee fighting, bow shooting, and magic via magic wand. \n\nI found the pacing to be... odd. For example, the first level often felt slow because of the exploration component. At least walking around was punctuated with combat encounters. The 2nd level had a completely different pacing. Little or no exploration, but it becomes frantic because activities are timed. I have a particular annoyance for timed things, and I eventually lost interest and stopped playing this game when I kept failing the time-based challenge.

Read on before marking as \"not helpful\" - it's not Reddit, this is a thought-out user review, not an epic troll on an internet forum.\n\nTL;DR - The game is actually somewhat polished, which automatically puts it head and shoulders above 99% of the SteamVR lineup. However, a slew of disappointing design flaws and the cheese-ability of the combat system do little to justify the pricetag when the game is as short as it is. If you're not too picky and willing to play along, go for it.\n\nPros & cons:\n\nPros\n-quality artstyle, decent enough ambiance to create significant immersion\n-the linear levels work without feeling railroady\n-sound effects and \"game feel\" work in VR, picking up coins and striking enemies doesn't feel like a chore\n-VR allows exploration to feel more like exploration, and less like a slog\n-A few nice and simple environmental puzzles keep the game from being a complete wagglefest.\n\nCons\n-Combat is incredibly easy to cheese. Waggling your sword at an enemy's head essentially guarantees victory. Add in a few quick teleports from place to place on bosses, and you've got a low-effort strategy that can wreck anything without actually playing along.\n-No artificial locomotion options. Unless it was some hidden options menu I missed, there was no way of giving the player any option other than teleportation. While TP is a nice default for comfort's sake, there are people who would like to use it, especially in the early days of roomscale VR software.\n-It's short as all hell.\n-It's insultingly easy, even if you play along and don't cheese fights. The telegraphs are massive, and the shield blocks EVERYTHING with no penalties.\n-Melee enemies pretend you don't exist until you're already in striking distance. I was expecting to be ganged up on numerous times by the enemy configurations, and never was unless I explicitly tried to. Even when I was firing the bow+arrow at their friends, they never did anything but look confusedly in my direction sometimes. \n-Exploration yields little, save for a few coins. \n\nALL THIS BEING SAID, Vanishing Realms is still one of the best VR games I've played. For most, the novelty of VR outweighs the subpar nature of the game itself.

I dont like sitting still while playing. So I bought a Vive, and i own 70 titles at this point. Or more. I can\u00b4t get enough.\n\nVanishing realms: This is, without a doubt the best game I have ever played. Yes, there are some things that need to be fixed, and it is still early access. But it is truly astounding he amount of joy I get running through this wonderful Dungeon Crawler! This is the game i dreamt about as a child! Thank you Devs, you are true heroes!\n\n\nI play on warrior mode, got to sixth rite of passage where I got tangled in my cable and yanked the power cable out of my link box ^^:\n\nGood Stuff:\nSwordplay: Amazing! I will not say it cant improve, but holy hell! you guys really put in alot of work compared to any other game I have ever seen. Keep it up!\n\nAi: Sure, there are still some dumb stuff the monsters do, but the AI in this is sometimes scary good.\nBig plus for the trap devs! Got me seriously fooled!\n\nBow and arrow: Excellent. Just leave it as it is. Maby make it more real and harder still. But if not, its fine as it is!\n\nGameplay and movement: I enjoy the heck out of it! I don\u00b4t mind the teleportation too much, even though it always sucks, your teleportation is the least suckiest at the moment. The game kind of makes up for it in this case :) The story is a little bit thin, but it feels like the devs are working up to something. I can\u00b4t wait! I almost got tears in my eyes when i found the new path!\n\nThe riddles: They are wonderfully written :)\n\nBad stuff:\nI dropped both my pick-axes accidentally, and both disappeared into the floor or wall or somewhere. Could not find them again. So I had to play a very long way around before I got it all back to where I wanted to be. It\u00b4s ok though, it was fun ;) Still, if i drop something, I want to be able to pick it up.\n\nGot some bugs where I suddenly, after teleporting, was standing right in front of a monster that had not been there before. Scared the living smurfs out of me. Only happened once.\n\n\nSome words to the devs:\nDo not make it easier. Do not let people tell you they have to be able to pick through inventory faster or anything like that. Remember, this is VR, make it as you are doing now. So that we have to get physically better irl to get better in the game. Thats the beauty of vr! Don\u00b4t you think?\n\nThank you devs!

A number of the interiors are a pleasure to walk through and explore and had a good balance of things to do and puzzles to solve.\n\nThe story line is simple - again, old school, but your first interaction with a skeleton warrior - right there - in front of you - trying to kill you, is something you can only experience in VR, and this game does it well.   The fighting has been beautifully realised.  Particularly the sword and shield combat.  I found myself sweating after a series of hack and slash encounters.\n\nTeleporting has been done well in this game too.  I found it produced no discomfort or nausea.\n\nI struggle to come up with any negatives other than those limits which are imposed on any VR material at the moment - ie lower graphic detail and game length.\n\nLooking forward to the next chapter.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1470832372, "timestamp_updated": 1470832372, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24800750": {"recommendationid": "24800750", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971616692", "num_games_owned": 167, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 547, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491137651}, "language": "english", "review": "+ Nicely designed and thought out\n+ Fun, (if basic) sword & board and bow combat\n+ Nice exterior environments\n\n- Short (Like almost all VR games so far released)\n- Limited variety of enemies with limited variety of attack moves\n- You'll struggle to play it in less than 2.3x2.3m without punching a wall or your cat", "timestamp_created": 1470779849, "timestamp_updated": 1470779849, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24796796": {"recommendationid": "24796796", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997319320", "num_games_owned": 613, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 202, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470708896}, "language": "english", "review": "First RPG I played on the Vive, like it a lot, it's a bit short (2h) but maybe that's a good thing since I played through it all in one go.\n\nCombat is well done, you can dodge and stab the monsters when and where they are unguarded.

Most of the environments in chapter one are really cool, like being in a cartoonish dungeon in an Elder Scrolls-game.\n\nMy biggest gripe with this game is the thing called \"chapter two\", which is basically just a horde mode.

I had one crash throughout the entire game, which is better than for a lot of finished games.  \n\nI thought that the point and click movement system would bug me but it didn't and lends itself to the game very well.  The combat felt polished and was enjoyable.  It feels a bit weird to have a huge sword that doesn't weigh anything but you quickly forget thtat once you are hacking, slashing, and parrying with the monsters in the world.  \n\nThe monsters are a bit limited, there are only six or seven of them but it really doesn't matter.  The sword and shield fighting is fun and well realised and the bow and arrow action is excellent.  My only problem was not being able to hit a skeleton thing on top of a pedestal because, as it turns out, the light shade was in the way, but that's just a VR thing.  \n\nThe only crash I had was that I suddenly dropped through the floor and couldn't find any way back.  It happened once and that was it.  Everything else was completely solid.  \n\nThe game is a little more cartoonish than the advertising graphic might indicate but, again, that didn't really detract from it.  \n\nI am really, really hoping that the reason this is early access is so that further chapters can be added to it.\n\nPros:\n- Very immersive\n- Fun sword play where you have to wait for your opponent's vulnerable areas to be exposed and aim for them before you can do damage.  \n- Brilliant bow and arrow action - you have to hold the bow in one hand and draw it with the other.  The arrows fly in an arc requiring you to take that into account for long shots.\n- Very smooth gameplay\n- Very few bugs or glitches\n- Intuitive movement system\n- Very polished product - I didn't even spot any typos in the scrolls\n\nCons\n- A bit on the short side - what you see as my play time above is how long it took me to finish it but it was an enjoyable 2.9 hours.\n- Quickly switching between weapons is a bit fiddly ... actually, I'm not even sure if this is a con as it adds to the realism a bit.\n\nI would definitely recommend this game.

This feels more like a showpiece of what's possible, more than a full game, and that's not necessarily a bad thing.\n\n     While playing this I often ran into situations where I thought \"Wow, it would be cool if this was an MMO\". While mining I thought \"Wow, profession systems translate really well to VR\". While switching from the bow, to the sword and board, to dual wielding swords, to the magic system, I realized there's a very real possibility of a class system here. Each style of combat was fun enough on it's own and could be expanded upon.\n\n     That brings me to my only negative about this game. There isn't enough of this game. GIVE ME MORE.

The styalized and cartoony look and feel reminded a lot of WoW, and the few different areas felt unique nice to look at.\n-The combat felt good and hit impacts felt satisfying. I feel that it was far too easy for myself, but it is sound and fun.\n-The HUD and convenience mechanics were good. Health/Mana/Gold float down your waist until the value is changed, never in your way, and not too far either. There were no problems accessing inventory and things like that.\n-The adventure feels like a natural progression through item and weapon aquisition. At the end I was excited for new challenges and further progression.\n\nCONS\n-With only a couple hours of play, the game is too short. While at the end I felt acomplished, I wanted a lot more. Especially considering the $20 price tag. If there are more chapters released in the future as the ending eludes to, I will be happy.\n-As I said earlier the game was too easy. There are hidden collectables and money to find, but there isn't really any use for it once you get your full set of weapons. The combat was fun, but I never really felt that I was in danger of dying when I put any effort in.\n-While the look of the game is great, the story and game feel generic.

I wish it were a bit more exploratory, and less on RAILS.\n\nThe graphics are a bit low poly, but that is made up for with a well conceptualized and executed style. My biggest gripe about the look and feel of the game is the inventory system and player stats. The live at the player waistline and can be hard to make out at the periphery of the Vive's screen when you have to look down. Other ties, they are blocking your view if you need to interact with something at your feet.\n\nI have encounter some bugs that have caused crashes, and in one situation, I got into a part of the environment, that I was not able to teleport out of.\n\nCombat comes in two flavors, melee and projectile. Melee suffers a bit from the fact that VR can't provide physical resistance. Projectile, shooting arrows and using magic wands is the really fun stuff. Dodging behind rocks and other obstacles to avoid being hit yourself can get your heart rate going and really brings you into the world.\n\nIf I were to compare it to any other VR experience I have had, the closest thing would be The Gallery, which is significantly better in the graphics and story department, but it is more puzzle oriented, with Vanishing Realms more fun.\n\nI highly recommend this game and really hope the developer continues to expand upon it.", "timestamp_created": 1467222436, "timestamp_updated": 1467222436, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23930915": {"recommendationid": "23930915", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016017687", "num_games_owned": 487, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466866343}, "language": "german", "review": "Nett gemachte Welt, spannende K\u00e4mpfe pe Schwert, Schild und Bogen.

Going up against the King skeleton guy or the big ones with flails, it really felt like I was the one doing the flailing.\n\nI think this will be a refund for me, first of my Vive ownership.\n\nEdit:  Not sure why the above information isn't helpful.  I will add:  Blocking enemy swords with your own sword or shield feels pretty damn good, and blocking arrows with your shield is even better.  However, having an enemy block you (and your hand + sword continuing through your swing unimpeded IRL) creates a disconnect between the VR world and the real.  It simply does *not* feel good.

The draw length of the bow is too short for me. I end up pulling my hand to 10 cm in front of my body instead of slightly behind. This should be adjustable. Also the anchor point on the controller is a bit to close to the hand so you don't get to draw the bow back correctly.\n- Magic is a bit boring. Its just a projectile weapon using Mana as ammo.\n- THIS is what changed my review to negative: With about a 2 hour playthough with good but limited gameplay options this game is good - for an early access. But the developer has said that he is about to make the game official and charge for future content. This game is not wide or deep enough to justify $20 price tag. I bought this game expecting much more bang to come from my buck.\n\nHalf way though the game I adopted a 2 handed fighting style and loved every second of mahem I rought on my enemies.\n\nSpend a whole day completing this game, enjoying the scenery and marvelling at how awesome it all is.

I would recommend it to anyone first picking up the system and those that love fantasy combat.\n Below is a list of Pros and Cons for me personally. Maybe it'll be helpful to you. Overall, I loved the experience, and just nitpick a bit here.\n\n\nPros:\n-Combat feels awesome, especially when you have multiple enemies engaging you at once\n- World looks good, and the atmoshere is nice\n-Teleporting mechanic doesn't take you out of the immersion (unless you blink around like a dingus)\n- Stats and user interface are easy to understand\n- Puzzles and clues are neither too challenging, nor too simple\n- Hidden items/easter eggs are fun to look for here\n- Distinctly different weapons for various situations\n-Some enemy variety\n\nCons:\n- Switching to the bow can be difficult at times\n- The wand weapon that you get is simply too powerful. It makes clearing the final boss incredibly easy if you have maxed out your mana.\n- Enemies do not pursue the player aggressively enough\n- Combat doesn't scale up fast enough (by about 30 minutes in you should be able to kill everything with little issue, unless you are swarmed). Enemies need to attack faster.\n- Enemies are fairly similar in regards to combat behavior. Would like to see more behaviors, or something simple like some skeleton warriors having their sword+shield hands switched.\n- The final boss lost some of his wow and scare factor after figuring our this pattern. Needs some more attack patterns to make him more challenging.\n- The sequence of trials after the main quest is kind of fun... but overall not challenging enough at that point or as engaging as the rest of the game.\n- It takes a good amount of time for you to face your first enemy... like longer than you need it to be. It makes it sometimes hard to show it to friends, as they can't drop right into the action.\n\nBottom line, it is not perfect, but it is quite good.

I felt the pressure of being flanked in combat, and the instant fear of arrows coming from an unknown source (which you are able to quickly track down by sound, naturally). Still, I'm itching to see more.\n\nI do like a lot of the mechanics introduced for the VR medium. If you stick your head into something, your vision blurs, or you're pushed back into an open space. Nice. The teleportation movement system works well enough, though I must say I quite enjoyed the more natural movement used in Spell Fighter once I got over the initial disorientation.\n\nThe only major complaint I would have is that the game seems to be designed for someone much shorter (I'm 6'4\"/193cm and tend to tower over other Hover Junkers players). There are many low ceilings (namely in the arena) and the space feels constrained, even though I have a generous space and stayed away from the Chaperone walls. The game automatically pauses if you try to push too far outside of reach, which became an annoyance at certain points in grabbing objects or attacking some enemies, given my long reach. Default combat distance seems to be incredibly close, and enemies tend to engage me right in my face, far within the reach of my sword, not the kind of distance I like to be at while fencing! Engaging the archers in melee was also annoying as they appeared to only come up to my knees and I had to golf swing to take them out; helmets blocked any reasonable swing I would normally take. Certainly I wouldn't say to skip the game if you are tall, but it's one thing to expect, and hopefully will be changed with future development.", "timestamp_created": 1466407663, "timestamp_updated": 1466407663, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23663697": {"recommendationid": "23663697", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125924372", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481344779}, "language": "english", "review": "THIS GAME.

Einziges Manko f\u00fcr mich war das nicht 100 prozentige Trefferfeedback bei den Gegnern (aber vertretbar:) ) und das ich bei diesen Titel leichtes motion sickness bei mir herausbeschw\u00f6rt, bisher aber zum Gl\u00fcck der einzige Titel :)\n\nAlso Absolute Kaufempfehlung! :)  \n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1466187858, "timestamp_updated": 1466187858, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23616803": {"recommendationid": "23616803", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042399728", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 42, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462301485}, "language": "english", "review": "I thought I would really like this game, but for a couple reasons it was very disappointing to me.  \n\nThe first reason is the lack of non teleport movement.  I understand that teleporting is supposed to reduce motion sickness and discomfort at the cost of immersion, but in this game I don't think teleportation is helping.  While traversing and fighting monsters in this game you will want to  take many small teleports rapidly in sucession.  This ends up resembling a slideshow.  I find this to be very disorienting and motion sickness inducing.  A more traditional smooth movement would be much much preferable to me.\n\nMy second problem is that I was not a fan of the design and art in the game.  I expected it to feel more atmospheric and epic in scale.  Instead it felt like a retro adventure game that I somehow became trapped in.  Typical lever pulling puzzles, linear map design, and very uninspired environments.\n\nThat said, the game is quite functional and has some cool stuff to offer.  I'm sure some people will enjoy it far more than I did.  I also think that the price is fair, and if there was another movement option available I think I would enjoy spending more time playing the game.", "timestamp_created": 1466181669, "timestamp_updated": 1466181669, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493158", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23614599": {"recommendationid": "23614599", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968326810", "num_games_owned": 294, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 164, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479698769}, "language": "english", "review": "This game isn't finished, but it has a ton of potential from what's currently available.\n\nPros:\n-The first real RPG style game with some decent meat on the bone\n-Interacting with the world is immensely satisfying, even something as simple as unlocking doors with a key felt awesome\n-Very polished, I encountered no bugs on my playthrough\n-The progression & pacing are just right\n\nCons:\n-Graphics are passable, but nothing I'd write home about\n-$20 is pretty steep for what you get right now, but if more is added, it has the potential to far outweigh that cost in value\n-Sadly the combat was the weakest point of the game, it's just not where it needs to be yet.

It's all over in about two hours, and that includes several tries at the \"second chapter,\" which is really just kind of an arena challenge. In a traditional game, I'd consider this more like a \"vertical slice\" than a finished game, because it introduces a bunch of zelda-like tools (sword, shield, bow, pickaxe, hammer, etc.) but you don't get much use out of any of them. There are only seven kinds of enemies, one of them a boss and the other a miniboss. So it's short.\n\nBut for VR right now, this isn't a huge downside; there hasn't really been time to create long games, and the tech is so new that experiences like this feel a bit like a theme park ride. And if this [i]were[/i] a theme park ride, I'd be pretty tempted to pay another $20 to go and do it again. The graphical style and animations are quite polished, and the atmosphere is very well done. And it's hard to overstate how intimidating the giant skeletons in the game are when you first encounter them. By the end of the game, you'll have found exploits for their combat AI, which is pretty limited, but that's fine, because that's how RPGs always are--by the end, you're a seasoned warrior who has no trouble dispatching hordes of low-level enemies and even a boss or two. It's just that here, you're actually more skilled at defeating the enemies.\n\nIt's worth noting that my play area is slightly below the minimum requirements: mine is 1.8x2.5m. I was still able to play the game fine, although I did encounter the auto-pause feature a lot. The game pauses if you get too close to the edge of your play area while doing something active, so that you won't swing through your chaperone and break something. At that point it asks you to move back to the center of your play space (which is shown with a green circle and some arrows) and hit a button to unpause. This works pretty well, though it does break up the flow of the action a little. I still hit things through my chaperone a [i]little,[/i] but mostly when doing gentle things like reaching for a potion, so I didn't do any serious damage. A nice large space will give you the best experience with the game, but you can get away with just under the minimum.\n\nAll in all, probably my second-favorite title after The Gallery.

Ignore the \"early access\" label -- you will get a complete (albeit short: 2 hours) game for the price.\n\nWhat makes this cartoony dungeon crawler special is the combat: Wield your controller as a sword! Parry attacks! Lunge! Chop! Once you get a shield you can parry and lunge at the same time! Use a bow and arrow (like in The Lab)! Switch between them! Yay!\n\nSome \"early access\" things do come up. They are not bugs that keep you from playing, but they are things that can improve: Combat is too easy once you understand it. The enemies, even the bosses, barely fight back, and definitely don't know how to move around intelligently. I think the teleporting motion is very good compared to other VR games, but it can definitely be tweaked to allow for a more satisfying (and creepy) sense of exploration and travel, and of course to make combat more exciting than it is right now. Finally, 2 hours is not enough! By the time I got enough gold to get the cool weapons, the game was over! It would be fun to have more puzzles that would require you to retrace your steps and get to know the world more intimately.\n\nBut these seem like nitpicks. All in all Vanishing Realms is a wonderful place from which to see the promising VR RPG future.\n\nIf only for labeling this \"early access\" Indimo Labs deserves a lot of credit. 90% of the \"full\" releases on SteamVR right now are buggy, incomplete, half-baked experiments. It's deceitful to sell them at any price.

Hell, it'll be my first review anywhere. \n\nThere's not much I can say that hasn't been, but I'll try anyway since I think devs need to see that their efforts are worthwhile and makeing a huge difference.\n\nI remember playing Legend of Zelda on NES as a kid.  I loved it so much I asked to go to the hardware store, bought a plank of wood, and went at trying to create my own shield. Epic fail, since my artistic and handicraft skills are subpar - at best. But it was the first spark of a decades long, insatiable quest to transport myself to another world and do the things that weren't possible. \n\nIt's been a long time since then, but for the first time ever, I feel like I've come close. This game is the promising first step in that journey. For those of us who have gotten Vive or are contemplating getting it, it's going to be a rough ride until something with Skyrim/Zelda production value comes out. But if you've even the slightest inclination to really feel like you're the hero in the game, this is the closest you can get at this time.\n\nPRO's: \n- Everything you could extrapolate from my introductory statements. You *are* the hero in this game. It's f-in' great. \n- Excellent swordplay mechanics (some prefer Spell Fighter VR - which is great - but I think the dodge/block/parry mechanics are better here). \n- Engaging atmosphere despite the sourced assets (ie: the character models were bought from a store).\n- Solid music. \n- Intuitive puzzles.\n- Leaves you aching for more content. \n\nCONS:\n- An argument can be made that it is a short experience. However, none of us early adopters should go into *any* game thinking we're going to experience the next Skyrim/Dishonored/etc...\n- While I think the utility belt inventory system is very interesting, I have to hyperextend my head downwards to see it. It also moves around erratically when I'm kneeling down. \n- I'd love it if there was more depth to the magic system (currently it's item-based magic limited to one item at this time). Not hoping for a miracle here, but it would've been nice to play as a wizard rather than a sword fighter every time. \n- No Hard Mode. While enemy difficulty does increase slightly, they are far outpaced in damage after gaining the last sword. They also become easier in general by the time you have a second playthrough. Hard Mode needs to happen. \n- Trackpad locomotion for both movement and turning would be superior for those of us with 'vr legs'. I like teleporting sometimes, but in battle I'd rather just reorient myself with the trackpad. It feels like cheating to just teleport away.\n\nAnyway, I hope this inspires other devs to keep the ball rolling and iterate on RPG/Adventure games. And to the dev of this game in particular, please keep up the good work. There's not many who've gambled on anything resembling an RPG at this stage in the VR launch cycle, and you're currently leading the pack by a wide margin.

The last part of the game (spoiler alert) is just repeated arena fights, perhaps added to pad out the length of the game so people will be less likely to get refunds.\n- Dull movement, besides room scale you can only teleport, and because it does not show you where your playspace will be in your prospective destination (like The Lab does), it makes movement frustrating.\n- Poor AI, understandable for an early VR game, but the enemies keep backing away, which means I have to keep teleporting close to them because my play space is only 2.5x2.5 meters, but the game sometimes prevents you from teleporting directly next to an enemy.  All in all it feels like enemy movement is working against the melee mechanics.\n- Bow is not fun.  It aims wherever your primary hand is pointing it, secondary hand is just used to pull back the arrow, making it feel unrealistic.\n- Lack of story, there are just a few cryptic messages guiding you around.  The game has little atmosphere and almost no personality.\n- Bad UI, you have to look down to check yout health, mana, gold, and inventory.  This combined with the small sweet spot on the Vive's lenses, makes it difficult to focus on the text.  Maybe it is better for people without glasses, I don't know.\n- Abandonware?  The game has passed the time frame layed out in the early access description, with no updates in two months.  The game was described as having almost two hours of content per chapter, but I was able to easily clear both chapters in under two hours, as the second chapter is just a series of arena fights.\n\nI really wanted to like this game based on it's reviews, but I found the gameplay to not be very fun, and it was only challenging when it was frustrating, such as fights against groups of enemies when you can't tell who is hitting you from where.

Maybe I am spoiled by games like Dragon Age: Inquisition, where after 120 hours of gameplay, I am not even close to done playing? And I picked that up for $30. Here, I am paying $20 for two hours of entertainment, so it doesn't quite add up no matter how good it is.\n\nWith that aside, what you do get to experience in those 2 hours is quite good. It is definitely cool to fight the skeletons, especially when dual wielding two swords, even though the fights are a little slow and clunky with so-so collision detection. I can see this maybe becoming a little more worth the price if a few bonus or side quests are added, along with a separately selected arena with leader boards. In a game that already has a bow and arrow, swords, a shield, and a magic wand, the possibilities for mini-games are endless.\n\nAdd that extra content, and I would fully recommend this game as a worthwhile $20 investment, but as it is now, I feel a bit slighted, and would not have paid more than $8-$10. It is also interesting to note that since the game takes just over 2 hours to complete, it takes you just past the 2 hour game time limit for returns, and then ends - that seems like a little more than a coincidence to me, but it is mentioned in the description, so it's not like it's a shock when it ends and you are left upset that there isn't more. But that right there is the important part - I was left wanting more. \n\nI didn't give this game a thumbs down because it is a bad game, I gave it a thumbs down because it is currently rather over-priced. I hope that will change as development continues, and if it does, I will try to remember to update my review/recommendation.\n\nUPDATE: Rather disappointed that after 4 months, there is still not a single update to this game. I stand by my review that this had the potential to be one of the greatest VR experiences out there, but instead the developer seems to have taken our money and disappeared. Such is the risk of investing in a game in the hopes that the money will go to improving it.\n\nI also do not think it is a coincidence that every single negative review for this game is being downvoted to make them disappear from the \"most helpful reviews.\" Go ahead and filter to see for yourself.", "timestamp_created": 1464274522, "timestamp_updated": 1471446999, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 52, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.634228", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23213374": {"recommendationid": "23213374", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966877172", "num_games_owned": 232, "num_reviews": 79, "playtime_forever": 347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473226559}, "language": "english", "review": "Vanishing Realms is very engrossing and immersive, and while the gameplay isn't really balanced at all and there's a ton of missing features, I'll give it a weak recommendation because it's still one of the strongest VR titles available right now.\n\nGood first:\n*Environments are large, well-crafted, and immersive\n*Sound design is good, although 3D positional audio is weak\n*Gameplay has some good core mechanics \n*By far the best handling of \"out of bounds\"; every other VR game lets you walk through walls and stick your head in solid objects, but Vanishing Realms fades out your view if you stick your head in an object and teleports you backward if you try to walk in a wall. Every game should work like this.\n\nThe bad:\n(I like to complain so this is much larger than the \"Good\" section, but shouldn't be considered to outweigh the good)\n*Gameplay isn't balanced. There isn't enough variety between the weapons - the two bows both do 5 damage, the medium sword and the hammer both do 6 damage, the hammer doesn't work any differently than the sword. Enemies have an aggro range of about 3 feet and you can skip entire battles by standing out of aggro range and blasting away with your ranged weapons. When you're actually in melee range, the enemies crowd you too much; one of those skeleton soldiers fills up your entire screen and makes you constantly want to back up.\n*Combat is too simple when you're fighting only one enemy but completely overwhelming and unmanageable when you're fighting 3 enemies, partially because the enemies are so bulky you can only watch one at a time\n*Not enough enemy attack animations. The skeleton soldier is the main enemy you encounter and only has two or three animations. After you get used to the timing of its main attack, you get a brief period of feeling badass and then combat starts to go stale.\n*There are no consequences for death. You respawn 10 feet away with your inventory intact and the enemies still wounded. This is probably because the gameplay isn't balanced.\n*Store assets - the same skeleton soldier also appears in Legend of Luca, which must mean it was bought from the Unity asset store or a third-party asset store. Not inherently bad, but gamers can grow sick of models if they start popping up in multiple games\n*Inventory system is buggy, clunky, and impossible to use in combat. Once a fight starts, the only way you can switch weapons is to teleport far away from the fight, which feels like cheating\n*Only 2 - 3 hours of gameplay depending on how much you rush and how much you get lost\n*Save system is minimalistic - it saves your inventory and your position but not your progress. Enemies and obstacles respawn if you quit the game and load up your save again\n*No way to return to the menu without quitting the game. C'mon, this isn't the NES era...\n*The developer isn't active on the forum, which is bad form for an EA game.

Und ich muss sagen, es hat mich wirklich sehr unterhalten! \n\nGameplay:\nVanishing Realms funktionert einwandfrei in VR. Die Bewegungen werden fast immer perfekt ins Spiel \u00fcbertragen und es ist einfach beeindruckend, wie man mit Schild und Schwert gegen virtuelle gegner antreten kann. Hierbei ist allerdings zu beachten, dass man ausreichend Platz im Zimmer hat. Meine Spielfl\u00e4che ist ca. 2 x 1,5 meter gro\u00df und es kam mehr als einmal vor, dass ich den Controller gegen die Wand geschmettert habe. Neben Schwert und Schild gibt es unter anderem noch zwei Bogen, die f\u00fcr abwechslung sorgen.\nSehr positiv zu bewerten sind auch Dinge wie das abbauen von Erzen wie Gold und Diamand, sowie die Suche nach anderen \"Sch\u00e4tzen\". Es gibt auch ein kleines Gesundheitssystem, wobei man Tr\u00e4nke, \u00c4pfel oder Orangen essen kann um sich zu erholen.\n\nStory:\nHier gibt es eher wenig zu berichten. Eine wirkliche Geschichte wird einem nicht erz\u00e4hlt. Es gibt lediglich ein paar \"Schriftrollen\" zu studieren die zumeist Hinweise zum l\u00f6sen eines R\u00e4tsels sind. \nDas Spiel baut eher auf dem Erkunderdrang und der VR Erfahrung, als auf einer Geschichte auf.\n\nGrafik:\nDie Grafik von Vanishing Realms ist nat\u00fcrlich weit entfernt von neuesten nicht VR Titeln, jedoch mit der Vive definitiv sch\u00f6n anzusehen. Es ist nicht nur einmal passiert, dass ich mir eine kurze auszeit vom Spielen nahm, um mir die Umgebung genauer anzusehen und der typische \"VR wow Effekt\" war selbst in einem Grafisch eher schlichten Titel wie diesem da. Alles ist sehr \u00fcbersichtlich gestaltet, was der geringen Aufl\u00f6sung des VR headsets zu gute kommt. \nAls ich das erste mal vor einem der Skelett Gegner stand, hatte ich doch schon ziemlich schiss. Ich weiss das sich das lustig anh\u00f6rt, aber wer selbst mal die Erfahrung macht wird sehen was ich meine ;)\n\nFazit:\nVanishing Realms hat mich ohne Zweifel sehr gut Unterhalten und gezeigt, was zuk\u00fcnftige VR Spiele alles nutzen, bzw. besser machen k\u00f6nnen. Das einzige was mich zum Schluss dann doch gest\u00f6rt hat, war die L\u00e4nge des Spiels. Ich hatte das Spiel in etwas mehr als 2 Stunden durchgespielt. F\u00fcr 20\u20ac h\u00e4tte ich da schon etwas mehr erwartet. Allerdings kann ich das Spiel trotzdem weiterempfehlen, da es eben eines der bislang besten und einzigen Spielen f\u00fcr die HTC Vive ist.\n", "timestamp_created": 1464185503, "timestamp_updated": 1464185503, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.665944", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23200816": {"recommendationid": "23200816", "author": {"steamid": "76561198287183150", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 404, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507097001}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u6230\u9b25\u5f88\u6709\u611f\u89ba", "timestamp_created": 1464180207, "timestamp_updated": 1464180207, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478833", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23200567": {"recommendationid": "23200567", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970573134", "num_games_owned": 1542, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 164, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473792346}, "language": "german", "review": "Ein super Abenteuer.

This is exactly the type of thing I was hoping for when it was announced a few years ago that VR was coming to the mass market. It isn't perfect, but it does a number of things very well.\n\nFirst, the cons. \n\nWhat I didn't see in the description of the game is that it \"highly recommends\" a 2.0 x 2.0 meter space. I live in a small apartment, and my play space is only 2.0x1.6 meter. I can still play the game, but I have to be very careful because any time I stick my sword arm through the \"wall\" (my restricted space is couches, so I can reach well above them, I just can't walk into them) the game pauses, forces me to re-center in the space, and then unpause. Slightly annoying, but better than constantly walking into things. \n\nHowever, within about 30 minutes I learned how to not over-extend, but as a 6'0\" guy who has done steel sabre fencing and sword & board fighting in the SCA, it was hard to not try to execute lunges and molinets (wrist turns to get around an opponent's shield and hit them in the face) in that \"forbidden zone\". Treating it more like a video game and less like a fighting simulation did the trick.\n\nThe story is a little on the flimsy side. Don't expect anything too deep, you pretty much can get the gist of it from watching the intro video on the Steam page. It's not horrible or bad, it's just basic fantasy tropes.\n\nThe pros: \n\nThe graphics are beautiful. To me, titles like this prove that we don't need photo-realism to be immersive in VR, especially when the game runs smoothly. \n\nFighting monsters that are taller than I am is a lot of fun. I've always been a fan of games where projectiles persist in the environment, and fighting with an arrow sticking out of your shoulder is surprisingly satisfying. I mentioned the sword and shield mechanic struggles I had above, but it's still a lot of fun to use that weapon combo. The bow and arrow mechanics work fantastically and are a lot of fun, and you can't beat the destructive power of the magic wand.\n\nObjects are easy to interact with and add a lot to the feel. The inventory system is pretty top-notch and intuitive: in need of a little health? Grab that apple out of the pocket you stuck it in and \"eat\" it by holding it up to your mouth. Did you find a key? Go find the lock that it goes to. \n\nMost of the text is super easy to read. Sometimes I struggle to see the health/mana meters because you have to look at your feet to see them, but the fact that they're out of the way when you're fighting is nice, and you can usually tell by the amount of blood you're looking through how your health is doing. :)\n\nOverall, highly recommended. Don't let the minor flaws get in the way of a good time.

The scale of the first chapter is great and going around the cave and then the open world was great. \n\nWhat I really liked about Vanishing Realms was the combat and the way in which the inventory/UI is handled. The combat is crazy satisfying as you go against enemies looking for their attacks to block/parry but then you're also looking for their opennings that you can then strike. Every fight and every kill I got felt satisfying and deserved. \n\nAs for the UI and inventory system, it is really simple and gets the job done. The UI is mostly minamalistic in that when you are looking out normally, you see no UI blocking your view. Everything UI is down below at your waist. When of your stats change (health, mana, or gold) they do pop up into your view but slowly lower back down to your waist. This system is perfect. Then for the gear and weapons you have, there's two 'backpacks', on on the left and right. This allows you to put things like keys, torches, food, potions, etc... in the backpack of the hand you will likely use. Torches and keys I would use in the left, but food and potions which I would need fast in combat were placed in my right pack so that my dominant hand could easily and quickly get to them. Between to two packs are your weapons devided into categories of one-handed melee, ranged-bow, and ranged-wand, and also the shield spot. Getting into fights and having to alternate between the weapons and gear was really simple and I never struggled to fight the way I wanted to in any engagement.\n\nIf you own a Vive, you need to play this first-person, Zelda style game.\n\n5/5", "timestamp_created": 1464044446, "timestamp_updated": 1464044446, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471125", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23163202": {"recommendationid": "23163202", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974513624", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469893758}, "language": "french", "review": "Un peu cher pour son contenu actuel, mais \u00e7a reste l'un des jeux les plus immersif en VR d moment.\nLe jeux ne brille pas forc\u00e9ment par sa r\u00e9alisation technique, des bugs sont l\u00e0 et certaines m\u00e9caniques m\u00e9riteraient \u00e0 \u00eatre peaufin\u00e9e (mais n'oublions pas qu'il s'agit d'un jeu en acc\u00e8s anticip\u00e9 et donc en cours de d\u00e9veloppement), mais clairement, par moment, on \u00e0 vraiment l'impression d'\u00eatre dans ce chateau perdu sur une ile.\nUn grand espace est n\u00e9anmoins requis pour ne pas heurt\u00e9 trop trouvent les bords de l'air de jeux, ce qui casse l'immersion (je conseillerais 2,5m x 2,5m minimum).\n\nImpatient que la suite sorte, et que l'ergonomie soit am\u00e9rlior\u00e9e", "timestamp_created": 1464043531, "timestamp_updated": 1464043531, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23158298": {"recommendationid": "23158298", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968546236", "num_games_owned": 699, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496518048}, "language": "english", "review": "Great \"mini\" RPG with Zelda elements with some fun exploration thrown in.

However, since VR is new and has limited users its completely understandable why games such as this, which have a cost associated with them only last two to three hours. The developers have to price their games in a way that will bring them a return when sales will be lower than the general PC market. Got it.\n\nThat said, the couple of hourse of gameplay that are available with Vanishing Realms are a heck of a lot of fun. I often felt like I was playing the role Indiana Jones and the environments are absoluetly stunning in VR.\n\nHowever, it is the room scale that really pushes the bar high. Being able to stroll around your own little space, lighting torches, peering over edges and looking through windows provides a gaming experience that I have simply never come close to having before. That isn't to say it is the best gaming I have ever had, it isn't; but it is so radically different to everything I have done before that comparing Vanishing Realms to any stadard monitor driven game would be like comparing apples and oranges. \n\nSo, Vanishing Realms is short but awesomely entertaining.\n\nThe combat is also very done. I generally don't emjoy first person combat games. Call of Duty? No thanks, not for me. However, even though this is technically a first person RPG, I wouldn't have it any other way. If this is a taste of things to come, then I can safely say that the first person gaming was simply made for VR... it just started out a few years before the tech :) Having a skeleton stand right in front of you hammering his rusty blade in your face can be genuinely intimidating. However, being able to lift your own sword (not a mouse/keyboard but an actual physical object in your hand that is perfectly tracked) in order to parry those attacks and then being able to thrust it into it's head to deplete its health is incredibly satisfying.\n\nSadly, there is a slight negative because things turn a little bit less satisfying once you have equipped the bow and arrow. You see, the AI is not particularly good, and as long as you stay at a distance you can spam your arrows to kill the enemies and they won't even move towards you. They can strafe a little from time to time but as soon as I had the bow all the danger became almost completely inert and that was a real shame. In the end I just put the bow away and only used it when absolutely necessary, ie if enemies could not be reached via melee, but it seems like a silly thing to have to do to get the most enjoyment out of the game.\n\nThat said, I highly recommend Vanishing Realms to anybody who has a Vive. Feel free to watch my video (linked at the start of my review) for a general idea of what the game is about, but this won't even begin to give you a taster of the actual experience. The game is great, so I thank the developer for their efforts and I can't wait to see what will be coming next!\n\nFuzz", "timestamp_created": 1463866822, "timestamp_updated": 1463866855, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23125232": {"recommendationid": "23125232", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038864953", "num_games_owned": 359, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 75, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463865561}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best, if not the best VR games I've ever played (including Oculus titles).

Ever.\n\nLet me start by saying, this is an early access game, which should make what I will say all the more impactful. Also, to set the context, I am in my mid 40's and remember playing Pong, getting an Atari 2600 in 1977 (coinciding with Star Wars, what a great year), owning Intellivision 1 and 2, Colecovision, NES, IBM PC jr, Commodore 64, XBOXes, PS's, you name it. I like games. I am an avid board gamer, I have designed games and was my groups Dungeon Master in D&D going back to 1980. In terms of VR, I backed DK1, bought a DK2, and own an Oculus CV1 and the HTC Vive. I've played every TES game, All of the Ultimas (started with Ultima 2 when it came out.)\n\nThis is some next nevel shit....and by that I mean thanks to VR.  skipping some levels that should have somehow been in there in between. All credit to Palmer Lucky and other innovaters for what we are now able to experience. \n\nNow, some things to get out of the way about this game right now. Be warned, that unless you are someone who enjoys early access to games, this is not for you. I feel this warning should be READ before people buy these titles. It's right there in blue, but people seem to ignore it.\n\nThe game is too short at this time. The game does not have realistic monsters, or AAA title graphics. You MUST make sure to set up your Vive perfectly to get the most out of this, and by that I mean make sure your play area is well defined with a good amount of room. Mine is 2m x 2m and my gut tells me that is minimum to REALLY enjoy this game once you start swinging around your weapon. Make sure your hardware supports smooth frame rates with the Vive.\n\nOnce all of the finicky parts are set, you can launch into the game. I will say this again, but I don't like the look of the monsters- but I believe most younger gamers will prefer it. I like more \"serious\" looking monsters, just a preference. While you are walking around in the world and interacting with it, this won't matter at all. In the heat of combat, I found it almost startling how something that looks pretty standard on the monitor, can be intimidating once you are fitted into it's scaled den. I love the inventory system, where you only need to look down at your belt and pouches and grab what you need. Eat food to improve health, grab a sword in one hand and a shield in the other, or a staff, or a bow. The immersion factor is top notch. The weapons feel great. Ducking and side stepping ranged attacks feels phenomenal.\n\nI will give you one example in the game to show you why this is the greatest gaming experience I have ever had.\n\nDeep in the heart of a battle with 3 orcs and 2 floating magic users hurling magic fireballs at me, I hurried to a cluster of rocks. I crouched behind the rocks and watched as fireballs just missed me and singed the side of the rocks I was leaning against. I decided to try to pick off the high floating magic users first. I noted that each time I would attack the orcs, these damned MU's would heal them. I grabbed my trusty bow. I waited until a blast hurled past me. I leaned out just enough to see the enemies and focused on the one closest to me. I slowly drew back my arrow, and tried to aim just above the MU, keeping steady. I released the arrow and made a hit. I continued to pound him and when I got him low in HP, he began to heal himself. I knew I had to increase the rate of my hits. I found a better spot to attack him. A barrage of hits met their mark, and I took the first MU down. I used this tactic to take out the other MU, and had to sidestep his balls of fire while making my way to a tree that was good cover, but closer in range to him. Once I dispatched him, I put away my bow and healed up a bit as quickly as I could. I then drew my sword in my right hand, and my shield in the left. I rushed the orcs, and in a fit of slashes I dealt damage to them. I would use the shield to try to block attacks from one, while stabbing and slashing the others. I finally killed them all and took their treasure. I then made my way into a cave opening I spotted, stopping only to catch my breath.\n\nCons-\nShort gameplay (at this point in early access)\nVery small number of enemies\nCombat can be a little easy (would be great if difficult levels could be added, increasing number, strength, and type of monsters)\nGraphics -Not even so much the level of graphics, I prefer a more serious \"look\" to the monsters, similar to TES or old school D&D. However, I really don't care that much that it should detract from my rating. The environments look great.\n\nPros-\nImmersive beyond anything else I have ever done\nPace is good\nJust enough story to keep things moving (some more voice acting could be added but not a negative at all)\nInventory system\nWeapons, while low in variety, feel great\nAtmosphere, good visuals for VR and ambient sound\n\nSummary - Even at this early stage, the greatest gaming experience I have ever had in terms of immersion and feeling as though I was IN a dungeon or ON a mountain etc. Once complete, with added length, variety and difficulty scaling, it will likely be the best entertainment experience (for me) in almost 40 years when I got into Star Wars.", "timestamp_created": 1463858981, "timestamp_updated": 1463860217, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23122981": {"recommendationid": "23122981", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964390981", "num_games_owned": 192, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500725997}, "language": "english", "review": "The controls and the weapons are truly amazing.\nI think the teleport system this game uses is perfect for vive.\nI love the inventory system.\n\nI ejoyed this game so much and can't wait to see more contentet.\n\nPlease implement random dungeons, random loot and perhaps a skill tree with different classes xD and i would never leave my home again !", "timestamp_created": 1463858419, "timestamp_updated": 1463858419, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23122568": {"recommendationid": "23122568", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983321029", "num_games_owned": 228, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 140, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465668477}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best experiences I had so far in VR.\nYou literally feel like fighting monsters and beeing the hero. \nI am really impressed.

I really like that the game prevents you from sticking your head through walls or warping to distant locations...it genuinely feels like you're walking through a dungeon.\n\nIt is unfortunate that sword fighting feels like a Wii game instead of real sword fighting, but that's not the developer's fault--swinging a motion control just doesn't have the inertia to inspire realistic motions and you end up just waggling the sword.\n\nThe interface for changing weapons and for accessing the inventory needs a bit more design. When you're crouched, you can't access your inventory (I think it goes under the ground due to 3D clipping), and you have to remember to grab the bow with your off hand instead of the one that you'll shoot with. It would be better if weapons were mounted at different points on your body, so that you could really draw a sword or unsling the bow from your back instead of pushing buttons to have them magically appear.", "timestamp_created": 1463794964, "timestamp_updated": 1463794964, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23107479": {"recommendationid": "23107479", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165321787", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463587221}, "language": "german", "review": "Ja, so stelle ich mir VR vor, in der Welt rumlaufen und alles anschauen\nbringt fun.

On the last level, I was getting really good at going around their shields (or under or over) to kill in very few strokes.  The map accuracy for the bows and arrows were surprisingly accurate, allowing for hiding behind cover, aiming without looking (stretch the arms around the corner), dodging incoming arrows, and, for the slow, looking down at the arrows sticking out of you!

I really hope we see more games like this in the future! \n\nPros:\n-I am a big fan of the item belt and really didn't have any issues with inventory management. I used the simple tactic of putting useful items like the pick and torch in my left pouch and put food and potions in the right pouch and it works like a charm.\n-Love the feel and atmosphere of the game world, I spent a few minutes in each area just looking around. You really feel like you are in a dank dungeon or mine. \n-Combat is fun and a little channenging at times (especially against two or more foes). The hit detection could use a little work, but I imagine that its hard to get a virtual sword with 1:1 motion controls to work and feel right. After all the sword and the skelleton you are swinging at are not really there. Over all I was impressed with how fun the combat is. \n-The puzzles, while not hard, required some thought.\n-Felt very much immersed in the game. This is one of those games you say \"Oh, Ill boot that up and play for 15 min.\" and then end up pulling the headset off an hour later saying \"Wow! that was fun!\"\n-Felt like I was getting just a taster of what games will be like in a few years time. After my first hour in the game, I put it down and though \"I really hope we see a major AAA game in this style.\" \n- Enemies feel intimidating and do protect themsevles well. They attempt to block or dodge arrows, and will cover up or step back if they are taking a beating. Also, watching my wife dancing across the room in an all out  fencing duel with thin air is always fun.\n- Mini bosses and bosses were very fun and, I think, a great addition to the game. There are 6 types of enemies and each feel different and have different fighting styles/tactics. I found that killing them in the order of [spoiler] Healer -> Ranged -> melee [/spoiler] helped a lot, and was required in some fights. \n\nCons:\n- While satisfied with the game at the $20 asking price, I want more! I had a lot of fun playing this, and cant wait for the devs to make a sequel or similar. (beat the game in about 2 hours) \n- Sometimes when looking down at the inventory belt the HMD will slide up your face a tiny bit and make what you are trying to see blur. Not a huge problem and may not be an issue for people who can get their Vive securely glued to thier face. But with my giant head, I found myself reaching up and holding the Vive in place so I could see a few times.\n- Because you are swinging the controllers around and moving quite a bit to dodge fireballs and arrows the game tries to keep you in the center of the play area so you dont hit something. This causes the game to pause with a screen that tells you to return to the center of the room and press pause to resume. While a fantastic idea so I dont break things, it does cut into the immersion a bit, sometimes popping up in the middle of a fight. a larger play area would probably help this a lot.

Perhaps making arrows a limited resource would help. E.g. you could loot some arrows from the arrow-filled skeletons you find, and the bowmen you kill.

Jetzt m\u00f6chte ich es auffrischen:\n\nVanishing Realms ist sicherlich ein sehr gutes VR RPG (wobei die allgemeine Liste der VR RPGs recht klein ist) aber dennoch hat dass Spiel auch ein paar Macken, sp\u00e4ter mehr dazu.\n\nIch brauchte knapp 2.5 Stunden um das gesamte Spiel durch zu spielen (dabei habe ich sehr langsam gespielt und mir jede Ecke des Games genauer angeschaut). Das SPIEL (keine Erfahrung!) ist im allgemeinen das Geld wert aber nachdem die Storykomponente einmal beendet wurde gibt es keinen Wiederspielwert denn alle Items wurden bereits erbeutet und ich logge mich nicht nochmal ein nur weil ich einen Erfolg haben m\u00f6chte, den ich bekomme wenn ich 50 Kerzen angez\u00fcndet habe.\n\n\n\n[H1]Negativ[/H1]\n\n- Kein Wiederspieltwert! Du wirst das Spiel vermutlich nicht nochmal starten nachdem du die Story abgeschlossen hast. Es w\u00e4re sehr sch\u00f6n gewesen wenn sich der Developer ein System h\u00e4tte einfallen lassen, dass den Spieler auch nach Beendigung der Story weiterhin besch\u00e4ftigt.\n\n- Es gibt lediglich eine einzige M\u00f6glichkeit sich Fortzubewegen (Teleport). Gerade in Kampfsituation h\u00e4tte ich mir gew\u00fcnscht nicht erst nach einem Platz zum teleportieren suchen zu m\u00fcssen.\n\n- Das st\u00e4ndige B\u00fccken (wenn man so wie ich jedes Goldst\u00fcck aufheben will) ist wirklich nicht sehr freundlich. Der Loot sollte immer in Spielerh\u00f6he leicht zu greifen sein.\n\n- Das Userinterface ist so lala, es funktioniert zwar, wird aber zum Ende des Spieles unglaublich un\u00fcbersichtlich und \u00fcberf\u00fcllt sich. So greift man schlie\u00dflich anstatt zum Schwert dann doch zum Bogen oder Zauberstab.\n\n- Monster droppen nur Gold/Mana. Ich h\u00e4tte mir sehr gew\u00fcnscht das Monster (gerade die St\u00e4rkeren) auch Ausr\u00fcstung droppen (so w\u00e4re eine wirklich Klassische RPG Komponente abgedeckt).\n\n- Kein Aufleveln.\n\n- Die Story wird nur auf Englisch (kein leicht verst\u00e4ndliches Englisch) und \u00fcber In-Game Texte erz\u00e4hlt.\n\n- Gelegentliche Bildfehler beim Teleportieren (vor allem wenn man sich drau\u00dfen Aufh\u00e4lt).\n\n- Relativ niedrig aufgel\u00f6ste Texturen (Der Stil ist trotzdem stimmig aber es k\u00f6nnte deutlich besser sein). Ich vermute das an sehr vielen Stellen Assets gekauft und benutzt wurden (v\u00f6llig i.O und verst\u00e4ndlich).\n\n\n\n[H1]Positiv[/H1]\n\n- Die Story l\u00e4sst sich ganz gut spielen aber geht definitiv unter wegen dem herausragendem Kampfsystem\n\n- Die allgemeine Stimmung im Spiel wird sehr gut umgesetzt. Man hat immer das Gef\u00fchl von einer \"h\u00f6heren Macht\" beobachtet zu werden.\n\n- Stimmige Soundeffekte mit Hall etc.\n\n- Man kann mit sehr vielen Objekten interagieren, so lassen sich zum Beispiel F\u00e4sser zerst\u00f6ren und Heuhaufen und Banner in Brand setzen.\n\n- \u00dcberall sind kleine Pokale versteckt die man sich erbeuten kann. Im Grunde wird man f\u00fcr alles was man in Brand setzt oder zerst\u00f6rt belohnt.\n\n\n\n[H1]Fazit[/H1]\n\nIch empfehle jedem Spieler der sich f\u00fcr RPGs interessiert Vanishing Realms auszuprobieren. Das Geld ist das Spiel defintiv wert und vor kurzem gab der Developer bekannt, dass er nun an der dritten Erweiterung arbeitet. Wer dauerhaften Spa\u00df sucht sollte erst noch abwarten um zu sehen ob der Entwickler daran arbeitet einen Wiederspielwert in das Spiel einzubauen.\n\nAlles in allem gibt es von mir eine Kaufempfehlung und eine Bewertung mit 7/10 Sternen.\n\n\nF\u00fcr die, die Vanishing Realms schon durch gespielt haben und jetzt auf neuen Content warte, hier meine Spieletipp: Trickster VR (\u00e4hnlich zu Vanishing Realms aber mehr Fokus auf Kampf und Waffen).\n\n\nViel Spa\u00df", "timestamp_created": 1463305963, "timestamp_updated": 1492208593, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22987086": {"recommendationid": "22987086", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990944641", "num_games_owned": 499, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 944, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514537834}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely amazing game.

Not just VR, everything.\n\nTips to super-enjoying this:\n\n1. Let yourself be immersed. Try and BE the character you're playing. I felt giddy with excitement and anticipation by the end of this game because I let myself believe I was there.\n2. Move around frequently in your play-space. Since you teleport a lot in this game you can lose a sense of immersion if you do it too often. So just make sure you shift around a lot. Be free.\n3. If you do 1. right, then make sure you fight your enemies like they're going to bludgeon you to death if they actually land a hit. It'll put the hairs up on the back of your neck.\n\nLegit criticisms:\n\n1. AI is pretty crap in this. Enemies aren't smart and just sit there staring at you even though you're only 2 meters away.\n2. AI fights incredibly slowly. This is probably just the designers deciding to ease people in - but more frantic fights would be amazing.\n3. AI doesn't really adapt to your fight style - I'm sure this will be fixed in other games given time. But basically, enemies should be a bit more clever about blocking and dodging blows that you repeatedly land.\n4. Textures could do with a bump in resolution, but honestly, it doesn't matter too much since you get lost in the moment.\n5. MOAR CONTENT! Left me desperate for more.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis is the single best entertainment experience I've ever had. This game is amazing. It's a cliche, but seriously: this game is a must-have.\n\nIf you don't have a Vive. Get a Vive. Get this game.

I was motivated to write it because, out of all the VR games I own, this has been the most fun and awe-inspiring experience on the HTC Vive to date.  It's basically a Zelda-like game where you are actually inside the dungeon.  I own many other VR games and in my opinion this is way better than Job Simulator and the Lab, which feel more like VR tech demos.  Vanishing Realms is a very short game.  I was able to complete the available content in a little less than 3 hours or so.  It does have a lot of interesting mechanics and once you get used to the movement and combat, it is one of those games that make you salivate about what the future of VR has in store.  I am not going to describe the game itself, as you can get that from the Store page.  I will describe the experience though.  \n\nThe initial chapter of the game sees your character locked inside a dungeon that you must try to escape by finding keys, following hints in riddles or defeating various types of enemies.  It is very immersive, and you really feel as if you are inside this world, to the point that I often found myself swinging my \"sword\" outside the playable area and bashing my furniture (make sure you have enough room to play as the game suggests a larger playing area than most other games).  Fighting multiple enemies is fun and sometimes challenging, as enemies will change their attack patterns after a bit and dodge your arrows and magic attacks.  The weapons right now are limited to three different swords and a hammer for melee, two different bows and a fire magic wand for ranged attacks.  Enemies vary based on their abilities and you will find yourself fighting skeleton warriors, archers, mages (as well as healers) and a few bigger baddies and bosses.  Once you complete the initial dungeon, you are teleported to an arena-style area where you have to defeat all the enemies within a time limit in order to complete the game.  The game has various checkpoints whereby you can save your progress by walking over them.\n\nI own several other VR games such as Holopoint, VR Minilands Golf, Job Sim, the Lab, The Blue, etc (just check my game list).  Vanishing Realms doesn't have a high replayability index, but is a way better experience for the price than many other VR games available now.  The only downsides to this game are its brevity, the lack of guidance at certain points (although it's not that hard to figure out) and the semi-ambiguous ending, although it does seem like the developer is working on more content.  I have to say that at this point, this is the only VR game I own that I have been motivated to play all the way through.\n\nAgain, I definitely recommend this game to anyone who owns the Vive and wants to get a good idea of what VR can potentially offer in a gaming experience.  I really felt like I was inside this world and I would be completely immersed in the fights and the game mechanics.  Some things could still use a bit of polish but I definitely think this is an experiencee worth checking out if you are into VR.", "timestamp_created": 1462984619, "timestamp_updated": 1462984619, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22905996": {"recommendationid": "22905996", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970817516", "num_games_owned": 496, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 140, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462938729}, "language": "english", "review": "It's rudimentary gameplay and simple storyline attest to the infancy of consumer virtual reality, but don't let that fool you.

Very much reminiscent of Zelda on N64.  The teleport to move mechanic works flawlessly.  Atmosphere and gameplay are fun and enjoyable. I want to see a dozen more chapters!\n\nOne thing that bothered me was that unlike many other room-scale games Vanishing Realms has no feature which keeps your point of view primarily away from your computer monitor or television. During my entire playthrough of chapter 2 (since it follows more of a single direction of movement - unlike chapter 1's more roaming exploration) I was facing directly toward my monitor and there was nothing I could do about that. For that reason i'd classify this game as more dangerous to near-by displays than other titles. I had smacked my controllers into walls as well my monitor (which I had thankfully covered with a thick cardboard box for safety) during melee combat several times. I play in a 8ft by 10.5ft play area. Many of the other games I've played will utilize the location of the monitor/computer in the room and set the default facing direction as away from the monitor.\n\nThe game takes about 2 hours to finish. That said I wouldn't consider the game worth its current price with its currently limited amount of content. To justify the price I believe the final product (after early access ends) should have have at least two or three times as much gameplay as what we can currently enjoy in the first two chapters. I mean paying $10 per hour for first play-through content is a little rediculous. \n\nI also felt that some of the game's design elements were created to keep the early access beyond Steam's 2 hour refund period.

There hasn't been a single moment where I felt uncomfortable or disoriented in the time I have played.\n\nThe combat is a little slow paced but I suppose it is for the better after trying other games that had fast paced combat which can make you feel uncomfortable and outright dangerous if designed wrong especially when fights get so intense that you forget about your chaperone bounds.\n\nThe cable you are tethered to also hampers your movement so I can't move quickly comfortably because I am always worried about tripping over the wire or smacking into a wall despite the chaperone warning which is often neglected in really heated moments. So I find it good that this game took a slower paced approach.\n\nBut the combat was far from snail paced, It was quite entertaining dueling with archers and sword skeletons, trading steel and arrows, dodging and blocking, and taking cover.\n\nThe AI though not the smartest in the world somehow seemed to react to my actions, sword fighters sometimes try to pull a fient on you dodging your attacks and swiftly counterattacking for instance. If you try to cheese the game with a bow from a distance eventually your foes start to dodge them.\n\nThe foes seem to have a set distance at which they will engage you, the fights are a little slower paced which I don't mind since you have time to plan your next move and don't run out of space as easily.\n\nI found the level design to be nice and clever but far from flawless, there were some places where I felt a disconnect. For instance trying to telport from a ledge to an archer that has been harassing me but it would only allow me to teleport to this one specific little spot on the ground without any visual cues so I was sitting there for ages figuring out how to get there.\n\nI found the inventory system to be quite intuitive, though sometimes it sticks out like a sore thumb when interacting with objects beneath you.\n\nThe art style was beautiful despite the simple cartoony looking graphics. Looks pretty good in VR, I loved the god rays coming out of the windows early on in the game. The skyboxes can use some work though.\n\nThe puzzles I've encountered so far are nice, but very short and simple.\n\nIt is good that the developer added some measures against cheesing the game, like abusing your available space to access areas you should not be able to otherwise.\n\nAll in all, I would really recommend this game, it is worth a try even if you don't happen to like RPGs.", "timestamp_created": 1462593136, "timestamp_updated": 1462593292, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22837176": {"recommendationid": "22837176", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113742847", "num_games_owned": 482, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 218, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504043404}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow....what a game!

The puzzles work pretty well, though the traps, while cool looking, didn't really seem to work for me with teleporting. \n\nOverall, this is a game with a lot of very cool elements.

It would be cool to see some kind of game design that employs Unseen Diplomacy\u2019s technique of room control.

Gone is the wonderful RPG exploration with puzzles, in is a battle area with time limit. It feels like the poorest excuse of level padding and it really wasn't fun.

Bei der allgemeinen Preisbalance wo die VR Spiele liegen, hab ich lange hin und her \u00fcberlegt. Mein alltime Fav. Game ist Dark Souls. Also wollte ich etwas zum erkunden, sowie ein brauchbares Kampfsystem. Vanishing Realms bietet sowas im kleinen. Das Kampfsystem KANN ordentlich genutzt werden, aber auch ein rumgefuchtel wie bei Wii-Titel f\u00fchrt zum Erfolgt und erledigten Gegner. Ich rate f\u00fcr die Immersion trotzdem ordentlich zu spielen, was den Spielspa\u00df erh\u00f6ht. Das Erkunden ist beim erstmal richtig richtig klasse, flacht aber beim erneuten Spielen schneller ab. Da nichts random platziert wird. Aber das ist okay, w\u00fcrde man jedem anderen Single-Playertitel auch nicht ankreiden. Jedoch wirkt ein erneuter Durchlauf, weniger spannend. Daher sei dies angemerkt.\nDer WoW-Look ist gut gew\u00e4hlt bei der momentanen Performance situation. Es verbreitet Stimmung, aber keine Panik beim erkunden der Gem\u00e4uer. Ein kleiner Jumpscare zum Anfang. Der aber wirklich nicht der rede wert ist ist auch dabei. Ich liebe Horrorfilme sowie Spiele, und das genannte Dark Souls hat nat\u00fcrlich auch viele solcher verst\u00f6renden Elemente. Jedoch wirkt in VR so etwas immer noch eine Ecke krasser und Intensiver. Daher bin ich froh, dass dieses Game nie zu dunkel oder zu furchteinfl\u00f6ssend daher kommt. Es macht Spa\u00df, sich eine Fackel zu greifen und hier und da ein bisschen Indiana Jones art die G\u00e4nge zu beleuchten, auch wenn dies nie notwendig ist. Da alles hell genug bleibt. Man macht es trotzdem und man f\u00fchlt sich wieder ein paar Jahre j\u00fcnger und baut sich ein Spiel im Spiel damit. \n\nIch habe zu diesem Zeitpunkt den ersten Akt in gut einer Stunde durchgespielt. Was auch wirklich mein pers\u00f6nliches Limit war. \n- Das Erkunden (soweit m\u00f6glich von meinem Wohnzimmer), funktioniert mit RoomSkaling und blinking bzw. teleportieren zu neuen Abschnitten kombiniert wirklich gut. Auch r\u00fcckw\u00e4rts, um sich platz zu schaffen, wenn Gegner vor einem stehen. Macht man dies zuu schnell versp\u00fcrt man gerade gegen Ende ein wenig \u00dcbelkeit. Aber alles im Rahmen und verglichen mit dem, was ich mit dem Dev-Kit1 der OR damals durchgemacht habe. Ein Kinderspiel. Man ertappt sich dabei, wie man hier und dort unter M\u00f6beln schaut und jede Ecke untersuchen m\u00f6chte. Ob nicht doch noch irgendwo etwas versteckt ist.\n- Das K\u00e4mpfen funktioniert wie schon gesagt gut, kann aber auch in fuchtellei ausatmen. Gerade wenn man seine pers\u00f6nliche Pause machen will, bzw. einfach nur noch den Akt beenden will, weil man ersch\u00f6pft ist. Die KI ist wirklich nicht der rede Wert, die Skelette fuchteln ein wenig, schreien dich an (perfekter Zeitpunkt um ins Auge zu stechen) und schwingen ihr Schwert aus 2 Richtungen. Ansonsten bleiben sie hinter ihren Schild und warten eher das man auf sie zu kommt. Was gut ist. Denn in VR wird vieles schnell hektisch: \"Wo bin ich gerade im RL? Hoffentlich ist vor mir nicht der Fernsehr, kurz umschalten zur Kamera. Neu Positionieren. Kabel richten. Okay weiter gehts!\" Solche Momente wird man hier alle 2 min erleben, gerade wenn man nur etwa 3x2 Meter platz hat. Ich habe fast meine Freundin aufm Sofa einmal getroffen. Gerade wenn man voll dabei ist. Oder nur ein paar M\u00fcnzen sammeln will. Daher ist es gut, dass die Gegner eher passiv agieren und dem Spieler sehr viele Chancen bieten. Ich denke das ist ein guter Kompromiss, zwischen Spielspa\u00df und Sicherheit.\n- Die Technik dahinter. Ich mag mich t\u00e4uschen, aber ich glaube vieles ist Asset, was im Unitystore angeboten wird. Aber das macht mir nichts. Man muss den WoWartigen Look aber m\u00f6gen. Daf\u00fcr bleibt die Performance auch meist Stabil. Bei zu vielen Lichtquellen hatte ich hier und da ein zucken gesehen. Was aber auch an meiner 770 GTX (4gb vram) liegen kann. Die Eingaben funktionieren tadellos und man merkt, dass sich viele Gedanken gemacht wurden. Einzig das man nicht runterfallen kann, wenn man sich auf Kisten portet finde ich etwas schade. Aber eine Kleinigkeit. Was mich mehr st\u00f6rt ist das Speichersystem, was eher Checkpointartig funktioniert. Ich hatte mal einen Soundausfall und wollte Steam neu starten und stand wieder vor New Game. Tut nicht not. \n\n\nUnterm Strich m\u00f6chte ich Jedem Vanishing Realms empfehlen, der einmal als Ritter Dungeons erkunden m\u00f6chte. Die Spielzeit mag (momentan) kurz wirken und der Wiederspielwert gen Null. Jedoch muss man sich vor Augen f\u00fchren, dass VR nach einer Stunde schon anstrengend ist. Ich denke Sessions werden niemals 4-6 Stunden in Angriff nehmen. Zumindest wenn man so aktiv agiert wie hier. Und auch wenn man nach einem mal Spielen alles gesehen hat, denke ich schaut man vielleicht hin und wieder noch mal rein, um ein paar Monster zu metzeln. Der Preis geht in Ordnung. Ich bin gespannt ob und was noch alles nachgeliefert wird. Aber es f\u00fchlt sich jetzt schon wie ein richtiges Spiel an, was das wichtigste erf\u00fcllt.

There's so many things I want to say about this game.  For one, I have been waiting 12 years to play this game.  I know, it's only been a twinkle in a developer\u2019s eye for a few months or so, but that doesn't change anything.\n\nWhen I was playing Morrowind, I wanted it to be this game.  When I played Diablo 1, I wanted it to be this game.  Heck, when I read books...I wanted them to be this game.  This game is not Morrowind or Diablo.  It's not any of those things.  This game is clunky, sloppy, graphically challenged (no offense, I still love them) and downright fantastic. \n\nIt has a taste, and truly just a taste, of everything I want in a video game.  Realistic sword movements, fun battles, gimmicky enemies, a touch of plot, a sprinkle of character, a hint of leveling, a smidge of puzzles, a dash of environmental interaction and a pinch of looting/customization.  This is by all means, a shadow of a good RPG.  But it doesn't matter.  We've all played these good RPGs, but what we want is to be in one.  This is as close as you can get right now.\n\nMy only negative is that it's tricky to interact with the belt, as in, a giant pain (unless I was doing something wrong) and it's too short.\n\nRemember when you senselessly fought things with the Wii-mote?  Remember when you bought a Playstation move and for a few hours thought it was awesome until you realized that, meh, not that great?  Remember when you wanted to be playing this game?

I tested this game sitting down in a office desk chair and had to use my upper body to move. This game thankfully allows movement using the controller, teleporting you from one spot on the floor to another. You will need to have the HTC Vive in Room scaling mode to play this game and it was a bit of a challenge to play sitting down, but I will assure all the talking points will cover the universal approach and in no way will my reliability of a chair affect the opinion. That said, let us get to the main question. Is this RPG the grand attraction suited to introduce the functionality of the HTC Vive or is it another newcomer that might have gone on stage prematurely?\n\nThe dungeon and graveyard look astounding with a style similar to one of the latter Zelda games. Little cracks cover the walls and the wood bearings show off wear and tare. Skeletons are detailed beautifully with shields riddled with arrows and bruised dents in their armour. It really stood out the entire time I was playing it and I found myself more than once stopping to enjoy the atmosphere. It works very well to establish the mood, even if the actual inhabitants look more cartoonish than frightening. The music was a side note, painfully masked by the louder ambient noises of box hits, enemy strikes and arrow flings. I tried finding a way to change the volume, but I might have missed it. \n\nThe tutorial is a welcome feature and covers the basics such as moving and picking up items. The rest of the features are rather self explanatory except for maybe the wand usage which as of now can be annoying when you attempt to put it away only to blast yourself with it. Items range from health potions, torches, a pick axe, food and puzzle items. Gold, jewels, mana stones, ore (from mining) and chalices add to the currency system used to buy weapons and potions. There are also ruby chalices hidden throughout the dungeon to collect for an achievement, but it also provides gold and mana. It is simple enough to pick up items and the only issues with it are being close enough to reach, but with the teleport movement style I have not had an issue reaching anything. UI consists of slots that appear around your waist and include categories for weapons, potions, wand, bow and items. The item slot is a bit annoying when trying to grab certain items (have to go through each item until you get the one you need) and you cannot drop items. There is a limit to how many items you can carry so unless you stockpiled on fruits before grabbing the pick axe, you should be fine.\n\nCombat is a typical hack and slash standoff against skeletons and ghosts. As long as the enemy can see you and are in range, they will attempt to hit you as a group (space must be available to accommodate multiple melee so bottlenecking into a short gap is usually recommended). Weapons and a shield are either bought or found and weapons range from swords, bows (use off hand to pull back arrow), hammer or a wand (uses mana and you point, hold trigger and release). Dual wielding is possible as well as parrying to deal with melee hits, but the shield is crucial against arrows and moving is the only way to avoid fireballs. It is very simplistic in nature with the majority just being massive flailing of the controller, but it is recommended to time attacks and use movement to gain a upper hand. It can get very tiring during the fights later on. Death is not to harsh on the player at least. \n\nThe look and feel of the game cannot overcome the barren amount of content though. Going through the first level can take about 30-45 minutes if you are going slow and the arena style matches can keep that stretched to about an hour and fifteen. There is a total of 11 ruby chalices to collect and 33 ore spots to harvest for achievements, but all of this can be done in one pass if you look half-effort. It can be hard for some to make it the whole way in one play through with the forty plus monsters you so thankfully their is checkpoint saving, but if someone wants to play, they either start where you left off or erase the entire save and start from the beginning. Outside of this, there were some random moments I experienced missing frames and was kicked out of the game to the Vive menu (it started were I left off when I entered the app again). \n\nDuring my second play through, the game starting feeling like an endurance test over anything else. The simple wonder of discovering what was behind the next corner really helped keep the magic alive during the first play through.

The visuals are gorgeous once you're inside of the game, and the use of roomscale is excellent if you have the room to move from different pieces of cover.  I had so much fun during the archer battles and ranged combat. \n\nThe melee combat is a little less satisfying but still overall a great deal of fun.  Like others have said sometimes the enemies end up getting to close to you and it makes combat slightly awkward, granted once you learn how to teleport around the battlefield like a boss this becomes much less of an issue.  My only gripe with the melee combat.....why isn't there vibration on the wand when your sword makes contact with something?  That seems like it should be natural, and it would go a long ways towards immersion. \n\nThe game is a bit on the short side, but it will make for an excellent demo game, and has proven to me that sword fighting can absolutely work (at least in single player) games with the Vive.  I was always confident that I could parry or block an attack that was coming without worrying about clipping, or feeling like my sword simply floats through the enemies.  \n\n8/10 for now.

Ich war ja schon immer ein RPG Fan, aber welche Art von RPGs m\u00f6glich sind in VR hat mich echt weggeblasen. \nDie ganzen VR Komponenten finde ich hier einfach super durchdacht: Ich habe einen virtuellen G\u00fcrtel um die Taille, der alle Waffen, Tr\u00e4nke, Zauber und sonstigen Gegenst\u00e4nde aufbewahrt, daher kann ich auch ein relativ komplexes Inventar recht schnell verwalten - Das Winzige, was ich mir w\u00fcnschen w\u00fcrde, w\u00e4re eine Art Oberfl\u00e4che, in der ich meinen gesamten G\u00fcrtelinhalt verwalten k\u00f6nnte - wobei ich auch sehe, dass das Immersion kosten k\u00f6nnte. Auch verh\u00e4lt sich der G\u00fcrtel manchmal etwas komisch, irgendwie scheint er manchmal die Taille entlang zu rutschen, aber das k\u00f6nnte auch daran liegen, dass ich meine 2 Sensorboxen noch nicht fest verankert und ausgerichtet habe.\n\nDas Laufen \u00fcber die Teleportierfunktion ist auch sehr gut gel\u00f6\u00dft: Ich kann mich nicht einfach auf den n\u00e4chsten Berg oder an einem Gegner vorbei teleportieren - leider kann ich aber einem Gegner entfliehen damit, da die Teleportation einfach viel schneller als jeder Gegner ist. Auch habe ich einen begrenzten Teleportastionsradius, der so ein bisschen die \u00fcbliche \"Schrittl\u00e4nge\" wiederspiegelt - man denke hier an Old-School Dungeonm Crawler wie Legend of Grimrock.

That being said, this game is amazing. If you ever wanted to feel like you have been thrown into a Zelda game(literally), this is the game for you. Yes it is in early access and yes there are some minor issues like inventory management. But the came had way too many pros for such minor details to stop me. I played all of the Early Access content in one sitting, probably not a good idea, but I was addicted. It was one of the most immersive games in VR I have played so far. I didn't want to leave! Anyways here are some of the Pros and Cons I experienced, it may not be the same for everybody.\n\nPros++++++\n-Immersive gameplay\n- You get to hack and slash your enemies( or disintegrate them with fire!)\n- Different weapons to suit your gamestyle(Archer, Knight, and Mage all mixed into one person)\n- Fun exploration and beautiful artwork/surroundings\n- A little bit of puzzle solving but nothing difficult\n- You feel like you are actually wielding whatever weapon you choose!\n- Some fun trap elements\n- Addicting( I don't know if this is a pro or con)\n- Some fun mini-boss and boss battles\n\nCons- - - - - (take lightly, it is still early access)\n- Inventory system can be annoying. I wanted to navigate back to my torch but since I picked up practically everything I saw I had to spam my inventory until the correct item appeared.\n- You need an ample amount of space of at least 2m x 2m.( not a problem for me, but could be for those with small areas)\n- Not much else when it comes to cons.\n\nPersonal recommendation:  I wish some of the puzzles were a little more difficult to really add a challenge! (Again, still early access)\n\nWell all things aside I do recommend this game for those that love the dungeon crawling and puzzle solving games. Or in other words, if you liked Zelda, you will like this game. It is only a few hours of content, but this is a game I want to support.

I wish there was a greater feeling of weight to swinging the sword. Obviously design choices were made, but I'd rather not see virtual objects ever 'go through' other virtual objects even if it means disassociating the held object with your actual hand. In Job Simulator for instance, if you hold a mug and put your hand through a table the mug is stopped by the table and your hand continues through. Not only should your sword be physically blocked by an enemy shield but there should be a momentum calculation as well. One of the primary differences of the Vive from the Wii is that the controllers are tracked 1:1, real momentum calculations are possible; otherwise the combat will just feel gimmicky.\n\nAnother criticism would be the dreadful inventory system which the developer has already said he is going address. \n\nThe environments look great and feel great in VR.

R. adapts the system from Valve's The Lab instead of the one they are using. \n- Hammer and Sword are cool but they could feel a bit more \"round\". Maybe add a bit of vibrations when hitting the enemy or something like that.\n- Shield is S-class, arrows pierce through a bit and give a super cool feeling. Not sure if there's vibrations actually. Was too immersed to really check that. It's just god damn statisfying learning the quirks and hits of every big dude and blocking the shit out of his strikes.\n- Wand is OGMWTFBBQ.\n\nGeneral movement is pretty well done, although the auto pause is a bit too agressive when pointing your sword through objects but that's not so bad and can be turned off.\n\nSome minor quirks with how far monsters \"back off\" when playing on a 2.5x2.5m roomscale but that's still not a big deal, short teleport and that is an interesting dynamic this way.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1461093699, "timestamp_updated": 1461093699, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22521269": {"recommendationid": "22521269", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002783329", "num_games_owned": 379, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 735, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508087694}, "language": "english", "review": "Tried to bite an apple. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1461093151, "timestamp_updated": 1461093151, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522887", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22516363": {"recommendationid": "22516363", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993471695", "num_games_owned": 190, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492225989}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm reviewing this as an early access game.

I was sad when I finished this because I wanted more. \n\nIf people are complaining that they can just teleport almost inside, and the waggle the sword around then I feel like that is one them for now.  Hopefully the enemies will be pushed back in the future.  For now, you can just teleport in front of them and then trade blows, blocks, and dodges the way it was intended to be played.  At one point near the end when it gets kind of hectic, I accidentally grabbed my old sword instead of my shield.  I didn't have enough time to switch back so I was duel wielding swords for awhile, and that was a lot of fun trying to move around and strike twice every time I saw an opening.\n\nThe auto pause was a little annoying at first.

About 25 minutes into Gallery, I had to stop and request a refund....it feels bored to me walking around exploring looking at things solving puzzles are not my thing I guess. Maybe I don't like adventure games.  Then I play Vanishing Realms, holy shyt...this game put me in a beautiful place where I actually really feel I am walking in that world.  It reminds me of Zelda except that you're actually there and not looking at the 2d screen. The teleportation is perfect....it's easy and quick and intuitive.  I didn't like the one in Gallery's...I know there is an option to change it but i didn't bother.  Vanishing Realm's teleportation should be used as a default for EVERY VR game!! It is that good along with Budget's Cut.  I love the magic, text, words, voices of Vanishing Realm, they're engaging. When i picked up the sword, it brought a smile to my face...i am ACTUALLY holding a freaking sword!  I am now ready to beat someone up.  And when i picked up the shield....I feel more than ready for combat.  I begin to search and the first battle with the skeleton was mesmerizing...holy shyt, it's huge.  I feel overwelmed but safe because I have my sword and shield. This is no gimmick folks. Your skills in battle is based on your skills in real life lol.  It was intense and I was so into it that I even hit the wall.  I'm losing my mind. I have 15x15 space and it feels so good to get that bit of space.  I imagine people that have less space might feel frustrated because even I wish I have more space.  So those are the positives i have about the game.

You can pause the game but there is no option to save and I don't know if i lose the progress or not.  \n\nAnother thing i wish improvement is object collision.  I wish every objects in the world I hit with the sword make that collision sound.  It just feel satisfying to hit things with your sword.  If i drag the sword on the concrete, it should give me that feeling of how sword behaves in real life....with perhaps spark flying.  Anyway, these are just suggestions.

Playing this with the Vive versus looking at screenshots just does not do it justice. I was enjoying it so much I was unable to stop playing this until the game told me I was done, it's that good. It's definitely my favorite Vive game I've played so far.\n\nWhat I loved:\n- Great sense of immersion\n- Great style\n- Writing (on pieces of paper throughout the game) was pretty entertaining to think about the meanings of and well written\n- Little touches - things like drawing the bow string back and getting a haptic tension feeling in the controller\n\nThings that I think could improve or at least considered by the devs:\n- Combat\nI didn't dislike the swordplay and shield stuff, but I felt like I was flailing a bit more than I would have liked to or felt immersive. I couldn't quite learn what was working against the enemies other than sheer flailing. I could get a cut around the head on the base skeleton warrior guys, but it was hard to replicate it time after time. Sometime I would get blocked. Using the bow and arrow was awesome and, when I was in a bind, would usually be a reliable strategy. Still I would love to be able to feel like I was a master of the swordplay.\n\nI was also wondering what sort of assumptions were made in the way the skeleton characters block that would be advantageous or disadvantageous to either a left or right handed player. I'm not sure if it makes sense, but maybe have skeletons that are left or right handed so there's a chance to even that playing field a tad.\n\n- User interface\nIt would be great if there's an option to choose a left-handed inventory \"belt\" layout. As a lefty I was picking things up frequently with my left hand, but having to reach across my body to the end slot to put an item away. I'm a pretty skinny person, but sometimes reaching and looking would cause the \"belt\" UI to shift over to the right on me, making it a bit more tedious to put the item away than it already was. It would be great as a lefty to just be able to put things away without having to stare too much at the slot.\n\n- Multiple item \"belt\" user interface\nIf a slot on the belt contains more than one item, maybe experiment with implementing a mechanic where the user can twist the controller once they've activated a slot and then twisting would cycle backwards or forwards through the items in that slot. Another option might be to show the items in some sort of list that pops out once you've activated that slot and moving the controller up or down moves through the items (only a few around the current one are shown)\n\nAll of those things said, I have to say this is the highlight game for me thus far on the Vive.

You get actually, physically fight monsters, the game is an absolute blast. The game isn\u2019t without issue however.\n\nThe current implementation of teleportation is not as good as it could be. Adding an indication of where you are in your play space, similar to how The Lab handles it would be a great improvement. This wouldn\u2019t change where you are and aren\u2019t allowed to go; it just reduces the mental acrobats you need to go through in order to get where you want to go if you need to interact with an object. Not being able to drop objects is jarring. Yes, you need almost every item you are carrying, but sometimes I don\u2019t want five apples on me when I\u2019m looking for a torch or my pickaxe. The grip buttons aren\u2019t used for anything currently, there\u2019s your use. If the player drops a key object, maybe make the object flash, or give some other indication showing that they may need it. Overall the inventory could use some work, I don\u2019t like having to cycle through my swords, just to get to the one I want.\n\nCombat is extremely entertaining, but as my friend discovered, you can win your fights by \u201cSkyward Sword-ing\u201d your way through them. Near the end of the game, he was just waggling his sword back and forth in the enemies\u2019 hitbox, effectively stunlocking them and turning the fights into a joke. That said, if you fight how you would expect to handle a sword and shield, the combat feels awesome. The choice of giving the play a sword first instead of a shield feels odd. From what I\u2019ve seen, the average player doesn\u2019t try to parry until they are told they can, and that makes the first few fights very panicked. Possibly introducing the shield first, and having the players defend against arrows before being given a weapon would introduce the combat better. I\u2019d love to be able to shield bash my enemies, maybe not doing much (if any) damage, but being able to stagger them would be nice. The magic staff, while useful for massive damage and an AOE attack, just doesn\u2019t feel good to use, it shoots it\u2019s fireball in a disappointingly short arc, and doesn\u2019t have much sensation on use.\n\nThe AI isn\u2019t the most advanced in the world but it does try to prevent you from performing the same combinations against it. After a few similar moves, the enemies will dodge your attacks or try to block them, and forces you to try a different attack angle or method. The giant skeleton enemies downward attack also seems like it might not be working as intended, where if the player is within range to be able to hit the giant, the monster\u2019s attack never seems to connect, since the end of the flail lands so far behind the player. All of that said, Vanishing Realms is an absolute delight to play, the environments are varied enough that you know generally where you are in the world. Although the first map is actually quite small if you are racing through it and the second is just the same arena nine times.\n\nSince the game is in early access at the time of writing (April 9, 2016) I expect that the game will grow more over time, and the majority of its issues to get dealt with.", "timestamp_created": 1460246417, "timestamp_updated": 1460246417, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503844", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22327571": {"recommendationid": "22327571", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968353457", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473533595}, "language": "english", "review": "I...\nwent to another world, got in fights with skeletons, got lewt, punched a real life wall (on accident), and now have tennis elbow.

I had a blast playing through it. Exploring was nice, and once you achieve some of the objectives it gives a nice and satisfying feeling.\n\nAlso make sure to respect and know your chaperone bounds, especially early on in the game when you're not used to the combat yet. Only stab when you're sure you have enough room :D. I didn't have any accidents, but there were a few close calls where I nearly punched a chaperone wall.\n\nI'd like to see some more refinement on the combat, though. It's great for a first iteration, but I feel that there's some room for improvement. Larger enemies are immersion breaking for me since you need to get close to them to whack them, but then you have non-existant collision and clipping. And their attacks also make no sense then. Also, in general, blocking works well, but attacking feels off. You don't need finesse for some enemies, just randomly flail around and you're guaranteed to get some hits in.\n\nOh and I love the AI sometimes. When using a bow and arrow, they eventually start dodging your arrows, and at one point they just put their guard up so it's hard to get an arrow in. A great way to deal with cheese. Speaking of archery, right now aiming is done purely with the bow hand.

The Vive removes those layers of abstraction. Which button do I press to gaze at an enemy and block that fireball? Who cares! Just look at that archer and raise your shield. Is there an arrow flying at you? Physically dodge it or duck behind that stone column for cover. Need to restore your health? Pull the potion out of your inventory and drink it.\n\nThrough these natural actions, and augmented by the haptic feedback of the Vive motion controllers, we\u2019re projecting a tangible sense of agency into the game world in a way that was previously impossible. And the world responds accordingly.\n\nDuring a particularly heated battle, I was fending off two flanking archers, a healer, and a spellcaster (make that healer a priority kill with your bow & arrow!) who were guarding the coveted Dragon Wand. I emerged sweaty and out of breath from hiding behind trees, popping out of cover, dodging arrows, and just getting wrapped up in the heat of the moment. When you start dual-wielding swords and fighting increasingly brawny boss monsters, Vanishing Realms can even turn into a legitimate workout if you get carried away.\n\nI can easily say without reservation that Vanishing Realms is a visceral, awe-inspiring VR experience steeped in intuitive, tactile gameplay. It has left me satisfied but selfishly craving more. That it was created by a single developer in 8 months is nothing short of extraordinary, and I believe this paves the way for a surge of successful, micro-sized development teams making breakout games for virtual reality.\"\n\nFull review with gameplay: http://uploadvr.com/vanishing-realms-rite-of-steel-early-access-review-roomscale-dungeon-crawling/", "timestamp_created": 1459868351, "timestamp_updated": 1459930169, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 75, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.723304", "comment_count": "11", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39500732": {"recommendationid": "39500732", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013495934", "num_games_owned": 280, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 182, "last_played": 1516336997}, "language": "koreana", "review": "this is good game, i can tell , little bit of short but! there was no boring spot, everything was absolutely needed my concentration.\n\nVR\uc7a5\ub974\uc911\uc5d0 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc774 \uc88b\uc740 \uac8c\uc784\uc911 \ud558\ub098\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4\n\n\uad81\uc220,\uac80\uc220,\ub9c9\uace0 \ub54c\ub9ac\uae30\ub4f1\ub4f1, \uc798 \uad6c\ud604\ud574 \ub1a8\uace0\n\n\uac80\uc220\ub85c \ub370\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \uc785\ud788\ub824\uba74, \ubb34\uae30\ub97c \uc77c\uc815\uac70\ub9ac\ub97c \uc18d\ub3c4\ub97c \ub0b4\uc5b4 \uc6c0\uc9c1\uc5ec\uc57c\ud558\ub294 \uc870\uc791\uc774 \ud2b9\ud788 \ub9c8\uc74c\uc5d0 \ub4e4\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4 \n\n\uc81c \uc810\uc218\ub294 8.7/10 \uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4\n\n\uc9e7\uc740 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\ud0c0\uc784\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc \uac00\uaca9\uc774 \ub0ae\uc544\uc11c \uc774\ud574\ub294 \uac11\ub2c8\ub2e4\n\n\uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub3c4 \ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\ub2c8 \uacc4\uc18d\ud574\uc11c \uae30\ub300\ud574 \ubcfc\ub9cc\ub3c4 \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4\n\n\uc544\uc9c1 \uc5bc\ub9ac\uc5d1\uc138\uc2a4\uc774\ub2c8\uae4c\uc694", "timestamp_created": 1516508232, "timestamp_updated": 1516508232, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39497498": {"recommendationid": "39497498", "author": {"steamid": "76561198204086047", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 232, "last_played": 1516431851}, "language": "english", "review": "Very engaging game.

The world is detailed and will surprise you. The mechanics are polished and the gameplay is fantastic. The game is extremely easy in terms of winning all your battles, none of them gave me any trouble at all, including any boss/mini bosses, but it was incredible fun nonetheless. The game makes you feel like youre an adventurer, with swords, shields, bows and more! I loved this game and it was easily worth its price on sale. The game is terribly short though, with two chapters. Chapter 1 was an adequate length, and I am satisfied with it. It never hit me that chapter 2 wont be as long, in fact, i finished chapter 2 in 436 seconds. Yes seconds. So while the developer did a great job with the game, saying there are 2 chapters is very misleading. Chapter one was exceptional, chapter 2 seems more like bait to make you purchase chapter 3 when it is released. After playing chapter 1 though, I already decided im buying the next chapters as soon as they come out! \nNote to developer: You guys have done an amazing job, and I love this game so much. But the way you handled the second chapter (you know what im talking about, im avoiding spoilers) was a great surprise but then the chapter ends after a total of about 10 mins of play, was extremely dissappointing. If you put the whole game as part of just chapter 1, including everything of chapter 2, it would have been a better experience, far more thrilling and i would have felt no dissappointment! So the game is great, next time just put it all in one chapter I think.

It's become one of my favorite VR experiences so far on Rift, I'm enjoying it as much so far as I enjoyed Lone Echo.   Lots of exploration, plenty of combat, riddles to solve, money to collect.\n\nI wish it were maybe a little more on the realistic looking scale than it is, but I do enjoy some of the fine details they have like skeletons eyes actually looking at and reacting to where my sword is.  If i hold it over my head pointed at them to try and go in for a side of the neck shot around their shield, their eyes look up and do the side in the direction of the tip of my sword.  It makes it feel more like combat would, and they properly react to your attacks and counter.  You can do stuff like block their incoming swing and reflect their arm away opening up a nice big gap to jab them.  Melee combat It's very satisfying.\n\nRanged combat, the bow and arrow stuff is pretty good.  I don't particularly like the magic staff combat though.  Right now i just have a fireball staff and it lobbs fireballs and there's no way to tell other than getting used to it how far the shots are going to go and at 100 mana cost per shot it depletes your mana quickly missing.\n\nI hope Vanishing Realms is a good platform the devs can use to produce bigger, deeper RPG experiences from .

Trials of Steel is a bit of a simple boss rush add-on but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. I think that speaks to the fantastic melee fighting system where you actually have to raise your arm to defend with a shield and swing with your other arm to attack with a sword while dodgin around with your actual body. All with one to one movement. I think it's easy to forget what a phenomenal achievement that is and how amazingly it adds to the classic adventure/RPG game.

As an old-skool gamer who has read various fiction to do with the future of VR (The Web 2027/2028, Ready Player One etc.), before getting a VR rig I was always most excited about the idea of VR high fantasy, and this hits the spot.\n\nThe graphics are excellent, the gameplay is fun and overall it's an absolute blast.  For the sake of completeness i will suggest two areas in which it could do better:\n1) The fighting - in melee there are few openings by traditional means - most higher level enemies have shields and you can't hit them with normal stabbing, slashing or overhead shots.  You have to come over the top with your sword (/mace/hammer etc.) only.  This leads to quite repetitive fights and the enemies don't really change their tactics so you just keep doing the same move.\n2) The writing.  It feels like this game was made by non-English speakers.  That's fine, but if you're going to release it in English, get a creative English writer to help with your content.  The riddles commonly don't rhyme or scan, and seem to be like a bad translation from another language.  In a few hours a good writer could have improved these and made a big input into immersion.\n\nAll in all though, an excellent game and one any VR gamer who likes a fantasy dungeon crawl should get.", "timestamp_created": 1520852788, "timestamp_updated": 1520852933, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40737816": {"recommendationid": "40737816", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133081944", "num_games_owned": 1608, "num_reviews": 76, "playtime_forever": 70, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520088222}, "language": "english", "review": "rather meh personally", "timestamp_created": 1520765881, "timestamp_updated": 1520765881, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.434783", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40725488": {"recommendationid": "40725488", "author": {"steamid": "76561198374713068", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 921, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 284, "last_played": 1520709204}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm completely gonna skip the part where I bitch about how 'short' the game is.

Vanishing Realms is definitely one of these games, and I'm not sure it'll be topped particularly soon.\n\nWhilst quite short, it's made up for by the well implemented mechanics and engaging RPG atmosphere. This is the only RPG I've played to completion in VR yet, and haven't had enough! I sincerely hope this is continued.\n\nThe plot is not hugely complex, but is interesting and engaging nonetheless. The game does a good job of explaining the background with good use of environmental props to support it. From quite early on in the game you feel like you know your place and how to proceed. I would love to see the lore expanded on in future, as in it's current form there is not overly much explained about *why* things are the way they are.\n\nBoth teleportation and \"walking\" are available as movement options, both feeling very intuitive making the world easy to navigate around without much thought.\nInteracting with the environment is quite satisfying, and interactable props respond well to the player.\n\nCombat is incredibly easy once you get used to it, but considering the limitations posed by VR this is very understandable. With mouse and keyboard it's very easy to turn and dodge very fast, but not so much in VR. The headset cable, real world objects, walls etc generally make rapid combat tricky for the player, especially for people in a small space like me. Despite the ease with which enemies can be dispatched, I have no complaints about the combat.\n\nI definitely consider this a \"must play\" VR game as it gets so many aspects of VR gaming so very right. At the current price (\u00a315 UK) it's a little expensive; 3 hours playtime to complete is \u00a35 an hour, so maybe consider picking up on sale if you're unsure. \nHowever looking back, I would happily pay \u00a315 for this!

That's when I knew the game was badass, though.\"\n\nI admit, I haven't had my VR rig for long (Dec 2017), but this is one of the first games I ever played.  I loved it then, and I love it now. \n\nI could do without the cartoony part of it, but really the game has a lot of polish, and YOU WILL lose yourself in the moment.\n\nI have played all kinds of games, everything from Myst to Thief to Fallout 1/2 to Diablo to Legend Of Zelda and even old Doom. I have been waiting over 20 years for viable VR, and in December, when I went to choose games to buy, this game was one of the first 10 I bought. It was also the first VR RPG I played. I loved it so much that it became the rule for grading other games, lol. I play VR to be immersed, and to escape my life and my depression; I guess you could call it an emotional support tool, and I don't care if it seem antisocial, as it is keeping me alive. Anyway, I have played through both chapters of the game, and have even started a new game on hard settings. It is just a LOT of fun, and really no one can own a VR rig and NOT play this game, it should be a law, (unless you hate RPGs and fun, and if so why did you get a VR rig in the first place, wacko?)\n\nPROS:\n-Middle filler content is good, seamless\n-Plenty to do and fight\n-Some side stuff, like shooting apples for an achievement. Yum apples.\n-Beautiful\n\nCons:\n-The double ax sucks (or I suck using it or both)\n-Not sure achievements are functional?\n-The bow could maybe have a longer draw, or maybe my arms are too long? Also, it doesnt seem to track a fully-drawn notched arrow well if you hold a shot for a while. I have noticed this in other VR bow games to lesser or greater degrees, especially if I wear a hoody with the hood down. Hmmm?\n-So immersive you could get hurt or break equipment. I have bruised a knee falling over a coffee table, and I broke my wand on the first day I got my VR rig, trying to cut open a skeleton guy when IRL I hit the wand on the wall. I had to take the wand apart and do the infamous thumbpad fix.\n\nI think I bought the game for 25% off, which I think is fair for Chapter 1/2. More? IDK about that.

Its only about 3 hours of game play but the immersion experience is great! I love how when your fighting if you actually pay attention to where your sword is and where they are stricking you can actually fight incredibly effective. I enjoy how easy it is to run.

Dishonesty?\n- The first half of the game was extremely frustrating with the game automatically pausing whenever you approached the limits of your playspace. You can disable that in options but it always gets re-enabled (after restart) and it was very unclear that this is what was causing it.\n- Playing on the Oculus Rift, during fighting I somehow (have NO idea how) kept pressing the pause button in heat of combat (which takes me to the SteamVR page and sometimes to the pause screen???) That would be so frustrating I wanted to throw the game out the window. There is of course no way to remap controls for the Rift.\n\nPositives:\n- Climbing ropes\n- Beating the ***t out of NPCs with accurate swings, interesting physics tho very easy to beat once figured out.", "timestamp_created": 1517001309, "timestamp_updated": 1517001309, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543860", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 9, "review_score_desc": "Overwhelmingly Positive", "total_positive": 2053, "total_negative": 108, "total_reviews": 2161}}

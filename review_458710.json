I was quite excited for this game as a continuation.\nTo make it a bit easier to digest, I'll make a pros and cons list.\n\n+PROS:\n+The new hero level-up system is great. Rather than having to level your hero from level 1 on each map, it's cumulative.\n+Better towers that all feel viable.\n+The addition of small comic strips before or after some maps.\n+Some of the maps feel more alive. Sandpeople from star wars shooting random targets, giant plants that eat whoever gets too close to them, erupting volcanoes that force you to move your guys so they don't get killed. Those kind of things.\n+They toned slightly down on pop culture references that their last game was too packed with.\n+More achievements than the previous game, although some of these are a little grindy.\n\n-CONS\n-For a game with so few voicelines, its sad that they use so much from their previous game. \n-Lots of reused sound effects, visuals and sprites.\n-It feels like most of the creativity with enemies and maps was spent in the early levels and then just dropped later.\n-Most enemies are just reskins of eachother without having anything special about them.\n-Besides what I mentioned in the PROS section, they didn't really do anything new with the game.\n-One achievement is to have a templar survive fatal damage 5 times in a row. This is calculated to about a 7% chance. Having a 7% chance to get an achievement is not fun.\n\nWith that out of the way, I want to add that this is a FREE mobile game. I think in the mobile version you have to use gems to buy new heroes, and these gems can be earned or bought for money. While in the steam version, you get all heroes for free when you clear maps. I was perfectly fine with this when I played the first game, cause everything was new and exciting. But now that they have recycled so many designs, sounds, visuals and voicelines while at the same time hardly did anything to change up the game, I can't really say it's worth the money.\nI bought it on a 50% sale and even that feels like too much.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I liked the original game and I like this game aswell. It's a good tower defense with cartoony looks and addictive gameplay. I just wish it was evolved a bit further.", "timestamp_created": 1514328969, "timestamp_updated": 1514328969, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.588629",

It seems that Ironhide Studios are free of the curse of the sequels, as they have managed to recreate and improve upon the magic of the first game in this amazing Tower Defense followup. It has a main campaign, two mini-campaigns after you beat the main one and a singular expert-level with its own boss. It has better balancing, more imaginative towers, bosses and enemies, as well as a more interesting story. Also, just like the original, once you've completed each level up to three stars, you unlock the Iron and Heroic challenges to test your skills against elite waves, or one mega wave in the case of Iron.

So many choices. So many play styles. I love the hero units and talent trees. Each tower can be eventually upgraded into 2 different towers independantly and not tied to talents as well and even has their own abilities beyond that.

I love tower defense games in general but if i have to list my top 3 this one would be my 2nd spot.\n\nThis game has 4 different towers, ok, not much. Each tower then has 3 upgrades and 2 specialist forms with special ability upgrade, now we're talking. Each tower has creative specialist forms like for an archer there's an axe thrower, or a necromancer for one of the mage's form. Each tower has its uses, though more so then others( [strike] archer > bomb in every way possible [/strike] ).\n\nThe strategy is VERY in depth. Choose a tower on any location you want and upgrade it however you want though sometimes you won't win. All the star upgrades choices and hero choices can win, though your strategy will have to change depending on them.\n\nI like that all levels are possible if you got good strats and I like that sometimes there are difficulty spikes to keep you in check.\n\nAll in all if you like TDs then check this game out, and if you've never tried one i suggest this game as a start to see if you like it.", "timestamp_created": 1509335929, "timestamp_updated": 1509335929, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36127373": {"recommendationid": "36127373", "author": {"steamid": "76561198336220242", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 224, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493249903}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Jogo que fez parte da minha inf\u00e2ncia.

Don't worry!  It's good too!\n\nThis sequel is \"more of the same\", in a positive way.  Some new tower types, enemy abilities, and map designs will have you thinking in new ways.  For example, Necromancer towers let you raise your foes as undead to act as temporary blockers, and enemy spellcasters can shield their soldiers from damage, requiring focused fire or an antimagic totem to nullify them.  These new wrinkles keep the old formula fresh.\n\nThere are more Heroes to work with this time around, and \"levelling up\" is now permanent, instead of only lasting for a single map.  Some like this change, some don't.  I do; it gave me a little bit of extra leverage when retrying a tough map with a slightly stronger Hero than before, but it never led to steamrolling.  Some players will choose one or two favorite Heroes and stick with them; I rotated through the whole roster, and by the time I finished the last map on Iron difficulty, everyone was at maximum level.  Satisfying.\n\nThe original game was very punishing on the final expansion levels; [i]Frontiers[/i] eases off a bit.  It's still hard at the end, but never seems to require \"one true configuration\" of towers as its predecessor did.  The previous game was a bit more hard core than I liked - once I was able to 1-star the last level on normal difficulty, I called it good.  Here, I was ultimately able to max score every level on every difficulty, and enjoyed myself the entire time.\n\nBottom line, this is another outstanding entry in the tower defense genre.

If you are itching for a casual and dynamic tower defense game look no further. This comic-esque game is similar to the predecessor with quirky dialogue and paid its tribute to some of the biggest games and movies titles in history such as Mortal Kombat, Indiana Jones and etc is guarantee to bring back some memories.\n\nThe gameplay and towers upgrade structure is the same as the previous title but a whole new tower specialty upgrade. There are no single way to win a level. DIfficulty is scalable and does not affect yours unlockables or stars earned. There are also no pesky leveling or tower upgrading outside level.\n\nHeroes, however now has persistent level meaning experience and levels gained are permanent. Heroes are free to choose from once they are unlocked (by progressing in game). Levels can be challenging but also rather forgiving. There are many enemies type and the levels are spanned across several theme each with its own traits and strategy. \n\nThe length of the game is simply enough to keep things interesting without getting too grindy or repetitive. For achievements chasers, don;t be put off by the long list. Once you've completed the game entirely, surely most of them have been unlocked so put no mind to them when playing. Game is balanced and levels can be short enough to pick up a game or 2 casually if you won't want to sink too many hours at one go.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1508228081, "timestamp_updated": 1508228081, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.659553", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35776937": {"recommendationid": "35776937", "author": {"steamid": "76561198354086182", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509992953}, "language": "english", "review": "YOUR GAME STINK`S stage 6 is unplayable", "timestamp_created": 1508174124, "timestamp_updated": 1508174124, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.191048", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35761928": {"recommendationid": "35761928", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000767443", "num_games_owned": 527, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2947, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512519915}, "language": "english", "review": "great port but uhhhhhhhhhhhhh where's the store? like seriously you charge $10 for this game but instead of adding to it you strip it? sad :/", "timestamp_created": 1508114901, "timestamp_updated": 1508115003, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.339434", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35702992": {"recommendationid": "35702992", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073991929", "num_games_owned": 316, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1498, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509533010}, "language": "german", "review": "Die Kingdom Rush Serie geh\u00f6rt zu den besten Tower defense Spielen \u00fcberhaupt. \nKleiner Tipp: Auf die massig vielen Easter Eggs auf den Karten achten.", "timestamp_created": 1507934912, "timestamp_updated": 1507934912, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35702369": {"recommendationid": "35702369", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022700041", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1543, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507622238}, "language": "english", "review": "Solid TD, though too easy compared to the 1st game.", "timestamp_created": 1507932559, "timestamp_updated": 1507932559, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35699569": {"recommendationid": "35699569", "author": {"steamid": "76561198283195244", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 50, "last_played": 1513479573}, "language": "english", "review": "I enjoyed this.

There are about 16 heroes that you can unlock as you progress through the game, and they are all varied and interesting. Some heroes can fly, for instance, while others can burrow underground or teleport. Some heroes can buff towers, while others do massive area damage when they die.

For those who would like a breakdown of the gameplay, you can read my [url=store.steampowered.com/recommended/recommendgame/246420] review[/url] for the first game as gameplay is nearly identical. The biggest change made is that the heroes - of which there are 16 - don't start as level 1 at the start of each mission, but now accumulate XP between missions. The level cap is still 10.\n\nThis is a great tower defense game with beautiful art, responsive controls and level design that provides a challenge for most.

The game is quite long, and has some good replayability, making it the perfect time waster\n2. As this is the steam version, you can get all the heroes completley free instead of paying for most of them on the IOS/Flash versions\n3. This game and the original Kingdom Rush have the same price, 10$, and they occasinally go on sale from time to time, so if you see a sale, dont miss dat chance.\n4. The amount of enemies this game has is quite impressive, almost every stage has a new enemy appearing atleast somewhere, some more rare then others, and, although it has less bosses then the original Kingdom Rush, they are still a challenge to fight and will keep you on your toes.\nSo, theres the good things, but there is one flaw in this game that may not be that big of a issue to some, but it kinda is to me\nThe difficulty is quite hard, even on Casual mode, but atleast its not as hard as Normal or Veteran mode, those are almost impossible to do without lossing a hefty amount of lives.\nBut, overall, i recommend this game to anyone looking for a great tower defense game, this is truley the best you can get.", "timestamp_created": 1504402206, "timestamp_updated": 1504402206,

The towers are all new (at least the advanced onces), fun to use and also seem better thought out. The overpowered lightning tower is gone, but there is even crazier stuff available now. Where the tower design in the first game was somewhat cautious, standard fare for TD games, here the developers let loose their imaginations and it works out. I also appreciate that many towers now have animations showing which upgrades were purchased. \n\nThere is a wide array of heroes to choose from and this time progress (leveling) is persistent! There are more map-related elements now like unique towers, heroes that appear only for one map, environmental hazards and so on. Another nice touch is that you don't need perfect performance to get 3-star ratings - it's possible to let a few enemies past and still get the top grade. Once again though, you run out of upgrades to purchase halfway through the game and then you're just collecting stars for no real reason.

Everything I wrote about the original (down below) applies here, but with new levels, heros and units to provide additional challenge.  More of a good thing in this game. \n\nOriginal Kingdom Rush Review\n\nProbably the best Tower Defence game I have played.  Don't let my steam hours fool you, I have a whole lot more on my tablet, where I originally played this.  Very addictive gameplay.  \n\nEach level have a set amount of points you can build towers on and you can choose to build one of 4 towers.  The basic towers are  \n\nBarracks provide troops that do damage but also engage mobs, preventing them from advancing down the late. \nArcher Towers provides ranged dps, high rof but low damage, good for weak swarm mobs and magick resistant mobs. \nWizard tower provides ranged dps, low rof but high damage, good for armored enemies and slow enemies. \nArtillery towers fire explosive rounds that do aoe splash damage, great for swarm mobs.  \n\nNow each of these towers can be upgraded multiple times and each have two unique upgrade paths.  Once fully upgrades they will have 3 additional bonus you can purchase with 3 levels each.  They have this for each unique upgrade path provide plenty of variety in your tactics.  \n\nIn addition to your towers you have a hero that you can upgrade throughout the game (all heros are available on PC verssion).  Heros are powerful units that can help hold the line against the unrelenting tide.  You also have troops (seperate from baracks) you can spawn at any location on the map.  These can be ugpraded throughout the game as well.    They are great to deploy to help hold the line or as a last ditch effort to stop a mob from hitting your base. \n\nEach level has 3 version.  You have the standard campaign level, then you have two more difficult versions.  These prevent you from using certain skills or towers and are tough but a great challenge and give good XP rewards which you can use to upgrade your towers (these ugprades are passive abilities).  \n\nThe two main differences I remember from PC version and Tablet version is you cannot purchase buffs on PC version and all heros are unlocked.  On tablet most heros need to be purchased with real money. \n\nHighly Recommended.", "timestamp_created": 1502211351, "timestamp_updated": 1502211351, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34095232": {"recommendationid": "34095232", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998115486", "num_games_owned": 370, "num_reviews": 78, "playtime_forever": 847, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480121478}, "language": "english", "review": "If you beat the original, and wanted more boards to play, well, here they are.", "timestamp_created": 1502165377, "timestamp_updated": 1502165377, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34080527": {"recommendationid": "34080527", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003728963", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2733, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502183042}, "language": "english", "review": "I never played  the original but this game is good enough that I plan to go back and finish that too.

Hope they release Kingdom Rush Origins here on Steam as well.\n\n[PT/BR]\nKingdom Rush est\u00e1 de volta e melhor. Gr\u00e1ficos em HD impressionantes rodando a 60 FPS. Tipos \u00fanicos de torres e novos her\u00f3is para jogar. O jogo \u00e9 simplesmente incr\u00edvel. Ele tem miss\u00f5es secund\u00e1rias al\u00e9m das 14 miss\u00f5es principais e tamb\u00e9m tem eventos \u00fanicos na maioria das miss\u00f5es. Pessoalmente, eu achei o jogo um pouco mais f\u00e1cil do que o Kingdom Rush original mas isso n\u00e3o tira a divers\u00e3o. Jogo excelente. Espero que eles liberem Kingdom Rush Origins aqui na Steam tamb\u00e9m.", "timestamp_created": 1502047123, "timestamp_updated": 1502047123, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0,

This game is possibly easier than Kingdom Rush as less of a specific mix is needed. Towers often have special variants that make them eventually viable for almost any enemy. This is the trade-off so you can play the way you want. Three expansion unlock after finishing the main campaign, each adds new units to make the gameplay fresh and a bit more difficult. You have a lot of heroes to choose from but apart from maybe the expansions there is no real reason to level them up. You can just pick the one you like and get him to maximum level and just keep using him/her. Though I have to say not all of them are usable in the later levels, especially the expansions. I had an occasional game freeze (FPS drop) when a tower is built or hero revives but it happened only on some levels and not always. During the campaign most of the stages have a special event (sand worm, ship cannons, etc.) that makes the gameplay more dynamic as you have to adjust to event while fighting enemies. Overall a really great sequel and definitely a game to check out if you are into tower defense games!\n\n[b]P.S.:[/b] Great Defender, Heroic Defender & Iron Defender probably only unlock in Normal or Hard difficulty (this was the case in the first game), but you only need to finish the first 15 levels to unlock them\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n[b]If you liked this review you can find more on the [/b][url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28638055-Subjective-Reviews-Corner/][u]Curator page[/u][/url][b] or in my [/b][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/srcorner][u]Review Corner[/u][/url][b].[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1500132543, "timestamp_updated": 1500132593, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.665676", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33555975": {"recommendationid": "33555975", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986382604", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2906, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502227062}, "language": "english", "review": "A Great tower defence game!\n\nThere are noticible improvements on Kingdom Rush with more balanced gameplay and transferable Hero Upgrades from one level to another.\n\nI would have perfered all heros to start at level one when unlocked but I can understand this would not appeal to all and could end up as a grind.\n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1500113672, "timestamp_updated": 1500113672, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33552852": {"recommendationid": "33552852", "author": {"steamid": "76561198370305743", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3950, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499588317}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "VERY GOOD", "timestamp_created": 1500101123, "timestamp_updated": 1500101123, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497703", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33545772": {"recommendationid": "33545772", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118823406", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1031, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513299917}, "language": "english", "review": "I like the game, I have it on all of my mobile devices.

Kingdom Rush, the Great and Magnificent, had a sequel, and that's good news. Or is it?\n\nPros:\n+ Kingdom Rush is a hell of a Tower Defense. This sequel is no different.\n+ Graphics, little details, Easter Eggs: the charm of the first Kingdom Rush has not lost any magic in this new Frontiers Lands.\n+ A very good diversity of enemies with some new interesting mechanics (temporary stealth, teleportation...)\n+ Eight new four-tier specialized towers.\n+ Some missions offer still more towers (Frankenstein tower, Dwarf bastion...).\n+ A very decent amount of content.\n+ Much better mechanics for leveling up heroes.\n\nCons:\n- This is not a sequel; more like a stand-alone expansion. \n- Same two magic powers as the original Kingdom Rush.\n- Many new enemies are just reskins from the first episode.\n- Some foes are very trick to beat (Sniper lizards, Mage tortoise)\n- One tower specialty seems to be useful (to the point of being mandatory) only in one arc of the main campaign. \n- Many issues of the first episode have not been addressed (no fast-forward option, half of the stars just pile up with no use)\n\nVerdict: Is it worthwhile? Of course it is! Aren't we speaking of Kingdom Rush? Have the developers been lazy? Wouldn't say so: the content is still of top-notch quality and the game mechanics worked so well anyway that it would have been pointless to change them. \n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1496841299, "timestamp_updated": 1496841299, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 144, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.920608", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32230636": {"recommendationid": "32230636", "author": {"steamid": "76561198263594559", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 1610, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496765847}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Kingdom Rush Frontiers...

original Kingdom Rush and want more!\n\nVery much what you want from sequel... everything that made the original game great, but with enough new content to keep it fresh and exciting. A completely new set of new enemies, new heroes and 22 new levels... more than you can shake an oversized Dwarven bombard at (or at least enough to shut you up for a good 20-30 hours).\n\nThe Tier 4 towers have also undergone an overhaul, providing a new set of tactics and toys to play with; from assassins, to battle mechs... and, most deliciously, a freaking [i]Necromancer Tower[/i]. Finally... Now [i]you're[/i] the one who gets to summon armies of the undead! The new towers feel well-balanced and have a diverse range of special abilities that seem to promote a much stronger focus on synergy than before, at least from my experience (though the Necromancer can feel a little overpowered on lower difficulties).\n\nThe only major change (which is hard to say if better/worse) is that the heroes now retain their exp between levels. Where, previously, they'd go from 1-10 in a single level - you now level them up throughout the game, adding earned points into to cool abilities and passive upgrades. Whilst it adds a nice RPG element to your favourite heroes... it can equally add a grind factor if you wish to play with the full range on offer, as you'll need to level them up individually. And obviously, if you wish to try any new heroes, you'll need to level [i]them[/i] up to the same as your current ones to be able to provide a meaningful comparison. So swings and roundabouts really... But the hero you use is more for your own fun, so it's not like you're hindered from finishing the game if you only wanted to stick with a handful or even just the one - in which case this isn't a problem at all.\n\nOther than that: Same loving attention, same cracking array of challenges and same humour...

Ent\u00e3o, deixarei algumas cr\u00edticas construtivas e sugest\u00f5es:\n\n- Gente, precisamos falar sobre revis\u00e3o de texto e tradu\u00e7\u00e3o. S\u00e9rio. Eu consigo achar erro em tudo que eu vejo, at\u00e9 quando n\u00e3o procuro (at\u00e9 no f ucking jog\u00e3o do(s) ano(s) The Witcher 3 j\u00e1 achei). S\u00e3o erros tipogr\u00e1ficos ou tradu\u00e7\u00e3o err\u00f4nea. Ningu\u00e9m t\u00e1 fazendo de gra\u00e7a, n\u00e9, ent\u00e3o n\u00e3o custa fazer direito. E, apesar dos nomes originais n\u00e3o ajudarem, a tradu\u00e7\u00e3o pt-br t\u00e1 muito ao p\u00e9 da letra e em alguns casos, nada a ver. E olha que eu joguei em espanhol e xeretei em franc\u00eas, e vi que adaptaram os nomes dos inimigos, em alguns casos.\n\nExemplos:\nsand wraith (en) = desespectro (pt-br) = momia de las arenas (es)\nbroodguard (en) = guardaninho (what...pt-br) = guardian (es)\nblazefang (en) = dentechamas (pt-br) = devastador (es)\n\n\"invoking his godly fury all enemies receives 65% extra damage for 5 seconds\" (en) = \"invocando sua f\u00faria divina todos os inimigos causam 65% mais dano por 5s.\" (*sigh*...pt-br)\n\nPode parecer uma coisa banal, mas tem gente recebendo para fazer essas coisas\n\n- IA dos nossos soldados. Eu juro que teve partidas que perdia estrela porque os inimigos passavam literalmente do lado desses animais, trocavam bom dia, e eles n\u00e3o atacavam. N\u00e3o tinha como dizer que n\u00e3o estava no alcance, haha.\n===============================================\n- Achievements:\n\nAcho que seria bacana se houvesse algum indicador do quanto estamos pr\u00f3ximos de se obter algum achievement. Por exemplo, roubar 10000 de ouro com os assassinos ou matar 100 com os templ\u00e1rios. Eu n\u00e3o fa\u00e7o ideia de quantas partidas terei que jogar pra pegar isso. Derrotar 500 com os mechas eu consegui em 2 ou 3! zzz\n\nOs achievements do Iron e Heroic s\u00f3 valem para fases da campanha. Fases b\u00f4nus n\u00e3o importam.

The 2d visuals are very well drawn and so beautiful.\nThere are more heroes to choose from, different new towers, abilities and new enemies. What piques my interest with this one is how funny the characters are and how they used references from other games to Indiana Jones and the Predator just to name a few. Everything has been made so well and the gameplay is so fluid. The game has achievements based on many other game references hidden pretty well in a level for example \"Finding Reptile from Mortal Kombat\". This makes me so curious as to what is hidden and got me searching thoroughly throughout a whole single level (and there are tons of levels). The boss fights are also very engaging especially when you're low on money and defenses and your Hero dies. \nOverall a full 10/10 and hats off to \"Ironhide Studios\" for this very well polished game.

If you are looking for a tower defense game to play, I would recommend Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten instead, because it does much of what Kingdom Rush Frontiers tries to do, but better.\n\nParticularly glaring in Kingdom Rush Frontiers is the lack of a fast-forward button, which has become standard in the genre for a reason.  The game has little downtime, but levels can take 15 minutes or more to complete, so replaying them for a better score at 1x speed can be annoying.\n\nThe four tower types are unique, but I thought some of the tower specializations were underpowered.  The numerous heroes have a good variety both thematically and gameplay-wise, and were enjoyable to discover.  It would have been nice to be able to more actively control them, because you are given only two spells to affect the battle with in real time.\n\nKingdom Rush Frontiers has fewer but longer levels than most other tower defense games I've played, but the enemy and map variety keeps things interesting enough.  One highlight was the iron challenges, which disable certain tower types to provide a short but focused challenge.\n\nFor the most part, the tooltips are of acceptable quality, though sometimes they refer to having \"a chance\" of an effect rather than giving numbers.  The metagame is pretty barebones; it mostly consists of upgrading your towers along a linear path.\n\nThe story is essentially nonexistent, which I have no problem with.  Don't expect any real characterization or plot developments.\n\nKingdom Rush Frontiers held my interest, but unfortunately, I see no reason to recommend it over Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten.  I enjoy standard tower defense games, but the sad truth is that if you fail to innovate, you run the risk of someone else making the same game, but better.", "timestamp_created": 1491259168,

I passed this a long time ago. \n\nFrontiers is the second game in the Kingdom Rush series.  Actually, when i first time started the game i was pretty dissapointed.  I liked the original KR, but i expected to see something totally new in the second game. For example, new skills, new game modes, etc.. Yeah, Frontiers offers to player new towers, new enemies and new heroes. Also, you have got new map terrains and a new story with comics.. Actually, there are no innovative ideas. Everything is the same. But it is on a proper level. It's like a second season of awesome season one.\n\nI realised that i have got negative feelings because my inflated expectations. After i played some hours i chenged my opinion to extremely posititve. I liked this game. I liked to feel the same feelings which i felt playing the first KR. I am sure now, devs did a right choice keeping\n\nFrontiers is the most easiest game in KR series. I passed all stages on Veteran for 3 stars without any problems. For example, i still have some unpassed levels in KR and Origins. Anyway, i would advice to play original Kingdom Rush before starting Frontiers.\n\nThere is nothing really to say about gameplay. If you played KR, you find Frontiers the same game with new towers, enemies and maps. If you didn't, i can say that KR is the best TD game now (I don't consider WC3 maps as a game).\n\nThere is no secret that it is a mobile port. But it's really qualitative port. No bugs were found. The game looks good on Full screen. Anyway, i recommend to buy this game on mobile. Not because of the fact that the game is a half cheaper on mobiles, but because it is really awesome what you can play such a great game when you have some free minutes (in a public transport, in a queue, etc).\n\nI recommend this game to play in any platform you prefer.", "timestamp_created": 1491133198, "timestamp_updated": 1491392723, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 40, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.778416", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30899125": {"recommendationid": "30899125", "author": {"steamid": "76561198240174760", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1221, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491483100}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u7ed9\u6211\u7559\u4e0b\u4e86\u592a\u591a\u7f8e\u597d\u7684\u7ae5\u5e74\u56de\u5fc6\uff0c\u6b20\u5b83\u4e00\u4e2a\u6b63\u7248\uff0c\u4e0a\u8f66\u8865\u7968\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1491133022, "timestamp_updated": 1491133022, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507168", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30899056": {"recommendationid": "30899056", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154575497", "num_games_owned": 224, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 608, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491738957}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u597d\u8bc4\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u7684\u4e0d\u8bf4\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u6027\u5c31\u6446\u5728\u8fd9\u91cc\u4e86\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u8bf4\u4e0b\u6c49\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u6e38\u620f\u6ca1\u6709\u5199\u6709 \u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587\uff0c\u53ea\u5199\u4e86 \u7e41\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u5176\u5b9e\u6e38\u620f\u91cc\u7684\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u8fd8\u662f\u662f\u7b80\u4f53\u7684\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u5f88\u5c11\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u662f\u7e41\u4f53\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u53c8\u597d\u73a9\u6709\u6709\u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587\u3002\u8fd8\u7b49\u4ec0\u4e48\u5462\uff1f\u4e0d\u559c\u52a0\u4e00\u5417\uff1f \u6ed1\u7a3d", "timestamp_created": 1491132812, "timestamp_updated": 1491132812, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30896360": {"recommendationid": "30896360", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039831042", "num_games_owned": 258, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 3958, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488704323}, "language": "english", "review": "The most addictive tower defense game I've ever played.

were like 7 years old?\nDo you want to play a tower defense game that is accually well made with tonnes of content?\nDo you like fighting bandits, lizardmen, and zombies with arrows, swords, magic tornados and bombs?\nDo you just need something to do for a few hours?\n\nIf you said yes to any of these then buy this game, and even if you didn't say yes buy it anyways!\n\nKingdom Rush Frontiers and the original are awesome games full of epic tower defense action that isn't just \"buy a ton of towers = win\"\n\nAnd before your like \"hey reviewer dude isn't the flash free\" and I say \"yes, but this version is better with post campain content, more heroes and FULL SCREEN and all kinds of other stuff.\" so don't be an idiot and miss out on the full version of Kingdom Rush Frontiers and the original just because its free on flash.\n\nPros:\n-Epic battles\n-Easy for a noob yet hard enough for a veteran tower defense player\n-Combat that requires you to think which tower will work in each location instead of just buy the tower with the best damage\n-Great artstyle\n-Heroes now keep their levels\n-Little things to do with the map while your towers kick the enemy's behind.\n-Funny

Frontiers is the first game, again, just with more creative level design. If you're like me, though, that's exactly what you want. If you've finished KR Classic, and you feel like you could use another 21 levels of it, then this game has what you're looking for. \n\nThere are eight new towers, but they replace the eight original towers, so although they're fun to unlock and use, you don't have more towers overall. There are new enemies, but half of them are just reskins of the classics, so only the latter zones really feel noticeably different. Apparently there's also a small improvement to graphics, but I didn't notice.\n\nThe only obvious difference, to me, was the introduction of the leveling mechanic for your heroes. This time, they start off at a lower level, and you have to grind them up to lvl 10, and choose which powers to upgrade along the way. Since they all end up the same at lvl 10, however, your individual choices don't really matter in the long run; just grind your favorites to 10, so you can use them on the hard stages. \n\nLike I said, though... I didn't want anything different, and I don't suspect that you do either. I loved the last game, I wanted more of it, and that is exactly what KR Frontiers delivered.

So if you dont know..., there are 4 types of towers, barracks, artillary, archer, and mage. barracks spawn soldiers to fight, archers shoot low damage, but fast attacks. Artillary fires powerfull aoe attacks but slowley and mages use powerfull magic attacks. Each tower you will upgrade 3 times and then get a choice of 2 finale upgrades. Each finale upgrade does a different thing depending on your play styke.\n\nEnemies:\nThere is a huge varaity of enemies in this game. Each collection of levels has a setting and the enemies fit the setting well. For example, the desert stage consists of bandits and scorpions. The only thing is that each stage has basicly a re-skinned version of the troll from the first game and the orc from the first game. But other then that you encounter new and unique enemies that you must adapt to defeat. \n\nStages:\nI metioned this a bit above, but there are a variaty of stages that you will fight through. You start in the desert, were you fight off worms from tremmers and bandits, go to the jungle and battle with the cannabalistic tribes, and finish the campiagn in the dark depths carvens and defeat the lizardmen. Once this is done, you unlock the halloween levels and the beach levels, and maybe a mushroom level(that might be in the first game I forget). Each stage has new enemies, sometimes towers, new terrian, and twists. \n\nStratagy:\nYour stragagy in this game is important! Why, becuase its a stratagy game. And each tower will play into it. I said above that each tower is different and brings new attacks and ways to bring your enemies to there knees. For example, the necrmancer can summon the souls of enemies you have defeated and have them fight for you. While the ax throwers can make enemies take more damage and remove magic ressistince.\n\nOther\n\nThe screenshots:\nI just want to say that the guy whose screenshots are getting overrun of a few of them.\n\nThe Haloween Levels\nThere back, there fun, not much else to say.\n\nCons\n\nLess extra levels then the first game:\nI love the extra levels from the first game, I think it was the most fun part, and there were like 10 new stages with like a total of 15-16 levels. This game I think has 3 new stages and 8 new levels, something like that. I would like to see the orcs and the trolls in frontiers. Also, for those who are completely lost becuase they dont have the first game, the extra levles, or bonas levels, were levels unlocked once the story was completed. They were extra hard and introduced new enemies and almost all ended in a boss fight. I wanted more once I beat the game.\n\nOnly new towers and heros:\nWouldn't it be cool too see the musket men supporting a mech? or Thor doing battle with savages? Nope, instead of also having the old towers and heros along with the new ones, we just get to new ones. F*cking sucks. Dont get me wrong, I like Necromancer more then archain wizerd and assassin more then templar knights, but, cant we have both?\n\n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1485035312, "timestamp_updated": 1485035312, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581749", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29400920": {"recommendationid": "29400920", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012918637", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 498, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485351202}, "language": "english", "review": "game is good but i cant get past level 2 help", "timestamp_created": 1485014362, "timestamp_updated": 1485014362, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506903", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29396746": {"recommendationid": "29396746", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131921317", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4365, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496858965}, "language": "english", "review": "One word \"EPIC\"", "timestamp_created": 1485002312, "timestamp_updated": 1485002312, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29390870": {"recommendationid": "29390870", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995734721", "num_games_owned": 520, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 919, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476603521}, "language": "english", "review": "The single best tower defense game there is.

Because of that, the strategies that worked before may not work as well for this game, so while the whole product feels familiar and unchanged, it's fresh and surprising at the same time. For example, in the original Kingdom Rush, you could usually get away with staring out a location with all the towers bought to the first level, but in Frontiers, you're better off focusing on one or two towers and upgrading them in the beginning due to the tougher enemies. \n\n\nThe heroes are new as well, but only a handful of them are any good. Each one again changes your strategy for a level slightly due to their strengths and weaknesses. They won't win the war for you but some of them could bail you out of some problems if you play your cards right.\n\nGreat game, over 120 hours on this one and the first one, and that's not including the the Flash versions.

It was released in July 2016. Frontiers features a campaign with various storylines in which you progress throughout the game upon successful completion of each level. This review will cover the campaign and the gameplay.\n\n[h1] [b] Campaign [/b] [/h1]\nFrontiers features a very fun campaign. There are several stories within the game that incorporate different enemy characters. For instance, the forest allows you to play levels against the cannibal tribe. A second example is near the ocean of you defending against enemy pirates or sea creatures. Frontiers features two extra game modes alongside the campaign, heroic and iron. To play both modes, you must play a level in the campaign mode and earn three out of three stars. These modes add replayability and difficulty to the game because Heroic adds some challenges to a level and Iron bans certain towers within the level, adding an extra layer of strategy. And, the game features 20 different level that amount to 105 upgrade points. I thoroughly enjoyed the campaign. \n\nThere are various settings in the game, allowing for levels to be in different climates such as the jungle, ocean, mountains. Frontiers shines in the strategic element that you cannot use the same strategy of tower placement each level due to the various types of enemies, but you can create a basic guideline of what works best against an enemy. Ironhide flourishes in creating beautifully designed diverse levels that are not repetitive, are simple, and emphasise strategy. I completed the campaign in 20 hours on normal difficulty, but I only earned 46 out of 105 stars. I found my play through to be enjoyable and not boring because I played the game more in a casual setting and that allowed me to enjoy it instead of quickly playing through it in one day. Back to the point, I believe there is enough content for forty hours of gameplay.\n\n[h1] [b] Gameplay [/b] [/h1]\nFrontiers incorporates various heroes that are diverse in character and have different abilities. You use these heroes when you play the levels and they gain experience, which levels their character up to level ten. I really like the heroes because it adds a simple and fun mechanic to the game, particularly the diversity in heroes and their strengths and weaknesses against enemy heroes. Furthermore, the heroes complement the four different ally towers in the game, artillery, archery, mage, and barracks. The different towers obviously have different strengths, weaknesses, and have upgrade paths that are liberal in levelling up according to your enemies in the level. For example, if you face heavy armoured enemies and fast-moving wolves, it would be best to upgrade your level three Wizard Tower into a level four Necromancer tower over the level four Archmage tower because the earlier has high damage but also spawns skeletons when you defeat enemies, contrast to the Archmage tower that has extreme damage but very minimal map control compared to the Necromancer tower. I like the variety of towers and upgrades though because the player needs to be strategic about their enemies within a level because not every tower or upgrade is suitable for every condition.\n\nThe game also has some neat voice acting that I think accurately portrays the type of personalities of each character, ally unit or enemy unit. I found there to be a hint of humour within some characters dialogue lines and I think the overall tone of the characters, their dialogues, and voice acting fits the casual tone of the game. Furthermore, to further capture the casual nature of the game is the artwork that mixes comic-book graphic elements, which I think adds to the overall gameplay and storyline experience.\n\n[h1] [b] Conclusion [/b] [/h1]\nI highly recommend Frontiers. I played the original Kingdom Rush in Flash on the Internet and I believe it has evolved since then without heavily altering the core mechanics of it. In saying that, I thoroughly enjoyed playing Frontiers and I found barely anything of fault with it if I am honest, I knew what to expect with this game. I particularly highlight the map design and the stories as a core component out of the game because that is what adds the uniqueness and continuous freshness to the game without staleness. Therefore, I highly recommend Kingdom Rush: Frontiers at the full price of USD$9.99.\n\n[h1] [b] Rating [/b] [/h1]\n10/10\n\n[h1] [b] Pros [/b] [/h1]\n\t- Map design.\n\t- Various storylines within the game that take you on a journey through different settings.\n\t- Diversity in ally and enemy characters and their character traits.\n\t- Frontiers strategic element that alters every level.\n\n[h1] [b] Cons [/b] [/h1]\n\t- If I had to nit-pick, I would have liked some more towers.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

There are new heroes, but the purpose of having a hero on the field is the same.

It does have bumps on the road however and can be incredibly frustrating, especially with the introduction of the Sand Wraith, an upgraded version of the enemy spawn unit from the first one.\n\nThe pro's of this game have been listed by many people, maps are enjoyable, able to find and click things for a bit of amusement, and towers are a ton of fun to figure out which works and doesn't. Feels like the old one but with updated and new versions that feel at home in this game. Which is weird to see someone list that as a con but honestly a Paladin guild would not fit in a desert setting as opposed to a assassins guild they have in this one. \n\nThe main cons of this game that I feel are the hero's, introducing a very grind system into the game that should not be a part of it especially since you can only use  your hero's on the 'campaign' parts of these maps, they're taken away during heroic and Iron situations. The hero's themselves are enjoyable and appear to all be unique and fun but very weak as well to the Desert Archer swarms which can be a bit difficult to handle if somone is new due to how fast they can rip the hero apart. The other part would be the Sand Wraith. The first game had a Necromancer which did a similiar thing of spawning 4 skeletons peroidically while having a ranged attack but easy to handle due to how far into the game they're introduce, giving the player a chance to be able to handle them. The hero's as well were capable of beating on them due to progressing in levels during the campaign, not a grind mechanic this one has. They work with spawning a coffin at a random location, ahead of them, in the samel lane they are (so yes they can spawn past your militia barracks). This is a huge problem as they'll also spawn more than just 4 mummies so easily able to get swarmed and suddenly over burdened. This wouldn't be an issue if they were somewhat squishy but they have half as much health as an Executioner who's supposed to be the Ogre (except he has one hit kills majority of the time) with 1400 health. The Sand Wraith's stats are HP: 700 DPS: 30-60 ranged AR/MR: none MS: Slow and thankfully only take 1 hp away. The bad part though with its slow MS it spawns more than enough tombs to release a swarm of mummies and towers will focus the mummies over the Sand wraith which you have zero control over. They'll also kill your militia quickly if you try and move them to handle it. Early on Hero's will not be able to handle it or help as well. I did the mistake of not leveling up my reinforcements and meteors apperantly as that's the only way I find to slow them down and when the wraiths are distracted with melee attacks they'll still spawn mummies. This is something of a huge turn off for me as i've actually RQ now due being so quickly being overwhelmed by 3 wraiths who spawned in close succession (without rushing the next wave in). \n\nOutside of those two things this game is once again incredibly enjoyable and a very welcoming feel to the TD genre. It can be frustrating, especially with tower placements at times, but that's the challenging part of it as well. Finding the best ways to maximize your Militia and defense towers range/damage. No tower is better than the other as each one is required to beat a map, the hero's are a welcoming part (in my mind) to the TD genre. The upgrades can feel a bit forceful in what you have to get first in this one however but make the game give a reason to actually get more stars and do better.  I still recommend the game, even though the Sand Wraiths are a huge turn off as well as the grinding feature in a TD game.", "timestamp_created": 1479709210, "timestamp_updated": 1479709210,

Lots of references to popculture, like the previous one.\n\nnot to say that there aren't some cons:\nlike the first game, you accumulate a ton of stars that just sit there and nothing can be done with them.\nno way to make or dl user-made maps.\nnew hero system isn't necessarily an improvement over the old. while experimentation is still somewhat possible, the repetition to get later-stage heroes leveled up is a disincentive and most players probably won't bother.\nthere could have been more challenges or more varied challenges instead of just the 6 wave / 1 wave. (user generated maps could probably addressed this in a creative way)\n\nTo reiterate, KR:F is a great TD game, but because the KR series was initially conceived just for the smart phone and flash game markets it lacks some of the features that would make it an even better series for the PC market.\n\n\"Stay Frosty!\"", "timestamp_created": 1478806254, "timestamp_updated": 1478806344, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26514162": {"recommendationid": "26514162", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991033565", "num_games_owned": 364, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 774, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483949223}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ud53c\uc2dc\ubc84\uc804\uc740 \uc601\uc6c5\uc774 \ubb34\ub8cc\ub77c\ub2a5~~\ube68\ub9ac \uc624\ub9ac\uc9c4\ub3c4 \ub098\uc654\uc73c\uba74 \uc88b\uaca0\ub2e4", "timestamp_created": 1478758798, "timestamp_updated": 1478758798, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506173", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26501864": {"recommendationid": "26501864", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031676160", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3871, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511196170}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Kingdom Rush \u00e9 muito divertido!!", "timestamp_created": 1478691510, "timestamp_updated": 1478691510, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502825", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26500244": {"recommendationid": "26500244", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027404648", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2139, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481844047}, "language": "english", "review": "The only thing wrong with this game is that there isn't any endless! :D\n\nI mean seriously.

Results in quite a bit of unnecessary grind to get all the heroes maxed, where - in the end - you will stick to only a select few anyway, due to their specific abilities. Do note that this hinders the overall experience in no way, really, as it is a post-game issue; one can easily finish the game with the starting hero, not having tried the others at all.\n[*] Sudden difficulty spikes in a couple of stages (like 2 or so) that can throw you off.\n[*] No real incentive to play at any difficulty higher than Casual (Normal or Veteran), as there are no achievements related to it.\n[*] Game suffers from the same issue as the first one, being that once you get to doing [b][i]Heroic[/i][/b] and [b][i]Iron[/i][/b] difficulties, you end up with an absurd amount of additional [b][i]Stars[/i][/b] that cannot be used on anything, as the upgrades available in the game only utilize so many of those.\n[*] Some issues with Cloud saving (people mentioning those issuse are in huge minority, though)[/list]\n\nAs you can tell by the score, the cons listed didn't really affect it much and should be treated as \"I wish this was in the game\" complaints of a die-hard fan, more than anything else.", "timestamp_created": 1476322218, "timestamp_updated": 1511777273, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.685993", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1476732673, "developer_response": "Hi Azure,\nThank you so much for the great review!\n\nJust a small comment on the extra stars.

It's perhaps better to see this game as a gigantic expansion to the first, protected from accusations that it should have just been DLC by the first game's colossal amount of extra content existing beyond the main campaign and within the base game and the large number of variations that Frontiers has made to tech tree progression, enemy types, and map interactivity.\n\nWhat it boils down to is simple - if you like tower defense games, buy both of the Kingdom Rush ones.

Ironhide brings you the same great art style, defense mechanics, new and old tower upgrades, a plethora of new enemies, AND to spice things up, we have unique Heroes to command on the battle field.\n\nNow, I've read a couple reviews which put the Hero system in a negative light. Personally, for me I really enjoyed it. Honestly, I played with one hero the whole time. Mirage, which is a clone creating, thief type Hero. Now, let me tell you that each Hero is very unique with their own pros and cons. I gravitated towards Mirage because her abilities matched my playstyle. I also messed around with the Wizard, the Alien dude and the final Dragon that you get. Ultimately, always coming back to Mirage. The Heroes are here for you to test and have fun with, not to be over whelming on the battlefield, which they are not.\n\nKingdom Rush is my favorite Tower Defense game and it's my favorite game to just pick up and play for 20 minutes or so at a time. \n\nWe will also be receiving FREE MONTHLY UPDATES.

Jeder spielt sich anders, bringt n\u00fctzliche F\u00e4higkeiten mit und   kann Maximal Level 10 erreichen, dadurch bekommt er F\u00e4higkeitspunkte, die man auf 5 verschieden Skillb\u00e4ume verteilen kann. Es bieten sich dadurch viele M\u00f6glichkeiten und Strategien, um die einzelnen Level abzuschlie\u00dfen. Zu jedem Level gibt es eine kleine Geschichte, die man nachlesen kann. Wenn man ein neues Gebiet betritt, wird die Story mit einer kleinen Sequenz erz\u00e4hlt. Nach Abschluss eines Level, bekommt man Sterne, diese kann man im Upgrademen\u00fc investieren, um deine T\u00fcrme oder F\u00e4higkeiten zu verbessern. Die T\u00fcrme haben nun mehr verschiedene Spezialisierungen, als im ersten Teil. Die neuen M\u00f6glichkeiten erm\u00f6glichen es dir, deine Strategie zu \u00fcberdenken und einen Weg zufinden, effektiv diese neuen T\u00fcrme zusammen mit neuen Helden zu verwenden, um die Ebenen und Herausforderungen zu schlagen.\n\n[h1] Grafik / Sounds [/h1]\n\nDie gleiche sch\u00f6ne Kunst ist wieder vorhanden, der Kingdom Rush ausmacht. Die Karte ist animiert und jedes noch so kleine Detail ist toll anzusehen. Die Entw\u00fcrfe der neuen T\u00fcrme sind gro\u00df und die Feinde sind einzigartig f\u00fcr Frontiers. Die Musik spiegelt die Atmosph\u00e4re des Spiels und wurde gut integriert.\n\n[h1] Pro [/h1]\n\n+ frische Brise, in einer vertrauten Umgebung\n+ viele Helden und Feinde\n+ guter Wiederspielwert\n+ s\u00fcchtiges Gameplay\n+ interessante Geschichte\n+ neue Upgrade-M\u00f6glichkeiten\n+ keine Mikrotransaktionen\n+ Errungenschaften und Trading Cards\n\n[h1] Kontra [/h1]\n\n- Levels sind leichter, als beim Vorg\u00e4nger\n\n[h1] Fazit [/h1]\n\nKingdom Rush Frontiers ist ein w\u00fcrdiger Nachfolger geworden und haucht der Serie einen frischen Wind ein.

However short it is at the moment, Kingdom Rush Frontiers delivers plenty of the same tower defense brilliance, background details, and pop culture references that made the original such a favorite in the genre - which is more than enough to justify its modest price tag.", "timestamp_created": 1471231367, "timestamp_updated": 1471231367, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508169", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24925453": {"recommendationid": "24925453", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106581040", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1642, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492009149}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e00\u5468\u76ee\u7b80\u5355\u6a21\u5f0f\u901a\u5173\uff0c\u8c8c\u4f3c\u6bd4\u624b\u673a\u4e0a\u8fd8\u96be\u4e00\u70b9\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u753b\u8d28\u5347\u7ea7\u6bd4\u4e0a\u4f5c\u6f02\u4eae\u4e86\u4e0d\u6b62\u4e00\u70b9\uff0c\u6700\u559c\u6b22\u7684\u82f1\u96c4\u5347\u7ea7\u4e5f\u6765\u4e86\u7b80\u76f4\u6740\u65f6\u95f4\u5229\u5668\uff0c\u51c6\u5907\u5168\u82f1\u96c4\u5347\u6ee1\u7ea7\uff0c\u6700\u597d\u73a9\u7684\u8fd8\u662f\u5916\u661f\u4eba\u4e86\uff0c\u81ea\u5e26\u4f20\u9001\u529f\u80fd\u3002\u5730\u9707\u52a0\u4ea1\u7075\u5854\u7edd\u914d\u554a\u3002\u800c\u4e14\u8fd8\u8981\u66f4\u65b0\u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587\u5462\uff0c\u5927\u7231\u554a\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1471228432, "timestamp_updated": 1471228534, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500225", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24923594": {"recommendationid": "24923594", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012233122", "num_games_owned": 190, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 990, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471220077}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0442\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0442\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0440 \u0434\u0435\u0444\u0435\u043d\u0441", "timestamp_created": 1471220136, "timestamp_updated": 1471220136, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24919498": {"recommendationid": "24919498", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027867393", "num_games_owned": 200, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 638, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471205849}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "[h1]Introdu\u00e7\u00e3o[/h1]\n[b]Kingdom Rush Frontiers[/b] \u00e9 a sequ\u00eancia de Kingdom Rush, sendo o segundo jogo na s\u00e9rie. Originalmente um jogo de [i]flash[/i], e, depois, um app, [b]Kingdom Rush Frontiers[/b] mant\u00e9m a din\u00e2mica inova\u00e7\u00e3o no g\u00eanero de [i]Tower Defense[/i] estabelecida pela s\u00e9rie, em um cen\u00e1rio completamente novo, com novas torres, her\u00f3is e inimigos.\n\n[h1]An\u00e1lise[/h1]\nAp\u00f3s jogar o lan\u00e7amento de Kingdom Rush no Steam, eu j\u00e1 sabia o que esperar de sua sequ\u00eancia no Steam: uma portabilidade excelente, com jogabilidade altamente flu\u00edda e com poucos (ou nenhum) problemas de funcionalidade.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nEm [b]Kingdom Rush Frontiers[/b], um jogo que segue o gameplay comum do g\u00eanero [i]Tower Defense[/i], cada fase tem como objetivo de defender um ponto final de um caminho em que os inimigos percorrem; se os inimigos ultrapassam esse ponto final, ocorre a penalidade, que no caso \u00e9 a perda de pontos de vida. Ao se chegar a 0 pontos de vida, o jogador perde a fase e ter\u00e1 que recome\u00e7\u00e1-la. Cada fase tem ondas de inimigos, e \u00e9 poss\u00edvel, assim que a onda atual termina, de mandar a pr\u00f3xima onda atacar imediatamente sem tempo de espera, em troca de ouro.\n\nPara defender esse ponto final, o jogador tem \u00e0 sua disposi\u00e7\u00e3o torres que podem ser constru\u00eddas e aprimoradas, o que custa ouro que \u00e9 conseguido ao se derrotar inimigos. Diferente de certos jogos do g\u00eanero, a s\u00e9rie Kingdom Rush apresenta lugares espec\u00edficos em que as torres podem ser constru\u00eddas (enquanto que, em outros jogos, os \u00fanicos lugares que as torres n\u00e3o podem ser constru\u00eddas s\u00e3o os caminhos em que os inimigos percorrem), portanto, trazendo um elemento extra de estrat\u00e9gia em jogo.\n\nAssim como seu predecessor, [b]Kingdom Rush Frontiers[/b] apresenta 4 tipos de torres que podem ser constru\u00eddas: [i]arqueiros[/i], [i]soldados[/i], [i]artilharia[/i] e [i]magia[/i]. Todas as torres possuem um custo para serem constru\u00eddas e aprimoradas e, ao chegar no \u00faltimo n\u00edvel, o jogador pode escolher, se permitido na fase, escolher entre um dos dois \u00faltimos n\u00edveis de aprimora\u00e7\u00e3o. H\u00e1 tamb\u00e9m o caso de haver torres de [i]mercen\u00e1rios[/i] nas fases, que s\u00e3o diferentes dependendo do contexto dela (como, por exemplo, fases que se passam na praia possuem torres de [i]piratas[/i]; dependendo da fase, pode ser que haja, al\u00e9m dos inimigos que percorrem os caminhos, ajuda ([i]jawas[/i] que atiram nos inimigos) ou desafios ao jogador ([i]plantas carn\u00edvoras[/i] que podem comer seus [i]soldados[/i] e inimigos).\n\nAs torres de [i]arqueiros[/i], [i]artilharia[/i] e [i]magia[/i] possuem um alcance definido que pode ser aumentado com aprimora\u00e7\u00f5es de seus n\u00edveis ou de aprimora\u00e7\u00f5es especiais, que podem ser habilitadas chegando ao \u00faltimo n\u00edvel. J\u00e1 a torre de [i]soldados[/i] funciona de forma diferente, criando soldados que s\u00e3o constantemente fornecidos (ao m\u00e1ximo de 3) e que podem ser postos em um determinado ponto do caminho, dependendo do alcance fornecido; esses soldados lutar\u00e3o contra os inimigos terrestres, bloqueando pelo menos 1 inimigo por cada soldado vivo (se houver apenas 1 inimigo, todos os soldados vivos o atacar\u00e3o, se houver 4 inimigos vivos, 3 ser\u00e3o bloqueados enquanto o outro continuar\u00e1 o caminho).\n\nAdemais, cada torre possui um tipo de dano que realiza. As torres de [i]arqueiros[/i], [i]soldados[/i] e [i]artilharia[/i] realizam basicamente dano f\u00edsico, enquanto a torre de [i]magia[/i] realiza basicamente dano m\u00e1gico. A decis\u00e3o de que tipo de torres construir depende muito de que tipo de inimigos est\u00e3o atacando em cada caminho na fase; se em um caminho h\u00e1 muitos inimigos com armadura f\u00edsica, a melhor forma de atac\u00e1-los \u00e9 com torres de [i]magia[/i], assim como se h\u00e1 muitos inimigos com armadura m\u00e1gica, a melhor forma de atac\u00e1-los \u00e9 com torres de [i]arqueiros[/i], [i]soldados[/i] e [i]artilharia[/i]. Esse \u00e9 um dos elementos de estrat\u00e9gia em [b]Kingdom Rush Frontiers[/b].\n\nO jogo tamb\u00e9m apresenta her\u00f3is, que s\u00e3o habilitados conforme o jogador progrede no jogo: cada her\u00f3i possui ataque b\u00e1sico, f\u00edsico ou m\u00e1gico, e 5 habilidades (ativas ou passivas) que podem ser habilitadas e aprimoradas conforme esses ganham n\u00edveis (os her\u00f3is ganham n\u00edveis derrotando inimigos em uma fase). Os her\u00f3is tamb\u00e9m bloqueiam inimigos e podem ajudar suas torres a derrotar inimigos dessa forma. \u00c9 poss\u00edvel apenas escolher um her\u00f3i por fase, logo, saber qual her\u00f3i utilizar em determinada fase \u00e9 outro elemento de estrat\u00e9gia do jogo.\n\nPor fim, o jogador possui duas habilidades especiais: a [i]chuva de fogo[/i] e os [i]refor\u00e7os[/i]. A [i]chuva de fogo[/i] \u00e9 uma carta na manga que normalmente deve ser utilizada para derrotar grupos grandes de inimigos que poder\u00e3o colocar em risco sua situa\u00e7\u00e3o em uma fase; j\u00e1 os [i]refor\u00e7os[/i] s\u00e3o uma op\u00e7\u00e3o para bloquear inimigos para que suas torres ou her\u00f3is os derrotem. Cada uma dessas habilidades possui um tempo de recarga diferente.\n\n[b]Progresso[/b]\nO progresso no jogo se d\u00e1 principalmente pela conclus\u00e3o impec\u00e1vel de cada fase; ao concluir uma fase, voc\u00ea \u00e9 recompensado por estrelas, que podem ser gastas numa \u00e1rvore de b\u00f4nus para suas torres e habilidades especiais, que pode ser apagada a qualquer momento sem qualquer preju\u00edzo. \u00c9 poss\u00edvel conseguir at\u00e9 3 estrelas por concluir uma fase, e, ap\u00f3s conclu\u00ed-la, voc\u00ea possui a chance de completar os desafios [i]de ferro[/i] e [i]heroico[/i] para conseguir uma estrela em cada um.\n\nO desafio [i]heroico[/i] consiste em defender-se de 6 grandes ondas de inimigos com apenas um ponto de vida. J\u00e1 o desafio [i]de ferro[/i] consiste em defender-se contra uma grande onda constante de inimigos com apenas um ponto de vida, logo, n\u00e3o h\u00e1 muito tempo para calcular meticulosamente a estrat\u00e9gia, for\u00e7ando o jogador a agir rapidamente contra a onda de inimigos.\n\nAo completar as 15 fases, o jogador completa o cen\u00e1rio de [b]Kingdom Rush Frontiers[/b] e assiste ao fim da hist\u00f3ria do jogo.\n\n[b]Veredito[/b]\nPor [i]R$ 19,99[/i], [b]Kingdom Rush Frontiers[/b] \u00e9 um jogo que se diferencia dos tradicionais jogos do g\u00eanero e que possui um alto n\u00edvel de desafio e fornece ao jogador um valor de poder jogar novamente determinadas fases, j\u00e1 que cada uma delas \u00e9 \u00fanica. Talvez n\u00e3o possa valer, no momento, o que custa, uma vez que \u00e9 poss\u00edvel jogar a vers\u00e3o [i]flash[/i] gratuitamente. [b]Mas[/b], assim como Kingdom Rush, [b]Kingdom Rush Frontiers[/b] receber\u00e1 as fases adicionais gratuitamente, o que justificar\u00e1 o seu custo.\n\nMesmo sendo um jogo originalmente [i]flash[/i], o jogo possui um estilo audiovisual incr\u00edvel, com detalhes em todos os lugares e indiv\u00edduos, impec\u00e1veis vozes \u00e0s torres e her\u00f3is (com diversas refer\u00eancias), e uma trilha sonora muito boa. Al\u00e9m disso, o jogador possui, nesta vers\u00e3o, a escolha de uma variedade de resolu\u00e7\u00f5es diferentes, a op\u00e7\u00e3o de colocar os gr\u00e1ficos em [i]Full HD[/i] e de escolher se quer rodar o jogo em 30 ou 60 [i]fps[/i].\n\n[b]Kingdom Rush Frontiers[/b] tamb\u00e9m se diferencia de seu predecessor por ter diferentes \u00faltimos n\u00edveis para todas as torres, her\u00f3is, inimigos e, principalmente, fases. Para jogadores de Kingdom Rush, [b]Kingdom Rush Frontiers[/b] ser\u00e1 uma agrad\u00e1vel sequ\u00eancia.\n\nE desafio n\u00e3o falta ao jogo.

Rush\", for me it was one of the best tower defense games I've ever played. Therefore, I was no question whether I'd buy its sequel \"Kingdom Rush Frontiers\" immediately.\nIn the following I will consider some of the, in my opinion, key aspects of the game in detail.\n\n\nGameplay:\nFirst, let me sum up the basics of the game: There are 4 types of towers, with 2 final branches each. There is a total of 15 levels, divided into 3 different regions with different types of enemies respectively. Each level has a \"Heroic\" and an \"Iron\" version that will unlock after the level was completed with perfect 3 stars. There are many different heroes that you can level up. Moreover you can also level up your powers and abilities with perks. That means you cannot only gear up your towers during a level but also globally.\nAll in all, the different towers, abilities and heroes form a unique gameplay. Especially the abilities and the heroes are features that I missed in so many other TD games, and that make this game so great, in my opinion.\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics of this game simply look gorgeous. Every pixel looks like it was handcrafted affectionately.\n\nThe price with respect to the content:\n10 bucks for initially 15 levels and ~20 hours of fun; sounds okay to me (note: I think that I completed the game quickly). But wait, there's more: Shortly after the release of the game the devs announced 3 free content updates that all game owners will receive. Thanks for that!\n\nDifficulty:\nThe difficulty of the game is a pro and a con at the same time. The beginning was not too easy, some of the levels took me some tries till I was able to master them.\nBut after I unlocked the second branch of the mortar tower, the mech, this changed instantly. I was able to completed all the following levels very very quickly and also most of them in the first try. I think the mech is simply overpowered.\nIn contrast, the game offers to change the difficulty, so this issue could be fixed easily, I guess. Still I am satisfied with the difficulty because it took me some time to figure out a good setup for each of the \"Heroic\" and \"Iron\" versions.\n\n\n[b] Summary - Pros (+) and Cons (-):[/b]\n    + gameplay\n    + graphics\n    + price w.r.t. content\n    o difficulty\n\n\n[h1]TL;DR[/h1]\nFor me \"Kingdom Rush\" is now one of the best tower defense series I've every played. \"Kingdom Rush Frontiers\" is a great sequel; if you liked the first one, you will for sure also like this one. The devs basically did not change much in the already great concept, rather added new levels, enemies and towers.", "timestamp_created": 1470386896, "timestamp_updated": 1470389539, "voted_up": true,

Adorable, vibrant fantasy graphics and animations, tons of content and replay value, and fantastic sound and music. The tower upgrade paths, the wide variety of heroes to choose from, and the global perk tree made for some wonderful strategic combinations and unique gameplay not normally found in your average tower defense game.\n\nI had a great time experimenting with hero and tower combos. Using the pirate with his ability to call upon the Kraken and having it lock enemies in place while my towers mowed them down was among my favourite combos, and there are countless others to try and discover.\n\nUnits are fully voiced in the game, and while it can sometimes get repetitive hearing the same lines over and over, the voice acting was well done and fit the overall cartoon, humerous theme perfectly.\n\nGet those towers up, ready your hero, because at the current price of $10.99 CAD and with more FREE content coming, Kingdom Rush Frontiers is not one you should let slip by.\n\nMy

Steam, but I wanted to make sure it's just how I remembered it to be.\nAND IT IS!!!\nNow THIS means good trust in a company to not fuck up a mobile port!\n\nReview:\n[*]Whatca need to know about Frontiers? It's the second game in the Kingdom Rush trilogy, and also the second one to hit Steam, and it is a tower defense game, esentially.\n\n[*]The concept of gameplay and story is pretty simple: evil guy wants to rule land hurr durr, build towers to spook them, then go after the bad guy yourself and defeat him. And you know? It isn't called Kingdom Rush for nothing, I mean your kingdom is under attack of another kingdom, you defend succesfully and just go after the enemy's ass. You're [i]rushing[/i] your [i]kingdom[/i] into his face! As much as it sounds like fun, well, it is!\n\n[*]Now the gameplay itself consists of you defending a couple of pathways from enemies to reach your booty and you have to build specialty towers for that. There are a total of 4 towers to construct and each one has 3 normal upgrades and 2 branching ones, which change their gameplay all-together or are just straight upgrades to the normal towers, which both options are still nice. Apart from the towers, you also get to choose a hero to help you out in your journey, and you unlock more as you play, and what can I say other than that they all have unique properties and abilities and I'll leave the magic of discovering for yourself ;)\n\n[*]Now as of the game's release there is only the campaign available to be played and there are only half the heroes available compared to the mobile version, HOWEVER, all of the remaining special levels as well as the heroes are going to be updated a tad bit later and everything will be perfectly fine, as believe me, all of that content is worth your while.\n[b]bUT mr. ReVIeWeR, hoW CAn YoU be So surE tHey wiLL aDd thEm?!?[/b]\nIt's simple: proof of Kingdom Rush 1. At launch, not everything was available right away, however in a couple of good working months, all that was promised, as well as its own Steam exclusive levels were added in updates and everyone lived happily ever after. Except for Veznan lol\n\n[*]Now for the levels themself have been improved quite a bit since its predecessor, and pretty much a vast majority of 'em have special encounters you have to keep an eye on, some being fun, some being challenging and a lot being annoying :)\n\n[*]And lastly, 2 more things before Imma go finish the last heroic level: the soundtrack is just as epic as you expect it to be, that's one. Two: each enemy and unit has it's own character portrait, but the towers do not anymore. That made me quite sad, since the ones in the original KR kicked ass!\n\ntl;dr Welp, it delivers what you expect: a solid tower defense game. Now I am not a fan of strategy games at all, but I do recommend this game for anyone, regardless of preferences, as it's just simple to learn and understand and it's just that addictingly good. The final verdict for Kingdom Rush Frontiers as of it's release is a well worthy 9/10. If you're willing to go get this game when all of the levels and heroes have been pushed out, well let me tell you(and this will skip me an edit in the future, trust me) that your game is worth a 10/10! But why a perfect rating? It improves on everything that the original game had, which is strategy and imagination, with more creative towers, more creative enemies and heroes alike as well as the levels.\n\nThis has been your random reviewer, leaving his opinion and going. The choice of purchase is all up to you. Have a nice day!\n\nFinal note edit: Did you know there's a toilet paper emoticon from this game? Now that's true devotion to emoticons! :krtp:", "timestamp_created": 1470233253, "timestamp_updated": 1470233488, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553205", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24684668": {"recommendationid": "24684668", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072534192", "num_games_owned": 133, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 48, "last_played": 1514302857}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm gonna hop on the review train relatively early.\n\nBought the first game released for steam and recieved about a week ago a coupon for 25% off on this game. Fairly certain that was the devs that requested that, so you know <3 Ironhide, they respect their fanbase. Even without the coupon, if you've played the first game, you'll love this one.\n\nThey've upped the strategy, and made heroes more than just a point and click go here and stand your ground. Control upgrade points as they level up. Heroes keep their levels after battle but it takes a significantly larger amount of time to level them up, levels are unique to each hero. Hero A at level 7? Well, Hero B is at level 3, go grind some earlier levels to level that guy up. Distribute level up points into unique skills for each hero.\n\nTowers have been changed/tweaked, new upgrade paths and gimmicks (the Archery Tower's final upgrades are actually useful now), further you go up certain tower, the more synergy you get with other towers around it, Archery tower for example, has a side path upgrade in one of the level 4 upgrades that effects all towers around it with increase range (has to be a mage, another archery, or bombard tower), also gives chance for criticals to all those towers. Smack an archery tower in the middle of the group and spam the upgrades, watch as your Mages get blown-out-of-the-water range on their attacks.\n\nNo new towers though, I'd have hoped for a 5th choice, not just the original four you get in the first game. Oh, new map by the way, and of course it's very pretty.\n\nNew Environments, new enemies, same great feel.\n\nMy experience this far is that the levels are a lot more close to challenging than they were in the first game, where it was either too easy or too hard. I feel like if I just tweak my strategy in someway with my tower setup/troop positioning/upgrade purchases I'll be successful. A feeling I haven't got with any game since I played Halo: Reach Legendary Difficulty.\n\n8/10, hopefully the next one they step it up a bit more, but definitely a worthy sequel and well worth the money.\n\nBUY IT\nBUY IT\nBUT IT\nGET YOUR WALLET\nAND BUY THIS GAME", "timestamp_created": 1470207225, "timestamp_updated": 1470207225, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505013", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24683421": {"recommendationid": "24683421", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064603608", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1620, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485265085}, "language": "english", "review": "What are you doing here on the review section?

Did you like Kingdom Rush? Then you will love this part too. For me this series is one of the best Tower Defense games for the PC. \n\n [*]The graphics are clean and cute. \n [*]The sound effects and music are perfect \n [*]The gameplay is just great. You will find long Levels and you have to adapt your strategy. I like the tower, enemy and hero variations and especially the surprises in the levels. The best for me is that it`s not too easy. You really have to find a different strategy to finish each level (you can choose between casual, normal, hard) I think it is obvious that I love this game :)\n\nYou will get a lot of play time just with the campaign. And when you are done with that don't forget to try the iron and heroic mode for each level which will give you an extra challenge. For Kingdom Rush I have 80hours + of playtime and for sure I will play both parts again in the future.\n\nOverall,I can only recommend buying this game and trying it out.

They found a way to completely re-create all 4 tower types with exciting and interesting ability trees.

You know, I'm not a big fan of tower defence games. Why did I bought this game? Looking at the high ratings I thought that this game has a soul. But after careful consideration of the game, I realized that this is only pitiful semblance of TD maps for Warcraft 3. No soul, no graphics, no atmosphere. Now I'm sure that the soul lives only in such masterpieces of oldschool like warcraft. At this point I could complete the review, but I want to ask one question for all readers: \n\nWhy you encourage unscrupulous developers and buy these games? Oh, sorry - \"games\". Very funny and sad to watch how the parodies of Warcraft maps (which are disguised as the original games) sell for huge amounts of money... Why are tens of millions people play DotA and other MOBA games? Why do they pay for these games, if they can just download a free map for Warcraft? Honestly, I don't understand this foolishness... And not so much foolishness, how much a complete lack of morals. Ask yourself a simple question: Will you develop a game, if you knew that it subsequently stolen piece by piece, and everyone will forget about you?", "timestamp_created": 1469586601, "timestamp_updated": 1469621343, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 30, "weighted_vote_score": "0.072503", "comment_count": "29", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24546071": {"recommendationid": "24546071", "author": {"steamid": "76561198220401872", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2913, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500135668}, "language": "english", "review": "I clicked a frog and then it started dancing.\n\nBEST GAME EVER", "timestamp_created": 1469573850, "timestamp_updated": 1469574212, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.426300", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24544969": {"recommendationid": "24544969", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998384445", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1836, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492629215}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0417\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0448\u044c \u0442\u044b \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0432 \u0441\u0442\u0438\u043c, \u0437\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0448\u044c \u0432 \u0438\u043d\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0440\u044c -

After Vez'nan demise, evil mage Lord Malagar gets his hands on Vez'nan's staff and steals powerful Hammer of Ages. You, unknown hero, have a task to retrieve it before Lord Malagar can use it for his evil plan. That proves to be a difficult job as you are chasing him across the desert, jungle and underground caverns. During your journey, you are gonna encounter new, powerful enemies but you will also get help from (unexpected) allies.  \n\nKRF's gameplay isn't any different from original. There are 15 levels with 3 game modes - Campaign, Heroic and Iron. Also, there are 3 difficulty options - Casual, Normal and Veteran.

The original Kingdom Rush on Armorgames.com was amongst my favorites, thus I did not hesitate to buy its updated version as a fullpriced game on Steam. Seeing this successor made me wonder if the quality could hold up to my expectations; after about an hour of gameplay I have the feeling that I will indeed love this game- as it builds upon the strengths of its predecessor while adding some improvements.\nI will first speak about the Kigdom Rush Series as a whole, before getting into detail with Kingdom Rush Frontiers.\n\n[b]What are the strengths of the Kingdom Rush series?[/b]\n[i]Style:[/i]First of all the lovely art and sound design; if you are able to bear the sight of a comic look you will notice that the drawings may not be at the peak of 2d-graphics (probably due to the games flash/mobile origins) - but that they do have a decent style on them that makes them distinguishable from other TD-Games. The sound itself is a combination of a decent background music (neither is it outstanding,nor is it irritating) and wonderful catch-phrases by your troops/towers.\n[i]Gameplay:[/i] Kingdom Rush is that kind of TD-Game where the path of the enemy units can not be influenced by your towers as you are building them next to the walking-path at specific locations (therefore: no mazes and no towerspamming till the map is full). However, one of the four towers you can build is a \"melee-tower\" which spawns three soldiers at a location you can can choose within its influence area - this gives you the opportunity to block enemies on the road with a fight - while your towers are tearing them apart. Micromanaging the spawning locations ofthese troops - as well as your powerfull hero character and your two spells - while planning your tower upgrades makes for a pretty intense experience in which you will forget that there is no button for fast-forwarding; as you are much more actively involved into the gameplay as you usually are in a TD-Game.\n\n[b]What improvements does this game bring to the series?[/b]\nFirst and foremost it is the leveldesign that was improved; while the first 6 stages offered a nice variety of artstyle it is the uniqueness of some gameplayelements in those maps, that made them really distinguishable -  without any spoilers: new paths are created and there are more interactive objects than before.\nThe heroes feel more powerful and unique than in Kingdom Rush.\n\n[b]Is it worth buying?[/b]\nThat - as always - depends on your experience with Kingdom Rush and TDs in general and of course the price of the game.\n\nIf you played Kingdom Rush and liked it you will like this one too.

Easy worth the money. Let's keep it short, shall we?\n[list]\n    [*]Excellent graphics - beautiful 2d graphics is easy to read, the environments are diverse and reward exploring, just take a look at [url=http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121022133222/kingdomrushtd/images/9/91/New_Map_Kingdom_Rush.jpg] this beautiful map [/url]. This is the actual in-game map. The difference being that it is animated in game.\n    [*]Excellent challenge level - the basic campaign was finished by myself and my wife with equal level of enjoyment. Then the game offered us - with a free update - additional minibosses on the same map. The challenge there spiked and it was precisely what we needed after killing the main baddie.\n    [*]Excellent enemy design - regular armored guys, spider queens spawning spiderlings as they go, flying enemies... I could go on, but this would spoil your fun. Go there, prepare your defenses and patch them up in panic mode as something unexpected happens.\n    [*]Excellent level design - levels start out linear, only to quickly become mazes with multiple entry points and tunnels. This forced me to rethink my defenses many times. Rarely there is a single chokepoint that one can fortify the hell out of and win the game.\n    [*]Excellent tower design - tower upgrades are rewarding. They just are. They look better, pack more punch and do crazy stuff like stealing gold from enemies, transform into Mechs and roam the battlefield.\n    [*]Good for all ages - friendly graphics and very user-friendly interface are what makes this game good for different players. You can be a hardcore guy like me, doing all challenges on all levels, or as my wife who plays as much as I but casually. Nobody gets lost in the interface, graphics do not mislead.\n    [*]Many save slots - I like the fact that game does not mix saves together. 1st save is mine, 2nd my wife's. We can play the same game and not overwrite our progress.\n    [*]Game rewards dedication - finishing a level perfectly gives more upgrade points used to improve your towers. Then there are two additional, optional challenges for each level, totalling to additional 66% of value of the original, perfect score. What I am saying here is: if you buckle down and finish additional challenges then you can upgrade your towers more for the later stages.\nI bought this game, I bnought Kingdom Rush: Frontiers as soon as it appeared.

Everything is retained from the first game, but things have been added to; more heroes (that you can level up and upgrade yourself), new towers, new abilities, and the graphics are simply [i]outstanding[/i]. Each tower got a redesign and everything looks fresh. The startup menu even allows you to choose to play at 30 or 60 FPS if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nFor those new to the series, you don't have to have played the first game to enjoy this one, although I'd strongly recommend it as Frontiers feels like a direct sequel. I'd easily claim Kingdom Rush to be one of the best Tower Defense games in the entire genre. The game can be controlled entirely with the mouse, but there are a few optional hotkeys on the keyboard you can use to save yourself the trouble of clicking near the edges of the screen. The in-game hints (that act as a tutorial) as well as the first few levels are [i]very[/i] beginner-friendly and serve as an excellent foundation to get you on your feet. If you're in search of a challenge, however, there's a hard difficulty setting (as well as an easy one if you're having trouble) that you can change to at any time without penalty. Each level also has challenge modes that require not even a single enemy to break through your forces. These challenge modes are completely optional in terms of story progression, but are necessary for 100% completion if you're going for that.\n\nOn a sidenote, I got an opportunity to talk with the devs of the game during one of their livestreams; not only do they actively reply to questions and comments, but they're very nice and easygoing and seem more than willing to address any issues, concerns or questions you may have.

Vom Krieger \u00fcber Magier und Zwergenk\u00e4mpfer bis hin zu einem fliegenden Drachen ist f\u00fcr jeden etwas dabei.\n\n[h1]Die Level[/h1]\nDie Level sind sehr unterschiedlich getaltet. Es gibt zwar immer das Ziel die Feinde davon abzuhalten zu einem oder mehreren zielpunkten zu gelangen jedoch dabei sind unterschiedliche themen, Gimmicks und Bauweisen ringebaut worden. So h\u00e4lt man die Gegner in einem Level einfach nur auf von A nach B zu kommen, im n\u00e4chsten Level gibt es dann 2 nicht verbundene Wege oder eine bestimmte H\u00fctte in der man sonst nicht Baubare Einheiten Rekrutieren kann bis hin zu Gimmicks welche nicht Spielbeeinflussend sind wie einem Predator der in mehreren leveln versteckt ist, einem singenden Frosch oder einem R\u00e4tsel um einem Indiana Jones \u00e4hnlcihen helden aus einer Ruine zu helfen.\n\n[h1]Die T\u00fcrme[/h1]\nDie T\u00fcrme sind sehr abwechslungsreich gehalten, so gibt es anfangs zwar nur wenige T\u00fcrme welche sich aber in sp\u00e4teren Upgrades sehr unterschiedlich aufsplten. So werden magiert\u00fcrme zu licht oder Todest\u00fcrmen, Bombent\u00fcrme zu Presslufthamemrn oder Kampfrobotern und vieles mehr.\n\n[h1]Positives[/h1]\n- umfangreiches Upgrademen\u00fc \n- 9 helden\n- Spiel lief absolut Fehlerfrei\n- Viele Geheimnisse eingebaut\n- Bossk\u00e4mpfe\n- mehrere Schwierigkeitsgrade\n- 2 Zus\u00e4tzliche Herausforderungsmodis f\u00fcr jedes Level\n- Sehr gut balanced\n- 41 verschiedene Gegnertypen die sich teils stark unterscheiden\n\n[h1]Neutral[/h1]\n- Viele Achievements\n- Sammelkarten\n\n[h1]Negatives[/h1]\n- Leider nur 15 Level zur Zeit. \n- Manche T\u00fcrme sind in den sp\u00e4teren leveln fast nutzlos und werden eigentlich kaum mehr verwendet\n\n[h1]Fazit[/h1]\nDie Macher von kingdom Rush zeigen mal wieder das es bei Tower Defense Spielen nicht auf hochwertige 3D High Definition Grafik ankommt sondern eher darauf das das Spiel strategisch und weitreichend aufgebaut sein muss. Das Spiel ist einer der Beweise das Kingdom Rush kein One Hit Wonder war sondern es sogar teilweise noch evrbessert werden kann wenn man mit Liebe und Hingabe zum Spiel arbeitet.\nVon mir eine klare Kaufempfehlung in jeder Hinsicht\n\nWenn euch diese Review gefallen hat, dann folgt unserem Reviewprogramm\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/-German_Gamer_Community-", "timestamp_created": 1469470218, "timestamp_updated": 1469470256, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568011", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24522426": {"recommendationid": "24522426", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967685936", "num_games_owned": 1745, "num_reviews": 579, "playtime_forever": 1884, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472759621}, "language": "english", "review": "If you have played Kingdom Rush this is more of the same glorious fun.\n\nI highly recommend this well polished, unique tower defense.

Now, heroes have persistent levels and abilities you can assign skill points to in whatever order you wish! Leveling heroes is fairly fast (especially when you play on later levels) so don't worry about there being a grind!\n\nLevel 4 Tower upgrades are all new and more interesting than in the original game! Now, the Mage towers can become the Necromancer or Archmage! Necromancer raises skeletons to block and fight for you when enemies die near the tower and the Archmage can store up to 3 high-damage shots to really blast enemies! Of course each level 4 Tower also has special abilities you can buy such as the Necromancer's Death Rider that is a powerful fighter and buffs nearby friendly skeletons and the Archmage can summon forth a Twister to damage and push back enemies!\n\nAll of the levels are top-grade stuff too with many having special features. One level has \"Tuskan Raiders\" up on a cliff shotting at targets that come near, another has man-eating plants that can gobble up friend and foe alike and yet another has a band of friendly dwarves (with unique Towers!) setup to aid you!

We can't simply use Google Translate (as someone suggested in a previous post)... Google Translate doesn't take context and cultural innuendos into account. It's not just grammar, but semantics and syntaxes that must also be taken into account.\n\nThe final level for this update and the Heroes were ported with time to spare.

I will add a TL:DR at the end.\n\n[h1] Gameplay \t[/h1]\n\nKingdom Rush: Frontiers (KRF) currently has 15 levels or 45 if you count iron and heroic level variations, 41 different enemies, 4 base towers each with two different specializations, and 9 different heroes. There are 3 different difficulties to play on which include casual, normal, and veteran so you can choose whether to make every hero movement and tower purchase count, or take it easy and perhaps experiment with different heroes and strategies.  \n\nJust like in the previous title in the series you unlock heroes as you complete more levels. There is a story about your adventure which you can read on each level, and as you beat more levels and level variations you get upgrade points to use on the upgrade screen. The towers now have different specializations than in the older title and they allow you to rethink your strategy, and find a way to effectively use these new towers along with new heroes to beat the levels and challenges which are presented before you.\n\nThe variation within heroes is quite large allowing you to have a character for whatever playstyle you prefer, however the leveling works quite a bit differently than before. Now your main hero Alric will start at level 1, but levels are kept throughout the game meaning once he becomes level 2 he will stay level 2 in the next level. When the hero levels up you can go into the hero room to choose which upgrade to give them, whether that is Alric\u2019s sand warriors, Deirdre\u2019s holy light, or even Ashbite\u2019s feast you can choose which upgrade you put those skill points into and can reset it with no problems. \n\nAs you advance further I previously mentioned that more heroes are unlocked, however they don\u2019t start at level 1 like Alric, but rather are of a higher level to allow them to be useful in the point where you unlock them throughout the campaign. \n\n[h1] Graphics/Sounds \t[/h1]\n\nThe same beautiful art is present again, the great artstyle that makes Kingdom Rush, well, Kingdom Rush. The map is animated and every little detail is great to see, you can even see the locations of the soon to be added levels.  The designs of the new towers are great and the enemies are unique to Frontiers. \n\nThe music works very well to give into the atmosphere of the game and add to it.\n\n[h1] Pros/Cons \t[/h1]\n\n[b] Pros\t[/b]\n\n+ Breath of fresh air in a familiar setting\n+ Hero and enemy variety \n+ Good replay value\n+ Easter eggs\n+ Interesting story \n+ New upgrade choices\n+ No microtransactions \n\n[b] Cons\t[/b]\n\n- Hero reliability (this is not a con for everyone, but it is for some where in later levels it is impossible to win without the use of a hero and so those who think that since KRF is a tower defense it should have the option to be beaten with only the use of towers may find great difficulty in that task)\n- Tower usefulness with baracks in question (It seems baracks lack usefulness after a certain stage because they are supposed to be body blockers first, and that is taken away through the great skill of the necromancer tower and if you do need baracks you usually never need to upgrade it to a specialization because it will usually be more optimal to upgrade an Artillery, Mage, or Archer. There is also the case of Templars (one specialization) being discussed as a worse investment compared to its counterpart the Assasin)\n\n[h1] Personal Thoughts\t[/h1]\n\nI was one of the lucky individuals allowed the opportunity to beta test this game, to perfect it for its release on steam. I\u2019ve seen bad bugs and great bugs and all of them fixed. For someone like myself it\u2019s amazing to get to play Kingdom Rush again. A while ago I checked to see if KRF was coming to steam and I saw a huge notice saying that it would sadly never make its way here. Happily, it\u2019s not the case, the future is here, and so is the next game in a beautiful series. This improves upon the original KR amazingly and honestly if you played the first KR, I don\u2019t think you can hate on this game. I am a huge fan of KR since I owned all the games on mobile and beat them repeatedly while waiting at the airport or bored during the day. It\u2019s truly amazing to see this game come to steam (here\u2019s to hoping for Origins to come onto steam as well). This game has less currently as compared to KR, but more is going to be added (for free). That includes enemies, heroes, and levels.  If you never played a game in the Kingdom Rush series before and enjoy tower defense games with humour and story, then whether you start at KR or go to KRF I would say you will enjoy it.\n\n[h1] TL:DR\t[/h1]\n\nThe second coming of Kingdom Rushing has arrived. If you liked the last one, you will most likely enjoy this one. If you are uncertain whether KRF is for you then go onto a site such as Kongregate and check out the much, much more limited flash version to get an idea of what the game will be like. When you return here I like to think you will want to buy the vastly superior version. \n\n[i]If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Original_Curators_Group#curation]Follow Original Curator Group[/url][/i]", "timestamp_created": 1469448518, "timestamp_updated": 1469468793, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 149, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.769768", "comment_count": "36", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39387051": {"recommendationid": "39387051", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005806303", "num_games_owned": 170, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1153, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1153, "last_played": 1516194486}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0442\u043e\u0443\u0435\u0440 \u0434\u0435\u0444\u0435\u043d\u0441.\n\u041c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0435\u0432.\n\u0412\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0435 \"\u0443\u0431\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442\" \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0442\u0430\u043a)", "timestamp_created": 1516100899, "timestamp_updated": 1516100899, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39354128": {"recommendationid": "39354128", "author": {"steamid": "76561198799691918", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 151, "last_played": 1515979925}, "language": "english", "review": "READ BEFORE BUYING!

Dahinter einige Schamanen, die noch mehr Zombies beschw\u00f6ren. Zum Gl\u00fcck ist eben noch das Lava-Upgrade des Kanonenturmes fertig geworden und so fackeln die fiesen Wichte vor sich hin und zerfallen schlie\u00dflich zu Staub, bevor sie das Ende der Stra\u00dfe erreichen und ich eines meiner wertvollen 20 Leben und damit die Chance auf eine 3-Sterne-Wertung verliere. Das ist Kingdom Rush Frontiers. Ein Tower Defense Spiel, das zwar das Rad nicht neu erfindet, aber einfach alles richtig macht und f\u00fcr viele Stunden Strategie-Spa\u00df bietet. \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nZu den grunds\u00e4tzlichen Mechaniken von TD-Spielen brauche ich hier eigentlich nichts erkl\u00e4ren, denke ich. Abwechslungsreiche Gegner schlurfen oder rennen durch abwechslungsreiche Levels und versuchen, euch eure wenigen Herzen wegzunehmen. Zur Verteidigung k\u00f6nnt ihr an fest vorgegebenen Positionen T\u00fcrme errichten, zwei verschiedene Zauber wirken (die Klassiker: Feuerball und Soldaten beschw\u00f6ren) und au\u00dferdem habt ihr noch - wie im guten alten Warcraft 3 - euren Helden, der ebenfalls mit teilweise sehr m\u00e4chtigen aktiven oder passiven F\u00e4higkeiten unterst\u00fctzt und sogar selbst zuhaut. \n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1265697039\nEs gibt insgesamt vier verschiedene Grundturmarten (die Klassiker: Pfeil-, Magie-, Soldaten- und Kanonenturm), die sich jeweils in der letzten Upgrade-Stufe noch einmal spezialisieren lassen. So wird der Magieturm entweder zu einem arkanen Turm, der Gegner mit Wirbelwinden zur\u00fcckwirft und magische Geschosse mit AoE-Damage verteilt, oder er wird zum Nekromantenturm, der Pestwolken verschie\u00dft, gefallene Creeps als Skelette auferstehen l\u00e4sst und einen untoten Skelettreiter beschw\u00f6rt, der f\u00fcr euch k\u00e4mpft. Echt cool! Dazu kommen dann noch ein paar stimmige Rollenspielelemente: Helden, T\u00fcrme und Zauber lassen sich f\u00fcr verdiente Sterne (durch das L\u00f6sen von Levels) stufenweise verbessern.\n\nDas einzige, was mir in der Spielmechanik ein bisschen gefehlt hat, ist die Taste zum Beschleunigen des Spielgeschehens. Selbst die ersten 2-3 eher langweiligen Wellen oder am Ende wenn man schon die Ultraverteidigung aufgebaut hat und eh nichts mehr schiefgehen kann, muss man den Creeps zuschauen, wie sie da langsam ihrem Ende entgegentrotten. Diese Funktion sollte doch eigentlich heute in TD-Spielen schon obligatorisch sein, oder?\n\n[h1]Grafik[/h1]\nDie Grafik von Kingdom Rush Frontiers ist h\u00fcbsch und durchweg stilsicher. Technisch wird da nat\u00fcrlich kein Feuerwerk abgebrannt und man merkt dem Spiel seine Smartphone-Herkunft schon an, aber die Levels sind daf\u00fcr mit allerlei h\u00fcbschen Animationen, im Fluss auftauchenden Krokodilen, in B\u00e4umen springenden Affen und versteckten Eastereggs dekoriert. Ich w\u00fcrde hier fast schon von einem liebevollen Leveldesign sprechen wollen :-)\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1265696464\n[h1]Umfang[/h1]\nDer Umfang des Spiels ist recht ordentlich. Die Hauptkampagne besteht aus 15 einzelnen Levels, die in der \"Normalform\" jeweils ca. 15 Wellen haben. So dauert ein einzelner Level schonmal 20-30 Minuten. Dazu kommen dann pro Level jeweils noch zwei abweichende Herausforderungen (ohne Held oder auf bestimmte T\u00fcrme limitiert). Au\u00dferdem gibt e noch drei DLC-Pakete mit Bonuslevels, die hier in der Steam-Version aber schon fest integriert sind. Unterm Strich bietet Kingdom Rush Frontiers mindestens 20-30 Stunden besten TD-Spa\u00df.\n\n[h1]Anspruch[/h1]\nDie sp\u00e4teren Levels mit mehreren Ein- und Ausg\u00e4ngen sind genretypisch oft etwas komplizierter, aber zumindest auf dem einfachsten der drei einstellbaren und jederzeit wechselbaren Schwierigkeitsgrade sollte das Spiel kein Problem darstellen. Wenn es mal wirklich nicht klappen sollte, w\u00fcrde ich es einfach mal mit einem anderen Held probieren. Gerade die fliegenden Drachenhelden kann ich f\u00fcr sp\u00e4tere Missionen w\u00e4rmstens empfehlen ;-)\n\n[h1]Errungenschaften[/h1]\nDie 84 sammelbaren Errungenschaften sind fair und unterhaltsam gestaltet. Da geht es unter anderem auch mal darum, in einem Level etwas Verstecktes zu finden oder einen nur kurz auftauchenden Frosch anzuklicken, der dann f\u00fcr euch tanzt. Sehr cool! Ansonsten einfach komplett durchspielen und dann die noch fehlenden Achievements schnell farmen. Die Erkl\u00e4rung der Errungenschaften selbst ist dazu eigentlich schon v\u00f6llig ausreichend und der Schwierigkeitsgrad hat keine Auswirkungen.\n\n[h1]Fazit[/h1]\nKingdom Rush Frontiers ist ein w\u00fcrdiger Vertreter seines Genres, bietet bestes TD-Feeling, abwechslungsreiche Gegner, liebevoll designte Levels, T\u00fcrme, Zauber und Helden mit Rollenspielelementen und mindestens 20 Stunden Spielspa\u00df. Einziges Manko: Es gibt leider keine Vorspultaste. Selbst die standardm\u00e4\u00dfigen 9,99 Euro auf Steam finde ich v\u00f6llig okay.

Em diversos jogos, ap\u00f3s descobrir uma estrat\u00e9gia boa e funcional, \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio apenas repeti-la com m\u00ednimas mudan\u00e7as entre os n\u00edveis. Kingdom Rush Frontiers n\u00e3o te deixa se acomodar, a cada level o formato do mapa, n\u00famero de rotas, caracter\u00edsticas de novas tropas, enfim, tudo converge para uma nova forma de jogar em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao n\u00edvel anterior. Muitas vezes \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio repetir um n\u00edvel em busca de uma nova estrat\u00e9gia e quando descoberta, o sentimento recompensador \u00e9 indescrit\u00edvel.\n\nAl\u00e9m de te tirar constantemente de sua zona de conforto, o mais impressionante \u00e9 a quantidade de tempo que ele consegue isto, j\u00e1 que esse n\u00e3o \u00e9 um jogo curto, ainda mais dependendo da dificuldade em que se joga. Do come\u00e7o ao fim, eu segui me frustrando e aprendendo a ultrapassar os obst\u00e1culos que apareciam em meu caminho, sem nunca conseguir me acomodar.\n\n[h1]Variedade e influ\u00eancia de RPG[/h1]\nEste jogo nitidamente n\u00e3o foi desenvolvido com uma mesma f\u00f3rmula e replicado in\u00fameras vezes apenas alterando o formato dos mapas. Em cada n\u00edvel, al\u00e9m do formato e o n\u00famero de rotas se alterarem, muitas vezes existem constru\u00e7\u00f5es aliadas no pr\u00f3prio mapa, tropas aliadas com upgrades pr\u00f3prios, novos spawns, novas rotas que v\u00e3o surgindo ao longo das waves, v\u00e1rios chef\u00f5es e uma grande quantidade de inimigos com caracter\u00edsticas, ataques, formas de se matar e de atacar diferentes. Todo essa variedade de features agrega muito ao resultado final do jogo. \n\nAl\u00e9m de ir liberando novos upgrades para as torres no in\u00edcio do jogo, o jogo conta com uma consider\u00e1vel quantidade de her\u00f3is muito diferentes uns dos outros, que, ap\u00f3s escolher um deles, o jogador poder\u00e1 controlar individualmente e assim desenvolver novas estrat\u00e9gias com ele em mente. \n\nO jogo tamb\u00e9m conta com mec\u00e2nicas derivadas de RPGs, contando com leveis individuais para cara um dos her\u00f3is, o que da a oportunidade de upar habilidades em cada um, que v\u00e3o desde a conjura\u00e7\u00e3o de minions, at\u00e9 grandes ataques em \u00e1rea. E mais um exemplo de local que teve aspectos de RPG implementados \u00e9 na \u00e1rvore de habilidades das torres, que podem te ajudar a moldar o seu estilo de jogo para um n\u00edvel em espec\u00edfico.\n\n[b]Para os amantes do g\u00eanero do TD, n\u00e3o tenho ressalva alguma para indicar a compra do jogo, \u00e9 divers\u00e3o garantida. Para os interessados a experimentar um jogo do g\u00eanero, eu acho este um jogo adequado para se iniciar, j\u00e1 que mesmo sendo uma sequ\u00eancia, ele n\u00e3o requer o primeiro jogo e conta com as caracter\u00edsticas cl\u00e1ssicas do g\u00eanero.

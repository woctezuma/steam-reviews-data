It shows more of the world outside of the killing games and gives a very different style of gameplay than the other entries in the series, which still feels very danganronpa. It's fully english voice-acted and has options to switch to japanes voice acting if preferred. ~18 hours play time and that's more than fine for \u20ac18.75 on sale.\n\nAlthough I do have some complaints, mainly with the Monoku-man(/puzzle) sections. \n\nFirst every puzzle is different and complex enough to be fun, but they can lead to frustations. mainly due to the fact that you have to use the limited amount of bullets that you have on you at the moment, they give you a box to replenish one kind of bullet, but it's randomized and often it's a bullet you are not allowed to use during the puzzle anyway, which is very frustating since you do know the answer, you just can't solve it.\n\nSecond the set-up of each puzzle gets somewhat tiring. I'm more than fine to have puzzle segments(,since they give the needed variety of the overall gameplay), but they should have more variety in the set-up of each puzzle. It's always shoot the monokuman machine, then look around with a birds-eye view and use the appropriate bullets in the correct order on the monokumas. To be fair, with how basic the gameplay is I'm not sure how they could have varied it more, but I definitely would have appreciated it. \n\nThird, the bosses are kinda...simple, except the fourth, but that boss had a cheap-suicide attack, and the final which was really freaking cool.\n\nFourth, the chapters are too long(~2-4 hours each). I don't mind the length of the game, I only think it should have been chopped up more into smaller chapters. Especially for when you want to complete everything, but screw up one single time and need to use a continue(which affects your chapter ranking) and really don't feel like reloading and repeating what you already did. \n\nThey do give you plenty of save points, so if you don't care about the personal ranking and only about playing and the story, then you probably wouldn't mind most of my complaints.\n\nTl;Dr: If you want to learn more abut the story of danganronpa, are fine with the change in gameplay and don't mind rare occasions of frustration. then it's worth the ~\u20ac20 on sale, perhaps full price, but I'm a cheap f*** so I wouldn't.\n\nedit: sidenote Steam says I spend ~18 hours on the game, but the in game save file says I've only played ~12-13 hours, but I'm assuming steam contains the more realistic number of played hours.", "timestamp_created": 1514715815, "timestamp_updated": 1514715993, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38894955": {"recommendationid": "38894955", "author": {"steamid": "76561198410661540", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1941, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511762818}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u76f8\u6bd4psv\uff0cpc\u4e0a\u7684\u7784\u51c6\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6211\u8fd9\u79cd\u624b\u6b8b\u661f\u4eba\u6765\u8bf4", "timestamp_created": 1514712938, "timestamp_updated": 1514712938, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38884147": {"recommendationid": "38884147", "author": {"steamid": "76561198284376822", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 860, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 503, "last_played": 1514757081}, "language": "english", "review": "Lame boring and just bad.

Najbardziej chyba podoba\u0142o si\u0119 mi zestawienie postaci Komaru - typowej dla serii \"absolutnie normalnej\" g\u0142\u00f3wnej bohaterki - z Toko. Brzmi to jak przepis na katastrof\u0119, ale obserwowanie jak dziewczyny dojrzewaj\u0105 (ka\u017cda na sw\u00f3j spos\u00f3b) by\u0142o bardzo interesuj\u0105ce. Gorzej niestety wypadli wrogowie - dzieci s\u0105 po prostu irytuj\u0105ce, a Kurokuma ma tak durnowaty g\u0142os, \u017ce nie mog\u0142am do niego czu\u0107 nic pr\u00f3cz \u017ca\u0142o\u015bci.

Tragizm wydarze\u0144 miesza si\u0119 tu z komizmem monokum, fantazjami Toko na temat Byakui (najlepsza cz\u0119\u015b\u0107 fabu\u0142y!), psychodelicznymi kolorami, azjatyckim popem, okrutnie nachalnym fanserwisem i - w og\u00f3lno\u015bci - ogromnym dystansem do japo\u0144skiej popkultury. \n\nDo grafiki trzeba si\u0119 chwil\u0119 poprzyzywczaja\u0107, bo modele postaci sprawiaj\u0105 wra\u017cenie nieco przestarza\u0142ych i \"wyblak\u0142ych\". Muzyka jak zwykle wypada \u015bwietnie, za to kamera mog\u0142aby pracowa\u0107 zdecydowanie lepiej, bo wielokrotnie w trybiue celowania muszka dzia\u0142ka nagle l\u0105dowa\u0142a na suficie, a nie na szar\u017cuj\u0105cym na mnie monokumie. \"Another Episode\" nie jest zbyt trudn\u0105 strzelank\u0105, ale wymaga tam, gdzie wymaga\u0107 musi. Dla mnie du\u017cym plusem by\u0142y zagadki logiczne.\n\n\"Ultra Despair Gilrs\" jest dobr\u0105 gr\u0105 - w innej konwencji ni\u017c pozosta\u0142e \"Danganronpy\", ale nadal \u015bwietnie rozubudowuje histori\u0119. Jest to jednak tytu\u0142 tylko dla fan\u00f3w - pozostali mog\u0105 poczu\u0107 si\u0119 odrzuceni przez bardzo specyficzny humor.

There are some cons but no breaking ones.\n\nSo, what do you get here ? A very very good action game I must say. Controls answer quite perfectly, only had some camera  problems mainly while too many monokumas chasing me and whit the final boss. \n\nIf you have played Danganronpa 1 and 2, then you will love this game. If you haven't, well, you'll still like it but will miss most of the references it makes to the two previous very very good installments. \n\nI must say I bought it blindly because of the label \"danganronpa\". And I honestly fell in love with that duo of girls. Playing Genocide Jack was very clever from Spike Chunsoft and Makoto Naegi's little sister is a lovelly character. Like always this is so well written, the scenario is always clever and if the plot is still the same, the end is always something epic. If you played both previous danganronpa you know how the final shot looks like and you know this game (if you have finished it) does it right too. I'm now going to attack Danganronpa 3, Don't know what I'll get for hope and despair but this neverending struggle is so well brought on the scene by the developper that I am always amazed.. Or I have a talent to be impressed every single time I see the same thing... Ha, isn't that hope for you ? Hahahaha... \n\nSo Please jump in, take up the role of Komaru and Toko and enjoy. Like all the other episodes of the series, it can be sometimes a bit long, repetitive but the puzzles here are clever, most of them are easy but it does fit the childish mood of the enemies and not a bad point at all.\n\nI truly had a great time with this and won't miss the opportunity to play it another time...someday... someyear... I like the way they implement characters from the first game into the other ones. \n\nHave fun guys, this game deserve the time you'll put in it.", "timestamp_created": 1512785133, "timestamp_updated": 1512785133, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528401", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38140078": {"recommendationid": "38140078", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072977555", "num_games_owned": 759, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 341, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 100, "last_played": 1513727213}, "language": "english", "review": "This game so cool!\ni like characters, cool design, and so nice humor\nAnime video scenes so perfect it's like i watching anime.

But I came to play anyway because I'm a fan of the franchise. I have to say I'm pleasantly surprised, and I would recommend this game to anyone who also likes Danganronpa.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the gameplay is really mediocre. I note that I played on the hardest difficulty. Most Monokumas die in a single hit, and are so slow that you basically have to be trying to be hit. It's almost impossible to run out of bullets. The puzzles are in general fairly simple. Even most bosses die in two hits, which is just plain ridiculous and means that most boss fights are over before they even start (a shame, because I really liked the boss soundtrack).\n\nBut if you like Danganronpa, you probably don't like it for the gameplay, and you definitely don't play it for Improved Hangman's Gambit. You play it for the story, which while not nearly as good as the ones in the visual novels was still good enough to keep me interested for the full duration of the game. Komaru and Toko's relationship is interesting and the extra backstory on the DR universe is very welcomed.

I was disappointed on all accounts.\n\nThe gameplay consists of 3 main parts: running around shooting Monokumas, solving puzzles, and solving riddles. The puzzles are incredibly simple, and you are given obvious hints about how to solve it. You can also ignore the entire puzzle aspect and shoot your way through it, which often times is an even easier option due to the poor puzzle design. It feels tedious, and you get no sense of accomplishment from completing these. The riddles feel out of place and strangely difficult in an action-based game. The combat is uninspired and easy, the controls are difficult. You are given the option to use Genocide Jack as a power up in combat, but the game is so easy that I never used it once. \n\nAs for the plot, you will learn nothing about the characters from the other games, besides a slight backstory for Komaeda. Throughout the game, there are odd times where the characters break the fourth wall, acting out of character for no reason other than for the developers and writers to poke fun at themselves, as if they made a fantastic game that they deserve attention for. You know when Joss Whedon took over the second Avengers, and everyone started making nerdy jokes for no reason? It's like that.\n\nSkip this game, and read a plot summary on Wikipedia or something instead.\n\nTLDR: Boring, uninspired gameplay with a boring plot that offers no details about the characters players have come to love.", "timestamp_created": 1511675004, "timestamp_updated": 1511675004, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488371", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37613833": {"recommendationid": "37613833", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086937903", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1532, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513527331}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u6709\u5225\u65bc\u300aDanganronpa\u300b\u7684\u5916\u50b3\u4f5c\u54c1\uff0c\u904a\u6232\u5167\u5bb9\u504f\u89e3\u8b0e\u7684\u6050\u6016\u904a\u6232(?\n\u559c\u6b61\u300aDanganronpa\u300b\u7cfb\u5217\u7684\u73a9\u5bb6\uff0c\u503c\u5f97\u63a8\u85a6\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1511666963, "timestamp_updated": 1511666963, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37565232": {"recommendationid": "37565232", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140295822", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1481, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507254829}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Um dos melhores jogos que vieram diretamente do  PSVITA.

Get it if you are a fan of the series.\n\n+ Runs smoothly\n+ English & Japanese voices\n+ Fun\n+ Puzzles\n\nI really enjoyed this, when I first played it I couldn't put it down. I loved the gameplay and wanted to learn more of what was happening.\nIt helps develop and explain parts of the series I didn't expect them to touch on but was great they did in this way. \nThe models look great for the series and I actually enjoyed the English voices and the backgrounds are fitting.\n\nThe puzzles I enjoyed, some were simple, others did have me thinking on if it was a trick or if I was just stupid.\n\n\n- Forced tutorials when replaying chapters\n- Monoku-man arcade challenges\n- Tracking items you missed\n\n\nEverytime you replay a chapter (such as for missing collectables/A ranking) you are told the tutorials again, as well as what each upgrade does. This is annoying, game you know I already completed the game, so quit it with the tutorials. Yes they can be skipped but that is still some time taking me out of the gameplay to spam skip it.\n\nThe arcade challenges are easy but some are a pain in the ass to get right, either 2-3 monokuma's take their time to get where they should be or you were caught for bullshit reasons. Chapter 4 I HATE because of this, 2-3 of those challenges are a bit of a trek from any save-point and to get A ranking you need to perfect the challenges, you can retry them and keep your A rank score but retrying over and over will lower that chapter score.\nThose Monokuma beasts can go to hell for all I care >_>\nBut this is more of a nitpick, I wouldn't have an issue with it if a save point was actually near the damn things but this is my 100% side talking.\n\nLastly, if you want to 100% it, you may need to use a guide. The chapters do not tell you what or how many of each collectable you missed other than the hidden children. Otherwise you need to guess and hope while replaying a chapter you find what you are missing, otherwise have fun being in the dark. I admit I used a guide after I completed the game a first time to tick off what I had found so I knew which chapters I had to return to to save myself time.\n\n\nOverall you be getting around 20 hours of gameplay for your purchase, possibly 24 to 100% without using a guide.", "timestamp_created": 1511130112, "timestamp_updated": 1511192609, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.603303", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36548679": {"recommendationid": "36548679", "author": {"steamid": "76561198268853545", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 990, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510794657}, "language": "english", "review": "What a weird game.\nToo many cutscenes for people who want to enjoy the gameplay,\nToo much gameplay for people who who just want to experience the story,\nThe gameplay is not good enough to leave either of these two groups of people satisfied.\nYet, at its core, it is still a great experience for a person craving more danganronpa.\nPlus it made me like Toko as a charecter, which is something I never expected to happen.

It deviates from the usual Danganronpa formula and goes in the direction of a third-person shooter.\n\nIf I were to describe this game , it would be a [i]tactical[i] story-driven third-person shooter.\n\nStarting off with the graphics , the psycho-pop aesthetic really shows in this game and honestly the environments are quite memorable. Sometimes the lighting looks off and the models seem bland , but it's not a massive concern. As always , the execution cutscenes have a very distinct art-style , inspiring anxiety within the player. There are also some enjoyable animated cutscenes.\n\nThere are executions in this game , but overall they are a lot more tame.\n\nThe story is far from perfect , falling flat on many occasions. First off , there is very little character development apart from the two main characters (Komaru and Toko). I wish that some of the characters were explored in a bit more detail (for example [spoiler]Hagakure's mother[/spoiler] or any of the 'Warriors of Hope'). Backstories seemed a little sloppy , in the sense that they weren't explained extremely well. You are only really given the general idea of why the 'Warriors of Hope' are extremely delusional. I'm not going to spoil anything , as even the first couple of scenes are worth going into blind.\nFor me , the game gives me the opposite impression of what Danganronpa V3 did. The story fell flat , but I really liked the ending. Apart from the dumb hope shtick that keeps resurfacing , the ending definitely gave a lot of closure and detail to the game.\n\nThe gameplay is surprisingly good , consisting of the player choosing different 'truth bullets' to counter different enemies. I very much liked the puzzles where you had to 'destroy all the enemies in one explosion' or 'find the child without being caught'. The 'puzzle shooter' element of the game really goes with the Danganronpa aesthetic. That being said , sometimes you have to shoot through waves of enemies , which gets rather repetitive as the game progresses.\nRather than a head-shot , you've got an eye-shot , which one-shots a normal monokuma. The bossfights in this game are rather good. Most consist of a large boss , which you have to find a weakness somewhere on the body , whether it is their eye , torso or leg. The boss fights are very enjoyable , and not extremely difficult.\n\nOverall , the game does feel like a Danganronpa game , but for the most part it did feel like watching an above-average filler episode of seomthing. Suffice to say , if you're interested in the Danganronpa universe , it's a must-buy. If you're looking to play your first Danganronpa game , not this one.

I felt like refunding it with the weird 3d graphics and the shift in the genre. I decided to play it til' the end, and honestly, I'd say it was worth it.\nDanganronpa Ultra Despair Girls is an awful lot like super paper mario; the gameplay itself wasn't anything stellar (and I'm a little biased, because I really liked the class trials from Danganronpa 1 & 2), but the story was alright. Unlike super paper mario, this game has an aesthetic that is rather displeasant in my eyes. \nFrom early game to end game, I felt like the game didn't have that much of a challenge while playing on normal mode. I've only died about 3 times in the game, and that was around mid-to-end game. I think it would be better to play on the easy mode, but if you want to actually be challenged, I'd think the hard mode would suffice (I haven't tested either one, sorry!)\n\nIn short; Danganronpa Ultra Despair Girls isn't like the other games in the series, but it's still Danganronpa. It doesn't really have writing as good as the other games, mainly because of the shift towards third-person action (with a dash of puzzles)[spoiler][strike](and worst of all, there isn't class trials!)[/strike][/spoiler].

The third-person shooter gameplay didn\u2019t seem up my alley and I read reviews that the main character was not good and Toko, well, she was unpleasant to listen to in the first game. So needless to say, I went into this game only for the story and expected to suffer for it. 20 hours later, I can say that, despite its flaws, I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed the game. I\u2019m gonna keep this spoiler-free since I\u2019m as antsy about these things as the next guy, so I\u2019m gonna try to give you a better idea of what to expect. Also, the game takes place in between Dangan Ronpa 1 and 2 (a 1.5 of sorts), so you gotta play those two first.\nObviously going over the story would be a spoiler, but I will say that throughout the game I was unimpressed with the plot itself. It wasn\u2019t bad, just not too interesting, which is curious given the interesting premise of the first game is what got us all here. The kind of \u201csmaller\u201d plot of exploring the city and going from point to point was entertaining enough, though. As for the characters, there was only one I outright didn\u2019t like. The other antagonists then varied from good to \u201ceh, sure\u201d at worst. The two protagonists that you spend the most time with, Komaru and Toko, are interesting. I started losing my patience with character rituals they went through, even if they made sense given the horrid situation. Komaru is scared, Toko is mean. However, around halfway through, both, (even Toko) grew on me until the end. The rest of the supporting cast is pretty alright, but the game doesn\u2019t really focus on them anyways so no big worries.\nI think a big problem I have with this game is its environment. The SETTING and places you explore are fine if you don\u2019t mind a ruined city setting like me, but the places you\u2019re actually walking through are lacking. Dangan Ronpa tends to have a minimalist style where things are flat and drawn oddly, and this works when they\u2019re presented as a scene in front of you like in the first games. But you\u2019re actually walking around these areas in 3D space in this game, so those setpieces seem very off. Not all environments are like this thankfully, but when it happens with stuff like fire, it stands out. My least favorite part is the people that are tertiary characters are all blue/purple. This trick works in super crowded areas like midday Tokyo, but even the most crowded area in the game wasn\u2019t enough to justify it. I would\u2019ve taken 3 or 4 of the same human model copy-pasted over this. When these people were dead everywhere, the impact was COMPLETELY lost because they were a vibrant blue/purple that tried the opposite of seeming real. It took me out of the gravity of dead people being EVERYWHERE, which in turn made the characters seem melodramatic even if they actually weren\u2019t. Plus, your character ends up getting stuck on geometry corners quite a bit.\nAs for the gameplay itself, it\u2019s fine. I can respect them wanting to try something new, and for the different plot this game has, it definitely works. Normally you\u2019d think you\u2019re shooting down Monokumas a bunch, but this game has a semi-surprising small amount of fights. I mean, it IS a Dangan Ronpa game, so it\u2019s focus is on the story and dialogue. Like the first games, the \u201cgameplay\u201d aspect is really meant to connect these story points. That makes them sound empty, which they\u2019re not, but there seemed to be more puzzles than Monokumas. Anyone wanting to play this to shoot things may be disappointed; no fight with Monokumas felt difficult. I may even recommend doing Hard. You\u2019re given a myriad of bullet types, but I found myself only ever using the default since I didn\u2019t need much else except when the game put in something that needed them. In fact, a good chunk of the game is surprisingly puzzle-based, using different bullet types to usually kill all Monokumas in an area in one shot. Thankfully you don\u2019t HAVE to do this the \u201cright\u201d way and the grade you get from them isn\u2019t important due to the easy difficulty, but I found myself hating these because Monokumas mostly ended up behaving stupidly and messing it up even though I knew the solution (a la an explosion just barely missing one). Upgrades were no only weird, but didn\u2019t feel too helpful. As a result, collecting money to buy them didn\u2019t feel too necessary. Also, it cannot go without saying that the game doesn\u2019t tell you there\u2019s a run button and, on keyboard (which you probably should be playing for aiming), it\u2019s on SHIFT. I found Shift to be endlessly uncomfortable\u2026but the only way to rebind it was to use an external program, so be advised.\nOverall, this game was a roller coaster. I went in dreading it, ended up excited to play by the end of the first hour, grew fatigued several more hours in, got interested again halfway through, started to fade again, then it brought me back near the end. It\u2019s not perfect by any means. The gameplay is rough around the edges, but can still be satisfying and a breath of fresh air for the series. The story and Komaru/Toko can start to feel stale, but get built on enough to not get too bad and ultimately become enjoyable. I could see where people would think it\u2019s not good, but I would play it to continue the Dangan Ronpa story regardless. But even then, I think it has its own merits that make it more than a mere stepping stone to get to Dangan Ronpa 3. I left out a good amount of detail to stay spoiler-free, so I'd recommend seeing for yourself!", "timestamp_created": 1508821905, "timestamp_updated": 1508821905, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2,

In fact, it feels more Danganronpa than previous titles have ever been. Danganronpa is known for its coined \"psychopop\" theme/aesthetic and i feel this game takes the aspects of psychopop to the max. The game is pretty dark, argugably darker than previous danganronpa titles. One would be accurate to assume that a game that involves children would tone down the madness, right? Wrong, in fact adding children to the mix contributes to the madness, giving the game a much darker theme than the last ones while simultaneously maintaining the humor. Ironically, there are several dirty jokes to be seen in the game as well. A few references to other media. \nI reccomend picking up every collectable item that appears in the game. There are interesting stories behind them all. In fact, if you really are interested in the story of the game, its critical that you pick up the items you find while exploring the game, because details about the story and characters are revealed.\nGameplay wise, there ARE no debates. I felt like this was going to be something like a deal breaker for me, but i was wrong. I found myself enjoying the game nonetheless. There are a lot of twists and turns in the game like previous titles. However, this game is full of revelations. Some won't be as exciting if you've never played the first two games, especially the first one. But you don't' really have to play the first two to enjoy it.\nThe game is a third person shooter. Unlike most shoot-to-kill games, you actually have to use specific kind of bullets for certain enemies. The Ai is surprisingly dumb sometimes, but the boss battles can feel a little cheap, especially the final one. There are also special challenges that reward you based on your strategic methods. There are a few riddles, most pretty easy, one dissapointingly easy. \nDebates are replaced with boss battles.

The change of pace, while jarring at first, can be offputting, but this game definitely has its own charm. It will most likely not be for everyone, and while I personally didn't come across any problems nor did I find the experience boring at any point, I know many others could have lists of cons with this game. However, if you like character development, you'll like this. Toko and Komaru's relationship blooms so nicely and I've fallen for both girls, really. Byakuya, who? Get me in with this yuri instead!\n\nAll jokes aside, while people may find the gamepay boring, the story is rich and the cutscenes are very well done.

However, I ended up enjoying it way more than I had expected (even thought it was inferior compared to the franchise previous games). Honestly, there are more Cons than Pros, but I still think it is worth playing. \n\nPros:\n\nIt's Danganronpa, with Danganronpa characters. It's funny and inspiring as usual, just like the previous games. \n\nThe characters, althought not so well developed, are likeable and cool. I did hate Komaru and Touko through the whole first chapter, but they grew on me later on. Some other characters did the same.\n\nIt completes the previous games. The story is pretty cool, and so is it's setting. It does well its job of being the link between DR1 and DR2. \n\nWe have voices all the time! Unlike the previous games, everytime someone says something, we can read it AND hear it! Amazing. The seiyuus did an amazing job as well (I played it with the audio in Japanese). \n\nCons:\nThe FPS is terrible - sometimes I would aim right and miss, or try to shoot something that was too far away and the shoot would miss even if I COULD SEE it hit the target -, so be warned. As bad as it is, however, somehow you get used to it at some point.\n \nThe character development isn't as good as DR1 and DR2. You spend a lot of time shooting Monokumas and running around, so there isn't much time to talk. Some characters can still be great - but you still feel like you wanted to see more of them. \n\nSome bosses are just [i]terrible[/i]. I could say the whole boss concept was terrible, but sometimes it was fun fighting against them, so I'm just gonna say that some are terrible. Like the last one. Seriously, wtf was that?\n\nMost puzzles are just... Boring. They're too simple or simply bad executed. I don't know. Tbh I think I only liked ONE in the entire game. \n\nThat's it, I guess.

Danganronpa isn't known for their amazing gameplay. Danganronpa 1 and 2 could have been masterpieces, if you actually had to solve the murders like one would in real life, as opposed to solving it by playing minigames. Luckily, danganronpa makes up for that by having the most sickening, disgusting, incredible stories, making it still one of the best games I've played. \n\nBecause of this weaker gameplay, I decided to play this game on normal instead of hard, so I'd spend less time doing that. This kinda... backfired because as bad as the gameplay was, it now became even more of a snoozefest. \n\nThe game is some sort of shooter where you use different bullets for different occasions. A rather familiar concept. The opponents only don't really fight back so it doesn't really matter what you do. It becomes boring fast. In between the repetitive shooting, you get thrown into a game room time and time again, where you have to 'solve' a puzzle to unlock the door. Only the puzzles are incredibly dull and simple and require almost no thinking if at all. I say 'solve', because, as I later found out, you don't have to solve them at all. The room says: kill them all in one explosion.... buuut, it doesn't matter what you do. If you just do everything but use explosions, the door opens as well. \n\nNow, the storyline. The main thing about the game series. It took about 20 hours before it finally got... a bit interesting. At the end there were some interesting twists, but it still was a lot weaker than the other two... and having to choose the very same thing over and over (you literally got the choice to either do something or don't do something, and you got that choice like 10 times in a row with a few seconds in between) was really annoying. \n\nSo. This was by far the weakest of the danganronpa games.

still set in the danganronpa universe that we all know and love, it does have some puzzles scattered throughout the levels to keep your brain occupied since there's no trials so that's good enough. The pc port is pretty decent, keyboard and mouse controls work well however the aiming isn't that great, even if you're good at shooters its not that easy to get perfect shots every time. There are a few issues overall like the game feels a bit unpolished sometimes and the boss fights are a bit of weak point if you ask me but the graphics are nice and it even has some proper anime cutscenes here and there. There's a lot of little collectibles you can get like lore stuff and extra things that give you more coins so you can unlock everything. The game is a lot shorter than the other games but it does one thing well and that is that it tells you what happened inbetween the first and second games and answers a lot of questions. Although one big issue I have is that there's a bit of a cliffhanger so that sucks, dunno if the tv show continues the story cause I haven't watched it yet but ya know if it does its all good but if not its a bit annoying. \n\nOverall its a cool little game, worth the play if you want to know some more stuff about danganronpa. Not a perfect game though, the levels are a bit barebones and  the gameplay is a bit weak, Genocide Jack is best girl again ofcourse. 7/10", "timestamp_created": 1505309610, "timestamp_updated": 1505309610, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34904378": {"recommendationid": "34904378", "author": {"steamid": "76561198160133927", "num_games_owned": 149, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1039, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500160998}, "language": "english", "review": "Not as good as the other 2, but a good one.", "timestamp_created": 1505233808, "timestamp_updated": 1505233808, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34897603": {"recommendationid": "34897603", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064925722", "num_games_owned": 356, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1551, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506254469}, "language": "english", "review": "Ultimate Thigh", "timestamp_created": 1505208024, "timestamp_updated": 1505208024, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 18, "weighted_vote_score": "0.635149", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34883067": {"recommendationid": "34883067", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097448878", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 851, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505136845}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros\n-The properly animated 2D OVA cutscenes\n-A new fresh twist on danganronpa with a 3rd person resident evil  5+6 style of gameplay\n-New interesting and quircky characters that fit very well into the lore\n-Bridged the gap between Danganronpa 1 and 2\n-Good character development regarding Toko\n-Ported quite well\n-Awesome soundtrack\n\nCons\n-THEY BROUGHT MUTHA FUCKIN NAGITO BACK!!

All the controls and movements that were clunky on the Vita now feels like second nature. The gameplay is actually fun now, and many details that couldn't be seen on the small Vita screen are now in full HD glory to be appreciated all over again.\n\nTLDR The PC version of UDG is hands down the definitive way to experience this game. Everything looks crisp and lifelike in 60fps, and the third person shooter gameplay is now very enjoyable.

games but I picked this up on the PS4 the day it was realsed.   I no longer am on PS4 and moved to PC gaming.   After replenishing my collection with this game on PC and playing it i'm happy to report this port is well done.  The graphics are great.  It supports the Xbox 360 and PS4 controlers without a hitch as long as you configure them in steam.  The main girl of the story is adorable and I dont find myself skipping the script.  I wan't to hear everything they are saying.  English voice on most parts of the game. There are some parts (interuldes) that are just text.  The villians are amazing.  This game is a brilliant display of story telling that takes you into this world soaking all it's dark zanny glory.   The script made me smile when the villians introduced themselfs.  It's not all story there is also parts where you move around and shoot bears and some parts are easy as hell puzzles/games.  Works perfectly on SLI (overkill).  Man, this game is really good for the price. If you like anime this is a no brainer.

This game only makes sense when you don't search for it, and let it creep upon you on its own, let it cripple you, disturbing, wrong.\nEverything in this game is wrong and disturbing. It takes things that are dark and presents them so indirectly that it's more shocking than those things themselves; wraps razors in polka-dot papers and smiles at you while shoving it down your throat. \nThings that are so out of place it feels absurd, and that's what this game is - a load of absurd that turns out more realistic than you want it to be - for the things that are worst in it have nothing to do with fiction or made-up story.\nYou can complain that the models look like they didn't even try - but are you there for models? Danganronpa is colourful, vivid and yet dark despite it; it's a patchwork of things, those meaningless generalized, those important cropped out, something that this game's very menu represents well.\nIt doesn't tell you to contemplate the plot after you finish it - you're supposed to be pulled by it when you play and when you play only. \nMany games reach for shocking content to become successful through controversy - Danganronpa does something different: it takes things that people just don't find worth as good shocking value, and almost belittles them, through this doubling on their weight felt by the player. \nAnd most of the times you wonder HOOOW THE FFFFFLYING FFFFUCK THEY GOT AWAY WITH IT?! It's crossing every line and breaking every rule - and not the rules anyone should be proud of breaking.\nThis game is a worthy piece, that ties all loose ends from two games before, and does much better work on presenting the motives than the previous did. It's never boring, not overextended, Even though not very complex.\nIt's disgusting.\nIt's adorable.\nThis game is OH MY GOD, followed by OH, GOD and OH GOD PLEASE NO within minutes. \nYou need steel nerves to go through it, you need to know many things, you need to bear with things. Another Episode feels like a MOTHERCAWING ROADKILL - it damages you on many levels, but you cannot - must not - avert your eyes. Just like you need to learn to cope with reality that is far from happy ends and good choices. Even if it hurts. \nThe struggle doesn't end when you learn its nature. Life isn't worth only aiming for goal and achieving it, but its worth lies in how much struggle you're willing to put to carry on.\nAnd I sincerely wish I could have murdered Toko and mutilate her corpse each time a chapter ended.", "timestamp_created": 1503839895, "timestamp_updated": 1503839895, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.640703",

I mean, you can watch the anime too, but playing the games gives you a better experience, for sure. Great series!\n\nThis game sounds like a spin-off, but it plays a core part to the DanganRonpa storyline as a whole. It puts you in the shoes of Makoto Naegi's sister, as well as Toko from the 1st game. This game has everything you like about DanganRonpa: great story, great characters, tense moments, shocking and gruesome imagery of despair, and even some 4th wall-breaking humor! And of course, the great story of friendship, hope, and despair! \n\nThis game isn't as long as other DanganRonpa titles you can find on steam, as well as changes the gameplay from Visual Novel to 3rd person shooster/hack-n-slash, but its still really fun to play! \n\nI will post a few cons, since there are so few in there for me:\n- Some textures aren't updated best for 1080p and may bug out, like Komaru's necktie or the eyes. The glitches can only be seen when characters are at a distance. \n- The aiming defaults to the center, no matter if you look up and down, which makes me adjust to the Aim Reset. It takes a while to get used to for KB/M, but works alright with controller. \n\nAside from that, Solid KB/M controls for an over-the-shoulder shooter/hack-n-slash!\nHave not seen any framedrops, audio clipping, or any intense graphical glitches. \n\nSolid PC port for the most part!\n\n*EDIT*\nRealized I should have left my specs as part of the review:\nIntel Core i7-4790K CPU @ 4\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 980\n8GB RAM", "timestamp_created": 1502967653, "timestamp_updated": 1503009849, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34279823": {"recommendationid": "34279823", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963922976", "num_games_owned": 347, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503164575}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was released after Danganronpa 1 and 2, so it should be played after those two, even though it is set between those two games. \n\nGameplay. Good ideas with some minor polish issues.\n\nGameplay wise, this is very different from the other Danganronpa games. This game is a third person survival horror type game. Its survival aspects aren\u2019t that prevalent except on harder difficulties than normal. In fact, you have an ally that is constantly with you that can be switched to at any point. This ally is invulnerable, has melee attacks (unlimited attacks), and special attacks for extra damage. This ally is only useable when you have the meter for it, but you get a lot of refills for this meter. This meter is also continuously refilling on the easy mode, for those worried about the gameplay change and who want to get through the story easier. \n\nI would argue that the tension generated by being the main character with a health bar, rather than reading about the main character, provides an interesting diversion to other Danganronpa games. While there are horror elements, most of the horror comes from the situation you are facing. However, there are moments of pop up horror. If that\u2019s a problem, keep your finger on the invincible ally button. \n\nA large portion of the game is puzzles. The combat itself can be quite puzzle based. \n\nFirstly, ammo conservation can be achieved through creative use of your special bullets. Most enemies have a specific bullet type they are particularly weak against. This weakness is not of the numerical damage kind. Some enemies can be used to kill other enemies, if you shoot them with the correct bullet. If it\u2019s not clear, I am being deliberately cryptic. Play the game to find out. \n\nSecondly, there are a number of explicit puzzle rooms that require intelligent use of your special bullets to kill all the enemies in one shot, and without alerting any of them. I found most of the rooms to require some thought to get the top score. However, they can be a bit rough, in that you are technically doing the right thing, but an enemy doesn\u2019t line up properly and you fail to get the top score. You can just shoot everything if you want a quick solution.\n\nThe gameplay is a bit rough. Everything mostly works, but it\u2019s those little things that aren\u2019t quite right. The critical shots are a bit harder than they should be, some puzzles don\u2019t quite work or enemies don\u2019t quite do what you would expect.\n\nThe save points can be annoying. You must use save points on the map and cannot save anywhere. There is a tendency to have saves at least every half hour or so of gameplay time, and often less. However, in the later part of the middle section it felt like the gap got quite big between save points. It\u2019s possible that this is because there are more cut-scenes, and so if you were to just play a section it would still only take half an hour to reach the next save. However, there were quite a few times where I\u2019m sure I had an hour between saves. And that continued for quite a few hours. After that point it seemed there were more saves than usual, at least.\n\nIf I were to compare this to any other game, I would say its most like Killer7. \n\nStory. Well written and logical, with some minor repetition.\n\nThe story is very logical and well written. It fills in many gaps in 1 and 2 that I felt were necessary to explain. It has great dramatic tension and much of that despair inducing narrative you probably like if you are playing these games. The antagonists really push the despair levels, being able to evoke immense pity, while also being able to completely nullify any pity that you might feel through immense revulsion. The plot can be a bit too slow sometimes though. The relationship between the main characters is great and grows a lot. Though it does feel a little repetitive sometimes.\nThe environment is a very strong part of the story. It is active and often changes, is constantly relevant to the story, and is very strong with its broad brush strokes of terror and death and despair.\n The music suits the game very well in enhancing the mood.\n\n\u2018Your levity is good, it relieves tension and the fear of death\u2019\n\nThe fan service quotient is quite a bit higher in this one, compared to 1 and 2 in the series. This was disappointing, considering the quality writing that these games are known for. But I personally feel that the horror and discomfort levels in this game are also quite a bit higher than in 1 and 2. So I think this may have been somewhat used as an attempt to balance the mood. Some of the fan service stuff is also deliberately used later on as part of the story, so some of it does have a part in the story. \n\nOverall I don\u2019t think it is quite as good as Danganronpa 1 or 2. However, at its best it is certainly worthy of those two. At its worst, it\u2019s a little frustrating in terms of lack of polished gameplay, or a little slow in terms of moving on to the next plot element.", "timestamp_created": 1502902191, "timestamp_updated": 1502903345, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34278147": {"recommendationid": "34278147", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100638051", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 434, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502441642}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ub2e8\uac04v3\uac00 \uc815\ubc1c\ubd88\ubc1c\ub098\uba70 \uc720\uc77c\ud55c \uc815\ubc1c \ub2e8\uac04.\n\ub2e8\uac04\uc758 \u3137\ub3c4 \ubaa8\ub978\ub2e4\uccd0\ub3c4 tps\ub9cc \ub530\uc838\ub3c4 \uc798 \ub9cc\ub4e0\uc9c0\ub77c \uc7ac\ubc0c\uac8c \uc990\uae38 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.tps\ub77c\uace0 \ub9c9 \ucd1d\ub9cc \uc3d8\ub294 \uac8c \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \ud37c\uc990\ub3c4 \ud480\uba74\uc11c \uc9c4\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uac8c \ub2e4\ub978 tps\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcfc \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud2b9\uc774\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc92c\ub2e4.\ub2e8\uac04\ub860\ud30c\uc774\uae30\uc5d0 \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac78 \ucda9\uc2e4\ud788 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc92c\ub2e4.\n\ub2e8\uac04\ud32c\uc774\ub77c\uba74 \ub450\ub9d0\ud560 \uac83\ub3c4 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc0ac\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \uac13\uac9c.", "timestamp_created": 1502896632, "timestamp_updated": 1502896632, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34274587": {"recommendationid": "34274587", "author": {"steamid": "76561198201301762", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 429, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511343105}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc774 \uac8c\uc784\uc740 \ucf54\ub9c8\ub8e8\uac00 \uadc0\uc5fd\uace0 \ucf54\ub9c8\uc5d0\ub2e4\ub3c4 \uadc0\uc5fd\uace0 \ud6c4\uce74\uc640\ub3c4 \uadc0\uc5fd\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "timestamp_created": 1502883780, "timestamp_updated": 1502883780, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506897", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34269062": {"recommendationid": "34269062", "author": {"steamid": "76561198262867621", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1094, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503137135}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u6574\u9ad4\u4f86\u8aaa\u90fd\u4e0d\u932f\u4f46\u5287\u60c5\u6709\u9ede\u592a\u5c11\u4e86\u8ddf2\u4ee3\u6bd4\u4e0d\u904e\u53ea\u8981\u6709\u770b\u5230\u5e0c\u671b\u5eda\u548c\u5275\u54e5\u8cb7\u9019\u904a\u6232\u5c31\u503c\u5f97\u4e86", "timestamp_created": 1502856170, "timestamp_updated": 1502856170, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34262297": {"recommendationid": "34262297", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012927140", "num_games_owned": 214, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1778, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502116261}, "language": "german", "review": "Dieses Spiel ist etwas anders aufgebaut als die ersten beiden Teile.

Danganronpa series this game has easily the darkest of the storylines, for reasons such as[spoiler] torture, betrayal, murder, sexual abuse[/spoiler] and all for the most part involving [spoiler]children no less[/spoiler]. It is a pleasure (or displeasure?) to play thorugh if only to see how things turn out for the characters involved and its the primary reason to play through this game. \n\n[b]Characters[/b]- The characters in the game - specifically the bad guys - are fascinating individuals in their own right. They're full of different neurosis and demented backgrounds. Their history is unravlled through their breakdowns and from books scattered throughout the game shedding some light on why they are just so f'ed up. There's also the appearance of a very special someone.\n\nCONS: \n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]- It's pretty basic third-person shooter fare with substandard level designs with poor looking graphics. Although in all fairness, this is a port of a PS Vita game so just bare that in mind. It's also extremely easy as most enemies in the game will die in one shot if you hit them in the right place, even on the hardest difficulty. \n\n[b]Other Characters[/b] - So in the pros I had mentioned that the BAD guys are the interesting characters. That's because for the most part the good guys, namely the two main characters are not interesting AT ALL. Let's start with Toko. I never liked her in the first game and I still don't like her now. She's whiny, neurotic, annoying and insulting pretty much all the time and while they try to give her some kind of character development it falls far too short as she's still just as irritating as she's always been. Then there's the main character who is so bland and boring that they constantly make jokes about this fact again and again. We get it, you're normal and boring, okay great. \n\nSo in conclusion, play this for the great story and certain characters if you're a fan of the series. As it is worthy of a playthrough and fills in some of the gaps between the first and the second game.

Elles sont toujours jou\u00e9s a 100%.\n-Cam\u00e9ra trop proche du personnage et aucune possibilit\u00e9 de la r\u00e9gler en profondeur.\n-Rythme assez irr\u00e9gulier, il y a parfois beaucoup trop de cin\u00e9matiques et dialogues pour peu de temps de gameplay.\n-Il manquerai peut etre un chapitre ou deux, les diff\u00e9rents pass\u00e9s des enfants ne sont h\u00e9las pas assez approfondies.

Its a well done port of the PS Vita original. Looks lovely at 1080p and runs at 60 FPS and doesn't require a demanding system.\nSupports Xbox 360 Gamepad.\n\nThe story: It keeps you going and gets better as you understand the antagonists motivations.\nSurprisingly dark writing at times despite the daft tone. Makes you feel for the situation.\n\nFunny, with plenty of WTF moments that the series is known for.\n\nAwesome Music. (Although a lot of songs were used in DG1)\n\nGreat English voice acting, also lets you listen to Japanese voices if you prefer. Best of all, so much of the dialogue has voice acting except for extra stuff.\n\nNice and colourful with wacky background art. \n\nArcade Machine Puzzles are optional. You have to pass them but you don't have to \ndo it perfectly.\n\nThe Servant. Enough said.\n\nCONS:\n\nRepetitive gameplay and too easy. It got boring to play near the end.\n\nBeing a Vita game, when multiple people are on the screen they have washed out colour with no features. This looks pretty jarring during some moments.\n (\"Yes, Adult F really contributed to this conversation!\")\n\nThe game deducts your end of Chapter score if you chose to restart a checkpoint in case you screw a puzzle up.\n==\n\nIt took me 20 Hours to finish. I would say most of that was dialogue instead of gameplay.\nSince I played Offline, my hours were not tracked by Steam.\n\nOverall, a solid game.

Never had a single problem with the game, and it didn't feel lazy in any way (borderless is highly appreciated).\n\nEven so, I was hesitant to buy this after hearing people say it's a side-story or that the anime already spoils the story. What's the point of playing this if you already know how it's going to end?\n\nNothing could be further from the truth. This is a meaty, gripping story that any DR shouldn't pass up on. In a way, I actually think this story is overall the best in the series so far, partly owing to the fact it builds on top of the already established lore to subvert expectations. It has lots of twists and turns along the way, to the point that it feels like the entire ending sequence is one long payoff consisting in large part of well-executed knife twists and solid character development. I don't want to say too much to avoid spoiling anything, but I feel deeply satisfied after having finished the game. It won me over very quickly and then just piled on the goodies all the way to the end and beyond.\n\nI also liked the change to the mechanics. I thought the shooting aspect would be tolerable at best, but there's actually a lot of variety to it, so it never gets boring or overly hard. I'd definitely like to see more of this in the future.\n\nAs for the music, I have to once again give props to Masafumi Takada (big fan here) for bringing his best to the table. Sometimes I wonder whether the DR series feels for him like an outlet for his bizarre style. The area music in particular really gives off that killer7 vibe which is another thumbs-up in my book.\n\nAll in all, UDG is a must-play for any DR fan, and the PC version is the definitive one.

If you've never play at least the 1st one, then it's highly recommended not to play this game as it will be confusing and over-the-top ridiculous. Also, the ending sucked even more than the 1st game. It's basically a cliff-hanger for the main series' sequel. \n\nFirst off, let me go upfront about the game time. Minus the cut scenes, this spin-off is an incredibly short game. Despite this, it still took me far longer time to beat it because it's hardly a fun game. It's 3rd Person Shooter mechanic is a bit too clunky for my taste, the Action mechanic with Genocide Jack is too easy while the Puzzle mechanics are way too simple. I can only play for about 30 minutes per session before losing interest and play something else.\n\nMy main complaint about this game is the characters. They're boring compared to the main series. Komaru is just as bad as Makoto and Hajime, all three are the stereotypical \"talentless\" and \"ordinary\" high school students that somehow manages to overcome impossible odds simply because they're the main protagonists. Supporting characters are even worst as they brought back two of the most annoying characters from the main series, Toko and Nagito, probably due to fan requests. Even worst, characters who survived aren't even likable.  \n\nAnother thing that I really dislike about this spin-off is that the game highly discourages players from retrying. The challenges aren't too hard to solve but it does require some precision. One simple f**kup and you're boned. Retrying lowers your overall score and it will prevent you from getting special items from getting a perfect score.\n\nWhile I may sound like I don't recommend this game, I actually do recommend fans to at least try it out. I mean, it successfully sated my appetite for the upcoming sequel.", "timestamp_created": 1499660353, "timestamp_updated": 1500877292, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0,

boring to fight (I think that the mouse makes this game even easier, but that may be just me) .\n\nSo, overall I'd say that I [b]recommend this game only to lovers of the danganronpa's

1499602566}, "language": "english", "review": "I went into this expecting a lot of Danganronpa plot mated with a very bad FPS. This was not so accurate. It's not exactly a twitch game. I'd call it a puzzle fighter. Sorta. There was one big-ish fight scene in particular where waves of Monokumas come at you. You can try to calmly peg each one in the eye to save ammo. OR... notice the one with the siren standing in front of the parked car, fire a Dance bullet to get him attracting all the enemies to him, and starting the car with one of your infinite Move bullets to mow them all down. Or just panic, hit C and turn it into a timed brawler as you mercilessly beat down your enemies with Genocide Jack. The game does not punish you for this. It only grades performance in solving specific arcade rooms throughout the game... and finding the one type of collectible that isn't on the ground. Then it's holding a skill hostage... but isn't asking you for 100% You can use a retry or two (or save scum) without costing yourself the prize.\n\nThat said, the boss fights are actually pretty brutal, and that's coming from a souls veteran. It's the typical \"avoid being hit and take advantage of vulnerability\" style of plinking away at a large killer robot. One particularly nasty one, the obvious solution was \"wait for it to get its axe lodged in a puddle, and hit another enemy in the water with an electric bullet.\" But not getting hit by the axe was Very Hard. But I was also forgetting... Jack doesn't take damage. I could switch protagonists for a few seconds as a shield... and worry about refilling her meter later. Also, some of the downed enemies were dropping health. It was more challenging than I expected, but that was because I didn't use my options well in the beginning.\n\nSo, look at MOST of the combat in the game as a problem to solve for minimum ammo cost. And switch up your tactics frequently.\n\nNow, the plot... the worldbuilding is solid. I always felt the first two games had glossed over WAY too much about the world, and this has you in it. Thoroughly. It has great connections with the plot of the other two games... series fans will be pleased, especially by the final anime bit. What got me to jump into this was seeing a friend streaming it and seeing Toko, my least favorite character... having a moment of minor growth. I was impressed, and had to see where they were going with it. Glad I did.\n\nMostly. The antagonists have some very dark backstories that might warrant a trigger warning.

It's less of a copy of the first game and, well, more of a spinoff.\n;It's literally a third-person shooter, that's how much of a spinoff it is. And I actually like it for that. It changes things up a bit, and though it might be seen as generic or otherwise noninteresting game, it's presented in a more fun and interesting way.\n;Bonus scenes feel worth getting, especially since you get to see relationships blossom between protagonists, and especially the one between Toko and Byakuya.\n;There's a scene that's mandatory that pokes fun at oversexualisation, even though it's been put in there for a completely dark reason.\n;The first thing I was accustomed to, however, was the soundtrack. In the other two games, I maybe liked one or two tracks. In this game, I'm a huge fan of the soundtrack and the overall theme of the sound design.\n;Though my laptop far from meets the game's requirements, the options to turn off shadows and graphical options makes the game a breeze to run.\n;All of the main dialogue has voice acting. The voice acting is pretty good, too.\n;I love Genocide Jack mode. The better part about it is that Genocide Jack also has her own animations for everything, like climbing objects and walking through doors etc.\n;It's short, if you think 17 hours is a short playthrough the first time 'round. It only took me 10-ish more hours after that to 100% the game. Thing is, I found collectible finding fun because of the bonus scenes, and the (it's weird when I say it about this game) lore involved from them.\n;Though people have complained about the game being 'repetitive', I do not think it's so much the case. It might be repetitive on the surface level - you're just shooting bears with a code gun - but it constantly introduces new mechanics, as well as puts old mechanics into play.\n;In that respect, a lot of the time the Monokuma Arcades are more like puzzles, and I did like them for that. Other than the Arcades, though, there are plenty of other puzzles too. Like the whole \"Challenge\" things you usually need to complete to get past a certain objective.\n;Executions, honestly, were meh. Though, replaying to find collectibles and grind for coins, I did enjoy rewatching them even after skipping all the text, so there was something I liked about them.\n[strike];Nagito-bae is in this ooooonnnnneeeee[/strike]\n;Though people claim this doesn't connect the two games on it's own...it does, as is shown by the ending, but I'm not going to go into why that is. It makes sense when you play 2, trust me. But, the story as a whole isn't completely connected, no. And it doesn't have to be to make it that much more enjoyable, it's still got excellent writing and soundtrack and even some scenes being FMV's drawn in anime style.\n;The ending scene choice made my spine tingle throughout, and my gut wrench as shit got worse -- I questioned my sense of hope and genuinely freaked out the more and more things got out of hand. The choice was presented so many times that doing either felt wrong, but I stuck with what I felt in my gut anyways. It was an amazing moment, one I find really difficult to describe. Going back and making the other choice makes my spine tingle now just thinking about it, it's genuinely that good of a scene.\n\nI am definitely going to play this later, to get A's on all difficulties and to unlock all the gallery items. I enjoyed the story and gameplay that much that I don't mind doing that again in the nearby future, effectively giving me a [i]true 100%[/i] past just achievements and what the game recognises as a 100% save file. I'd definitely recommend it to those who just want a laid-back story experience, and to those more familiar with TPS's that don't mind a little absurdity. And much like the other games, it's got a healthy sense of humor with a good mix of happy and sad moments. I definitely recommend this, and all of the other Danganronpa games. I cannot wait for V3, and it's rare I'm actually hyped for games, but this series is one I've loved throughout so far.", "timestamp_created": 1499400224, "timestamp_updated": 1499460367, "voted_up":

where to start with this one. I absolutely loved everything about the game. It was a beautiful roller coaster of emotions. After first starting the game, I couldn't stop playing it, not until I got to the end (Now that I've finished the game, I hope to grind out the last few achievements). Another great thing about the game is the soundtrack. They did so well on the soundtrack for this game, and in fact, that's probably another reason why I got so stuck on this game. It was all too addicting.\n\nDEFINITELY do not play this game until you've finished the first two games. This game just gives away too many spoilers if you don't know DGR's story.\n\nHowever, if you're sensitive to traumatic events/triggers, etc., then I highly recommend being careful when playing this game. I was fine, but I'm sure some of the scenes will trigger some players. \n\nUhhh other than that, this game was a super fun play! Have fun playing if you do decide to purchase this.

In my opinion, danganronpa 1 and 2 are 10/10, my favourite games ever. This I would say is a 9.999/10. Pretty much perfect in everyway in my opinion. There are some bad things though but only minor stuff as explained in the cons section.\n\nThis game is a fantastic addition to the danganronpa series. It carrys across the danganronpa art style perfectly with a conbination of 2d sprites and 3d models with the crazy colour pallet of the other games. The monokumas convey both the comedy of a bear running at you, to the horror of them trying to claw you apart.  The music as per the other games is fantastic and suits the atmosphere perfectly. The gameplay is pretty fun, solving puzzles in arcade rooms, and fighting through lots of monokumas and searching for lots of secrets. The cutscenes are amazing as well. There are multiple types of cutscene as well. There are ones where the characters move and text comes up like in the other games, pre-rendered ones which convey facial expressions and action with the 3d models (for some reason they are blurry, probably from porting from handheld), the classic 2.5d over the top cutscenes from the other games and then my personal favourite, full on anime scenes. The anime scenes always appear at the best of moments and are very detailed. Pretty much every one of those cutscenes managed to make me cry. There are lots of collectables to hunt for if you so choose as well, all of which teach more of the story  of the world. \n\nThis game is so connected to the other danganronpa games, I would avoid playing until you have played atleast danganronpa trigger happy havoc. Dont play this without that, preferably play both games before this. For a fan of the series, this game is a must get as it fills in so much of the plot between the first 2 games. The ending as well... The ending is perfect. Can't say why without spoiling.\n\nTldr; get this game if you have played the other 2 games or atleast the first game, dont get until you have done that though. 9.999/10", "timestamp_created":

announced it since I didn't have a PS Vita to play this game on. After playing and finishing the game I can definitely say that it was worth the wait and although I don't like this game as much as Danganronpa 1 and 2 it is a solid game with the same amazing storytelling and characters that make the Danganronpa series so amazing. Also if you are thinking of trying this game I suggest you play both the 1st and 2nd games before playing this one.\n\nFirst the story, characters, and setting are all very unique compared to 1 and 2. The story is very well written and helps clear up things that happened between the first and second games. The characters are amazing as well with some of them being related to characters from the first game although some of the characters some felt weaker than others and I overall like them less than characters from Danganronpa 1 and 2. The setting looks amazing and I think Towa City really pops out in a way that makes it feel unique compared to both Hope's Peak and Jabberwock Island.\n\nNext I will talk about the thing that makes Another Episode so unique compared to 1 and 2 the gameplay. The gameplay is way different because this game is a third person shooter as opposed to the mystery gameplay of 1 and 2. This was the first time Danganronpa has had a way different playstyle and it works really well. There are two playable characters in this game each with their own unique abilities Komaru Naegi and Toko Fukawa. Komaru Naegi wields a Megaphone that can destroy Monokumas. This megaphone has 8 different types of Truth Bullets that each do different functions which I will not spoil. Toko's gameplay is hack and slash gameplay with different types of combos you can pull off although you only play as Toko when you have her battery meter up. The only problem I have with the gameplay is that the camera can be a little awkward at times.\n\nFinally Masafumi Takada does a great job composing a soundtrack that is both sinister and very fitting to the very dark tone that the game brings to the table.\n\nBefore I finish this review I must warn people that this game covers some very dark subjects that are not for the faint of heart.\n\nOverall, Danganronpa Another Episode combines the amazing writing and storytelling that the series is known for and the unique gameplay that works amazingly into a neat package that felt sastifying to play and complete.

Danganronpa 2: Goodbye despair would also be recommended to be played before this also as it contains a lot of information about a specific character called [spoiler] Servant [/spoiler] [/b]\n\n[h1] Story, Gameplay & Port  [/h1]\n\nDanganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls is a Spin-off sequel to the first game Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc and is a Pre-sequel to Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair so the events of the game take place after the first but before the events of Goodbye Despair. \n\nI can't say much about the story without spoiling it but i can talk about the start which is basically the \"Tutorial\" The story takes place in a location called Towa City. It begins with Komaru Naegi escaping her imprisonment after being attacked by Monokuma's and saved by [spoiler] Byakuya Togami [/spoiler] only to be captured again later by a group of 5 childern called Warriors Of Hope then is released into Towa again only to meet [spoiler] Toko Fukawa [/spoiler] be hunted by the Childern with Monokuma's as a game whilst you try to escape Towa City.\n\nThe gameplay is unlike the first two in the series as it has been changed into a 3rd Person Shooter hence it's called a spin-off. The gameplay uses the term \"Truth Bullets\" from the other games a form of the different bullets which can be used to defeat Monokuma's in different ways or combonations. There is a total of 8 Truth Bullet Types which can be upgraded. 1 bullet type is called Detect which is used sort of like a \"Black Light\" to help solve puzzles rather than combat.\n\nThroughout the game more types of Monokuma's will appear and have different abilities from each other and are harder to defeat but can be used to kill other types easier e.g Bomber Monokuma explodes on death which can kill others. \n\nToko's abilitys are different as instead of using a gun she switches to her other personality, [spoiler] Genocide Jack [/spoiler] to fight and she has fast movement, high damage and is invincible which can be uprgaded although she has a limit on how long she can fight and it is very short and should be used only when overun or close to death. As she has a super ability to wipe out large amounts of Monokuma's around her with different animations playing when used.\n\nOther upgrades for each character can be found hidden around each chapter which will make the game easier in a long run such as Faster Aiming, More Drops and More HP or Longer time with Genocide Jack. Only a limited amount of these uprgades can be used at once depending on your Level but i was able to use all of them at once.\n\nEach puzzle is made very well and always makes you use your head to figure it out. These puzzles are normal puzzles given to you or are these arcade machine puzzles which must be beaten to continue. You're rewarded for beating the puzzles but you can just fight through each of them but wont be rewarded. [spoiler] I don't know if im dumb but damn,\n that birthday puzzle passcode made me feel really stupid for how long it took as i didn't want hints. [/spoiler]\n\nThe port is very well made and it can be shown that Spike Chunsoft make there ports very well. i never experienced any FPS drops or stuttering when playing and the gameplay felt smooth and the combat was very easy to use with mouse and keyboard. You're unable to rebind the keys but the controls are very easy to understand and use. I've completed the game fully and i've only crashed once during my time playing which was caused when using Toko's special ability during [spoiler] The fight againist Kotoko Utsugi after her \"Motovation\" Minigame.... heh..... Cumaru Naegi [/spoiler] \n\n\n[h1] Characters & Voice Acting  (Minor Character Spoilers) [/h1]\n\nAs usual from each of the games in the series each character is unique in there own way and throughout the story each of the characters develop as you get to know them more.\n\nThe main character Komaru starts by being a basic ordinary character that is constantly scared of everything that is happening. [spoiler] She then begins to grow stronger and face fear head on throughout the game as Toko and her become friends. This is the same for Toko from the first game as she appears more strong compared to Trigger Happy Havoc  [/spoiler]\n\nEach of the children from the warriors of hope have their own personality and talents. It's hard to explain each their talents as it affects the backstory and the reason why they're doing what they're doing to Towa City. Although i will explain one thing from my favourite of the 5. [spoiler] Kotoko Utsugi is by far the funniest character out of the group. She is very fun to listen to and every scene she appeared in had me laughing when she spoke. But when learning her backstory during the very Disturbing mini game about the words \"Gentle\" her acting talent makes the whole thing even more creepy and changes the view of the character on its head. She is also the games \"Fanservice\" character as most of her jokes are sexual but her character is very well made and why i think her and Komaru are the best Characters and Voice actors in the game. [/spoiler]\n\nI played and completed the game in English Voice overs and each of the scenes was very well acted. I started my 2nd playthrough in Japanese and the voice acting is still amazing even better than English although i felt as if one character called [spoiler] Kurokuma didn't get enough time even though he was funny and had an excellent VA.\t[/spoiler]\n\n[h1] Animations + Sounds + Music [/h1]\n\nAnimations are very well made and each character has a cool design and each expression is very well made. Each cutscene is very well made and flows in and out of the game play very smoothly so you would expect a cutscene to appear. Although you may expect a cutscene to appear you are unlikely to know what type of cutscene it would be. As it could either be a normal scene with characters just talking or it could be a goofy looking animation from the previous games with the style of the excutions being used or a 3D animation or it could even been an animation from the Anime itself in full 2D style.\n\nEach sound from each bullet and enemy feel very well suited for the anime style and it is appropiate throughout the whole game. A good example would be knowing an enemy is near by hearing the squeaky foot steps in the distance. \n\nLastly is the music. As always very well made and is always made appropriate for each scene. E.g Intense Music used for a boss fight and Goofy Music when Warriors of hope were on the screen. they do reuse music from older games during certain places but that is fine as they are very well made and suit the game perfectly. My favourite has to be the Monokuma Kid song which is played during fighting Beast Monokuma's just because of how out of place it is and it is also used as a weapon.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJy_MKqjheM\n\n[h1] Verdict [/h1]\n\nIt may be different from the other games in Gameplay but that doesn't change the fact of the amazing Story of Danganronpa and the whole Hope Vs. Despair aspect as it nails it perfectly in this game as i feel this is more creepy than the other games, but that may only be because of the full story and how it goes.\n\nI'd say this game is worth the full price of \u00a323 or whatever in your currency and i feel Spike Chunsoft deserve all the money they get for this game. I would say this game is worthy of being priced at Triple A price at \u00a340 just because of how well made it is. so feel like its a steal for being considerbly cheap compared to other games.\n\nIf you've played the other Danganronpa Games, this game is worth all of your money and wouldn't regret it one bit as it gives you more insight in the universe. This game is a masterpeice with little flaws. 9.5/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1499028648, "timestamp_updated": 1499028648, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528080", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33150855": {"recommendationid": "33150855", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125973178", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 812, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503370951}, "language": "english", "review": "I first played this game because I was I had played the other two Danganronpa games on Steam and my friend let me borrow his Vita to play this game.

third game in this series and right in between DR1 & 2, Another Episode takes the game in a different tangent from a visual novel/whodunnit to a 3rd person shooter. And surprisingly, it transitions quite well. Spike Chunsoft tried something new and for their first time in the shooter genre with an experimental game like this? It's quite entertaining. However, there are a couple things that make gameplay a tiny pain.\n\nI will give a slight spoiler warning for the franchise, as this does spoil a bit of what happens after Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc and hints to stuff mentioned in Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair. If you haven't played those already, or have not seen a playthrough of either, please check them out before you dive into this game. It'll make the experience much better,\n\n[h1]Plot Overview: Spoiler-Free Version[/h1]\n\nThis game takes you to a different kind of killing game: one that might be more sadistic than the one at Hope's Peak and at Jabberwock Island. This game has you take control of Komaru Naegi, sister of Makoto fron DR1. After being trapped in an apartment for who knows how long, she's finally freed\u2014by a Monokuma assault. And they're out for blood. However, Future Foundation is also there, with Byakuya Togami leading the defense. After handing Komaru a hacking gun, your main weapon, she flees and finds out the cruel reality of what's going on: 5 children calling themselves \"The Warriors of Hope\" are slaughtering every single adult in the city Komaru was help captive in, and making it into a children's paradise of sorts. After getting captured by those five children and having an explosive wristband attached, she's thrown back into the city as part of a \"hunting game.\" However, along the way, she runs into Toko Fukawa/Genocide Jack who's also there for her own reasons. The two reluctantly team up and it's up to you to lead them out of the city and find out what exactly is going on here.\nThe storytelling in this game is just as great as it was for its other games in the series, with strong character development, moments of despair that may leave you screaming, with some humor dabbled in.\nOh. And expect a lot of 4th-wall breaking, lenny moments, and the such.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nGameplay is simple. Komaru has a hacking gun which can be used to shut down the opposing Monokuma army. You have access to 8 different kinds of \"truth bullets,\" which you will acquire as the game progresses. Break is your basic fire, gotten right from the get-go. Move activates objects around the world, be it slot machines for pickups, cars to crush Monokumas, or just to remind you where you need to go. Dance functions as your stun. Monokumas hit by it will dance in place, allowing you to line up a shot. Detect has no combat function, though it is useful for some puzzles. Knockback is self-explanatory, knocking back Monokumas in a certain range, disarming a few and allowing you to flee for some cover. Paralyze one-shots weak Monokumas in a radius, or ones in the same puddle of water\u2014even yourself. Watch your step. Burn is basically a rapid-fire Break, useful for faster units. Link does no damage, but allows you to temporarily take control of a Monokuma, which may be useful for solving puzzles or moving a threat out of the way. Pr taking out a threat without getting dirty yourself. These 8 ammo types will help you defend yourself as you roam through Towa city for your life.\nIf that's too difficult, you have the option to switch to Genocide Jack. She's invincible and melee-only, making her useful if you're overwhelmed by a horde of Monokumas. Don't get too crazy with those scissors though, as she has a time limit of how long she can be used before you switch back to Komaru. Her limit can be refilled with batteries scattered around, so don't be afraid to fall back on your favorite serial killer.\nIf you're looking to get stronger, skills can be scattered about the area which makes gameplay less of a sluggish combat simulator. Which leads to my one complaint: combat early on is s l o w. Unless you swap to Genocide Jack, you only have Break as your method of killing Monokumas, which makes it a bit of a pain, especially when overwhelmed. Once you get Burn, combat becomes much more fast and fun. But given how this is also a puzzle game, the decision to make combat slow was understandable.\n\n[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]\n\nRight until the very end, Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls is a game that's still worthy of the DR franchise. Leading right into the Danganronpa 3 animated series, this game opens up the world a tad more with the same great storytelling that'll keep you going.\nOverall, I would recommend this game to avid fans of the franchise who want more after playing DR1 & 2, and cannot wait until V3's release to play more. Well done, Spike Chunsoft.", "timestamp_created": 1498969117, "timestamp_updated": 1500818596, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33113837": {"recommendationid": "33113837", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117754475", "num_games_owned": 374, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1514, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498966902}, "language": "english", "review": "Well, first of all, the port is amazing, because my potato does solid 60 fps almost everywhere.\nThe game itself gave as much as I expected of another Danganronpa game.

In this one, it more like a 3rd Person shooter with Komaru Naegi wielding as a character with addition to Genocide Jack's combat mechanic similar to those Hack n Slash games (e.g. Senran Kagura ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) ). Since I've said that it's similar to a 3rd Person Shooter, don't dig much on that since it emphasize more on the puzzles and the interaction on how you will use the gun and the special bullets in the game. Note that this happened between Danganronpa 1 and 2 which means some characters in the game are not revealed or have an alias. So I do suggest you play Danganronpa 1 and 2 first for better experience and knowledge before playing this. \n\n\nPROS\n+Refreshing gameplay mechanics\n+Great story line for a spin-off \n+Great art style for the theme \n+Fair Price, better if you have the other 2 Danganronpa for a greater discount\n\nCONS\n-Not as despair inducing as the previous 2(it might be just me and it's not really much of a con)\n-Though the gameplay mechanic is refreshing, It's quite easy even on difficult mode\n-Some bugs(using ALT TAB on Fullscreen will put me to Window mode, but that might just be me again)\n-Not a challege in the problem solving department. \n\nSo do I personally recommend it?

In fact, I'd say that this port is good enough that the game's been [i]improved[/i] by it; all the complaints of how awkward it is playing a third-person shooter on a Vita no longer apply when you have a PS4 pad or mouse at your disposal.\n\nThough [i]Another Episode[/i] is billed as an action/puzzle game hybrid, the game's meat is still the story, presented in the fashion of a visual novel. I enjoyed the story a lot; it's a satisfying bridge between the stories of Danganronpa 1 and 2, and builds upon the universe in a way that prior games did not. The gameplay was decent, a passable vehicle to carry you from one place of interest to another, but it definitely comes second to the writing in terms of player impact. To the developers' credit, I never got bored, or frustrated; the gameplay was firmly \"OK\", shooting and puzzle-solving and all.\n\nI'd definitely recommend DRAE to fans of Danganronpa [i]who have played both 1 and 2[/i]; this game has major spoilers for both, so I wouldn't recommend it as an introduction to the series.

If you are buying this game for something like the other two Danganronpa games, then this is NOT a game for you. (waiting for Danganronpa v3 is not a bad option as it comes up very soon :^) )\n\nNow for the reveiw, I clocked in a good 10 hours into this game and finally finished it. After finally finishing it, It was a experince I personally found great for a spin off Danganronpa game. It may not have the classic format like the rest of the Danganronpa games but It brings to the table a great wonderful new experince for the series. The combat is at most average and will (I promise) get a bit repetitive. The most charming aspect I find in the combat is the certain areas that bring a sort of challenge to complete the room but is not forced onto you as you can easily just defeat the enemies to get past the room. \n\nNow, I know about everyone is saying well if the gameplay is going to get boring and not going to bring anything good for me in terms of gameplay then I shouldn't buy it. You are 100% correct and I would do that as well but the reason why I bought the game and probably why most people bought it was for the story. This aspect single handedly saved the game for me. I personally am a fan of the story and the Danganronpa world as it brings something wonderful to think and really focuses on what is good and evil. By the near end of the game, you will start to question a lot of what is the right thing to do. The game does bring life to both protagonists (yes I see Toko as a protagonist) as it has them interact and talk to each other through the game. I like that they do this very well in terms of making the two leads develop and grow from the current situation that has them survive in this terrible incident. I felt that this game was giving something that most games hasn't done in a while which was giving a chance for the player to peer into the situation and care about what the main characters are feeling because this situation is overall scary for the both of them. (many times Komaru explains this to Toko) This game does bring in lore before the second game but does happens after the first.\n\nI hope you will give this game a chance as it is fun if you're looking for another piece of Danganronpa and looking for a more action paced game from the others in the series. \n\nThank you for taking time to read this.", "timestamp_created": 1498837147, "timestamp_updated": 1498837147, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33032866": {"recommendationid": "33032866", "author": {"steamid": "76561198204038572", "num_games_owned": 189, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 933, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498819288}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5e0c\u671b\u662f\u4f1a\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u554a\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1498819419, "timestamp_updated": 1498819419, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519313", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33030843": {"recommendationid": "33030843", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097769831", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1060, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498815426}, "language": "english", "review": "Game Completion Review :\n\nStory ?

Here you must master all the different Ammo-Types to accomplish that goal and it's a huge part of the game. There are plenty of those rooms, and everyone is unique and fun.\n\nSo thats for the Gameplay. surprisingly good for this kind of series. \n\nAs for the Story, you got your typical Danganronpa-Charme with the Dialogue. You know, what I mean ;) It hasn't lost anything of it.\nBut i have to say, the Story is somewhat lacking, in comparison to the Main Titles, but this is just a in-between story, so for that it is fine, just don't have too high of expectations, as for the Main Games.\n\nSo without spoiling to much, the Story is about the War between Adults and Children in Towa City. The Children start attacking the Adults with the help of dozens of Monokuma-Bots and you get always confronted with some Child-Parent problems and some extremes.\nAlso I have to say, Spike Chunsoft really tested the borders here with killing Children and Child Abusing and that kind of stuff. But thats why i respect that company for just doing their thing. They even make fn of it, as they are very well aware. I quote one sentence from the game: \"This isn't child abuse, it's pretty much the opposite, so it's allowed to put in a Video Game!\" \nDamn I love this series :D\n\nOne last thing for the Story, you are playing Makoto Naegis Sister, Komaru Naegi and you are accompanied by Toko Fukawa from the First Danganronpa, the whole game.\nThe relationship between those two and how they develop throughout the game is simply said, great. You learn a lot about Toko and the development of Komaru is just awesome, even her character Model changes, after her Personality changes in game, which is just a super detail i recognized. Spike Chunsoft always puts a lot of love in their games, and this game is no different.\n\nSo, if you are a Danganronpa-Fan, just buy this game. If you are new to the series, i recommend hugely, play the first two games, especially the first one, or else, you won't know the background story and some important characters and many of the references to other Danganronpa games, mostly from the first one.\n\nI hope i could help you with my review!", "timestamp_created": 1498762568, "timestamp_updated": 1498762568, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33004872": {"recommendationid": "33004872", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067861991", "num_games_owned": 214, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498761728}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "A nice game from a must-play series \n", "timestamp_created": 1498762425, "timestamp_updated": 1498762425, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33003175": {"recommendationid": "33003175", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129797834", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 872, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498759846}, "language": "schinese", "review": "14\u4e2a\u5c0f\u65f6\u4e86\uff0c\u7ec8\u4e8e\u6253\u901a\u4e86\u6e38\u620f\u5e76\u4e14\u770b\u5b8c\u4e86\u6700\u540e\u7684\u5c0f\u8bf4\uff0c\u600e\u4e48\u8bf4\u5462\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u6b3e\u5f88\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\u7c89\u4e1d\u5411\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u56e0\u4e3apc\u952e\u9f20\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u7531\u897f\u5357\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u4e0d\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u5f88\u6709\u610f\u601d\uff0c\u5f88\u660e\u663e\u7684\u5f39\u4e38\u8bba\u7834\u7684\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u5f88\u7edd\u671b\uff0c\u561b\uff0c\u603b\u7684\u6765\u8bf4\u6e38\u620f\u5f88\u68d2\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1498760031, "timestamp_updated": 1498760031, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33002815": {"recommendationid": "33002815", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035792915", "num_games_owned": 866, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1030, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498759101}, "language": "english", "review": "Note: I've finished the game \n\nSo as others are recommending, PLAY 1 AND 2 FIRST.

So to put it out of the way\n\n1) People unfamiliar with Danganronpa games, don't buy it. Or buy a bundle with all 3 games.\n2) People who played Danganronpa games: if you like those games and want to know more about lore, charecters and whatnots, buy it.\n3) Hardcore fan? Absolutely must have for you.\n\nPlot:\nPlayer takes controll of Komaru Naegi (sister of Makoto) and fanfavorite Toko (aka Genosider Se). Another Episode takes place between 1 and 2 games, and follows events prior to second one. Without too much spoilers; the story itself is the strongest side of this game -- shouldn't come as a surprise. Nice twists, great addition to first game, likeble charecters, humor and drama... Danganronpa!\n\nGameplay:\nFor the majority of the game you will play as Komaru armed with hacking gun (looks like megaphone) and in her case game pretty much is a mediocre TPS: sure game tries to keep you entertained, tosses new enemies now and then and hacking gun have a variety of diffrent ammo -- 8 types to be precise,  each more effective against certan enemies (for example knockback will swat shields from hands of monokumas with said shields, dance will make monokumas dance -- but use it against siren one and every enemy in vicinity will gather around him etc). The second charecter is Toko Fukawa, you can switch to her and play as Genosider Se for a short periods (she doesn't have health instead it's battery... Think of her as your super mode), slice and dice Monokumas with signature sccisors, use extremely fun blood lust moves, take it back and relax for a while. Still gameplay is very weak, enemies are slow, fragile and come in small groups (on max difficulty I expereinced exactly zero challenge from them). So yeah a mediocre TPS with boring slasher tossed inbetween.\nOh right there are also chalenges and puzzles!  Again not a bad way to keep player entetained, does bring variety, and developers tried their best to make those puzzles and chalenges diffrent, but to be honest those puzzles and challenges will became a chore somewhere around third Chapter... They are easy... One or two may have an intresting concept and fun solution, but majority is kindergarten level. Still, guss it wouldn't be Danganronpa without a little mind excercise now and then.\n\nOST and sound: As always Danganronpa provides a good music and decent sound design. English dub still sucks -- switch to Japanese as soon as you can (to do that press C on keyboard\\Y on controller on difficulty chose screen). Overall not much to say.\n\nIn conclusion. It is a game for fans of serie, don't buy unless you played previous games, buy if you are a fan or simply a person who is intrested in this universe. Sure gampelay is not the strongest side of game, but story, charecters and mystery will sure keep you on your toes till the end.", "timestamp_created": 1498700476, "timestamp_updated": 1498700504,

came true! I can play for Komaru, as I wanted since Danganronpa THH when she appeared in the cutscene.\nKhem... Besides the most adorable game character of 2017:\n\nI passed through first chapter, and it is quite enjoyable. Not the best graphics, however, this is not what you are supposed to look at in Danganronpa games. Get ready for tutorials\n...\n...\nEndless tutorials. However, things are kind of obvious. \n\nLove the weapon system, upgrades and stuff. Really feels like applying some strategy and paying a lot of attention on surroundings. Small challanges are fun and... Hey, don't worry about the puzzle apect - there is still some in this game (I hope there will be more to it in future).\n\nDid not expect to play for Genocider Jack/Shou. Did not use her much, however this is nice to be sure there is always someone to help you with some difficult stages.\n\nAs always - best soundtrack.\n\nAnd, sure, the executions! So glad that those stylized cutscenes back from Danganronpa 1 and 2. \n\nAnyway, I feel like completing game again after I finish it (you know all collectibles and perfect scores)\n\nFor now it is a top score.\n...\nDon't think it's gonna get boring anyway *Monaka interferes*", "timestamp_created": 1498631806, "timestamp_updated": 1498631806, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.619923", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32914960": {"recommendationid": "32914960", "author": {"steamid": "76561198285550793", "num_games_owned": 195, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 836, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501151670}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u719f\u6089\u7684\u97f3\u4e50\uff0c\u719f\u6089\u7684\u9ed1\u767d\u718a\uff0c\u719f\u6089\u7684\u5341\u795e\u5927\u4f6c\u5f00\u5c40\uff0c\u7b97\u4e86\u6211\u7f16\u4e0d\u4e0b\u53bb\u4e86\u3002\n\n\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u73a9\u8fc7\u524d\u4e24\u4f5c\uff0c[spoiler] \u90a3\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u4e0d\u8d81\u70ed\u5165\u4e00\u53d1\u5462\t[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1498631034, "timestamp_updated": 1498631034, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519313", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32911953": {"recommendationid": "32911953", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025143866", "num_games_owned": 568, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 1022, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499674071}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5982\u679c\u662f FPS TPS \u8001\u73a9\u5bb6\n1\u3001\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u5b9a\u8981\u8c03\u6210\u201c\u624b\u52a8\u201d\n2\u3001\u6280\u80fd\"\u81ea\u52a8\u9501\u5b9a\"\u4e00\u5b9a\u4e0d\u8981\u7528\n\n\u4e4b\u540e\u5c31\u662f\u7b80\u5355\u6b63\u5e38\u7684\u5c04\u51fb\u6e38\u620f\u4e86\u3002\n\n\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7cfb\u5217\u7b2c\u4e09\u4f5c\uff0c\u6f14\u51fa\u4f9d\u7136\u5f88\u8d5e\u3002\u503c\u5f97\u4e00\u73a9\uff0c\u63a8\u8350\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1498626221, "timestamp_updated": 1499674348, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32911245": {"recommendationid": "32911245", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996738758", "num_games_owned": 321, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1981, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498972396}, "language": "english", "review": "An incredibly solid third-person shooter / puzzle game filled to the brim with all the things I love about Danganronpa and more.

I'm in about the middle of the first chapter. \n\nI've been waiting months for the PC port of this game and bought it a few minutes after it was released on steam. \n\nFirst off, as many other reviews recommend, play Danganronpa 1 & 2 first. They contain the necessary backstory you need in order to understand this game, and are an absolute blast to play. \n\nI was surprised to see they went with Toko as a second main character. However so far she's actually turning out to be interesting and I can already see a little character development, hopefully that will continue later into the game and be more prevailant. There's ties to other characters introduced in earlier Danganronpa games, which is an aspect I enjoy a lot, as it helps tie things together better. \n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n-Character designs live up to the rest of the series in being unique, interesting and visually pleasing \n-Story rich (text heavy) game with near full voice acting, something largely missing from the first two games \n-many wonderful cutscenes done in the styles of 3D, the style from the anime, and the styles from the cutscenes in the first two games \n-Great sound track that uses songs from the first two games and some new ones of its own \n-Shooting monokumas is awfully satisfying \n-Builds upon/provides another perspective into the danganronpa storyline \n-English voice acting (so far) is enjoyable, with the exception of some of the characters (the main five kids, one of them in particular is unbearably bad) \n\n[h1]Neutral[/h1]\n-There's no keybinding options. Personally I don't think that's a huge problem because the controls aren't very weird as is (typical WASD movment, use mouse to shoot, etc) but to people who wish to play differently this could pose a problem. \n-Options to change voice acting to japanese are hidden rather well and need to be adjusted at the beginning of the game, before you start. \n\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[b]-3D cutscenes are, honestly, really not so great to look at.[/b] Characters move awkwardly and the animation isn't so great. Its obvious Spike Chunsoft's strong point is in 2D animation, and thankfully there are some 2D animated cutscenes. I just wish they were all in 2D. The 3D graphics in-game as you play, however, are fine. \n-Graphics during cutscenes can be a little buggy, and work better when playing in Windowed mode, which is a bit of a drag. \n-The pathfinding on the monokuma enemies is a little off. They tend to do this weird turn around thing when coming at you from around a corner. \n-The game introduces mechanics but it never really feels like I get to use them much. \n-You can't save whenever you want, you have to find specific save spots in game. That's a pretty big hinderance considering these save spots are usually only before and after going through a specific area (like a hotel you need to go through, for instance) and not in the middle. \n-There's not anything especially remarkable about the gameplay thus far. I'll give it to Spike Chunsoft for trying something knew and doing pretty alright with it but I ultimately prefer the gameplay of the other two games. I'm really mainly just here for the story. \n\nIf you're as interested in the story line, or have played the other two danganronpa games and enjoyed them, I would recommend this game. Even if you're not great at FPS I wouldn't let that sway you away from purchasing it, as its not exactly very hard. (perhaps it will get harder in the future, but so far its been a breeze.) Its very story-heavy. \nIf you're just now being introduced to the stories, again, play the first two first. The story is full of twists and turns and interesting characters, and wonderful mysteries to solve.

Now, don't get me wrong; it's still a fine game, but where it stands in the Danganronpa series, I can't call it anything but a failure.\n\nWhy, and why am I still recommending it? Well, the answer to that involves the plot, which spoils Danganronpa 1, and to a lesser extent DR2, so I will put those details at the bottom to hide them below the fold. First, let's talk gameplay; the good stuff, the stuff that makes me still recommend it.\n\nThe port is lovely, for starters. Coming up from the vita, the crisp, stylish anime art style benefits it. Second, the game itself isn't bad. While the pacing is dashed often by unending dialogue segments, the core gameplay is surprisingly strong. It is a simplified take on RE4 or Dead Space, with over the shoulder stationary aiming at hordes of evil Monokuma robots. Nail one in the weakpoint, and your next shot is charged up. Couple this with some alright enemy and shot-type variety and you have a solid foundation. The boss fights, too are actually really good, all giant robots piloted by your enemies: The Warriors of Hope. Easily the best boss battles in this subgenre since Dead Space 1. Some of the middle ones are a bit dull but in general they have fun gimmicks and make use of the limitations of the RE4 style really well without relying on RE4-style QTEs. In fact, the main reason I bought this again after clearing it on Vita was to relive a couple of those boss fights.\n\nThere is not much challenge, though. Your resources are plentiful and the enemies aren't much trouble to handle if you're good. In addition, you have a separate meter for your partner, the inimitable Toko from Danganronpa 1, who is literally invincible and summoning her turns it into a simple hack and slash tinged with her own unique madness. If you do not know why Toko is invincible or how nutty she is, you ought to play Danganronpa 1.\n\nThe game's pacing stays solid throughout, even if the psychedelic visuals native to the franchise are pretty frontloaded and drop off quick. Breaking up the flow are regular puzzle rooms, where you are meant to hack the enemy robots and use their behavioral quirks to clear the room without being seen, with a modest reward and a slightly greater reward of not having to fight the enemies within. There are a few clever puzzles of a more traditional sense, too. This is no Metal Gear game where the last act may as well be one continuous cutscene and swimming minigame. For all the talking, DR:UDG still expects you to play the game too.\n\nSo what's my problem with Ultra Despair Girls? It's the plot. It's a monumental failure on two levels, as a story and as a Danganronpa followup.\n\nWhere it sits in the DR franchise, UDG is Spike's first attempt to explain what was purposefully left a mystery in Danganronpa 1 (And despite Danganronpa 2 watering down a lot of 1's impact, it still did not touch what UDG is based in.). UDG is our first look at the despair-controlled world posited by the villain of Danganronpa 1. And UDG fails utterly at depicting that, instead depicting an untouched by despair city overrun by what is essentially a robo-zombie apocalypse. What a disappointment, a complete failure of imagination! And, if not this, if not showing us what survivors of the despair cataclysm have to go through, what the hell point is there of having a shootan Danganronpa side game? This is why I call it an absolute failure. For all the good of the mechanics, it had one job. We were all hyped for that one job it took on, maybe not intentionally, but by virtue of what DR1 and 2 set up for it.*\n\nIn Spike's defense, the despair world posited by 1 was mostly interesting because it was not explained. Only just enough hints were dropped to give us the impression of what we needed to understand about it. Without a truly exceptional writer, there is no way to give such a world justice in video game form. Even after Danganronpa 2 almost reduced it to super-powered teens yelling hope and despair and throwing hope kamehamehas and despair genki damas back and forth, some of that mystery was still ready to be revealed here.\n\nInstead, the story revolves around some truly nauseating villains, the Warriors of Hope. You meet them in the game's unending prologue and each scene they are in seems even longer than that. A group of evil little kids who ramble on and on and on about the abuses they have suffered with such gleeful, repetitive, drawn out abandon that it feels like Yoko Taro did the writing for most of the scenes they show up in. The irony of cute giggling little kids laughing about the insane evil acts they are committing and had been commited against them wears thin so fast and the game doesn't figure that out until about the halfway mark. There's just nothing interesting about them beyond the Taro-esque shock value of them screaming their pathologies constantly and all they manage to do is deny this game any good villains to speak of. (I guess Nagito shows up for no reason and he kinda counts as a decent villain but once again his role is just \"whatever the author needs to get out of this plothole, with HOPE as the reason.\")\n\nTo make matters worse, for an entire city to be laid low by little kids, we need survivors who are dumb enough to be outsmarted by little kids, and boy those show up in spades. An entire arc of the game involves survivors yelling at each other over why they are/aren't fighting back enough, despite that their enemy is a merciless robot army and all the survivors have between them are fists and chair legs.  The story is an utter mess. And the ending tries to recall the crazy trap/gambit of the final showdown in DR1 and the pale imitation that was in DR2, but this one is just terrible. You just end up wishing everyone would take off their idiot hats and let us get on with the grand finale.\n\nThe only thing the story does well in the relationship between Toko and Komaru. It's a little silly, as DR writing tends to be, but the eventual warming up, nerdy chatter, and gal-pal banter between the two are the only fun you are going to have following this miserable story. Whenever the story cutscenes were just them, it was often a good time. Heck, it was downright heartwarming watching those two become friends after a while.\n\nIn the end, I still recommend DR:UDG. I hate the story, but the gameplay is pretty strong, even if it takes a bit of a backseat to the story. The shooting is fun, the Toko switch gameplay is fun even if the hack and slash she does is terrible and only acceptable because it is a 15 second long super move and not anything you are playing seriously. This leaves it in an awkward position, as it can only appeal to Danganronpa fans, who love that series story, and you absolutely should not play this if you have not played DR1 and 2. But I still think it is good enough as an RE4 clone to recommend on the strength of gameplay alone.\n\n*In fact, UDG is such a failure that the one-two punch of DR2 and UDG have completely killed any interest I have in the Danganronpa franchise. Which is a shame; neither are bad games in any sense beyond their story beats, but what the hell else do you come to Danganronpa for?

All i will say is that based on the previous 2 games, Danganronpa is one of my favorite series in terms of story and character design so i have no doubt that this game will live up to the high expectations i have for the series.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\ni will update this edit review upon completing the game to give a full in depth review.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1498610655, "timestamp_updated": 1498610655, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.654255", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32900289": {"recommendationid": "32900289", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053348394", "num_games_owned": 1665, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1539, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504646386}, "language": "english", "review": "I nominated this game for the \u201cSuspension of Disbelief\u201d award, because this game has significant more of these moments compared to other games I can think of.\n\nJust in case, there is subtitles; you just need to change voice to Japanese in difficulty screen and subtitles will be turned on.", "timestamp_created": 1498609551, "timestamp_updated": 1511486920, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.741264", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32900085": {"recommendationid": "32900085", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139882389", "num_games_owned": 258, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 190, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500894958}, "language": "thai", "review": "How do you save ? \nI don't know the botton to open option menu T w T \n\nIf I know it, then this game is good game :3", "timestamp_created": 1498609286, "timestamp_updated": 1498609286, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.598738", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32899942": {"recommendationid": "32899942", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098849136", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 393, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505066970}, "language": "english", "review": "Full review here with screenshots! \nhttps://frontseatgaming.com/2017/06/27/danganronpa-another-episode-ultra-despair-girls-should-you-buy-it/\n\nThis game is different from the two other titles, but I love it! \nPros:\n-Great story\n-Unique gameplay\n-Amazing cinematics that looks like anime episodes\n-Interesting characters\n-Yes, you can play it with the voices in Japanese or English!\n-Monokuma!\n\nCons:\n-Blurry graphics during some events\n-You can easily miss some game options (change language)", "timestamp_created": 1498609067, "timestamp_updated": 1498609114, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485599", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32899145": {"recommendationid": "32899145", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024058809", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498880780}, "language": "english", "review": "Make sure you've played the rest of the Danganronpa series before playing this.

Definitely NOT let down by this game. Only gotten 2ish hours in as of now but would definitely recommend the game to any fan of the series.\n*Update below, now that I've gotten a little bit more playtime into it*\n\nBefore considering to purchase the game, MAKE SURE YOU'VE COMPLETED DR 1 and 2.\n\nThe game features spoilers for those 2 games and also has context that will make absolutely no sense if you haven't played them. If you don't want to play DR1 (which I fully recommend playing, but there are those who don't want to), at least watch the 1st anime, its effectivey a walkthrough of the game.\n\nThere is no real substitute for DR2 anime wise.\n\nIf you want the full experience, I'd also recommend watching season 2 of the anime to get even more background and context.\n\n\nNow to the game itself:\n\nMy computer is the MSI GP72, so for these kinds of games, it excels easily. Even then, the graphics don't really feel fully 1080p, but that might just be the result of it being a PS Vita port.\nThat being said, the graphics are still Danganronpa style, so pink blood, heavily cartooned fires, etc... So it still feels like a pure Danganronpa experience. \n\nBugs: If you tab out, the game will be set to windowed mode, so if you tab back in, or select it from the taskbar, it won't be fullscreen. Only way I know to make it full screen is to wuit the game and relaunch. Might be fixed in a future patch.\n\nImportant note: The game can only be saved in 2 ways: A storyline checkpoint is met and the game prompts a save option, or you find a saving point in game and save that way. You cannot save through settings, and because the in-world saving system it is unlikely that an update in the future will add that in.\n\nGameplay wise, it plays similarly to a Third Person Shooter, so Komaru weilds the \"gun\" with RMB to aim and LMB to shoot. Unlike many TPS games, you cannot hip shot, so you have to aim to shoot. This can be tricky when a Monokuma pops in out of nowhere, but when you get the hang of it, it becomes second nature.\n\nMinor spoiler for literally the first 20 min of gameplay:\n[spoiler]Please note that the first time you shoot the gun in the game, it is a very overpowered version, so please don't start the game thinking  \"Oh, this is too easy, I don't like this, refund time\". play it for a bit more and it will all make sense.[/spoiler]\n\nGenocider Jill plays as a melee character from what I've seen so far, and can easily be switched with Komaru mid battle, so you can tactically use both to get out of tricky situations.\n\nAfter 3h I've completed the first chapter, and as I expected, it plays similarly to a boss fight that you'd see in other first person and third person shootes that follow this game style. It is NOT a danganronpa 1 & 2 style classroom court session, however some of the styling involved with the court can be seen within the fight (when you play it, you'll understand what I mean).\n\nThe game so far also makes references to various families of other characters in other DR games (both dead and alive) so thats a huge plus.\n\nThis review will be updated as I play a bit more, but for now, here is my rating:\n\nDanganronpa fans: 10/10\n\nPeople who played Danganronpa games, but didn't like them: 9/10 (cause it is different than those games)\n\nPeople who have never touched a Danganronpa game: 5/10 cause you won't get most of the references, so it won't feel as fun for you. Trust me when I say this, play the other games, then come back to this, and you'll realize why its 5/10 for non-DR players vs 10/10 for DR fans", "timestamp_created": 1498601148, "timestamp_updated": 1498692454, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.635258", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32892519": {"recommendationid": "32892519", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003947790", "num_games_owned": 813, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504156978}, "language": "english", "review": "YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAHYEAHYEAH\nHMM HMHM HMM HMHM HMM HMHM HMM\nHMM HMHM HMM HMHM HMM HMHM HMM\nHEEY YEAH\nYEAH YEAH YEAH YEAHYEAHYEAH\nOOH-OOH-OOOH-OOH OOH\nYEAHYEAHYEAHYEAHYEAHYEAH YEAH\nOAOAH OOH BABY\n", "timestamp_created": 1498600898, "timestamp_updated": 1498600898, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 26, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489165", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32890368": {"recommendationid": "32890368", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048872576", "num_games_owned": 491, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 54, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498600837}, "language": "english", "review": "Too many problems to be fun:\n-Can't rebind any keys.

See last section for the final conclusions:\n\nVery early review of the game.\n\nFirst of all: [b]DONT PLAY THIS GAME BEFORE DANGANRONPA 1 OR SUPER DANGANRONPA 2[/b], because it will sure spoil the story.\n\n[h1]About the port:[/h1]\n\nFor now I have only played the prologue, but the game looks very good and has not any performance issues. You can clearly see how everything in game has been remastered for higher resolutions; the only thing that is a bit lacking are the 3D cutscenes which still seem a bit bad, although in my opinion that is not an issue because they are good enough.\n\nI have not tested the keyboard+mouse control, but given that the game is a third-person shooter, it sure will feel better, I migh even change later, although you can use the a controller without any problems. UPDATE: I have been playing with Keyboard+Mouse and I prefer it over controller. The only downside is that there are not customizable keybindings, althought the default ones are pretty good.\n\nAbout graphical options, in my opinion the game has enough. You can customize in the launcher of the game if you want to display it borderless window or fullscreen along with other graphical options like antialiasing. Something I noticed is the lack of V-sync option on Fullscreen mode, but I didnt see any tearing so its okay.\n\n[h1]About the game itself:[/h1]\n\nThis game does not follow the same pattern as the two ones before (simply because the author wanted to make something different lol) and instead of a trial-murder-puzzle game, is a fps with some hack-and-slash. Even so, the game keeps the Danganronpa feeling and I think its worth a play if you are fan of the series. Storywise is not very important, but give details about what happened between the first and second game and introduces some characters that are then shown in the Danganronpa 3 animation, which ends the Hope's Peak Academy Arc, so if you like the universe absolutely play this.\n\n[h1]Final conclusions:[/h1]\n\nThe game is fine. Recommended if you like the Danganronpa Universe and dont expect nothing like DR1 and SDR2. The port is fine overall, I havent find any bugs nor performance issues. The only con I can say is that its a little easy with keyboard+mouse simply because aiming to the weak point of the enemies is very simple.", "timestamp_created": 1498592673, "timestamp_updated": 1500040336, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 406, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.930345", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32881467": {"recommendationid": "32881467", "author": {"steamid": "76561198353259333", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1164, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501092750}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u73b0\u5728\u51cc\u6668\u4e09\u70b9\u534a \u6253\u5b8c\u4e86\u5e8f\u7ae0 \u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u6211\u671f\u5f85\u4e863\u4e2a\u6708 \u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u6765\u8bf4\u4e00\u4e0b\n\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620fpsv\u5e73\u53f0\u552e\u4ef7\u4e3a200+cny ps4\u5e73\u53f0\u548cpc steam\u572827\u65e5\u592a\u5e73\u6d0b\u65f6\u95f4\u540c\u65f6\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u6b64\u6e38\u620f\nps4\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u5b9a\u4ef7\u4e3a360+ \u800c\u4e14\u53ea\u6709\u82f1\u6587 29\u53f7\u4f1a\u6709\u65e5\u6587\u7248\u5728ps4\u5e73\u53f0 \u4e0d\u8fc7ps4\u7684\u4e2d\u6587\u7248\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u8981\u4ec0\u4e48\u65f6\u5019\nsteam\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0d\u4ec5\u76f4\u63a5\u6709\u4e2d\u6587 \u800c\u4e14\u552e\u4ef7\u53ea\u670988\n\u8fd9\u4e00\u4f5c \u5f39\u4e38\u7cfb\u5217\u7684\u756a\u5916 \u4e0d\u518d\u662f\u63a8\u7406\u6e38\u620f \u6ca1\u6709\u73ed\u7ea7\u5ba1\u5224 \u800c\u662f\u6709\u7740\u5c04\u51fb\u7b49\u8981\u7d20\u7684\u6e38\u620f\n\u552e\u4ef7\u4e0a88\u5f88\u8ba9\u6211\u9707\u60ca \u867d\u7136\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u8be5\u5938\u8c01 \u4f46\u662f\n\u8fd9\u662f\u4e2a\u597d\u6e38\u620f \u4e70\u4e86\u4e0d\u503c\u7b97\u6211\u8f93", "timestamp_created": 1498592445, "timestamp_updated": 1498592445, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 489, "votes_funny": 48, "weighted_vote_score": "0.931939", "comment_count": "24", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32877281": {"recommendationid": "32877281", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135745794", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1350, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499168796}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ud638\uc5d0\uc5d0\uc5d0\uc5d0\n\n\ub2e8\uac04\ub860\ud30c \ucd5c\ucd08 \ud55c\uae00\ud654 \ucd9c\uc2dc. \uc2a4\ub9ac\uc988 \ud32c\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uad6c\ub9e4\n\uc7ac\ubc0b\ub0d0\uad6c\uc694? \ubb3c\ub860!\n", "timestamp_created": 1498589886, "timestamp_updated": 1498589886, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.602493", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32868937": {"recommendationid": "32868937", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159066813", "num_games_owned": 974, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 700, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500208441}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ud654\uc81c\uc758 \uc0b4\uc778\uc720\ub3c4\uac8c\uc784!!!\n\n\ud53c\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ud55c\uae00\ub85c \ud560\uc218\uc788\ub294\uac70\uc5d0 \uac10\uc0ac\ud558\ub294\ub370 \n\n\uc778\uac04\uc801\uc73c\ub85c 1,2\uc788\uc73c\uba74 20% \ud560\uc778\ucfe0\ud3f0\uc774\ub77c\ub3c4\uc918\uc57c\ud558\ub294\uac70 \uc544\ub2c8\ub0d0 \ube7c\uc560\uc560\uc560\uc560\uc561\n\nV3\ub294 \uc81c\ubc1c \uc880 \uadf8\ub807\uac8c\ud574\uc918", "timestamp_created": 1498585608, "timestamp_updated": 1498585608, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 171, "votes_funny": 40, "weighted_vote_score": "0.670296", "comment_count": "9", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32862712": {"recommendationid": "32862712", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016432675", "num_games_owned": 864, "num_reviews": 329, "playtime_forever": 1017, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498526645}, "language": "english", "review": "[b] Target Audience: [/b] [I] Danganronpa/Story Driven Fans, or surprisingly, Puzzle enthusaists [/i]\n\n[b] Summary: [/b]  \n\nLet me get this out of the way: if you haven't played Danganronpa 1 and 2 at this point: well you should probably do that before you play Ultra Despair Girls. It's not that you can't get anything out of this game if you play it alone: but it's SO much better after playing the first two games. And those two games are fantastic.\n\nWhile Ultra Despair Girls tries to spice things up with a new gameplay style, it's the iconic and fascinating story is the reason that you should pick up the game. The spin off takes the story in a new direction but not only keeps a lot of the themes from the original, but adds a more character relationship driven angle with Toko and Komaru which really REALLY works. The angle with the kids takes the series to new creepy depths, and if you were concerned that the game who pull punches with the new characters involved: you'd be dead wrong. It can be down right disturbing at times in the right way, causing you to shudder in your seat.\n\nThe gameplay however doesn't do as well. The basic shooting doesn't play to its own strengths, as the generic gameplay and lack of AI complexity keeps it from being interesting. It's got a bunch of tools, but it doesn't use them well in the main gameplay. Frankly, its the worst part of the game. When it switches to a more puzzle like format: that's where it starts to get a lot better: as thinking about how you use each bullet to kill all the Monokuma's at once. It's all a case of wasted potential, as the tools here could have been used to really work in a Survival Horror type setting.\n\nThe presentation is pretty good (for a vita port), and the port itself is great performance wise,  although has some options missing that I would want. The voice work is good, and the music work is great despite being all over the place genre wise. \n\nOverall, Danganronpa series fans have to pick up this game because well, the story is worth it. And if you aren't a fan of the series as of yet, even though it's not the best way to get into it, it can do the job for someone who ABSOLUTELY NEEDS action gameplay. \n\n\n[b]Video Review: [/b] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muDSpdQX0tE\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]Positives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] The Story keeps the themes of the original series, but takes them in a new interesting direction with more traditional dystopian/survival elements. They kept the lore in tact without going completely off the rails. This feels like a Danganronpa story.\n[*] The Star of the show is the relationship and complexity that develops between Toko and Komaru. They play off each other well, and the growth of both characters is fascinating to watch.\n[*] The world is built on in a lot of good ways, and does a good job of bridging several of the holes in the plot up to this point. \n[*] Pushes your uncomfortable meter in good ways. Can legimately get under your skin and make you wonder if the villians/heroes are justified. Kudos to the writing. \n[*] The kids characters. All of them are rather well done. \n[*] Very clever references to the original game, and makes fans who pay attention really appreciate the tight narrative here. \n[*] The tools for the gameplay have interesting concepts, and if they were assembled better, it would make for some good gameplay. (More on this later) \n[*] Character design and artwork is still superb, doing well in giving little details about the characters while still having a style to it. \n[*] 60 FPS will drops every so often, but not more then 4/5 frames. Does support up to 4K in Fullscreen (although really, you're not going to notice it that much)\n[*] All controllers are supported that I tried. Including a default configuration for the Steam controller!\n\n[/list]\n\n[b]Negatives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] The standard shooting is rather repetitive and doesn't do well in constructing interesting scenarios to keep the player entertained. \n[*] The enemy AI is pretty gosh darn horrible. Will constantly run into walls, and is able to be easily exploited. This added to your speed makes even the hardest difficulty....a reasonable cake walk. \n[*] The 3D models don't do well in complementing the emotional elements of the story. The Animation/3D cutscenes conflict with each other. \n[*] Note, my main machine could not play via the keyboard/mouse controls due to \u2026..something causing the game to auto rotate the camera and not allow me to use the virtual directions. The thing is, this problem was not seen on a second machine, and seems to be some directx/other issue. Keep it in mind as you may have to refund the game if you run into this problem. \n[*] Some of the deaths this time around don't have that much of an impact due to the format chosen here. \n[*] The strength of Toko almost undoes Komaru's character at times. Side characters sorta get overlooked from the \u201cgood\u201d side.\n[*] Don't like the split of options here with the launcher and the in game options.\n[*] Missing bindable keys, which for a third person shooter, is sorta a big feature to miss. \n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1498583037, "timestamp_updated": 1498583061, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4143, "votes_funny": 253, "weighted_vote_score": "0.915146", "comment_count": "30", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39410493": {"recommendationid": "39410493", "author": {"steamid": "76561198406871710", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1123, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 939, "last_played": 1516176956}, "language": "english", "review": "brain hacking", "timestamp_created": 1516186421, "timestamp_updated": 1516186421, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39409114": {"recommendationid": "39409114", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996633876", "num_games_owned": 758, "num_reviews": 175, "playtime_forever": 1080, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1080, "last_played": 1516202833}, "language": "english", "review": "This game's awesome. I don't think just anyone should play this unless you're one of those people who don't do a lot of thinking, or you're okay with heavy, dark, grim themes. UDG is darker, with more impleasant story elements and a heavier atmosphere than the other games.\n\nThough, I definitely recommend playing it. It's an interesting game, the gameplay's always being mixed up to make it fun, there's lots of 'challenge rooms' which challenge your thinking more than your aim, but there's also plenty of sections that'll make you very glad you have a mouse to play this game with rather than a controller.\n\nUDG is a third person shooter, and shortly into the game you get a powerup that lets you go into a kind of melee mode and beat up enemies. There's really not much more to it than that. You shoot stuff, you hit stuff, it dies. There's different bullets you get which do different things and the game tries to get you to use them together to defeat enemies but you can also just headshot them and they go down, and since this is on PC you'll probably be doing a lot of that. There's no reason not to, after all, and the rewards are better since headshotting an enemy will give you 50 coins instead of 20 when a coin is going to drop.\n\nIt's shorter than other Danganronpa games but it's still one long game. I blazed through it and it still took me about 17 or so hours on the in-game timer.\n\nI don't really have much else to say. It's a third person shooter, it's pretty good.

Not recommended for others. \nRating: 7/10\n\nWhat you can look forward to:\n+ The story: It's really the only reason why I bought the game. The story takes place after Makoto and the gang left Hope's peak [spoiler]and joined the Future Foundation [/spoiler] and before the events of Danganronpa 2. \n+ Characters: Although there are only a handful of significant characters you can interact with in the game, the game makes up for it since they're very interesting characters. There will be more of Toko and Nagito (my favorite characters). You'll witness Toko Fukawa's character development [spoiler]as she makes her first friend[/spoiler]. You'll also be able to witness more of Nagito [spoiler]as a Remnant of Despair[/spoiler]. \n+ Puzzles: Instead of class trials, this game gives you puzzles (challenges) to solve before you can progress. Some puzzles are optional. Hidden objects are also present.\n+ Music: Classic Danganronpa music you can never go wrong with.\n+ Fanservice: Komaru and Byakuya fans rejoice. Anti-grope simulator 9/10. \n\nWhat you can't look forward to:\n- Graphics: The mix of 2d and 3d elements are fine. However, most of the 3d elements are unrefined. Clunky animations and character expressions are present.\n- The first 2-5 hours of the game: Honestly, it was dreadful playing the few hours of the game. I honestly wanted to get a refund since it was utterly boring playing the prologue and chapter 1. However, it gets better in the second chapter gameplay and story-wise.\n- The ending: Very long-winding. The boss battle also has crappy camera rotation. With regards to the story, however, it is satisfying.", "timestamp_created": 1515401394, "timestamp_updated": 1515472486, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39143901": {"recommendationid": "39143901", "author": {"steamid": "76561198441357030", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1043, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1043, "last_played": 1515310496}, "language": "english", "review": "If you are a fan of the series I highly recommend this game!

Go and play in the first one!\n\nYet this game is a spinoff to the series with completely different gameplay, that was the most emotional, psychological, and cruel game so far, and that's exactly why I love this series so much.\n\nI love that developers aren't scared to show the most awful and disgusting problems human society and our minds experience, mixing up those with a hilarious sense of humor, very sad moments, and spectacular courage moments.\n\nCharacters, those characters, I'm not going to spoil anything about them, but trust me, characters of this game have one of the most emotional and bright characteristics and acting I've seen in anything.\n\nYet, this game is completely different from others with gameplay, this is still fully a Danganronpa game, don't be scared about that, if you're fan of the first two games who deciding should you give it a try or not, man trust me and just go for it, I assure you, it'll worth it.\n\nSo as you probably should know, this series is 100% about the storyline, and this game isn't an exception.\nIn particular, it's a big storyline\\character expansion to the previous two games, which amazingly fills holes of previous games, and adds waaay more.\n\nGameplay on max difficulty even without upgrades is super easy since this game really not about gameplay.\n\n+ Incredible story\n+ art of characters\n+ Super-versatile characters with well-thought motivations and personalities\n+ feels\n+ Filling up hole in what happened between the 1st and the 2nd games\n+ 3D models and their expressions are amazing\n+ Good and Cool cutscenes\n+ Characters from the previous games\n+ Seiyuu acting beyond quality level\n+ 99% of all dialogues voiced fully\n+ A lot of hilarious dialogues and moments\n+ Just as always amazing OST\n\n5/5", "timestamp_created": 1516759157, "timestamp_updated": 1516759157, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39552144": {"recommendationid": "39552144", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043401618", "num_games_owned": 939, "num_reviews": 79, "playtime_forever": 1479, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 423, "last_played": 1516668948}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] [b] Ultra Literaire Girls\t[/b]\t[/h1]\n\nBelieve the other reviews: This game is only for players who have completed Danganronpa 1 & 2. If you have here are a few things to consider before playing this chapter:\n\n-It's still a VN, with about 80% time spend reading/listening and 20% gameplay.\n\n-The one and only major downside to the game: manual saves only and scarce checkpoint placement. You can have bits of the game where you can't save for an hour at the time. I found myself skipping dialogue that I did not want to skip, because I needed to save and quit.\n\n-The soundtrack and 2D art are pure Danganronpa quality. The 3D levels are poor in detail and same-ish, with lots of (short) loading screens. 1080p is a lie as well, as it's just an fullscreened vita resolution.\n\n-That said it runs very smoothly at 60fps, and the gameplay is competent enough to not feel like a chore. There are quite a few puzzles as well, which range from clever to annoying, but I believe they can all be skipped/brute forced. The difficulty is low (I am an average hardcore gamer but hardest difficulty felt somewhat easy). \n\n- Most of the time is still spent watching fully animated cutscenes, dialogue cutscenes, dialogue strips, finding books and mangas on the floor that you read, and after that watch a dialogue where the characters talk about the book.\n\n-You will discover so much background information about the characters from Danganronpa 1 & 2, their family members, as well as the sinister origin of Monokumas.\n\n-And yet it's also a story of its own, incredibly rich, dark and depressing; with new, well developped, psychologically broken characters, and probably the best villains the series has to offer.", "timestamp_created": 1516695828, "timestamp_updated": 1516695828, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39530503": {"recommendationid": "39530503", "author": {"steamid": "76561198358730587", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1376, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "last_played": 1516271005}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac \uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc138\uacc4\uad00 \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294\ub370 \uc788\uc5b4\uc11c \ud765\ubbf8\ub85c\uc6e0\ub2e4. \uc544\uc26c\uc6b4\uac74 \uac8c\uc784\uc774 \uc0dd\uac01\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub108\ubb34 \uc26c\uc6e0\ub2e4.", "timestamp_created": 1516611141, "timestamp_updated": 1516611141, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39607637": {"recommendationid": "39607637", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028123272", "num_games_owned": 2221, "num_reviews": 385, "playtime_forever": 1286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1139, "last_played": 1516892707}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ud559\uae09\uc7ac\ud310 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \ubc84\ub9ac\uace0\ub3c4 \uaf64 \uc798\ubf51\ud78c \uc218\uc791\uc774\ub2e4.\n\uae0d\ub370 \ud328\ub4dc\ub85c \uc870\uc900\ud558\uae30 \ub108\ubb34 \ud798\ub4e4\uc5b4\uc11c \ud0a4\ub9c8\ub85c \ud074\ub9ac\uc5b4\ud588\ub2e4...\n\uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc870\uae08 \ubb34\uc758\ubbf8\ud558\ub2e4 \uc2f6\uc744 \uc815\ub3c4\ub85c \ub9ce\uc740 \ud37c\uc990 \ubb49\ud145\uc774\ub294 \uc880 \uc9c0\ub8e8\ud558\ub4dc\ub77c", "timestamp_created": 1516892864, "timestamp_updated": 1516892864, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}}

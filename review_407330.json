But while I've expected finding only that when approaching this game, there were many positive surprises awaiting me. The first one was probably the protagonist, Yomi, who as a centuries-old fox spirit is really an unusual heroine to be in the centre of this kind of story. She's also simply a compelling character, probably the highlight of the whole game, showing really interesting traits and simply providing a rare perspective to observe this kind of fantasy adventure from. While the game's writing in general wasn't brilliant, I really liked most things connected to her and her interactions with Ceri, the human knight that (unwillingly) accompanies her on the quest to reclaim the titular dungeon.\n\nThe RPG mechanics were simple, but quite elegant, with just enough customization and complexity to make them enjoyable, while exploring the dungeon itself was well-paced (no pointless grind and backtracking, at least on normal difficulty) and fun. The game respects your time, what's not necessarily true even with many \"serious\" JRPGs and RPGs nowadays and it's clear that its main mechanics and level layout were pretty well-though out. It's really more than I've expected from this developer and something I can deeply appreciate as a person with very limited free time.\n\nWhile everything you do in the game is more or less an excuse to throw cartoon nudity (and mild yuri romance) at you, I have to say that in the end it was all pretty enjoyable and consistent in quality. The attempts at being \"sexy\" didn't really grab me most of the time, but I know many people are very much into the kind of sexual content Sakura games offer and I was (nearly) impressed by the execution and variety of it here. And underneath that somewhat obnoxious mass of anime boobs and girls-kissing CGs, there's a really decent game hidden.\n\n[b]If you really want to see what the games in Sakura series are all about, buy this one - and if you're already a fan of the franchise, Dungeon should be extremely enjoyable for you. Just be wary, Winged Cloud is alleged to be guilty of some very nasty business practises and produces tons of embarrassingly bad VNs that gives the whole genre a bad name - be sure you're ok with supporting a company like that before you buy Sakura Dungeon, even if the game itself in definitely worth playing.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1515789773, "timestamp_updated": 1515800407, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.564233", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39238187": {"recommendationid": "39238187", "author": {"steamid": "76561198377949946", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 1751, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1751, "last_played": 1515988460}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ucc98\uc74c\uc5d4 \ubcc4 \ud2b9\uc131\uc5c6\ub294 RPG\uc778 \uc904 \uc54c\uc558\ub294\ub370, \uc0dd\uac01\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc911\ub3c5\uc131\uc774 \uac15\ud558\ub2e4.\n\uc124\ub9c8 \uc774\uac78 5\uc2dc\uac04 \ub3d9\uc548 \ub17c\uc2a4\ud1b1\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uac8c \ub420 \uc904\uc774\uc57c... \uc5ed\uc2dc \ub178\ub2e4\uac00\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04\uac00\ub294 \uc904 \ubaa8\ub978\ub2e4\ub2c8\uae4c.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/kimgaemandoo\n\uc5d0\uc11c \ud328\uce58 \ubc1b\uc740 \ub355\uc5d0 \ub354\uc6b1 \uc7ac\ubc0c\uac8c \ud50c\ub798\uc774 \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc5c8\ub2e4.\n\uac13\uac9c\uc774\ub798\uc11c \uc0c0\ub2e4\uac00 2\uc2dc\uac04 \uc815\ub3c4 \ud588\uc744 \ub550 \uc0b4\uc9dd \uc2e4\ub9dd\ud588\ub294\ub370, \uc9c0\uae08 \ub2e4\uc2dc \uc0dd\uac01\ud574\ubcf4\ub2c8 \uac13\uac9c \ub9de\ub124.\n\ub178\uac00\ub2e4 \ub9cc\uc138.", "timestamp_created": 1515610570, "timestamp_updated": 1515610570, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39218996": {"recommendationid": "39218996", "author": {"steamid": "76561198281908131", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 831, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 540, "last_played": 1515619001}, "language": "english", "review": "To be honest, I don't know if this game could be any better.

Nothing crazy involved, but enough to entertain.\n\nEnemy variety: You get 2-3 new monsters per floor, interspersed with monsters from the prior floor. All but the ones in the final dungeon segment can be captured. Due to how leveling works in the game, and the stat limits from raw leveling on the monster girls, you're incentivized to cycle into new monsters as you progress.\n\n18+ content: If you remove the face from all of the girls in this game, 97% of them would look identical. Same naked body, same bust size, same shape to nether regions, all perfectly clean. Smallest cup size is a high C, most are D, with one or two characters going into DD or beyond territory. No love is given for the A-to-B cup girls in this art.\n\nSo going off of my play of the game alone, I'd say if you have no problems supporting a shady company (EA fanpeeps, I'm looking at you right now), toss a few bucks at the game. But, if you have ANY moral standards, watch the below-linked video (Thanks, Transflection!) and understand why I wish I could un-buy the bundle that contained this game, or at least change my fund allocation to 100% not go to the developer.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlh8e201lI0", "timestamp_created": 1513041833, "timestamp_updated": 1513041857, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6,

Being no match for the fox spirit Yomi, Ceri was forced into servitude to Yomi to help Yomi regain her former position as the dungeon lord. As Ceri and Yomi explore each level of the dungeon, battle, capture and recruit the monsters along the way, they are joined by an all-female cast of heroine characters and monsters that will help to shed light on the new dungeon lord that has imprisoned Yomi for centuries and an impending campaign of war and destruction by unknown mysterious forces as well as provide comedy, humour and yuri fanservice.\n\nThe game contains both role-playing game(RPG) and visual novel as a dungeon crawler where Ceri will bring along up to 5 other followers to accompany her in a quest to defeat the monsters in each level, locate the keys and defeat the guardian(boss monster) of each level to proceed further into the next level. All monsters have unique sprites and most monsters will have a few lines of dialogue if they are accompanying Ceri during certain specific event sections relevant to the monster's domain area. The dungeon levels have sufficient variety which include a Western castle, an Eastern manor, an underground cavern, an Egyptian pyramid, an abyssal realm and a futuristic spaceship across 30 levels with false/breakable walls, pitfalls, spike traps, teleporters and spinners. There are also a number of optional side quests which will reward the player with an achievement and often a unique monster which Ceri can bring along as a follower.\n\nHaving played through the earlier titles of the Sakura series, this title has the largest number of female characters in the game with an all-female cast of 2 non-player characters(NPCs), 8 heroines, 10 unique monsters, 35 monsters, 3 non-recruitable monsters and 3 non-recruitable unique monsters and boss heroines with plenty of CGs. The background music by Zack Parrish and artwork by Badriel, Fatelinealpha, Wanaca, kauru and MMrailgun are great and make this the largest scale Sakura title compared to all previous titles of the series with a very large number of cards in a set required to craft a badge, emoticons and profile backgrounds. Among the cons, by being the first Sakura title as an RPG with Steam achievements, there are 2 potentially missable achievements from starting the game at an incorrect difficulty mode, an achievement(Breaker of Armies) that require grinding for at least 30 hours and some of the achievements may not unlock correctly unless the game is installed to a beta version.\n\nOverall, this RPG and visual novel is highly recommended when at discount or bundle offer for fans of Winged Cloud who might be interested in collecting the titles in the Sakura series, a long dungeon crawler RPG(More than 30 hours) with fanservice, humour, romance, mystery, thriller, fantasy and science fiction themes, appropriate background music to match the different locations, battles, funny and erotic moments throughout the game, great artwork in the trading cards, badges, emoticons and profile artwork for this game and don't mind a good challenge or looking past a few achievements that might be difficult to unlock.", "timestamp_created": 1511152496, "timestamp_updated": 1511152496, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475281", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36623531": {"recommendationid": "36623531", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070684885", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 988, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512828012}, "language": "english", "review": "That's litrally one of best mmorpg's I've ever played.\nPros:\n+A lot of characters.\n+18+ patch ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\n+Really great scenes\n+pokemon wannabe combat (even better)\n+You can have your team (read harem)\n+Dungeon, treasures \n+Decisions making\n+Dialouges are really good\n+Main story is also great\n+If you crit u can litrally rip enemy clothes ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\n+Only girls, since im anti-social i really like it\n+You can change outfits of your characters if u find cloth scraps in dungeon\n+Spells\nCons: \n-No jiggle phycics\n-Can't play when someone's home (xD)\n-Price\n-You can't change equipment of your characters ;c\n\nWonder if there were more locations not just dungeon and more options in town.

Also, with the increased longevity came with a more smooth and enjoyable story progression.\nIn terms of sheer content, this has the most CGs in all Sakura games, and, once you complete the main story, you are given access to the sprites and background in a way that you can create your own scenes for you to create your own images.\n\nIf you are a fan of dungeon crawlers, or you thoroughly enjoy visual novels, I would highly recommend Sakura Dungeon.\n\nFor those that are not much experience with visual novels or dungeon crawlers, I would recommend this game when it is on sale.", "timestamp_created": 1510720553, "timestamp_updated": 1510720553, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36482800": {"recommendationid": "36482800", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018699344", "num_games_owned": 148, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 633, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510543243}, "language": "english", "review": "Very basic dungeon crawler with simple elements thats easy to pick up. Capturing dungeon monsters and using them as allies is an interesting concept rather than making your own units or getting them from a randomized recruitment place or something. Although it can be a bit frustrating with the low chance of capturing enemies as you get further into the game, requiring you to fight and successfully capture the same monster multiple times until you get it. Also unforunately another problem I have with the game is that the skill scrolls dont tell you what they do so you kind of have to just use them to get their description and then load the game to use it properly if you want. \n\nI played it on hard and unfortunately hard mode is pretty hard for all the wrong reasons. Never have I seen so many enemies land so many hits with a 30% chance or less so often, 9 out of 10 times they seem to always hit. And never have I seen so many of my own characters miss with a 80% chance or higher. I've lost count of how many times an attack has missed with a 99% chance to hit. It makes the game very frustrating and you've got to take it a lot slower with the whole game weighted against you but if you're into that, hard mode might be fore you. Playing on normal will probably give you a much easier and more enjoyable experience. \n\n[strike]And of course be sure to get the uncensored patch for all that good eye candy you paid for[/strike]", "timestamp_created": 1510534747, "timestamp_updated": 1510534881, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502924", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36457151": {"recommendationid": "36457151", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018789137", "num_games_owned": 376, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510452289}, "language": "english", "review": "Not enough boobs", "timestamp_created": 1510447722, "timestamp_updated": 1510447722, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 19, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530977", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36453164": {"recommendationid": "36453164", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035403576", "num_games_owned": 1051, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 2350, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510432943}, "language": "english", "review": "Because hardcore gamers need games to start their journey, Sakura Dungeon is a nice way to introduce new players to the Dungeon Crawler genre.\nIt's fairly easy, so newcomers won't feel overwhelmed by too many options or strategies.\nMany cute girls and a not too complex story make it the ideal first game for people who want to explore this kind of RPG games.\n\nMinus point for the many spelling errors and typos.

Being no match for the fox spirit Yomi, Ceri was forced into servitude to Yomi to help Yomi regain her former position as the dungeon lord. As Ceri and Yomi explore each level of the dungeon, battle, capture and recruit the monsters along the way, they are joined by an all-female cast of heroine characters and monsters that will help to shed light on the new dungeon lord that has imprisoned Yomi for centuries and an impending campaign of war and destruction by unknown mysterious forces as well as provide comedy, humour and yuri fanservice.\n\nThe game contains both role-playing game(RPG) and visual novel as a dungeon crawler where Ceri will bring along up to 5 other followers to accompany her in a quest to defeat the monsters in each level, locate the keys and defeat the guardian(boss monster) of each level to proceed further into the next level. All monsters have unique sprites and most monsters will have a few lines of dialogue if they are accompanying Ceri during certain specific event sections relevant to the monster's domain area. The dungeon levels have sufficient variety which include a Western castle, an Eastern manor, an underground cavern, an Egyptian pyramid, an abyssal realm and a futuristic spaceship across 30 levels with false/breakable walls, pitfalls, spike traps, teleporters and spinners. There are also a number of optional side quests which will reward the player with an achievement and often a unique monster which Ceri can bring along as a follower.\n\nHaving played through the earlier titles of the Sakura series, this title has the largest number of female characters in the game with an all-female cast of 2 non-player characters(NPCs), 8 heroines, 10 unique monsters, 35 monsters, 3 non-recruitable monsters and 3 non-recruitable unique monsters and boss heroines with plenty of CGs. The background music by Zack Parrish and artwork by Badriel, Fatelinealpha, Wanaca, kauru and MMrailgun are great and make this the largest scale Sakura title compared to all previous titles of the series with a very large number of cards in a set required to craft a badge, emoticons and profile backgrounds. Among the cons, by being the first Sakura title as an RPG with Steam achievements, there are 2 potentially missable achievements from starting the game at an incorrect difficulty mode, an achievement(Breaker of Armies) that require grinding for at least 30 hours and some of the achievements may not unlock correctly unless the game is installed to a beta version.\n\nOverall, this RPG and visual novel is highly recommended when at discount or bundle offer for fans of Winged Cloud who might be interested in collecting the titles in the Sakura series, a long dungeon crawler RPG(More than 30 hours) with fanservice, humour, romance, mystery, thriller, fantasy and science fiction themes, appropriate background music to match the different locations, battles, funny and erotic moments throughout the game, great artwork in the trading cards, badges, emoticons and profile artwork for this game and don't mind a good challenge or looking past a few achievements that might be difficult to unlock.", "timestamp_created": 1509297556, "timestamp_updated": 1509419395, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 49, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.788986", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36100258": {"recommendationid": "36100258", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109973509", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 801, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509897872}, "language": "thai", "review": "Played for the boobs and naked 2D girls...\nNot disappointed.", "timestamp_created": 1509256359, "timestamp_updated": 1509256359, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36095903": {"recommendationid": "36095903", "author": {"steamid": "76561198281445674", "num_games_owned": 348, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509241971}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u9700\u8981\u8bed\u97f3\nvocal needed", "timestamp_created": 1509242047, "timestamp_updated": 1509242047, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538168", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36080159": {"recommendationid": "36080159", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109935182", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514588600}, "language": "english", "review": "A unique take on the Sakura series by Winged Cloud (by which I mean not a visual novel). I really enjoyed this game, playing RPG's for me are always fun, but Dungeon's way of doing this is really cool. Players can \"collect\" their own teammates and use them in battle. The characters are different and unique and the different environments are very cool. A downside is that sometimes I felt that some characters repeat things more often than not (see Ceri) but apart from that I enjoyed the characters. The music is nice as well, with my personal favourites being the midboss battle music and the title screen music. The gameplay is fun while battling, however the gameplay when exploring can get repetitive at times. However, that's nitpicking as the positive of the battles outweigh the negatives of exploring.\n\n\nOverall:\n\nPros:\n\n+ Fun battle gameplay.\n+ Story is fun to read.\n+ Likable characters.\n+ Environments are unique.\n+ Enjoyable music.\n\n\nCons:\n\n- Characters can repeat certain saying too often.\n- Exploration can be repetitive.\n\nOverall Score:\n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1509202632, "timestamp_updated": 1509202632, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518868", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36059657": {"recommendationid": "36059657", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027285237", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 348, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509242553}, "language": "french", "review": "prise en main lourde et r\u00e9barbative , comme ma b... euh non ....\nune fois pass\u00e9 le cot\u00e9 oldies , ce jeu est une merveille....\ndu dj crawling comme on aime , du kemonomimi comme on aime , un patch 18+ comme on aime \nje dis oui , oui oui!!!! encore \n\nps : penser a racheter de l essuie tout et une manette propre\n", "timestamp_created": 1509147573, "timestamp_updated": 1509147573, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36037575": {"recommendationid": "36037575", "author": {"steamid": "76561198247759050", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1049, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509533320}, "language": "english", "review": "Please describe what you liked or disklike about the game:\n\nI liked the anime boobs especially when I am playing with the cracked version of it.\n\nI disliked the amount of time I had to spend fighting irrelevant minions to get to specific levels.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1509095638, "timestamp_updated": 1509095638, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519235", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36011888": {"recommendationid": "36011888", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088502572", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 514, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511542802}, "language": "english", "review": "boobs", "timestamp_created": 1509021240, "timestamp_updated": 1509021240, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519685", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35980354": {"recommendationid": "35980354", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009986252", "num_games_owned": 981, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 2161, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506910273}, "language": "english", "review": "This was a really fun dungeon crawlling romp. My favorite Sakura series game to date, and a darned good game as a whole on its own too.\n\nReminds me a lot of the lesser-known Lightning Warrior Raidy games, in fact I'd be almost positive the developers at Winged Cloud took inspiration from them. Except I feel it is even better than the LWR series of games for a few important reasons.\n\nOne really major one is in the LWR games, sex scenes were prone to being a bit dark or often used as punishment for wrongdoing, and sometimes were clearly sex without consent. Sakura Dungeon however does not fall into this trap.\n\nThat was one thing I really appreciated about the whole attitude of Sakura Dungeon and its characters. It was clear that Yomi, one of the main characters in the story, was very accepting of all walks of life with her defending the different kinds of monsters, not chastising other characters for their choice of behavior a lot of times, and even when there were some punishments to be had for wrongdoing, usually compromises were offered, or the actual punishments were hardly of a detrimental nature and were usually more like giving second chances with guidance.\n\nIn other words she was a refreshingly understanding, forgiving, and gentle protagonist for an RPG, and it made the game very enjoyable to play through knowing that no matter the seeming severity of the current agenda, it was all handled rather peacefully and with a healthy dose of humility, and not forcefully guns blazing with no remorse like you see in so many other games.\n\nEven Ceri, the other main protagonist, through her character growth as the game progressed, learned the value of Yomi's wise and mostly gentle ways, and also to just lighten up a little bit and let her guard down some more and enjoy herself. It was pretty good character development and growth for a game that wasn't a novel's worth of story.\n\nThe vast majority of the adult content scenes were fun and light, the \"worst\" of them perhaps being the embarrassing mishap scenes, or perhaps the few scenes where sexual activity was spontaneous and caught the character off guard, but was not actually undesired as was made clear by the reactions of the characters involved. Even these scenes were playful and lighthearted.\n\nBy \"worst\" I don't mean that the scenes were bad, but in comparison of their nature to the much more common non-consentual scenes in the LWR games which are as close of a game comparison as I can make, Sakura Dungeon did so much better with the adult content scenes at making them truly enjoyable and positive by contrast. You never really came away from them feeling bad or negative, and I can't say the same for some of the stuff in the LWR series, speaking personally.\n\nThe monster girl character designs were all pretty great, and the team at Winged Cloud used just about every trick in the book for dungeon crawlers like this to make the game interesting to play. Minor spoiler: [spoiler]even fake walls ugh! My \"favorites\" by far. At least they had the good sense to not overuse the fake walls too much like other games I have played have done. Too much of that can be very frustrating for players, but I feel like Sakura Dungeon keeps the frequency to a sane level, which is appreciated if they are going to be included in a game at all.[/spoiler]\n\nThere were a lot of secrets to uncover and I feel like in general it was a longer game than I was expecting it to be content-wise, which was a pleasant surprise. The dungeon layout designs were great and really I have a hard time thinking of any more innovations for this kind of game that could have been done as far as tricks to throw at the player to make dungeons interesting to navigate. They really did a great job with all of what they included, keeping the experience evolving as the game went along by adding new mechanics to the dungeons worked really well.\n\nWith so many characters possible to adventure with at any given point, only a few of them were really developed in depth as main or supporting characters. However, every character had points in the story where they would offer up some dialog and so it helped bring a sense of the personality of each monster girl comrade in your party by seeing how they reacted to each scene you brought them to.\n\nSome clearly showed their preferences and inclinations towards certain persons, other monster types, activities, and even brought their specific expertise into play at times when commenting on the events taking place. It was a really nice touch I thought, giving meaning and life to characters that many other games might not have bothered telling you anything about in a similar setup.\n\nCollecting new and progressively stronger team members from among your enemies is always an enjoyable gameplay mechanic to me in games, and here it was done quite well as a central mechanic to the game. The battle system was simple and elegant, with some nice depth to keep it interesting and engaging throughout the length of the adventure.\n\nOverall I found this game very enjoyable, and while I don't really see it having a ton of replay value unless you're an achievement completionist, it was of a surprisingly good length, and I could see it being one of those games that's fun to go back through all over again later on after some time passes from your last trip through it too.\n\nWhile I don't feel like there is much room to add additional content to this game after completing it and the after story extra bits (it felt pretty full and like things were resolved well by the end) I would love to see a sequel or something with a returning cast of characters, or maybe a prequel story

I played Dungeon Sakura over. And it is a very nice game. As the name suggests, a dungeon crawler. \ud83d\ude04\n\nWith typical and beautiful Sakura pictures. (Butts and Anime Tiddies.) There are several dungeons to explore. And you can unlock a lot of secrets and stuff. You should also set a lot of memory points. You never know. There are GC's/ Ecchi pictures and simple pictures. There are different outfits in the game. \ud83d\ude18\n\nThey can all unlock certain actions. During the adventure they fight against other girls. You train while fighting and the levels rise. They also receive various attacks, which they can teach their fighters. Sometimes stronger, sometimes more. With effects that harm the opponent. Like poison. And there is much to read again. \ud83d\ude04\n\nI was more busy with exercising. But it's been fun to explore everything and listen to the music there. \ud83d\ude0a Only I was not able to unlock all the pictures. \ud83d\ude15\n\nHere is a brief statement:\n\nI played the game on the normal version. Later on the beta version. It did not work out as it should. Then I again tried everything to unlock. It did not work so well. Then I used the Cheat Guide at Steam. But just about all GC's unlock. After that I have reset everything. Cheat again removed. Room 22 has caused difficulties. I might eventually try again. I'm staying with the beta version of Sakura Dungeon. Sakura Dungeon is a very nice game. Something a pity that not everything has worked. But I liked it very much. Praise to Winged Cloud. \ud83d\ude09 \ud83d\ude0a\n\nAs I said, I tried everything, but it just did not work out. I hope it is not too bad. I've removed the cheat. I just wanted the pictures. The dungeons themselves are also beautifully designed and structured. \ud83d\ude09\n\nFeeling and Characters:\n\nProtagonists: Ceri and Yomi\nAntagonist: Vesta\nSurroundings/ Feeling: Medieval  \ud83d\udc7b\n\nSakura Dungeon is a very nice game. Have spent a lot of time with it. And it was worth it. Would highly recommend it. And there are still many games of the Winged Cloud series. \ud83d\ude07\n\nHere is my final/ end video:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebNQYlxZKJY\n\nThanks to Steam and Winged Cloud. \ud83d\udc4d", "timestamp_created": 1508410817, "timestamp_updated": 1508668312, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502924", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35835355": {"recommendationid": "35835355", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026714403", "num_games_owned": 346, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 40, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467368348}, "language": "english", "review": "came for anime boobs but found amazing dungeon gameplay and ANIME BOOBS.", "timestamp_created": 1508402153, "timestamp_updated": 1508402153, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502924", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35820999": {"recommendationid": "35820999", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125561211", "num_games_owned": 412, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 1443, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508385559}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u81ea\u5df1\u6253\u7684\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u5168CG\u5b58\u6863[url=pan.baidu.com/s/1geUghnt]\u70b9\u6211 [/url] 5jkm \u9700\u8981\u5148\u5f00\u542f\u795e\u79d8\u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u6700\u597d\u8bbe\u4e3abeta\u7248\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5c0f\u9ec4\u6cb9\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u53ef\u4ee5\u793e\u4fdd\u90a3\u4e48\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u540e\u671f\u7684\u4e0d\u5c11\u5730\u56fe\u8fd8\u662f\u5f88\u6298\u817e\u4eba\u7684\uff0c\u6218\u6597\u96be\u5ea6\u9887\u9ad8\uff0c\u60f3\u89e3\u9501\u5168CG\u4e5f\u662f\u5f88\u8d39\u5de5\u592b\u3002\n\u6240\u4ee5\u60f3\u770b\u56fe\u7247\u7684\u540c\u5b66\u53ef\u4ee5\u53ef\u4ee5\u53c2\u8003\u793e\u533a\u6307\u5357\u91cc\u5173\u4e8e\u7528\u63a7\u5236\u53f0\u4f5c\u5f0a\u7684\u6587\u7ae0\u3002\u6839\u636e\u6211\u4e2a\u4eba\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u8c03\u9ad8\u6297\u6027\u6570\u6bd4\u8f83\u597d\uff0c\u8fd9\u6837\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u514d\u75ab\u4f24\u5bb3\uff0c\u5904\u4e8e\u65e0\u654c\u72b6\u6001\u3002\n\u524d\u9762\u8bf4\u4e86\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u4e0d\u5c11\u5730\u56fe\u76f8\u5f53\u6709\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u60f3\u7701\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u8bdd\u5efa\u8bae\u770b\u7740\u6307\u5357\u91cc\u90a3\u7bc7\u5173\u4e8e\u5730\u56fe\u53ca\u7269\u54c1\u7684\u653b\u7565\uff0c\u987a\u4fbf\u628a\u670d\u88c5\u90fd\u641c\u96c6\u9f50\u4e86\u3002\n\u6d41\u7a0b\u53caCG\u641c\u96c6\u540c\u53c2\u8003\u793e\u533a\u6307\u5357\u3002\u4f46\u662f\u90e8\u5206\u6d41\u7a0b\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e0d\u662f\u5f88\u8be6\u7ec6\uff0c\u53ef\u53c2\u8003\u8fd9\u4e24\u7bc7\u82f1\u6587\u653b\u7565\uff08\u6ce8\u610f\u6709part2\uff09\n[spoiler]\u6ce8\u610f\uff1a\u6709\u4e9b\u60c5\u666f\u7ea7CG\u5fc5\u987b\u6253\u4e86\u795e\u79d8\u8865\u4e01\u624d\u6709[/spoiler]\n[url=www.otakulair.com/english-visual-novel-walkthroughs/sakura-dungeon-walkthrough-winged-cloud/]\u4f20\u9001\u95e8[/url]\n\u8fd9\u6b3e\u5c0f\u9ec4\u6cb9\u5e94\u8be5\u6765\u8bf4\u8fd8\u662f\u5341\u5206\u826f\u5fc3\u7684\uff0cCG\u6709120\u5f20\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u753b\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u90fd\u975e\u5e38\u9ad8\uff0c[strike] \u8db3\u591f\u6765\u4e00\u53d1\u4e86[/strike]\n\u5267\u60c5\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6bd4\u8f83\u5570\u55e6\uff0c\u6211\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\u53ea\u770b\u4e86\u793e\u4fdd\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u53cd\u6b63\u5927\u610f\u5e94\u8be5\u5c31\u662f\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u6ca1\u6709\u96c4\u6027\u751f\u7269\u5168\u662f\u59b9\u5b50\u7684\u7f8e\u597d\u4e16\u754c\u91cc[spoiler]\u4f46\u662f\u5947\u602a\u7684\u662f\u5374\u6709\u4e0d\u5c11\u5047JJ[/spoiler],\u4e00\u53ea\u6296S\u7684\u72d0\u72f8\u7cbe\u548c\u4e3b\u89d2\u4e00\u8d77\u4e0d\u65ad\u6536\u670d\u540e\u5bab\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\u3002\n+\u4eba\u8bbe\u8fd8\u662f\u76f8\u5f53\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u6570\u91cf\u5f88\u591a\uff0c\u798f\u5229\u6ee1\u6ee1\uff0c[spoiler]\u5f88\u591a\u767e\u5408[/spoiler]\n+\u89e3\u9501\u5168CG\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ef\u73a9\u6027\u5f88\u9ad8\n-\u6e38\u620f\u6709\u4e9b\u5730\u65b9\u8fd8\u662f\u6bd4\u8f83\u7c97\u7cd9", "timestamp_created": 1508341791, "timestamp_updated": 1508405016, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.758948", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35807775": {"recommendationid": "35807775", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085536907", "num_games_owned": 200, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 571, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508366266}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun time killer.

The 18+ content makes it more understandable, the family version stretches things a bit to make things fit together, where as it flows smoothly with the adult parts left in. 15+ version (ie; steam) just leaves ALOT more to your imagination.\nI was totally enjoying it \"as is\" on the steam version, so you do not need the patch to enjoy this well concieved game. (The perv in me just likes it better intact, heheh) \n\nPro's: Fun time waster\n          Excellent character art!! (Yummy)\n          Great music and sound effects that fit\n          Good story, characters are \"fleshed out\" (sorry, heheh) and you care about them by the end.\n          Decently long with plenty of optional sidequesting\n          Sense of accomplishment capturing the girls to make your army\n\nCon's: All lesbian all the time....(ok maybe not a con, heheh. But no men allowed!)\n           Some gramatical errors (They do have a spot to list bugs and such though!)\n           Have to find the \"Real\" 18+ version outside of Steam. (it makes things make more sense storywise, but not a game breaker!)\n           Battles can become a bit repetative....thank you autobattle and autoskip....heheh..\n           By the end You have a main group, so capturing new girls is pretty much just pokemoning.....gotta snatch'em all...\n           NEEDS DLC!! MOAR CONTENT, EXPANSIONS!!!\n\nHope this helps, I got this from a Humble Bundle pack, but will buy sequel the second it launches if they make one!\n\n:side note: I play offline so I've actually got over 50hrs into this, but Steam hates syncing with my Mac....", "timestamp_created": 1508287708, "timestamp_updated": 1508287802, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502924", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35807735": {"recommendationid": "35807735", "author": {"steamid": "76561198297727855", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1762, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510477883}, "language": "english", "review": "Stryker that's me, on CrashFM, now i'll have to say that this IMO (in my opinion) this game i prefer it as the best Sakura game.\n\nSpeaking of which, lets make a review on this. Let's get going blazin' fast:\n\nThis game is sorta like a PokeMon-ish where the thing is that the original Pokemon is been replaced by some cute anime monster girls. In the story you play as Yomi, the ancient fox spirit. basiclly progress through with one of the 3 difficulties: Normal, Hard & Abyssmal. Also you can recruit some of the characters to your party like i.e: Ryuuou\nAlthough its like 13 Dollars in the U.S.A and 180$ in my country, its kinda fun and a bit challenging. infact the game is a Dungeon crawler and has no anime dudes. soo it is like a Lesbian type game (female to female relationships are presesnt) The characters suit very well to this game tbh\n\nBefore i go, i want to mention there IS a uncensored patch if you want to see some...well you know what i mean OR if you were since 1999 (after your 18th birthday if we say for example) even tho i am 15 years old, \nFinal Score of all the games: 98/100 \nFinal Score above all of the Sakura games i have: 100/100\n\nThat was my public service review brough you by Stryker on CrashFM!\n\nPS: If you like anime(like i do) or Pokemon, this may be the game for you ;)\nPPS: This game has been nominated recently by me", "timestamp_created": 1508287498, "timestamp_updated": 1511415070, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2,

Voice acting is not present, the game is still 720p in resolution.  You must opt in to the beta version to get all the fixes.\n\nPros:\nIt\u2019s an actual game (dungeon crawler) and not purely a VN that is surprisingly quite addictive to play. You can save anytime you are not in battle which I really like. The amount of CG\u2019s in the game far exceeds any of the Sakura VN games that I have played. The story is straightforward, easy to follow and has a proper ending.  The soundtrack used is well mastered, complements the scenes in the game and are nice to listen to.  There are cool bonus end game dungeons as well as another boss to fight after the story ends. \n\nCons:\nCome on why is the art still 720p in resolution? The UI scales correctly with the resolution that you set the game to but everything else is still 720p. The monsters in the game seriously look just like girls cosplaying with almost every outfit they wear being slooty and quite out of place in my opinion.  You also must opt in to the beta version of the game manually in steam to get the latest version with all the fixes. I\u2019m not sure why they never finished patching this game.

The story for this one isn't as detailed as other sakura games for obvious reasons but it still has interesting encounters/dialogues between Yomi and other team members. Out of the whole game I enjoyed recruiting monsters the most, not the ones u capture but the special ones like Anubis or the Twins where you have to do some mini quest in order for someone strong to join your team. I also like the fact that every monster u meet is eligible to join your team, you can have a mix and match team of waifus. \n\nP.S. u can play it with one hand if you prefer using your other hand for.... anime waifu purposes", "timestamp_created": 1506890151, "timestamp_updated": 1506890151, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35392806": {"recommendationid": "35392806", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989126720", "num_games_owned": 541, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506803737}, "language": "english", "review": "please don't tell my mum i play this", "timestamp_created": 1506883875, "timestamp_updated": 1506883875, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 30, "weighted_vote_score": "0.728893", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35387632": {"recommendationid": "35387632", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985327991", "num_games_owned": 809, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1577, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 12, "last_played": 1515390441}, "language": "english", "review": "Many years ago, there was a type of game called the \"dungeon crawl\".

That said, Sakura Dungeon is one of the first good dungeon crawls I've played in years.\n\nThe party management and battle system are very reminiscent of Pokemon's triple battles, where you have three of your monsters out in the field at once, and you're required to manage the stats and moves of your active and reserve party in order to have type/elemental coverage against the wild enemies you may encounter. The art is great, and many of the dungeon floors have different aesthetics so that they each have their own \"feel\" to them as you progress.

To be honest, I've always thought the Sakura games were pretty trashy and even as joke experiences they're a bit of a slog.  Such to say, I wouldn't recommend the other games in the series, or at least Sakura Spirit.  The writing isn't particularly grand, the art's what you make of it (though I will say that the games with guest art do certainly deserve praise for their art alone), and I honestly don't know what you'd be expecting with these that you couldn't get out of other better visual novels.  Ecchi, Eroge, or otherwise.\n\nBut this one had my eye simply because it was pretty outwardly apparent that despite the series' routes, Sakura Dungeon was a game first and a visual novel second, and that despite the sexual nature of the series that, here, would be the icing on the cake rather than the main contents themselves.  The main game was about collecting enemies and using them to build a growing party as you delved into a deep-spanning dungeon.\n\nThese days, DRPGs aren't exactly uncommon.  In fact, when this was released they were probably at the height of their popularity in recent years, but with Moero Chronicle yet to be released on PC at the time, it made sense that Sakura Dungeon would take the opportunity to fill the void, striking while the iron was hot.  And it certainly came in guns blazing, because while I won't completely lavish praise over what I've experienced, the experience so far has been pretty exclusively pleasant and exceeding the low (albeit high for a Sakura title) expectations I had set for this game.\n\nThe music, which, so far, isn't particularly plentiful, is incredibly soothing when it wants to be and is easy on the ears any other time.  Quality's the name of the game here, and so far Sakura Dungeon wins that handily, to the point that despite the grindy nature of the genre I never really feel like turning down the music and putting in my own jams.\n\nThe art is...well, it's standard Sakura art.  There's no guest artist this time around so this is pretty much exactly what you'll see in most other games in the series.  Personally I think the art is just okay, it looks better than the dime a dozen random VNs that you'll see pop up but that really is about as much of a pro as I can give it.  The character designs are okay, though it doesn't really sell the provocative nature of the game too well save for by giving the characters large breasts, shiny skin, and fair amounts of unclothed areas, which is pretty bog standard.  Compare this to Huniepop, which, if budget = quality, really had no business looking better than any Sakura title, managed to (despite being a bit rough around the edges) create designs that were colorful, individual, and provocative as hell without relying simply on the fact that the girls were buxom and showed skin...well, I think you can see what I'm getting at here.\n\nThe writing's subpar but it's not nearly as bad as it could be.  Or, to put it another way, while the actual quality of the writing is particularly mediocre and lacking in any particular flair, but it seems like whoever was writing it didn't get the memo that they were making a Sakura game.  It's not trashy in any sense of the word and, surprisingly, there's a good amount of character-emphasis, in the script, even among the generic enemies-turned-recruits.  It's actually quite refreshing to see one of the monsters I captured chime in on something the main characters are discussing, even if they're quickly swept off to the side.  It makes the capture mechanic feel more substantial, and the non-story focused mobs feel more like actual people rather than simply sheep to the slaughter and pawns in an army.  That the monsters also have motives for wanting to join you makes only adds to this.\n\nAnd so far that's all to be said for the game, but I think that's enough to understand my faith in this game prior to having bought it.  It's not a bad DRPG at all, and while $19.99 might be a bit much, I do certainly think that if you're looking for a good Monster Catching Dungeon Crawl on the PC, Sakura Dungeon is a pleasant surprise that will likely suit your needs.", "timestamp_created": 1505931166, "timestamp_updated": 1505931166, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512821", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35080863": {"recommendationid": "35080863", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038971666", "num_games_owned": 4362, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 2047, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505574009}, "language": "english", "review": "I got this game in a bundle and decided on a whim to try it.\n\nThis was my first dungeon crawler and honestly, these are probably not for me.

Schritte durch das Areal)\n\nFans der Reihe k\u00f6nnen aufatmen: Auch hier geht es um Damen mit respektabler Oberweite, die zu dem noch leicht bekleidet sind.\n\nWer keine Lust auf den Wall of Text hat, scrollt ganz runter zur Zusammenfassung\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nF\u00fcr einen Titel der \"ber\u00fcchtigten\" Sakurareihe, in der es haupts\u00e4chlich um junge Damen mit respektabler Oberweite geht, hat das Spiel recht tiefg\u00e4ngiges Gameplay, das sogar auf dem \"Normal\" Level im sp\u00e4teren Verlauf des Spiels gewisses taktisches Know-How fordert (sofern man kein Fan stundenlanger gegnerklopperei zwecks Auflevelns der Charaktere ist) \n\nWie in einem \"Klicker\" \u00fcblich, spielt man in der Egoperspektive und bewegt sich via Knopfdruck genau einen Schritt vorw\u00e4rts (mehrere, wenn man die Taste gedr\u00fcckt h\u00e4lt, es ist aber keine fl\u00fcssige Laufbewegung), r\u00fcckw\u00e4rts, zur Seite  oder dreht sich nach links oder rechts. \n\nGegner erscheinen via Randomencounter, das bedeutet, man sieht sie nicht, bis der Kampf beginnt und sie erscheinen zuf\u00e4llig beim herumlaufen im Dungeon, sowie in zuf\u00e4lliger Formation von bis zu drei St\u00fcck auf ein Mal. \n\nIm Kampf entscheidend  sind hier, anders wie in RPGs \u00fcblich, nicht unbedingt die Statuswerte der Kombatanten (wobei diese auch wichtig sind) sondern eher der Level, denn Gegner, die einen h\u00f6heren level als die Gruppe haben, erlangen Boni im Kampf, die den Kampfablauf teils enorm beeinflussen k\u00f6nnen. Statuswerte wie St\u00e4rke oder Vitalit\u00e4t hingegen, bringen kleinere Boni, haben allerdings mehrere Aufgaben. So erh\u00f6ht st\u00e4rke nicht nur den Schaden, den man mittels physischer Angriffe anrichtet, sondern verringert auch den erlittenen Schaden durch solche.\n\nEbenfalls wichtig sind diverse Ressourcen im Kampf, die sich zwar nach und nach erholen, aber bei unachtsamen gebrauch schnell zur Neige gehen. \nVP-Vitalit\u00e4tspunkte. Wenn sie bei null sind, ist der Charakter Kampfunf\u00e4hig\nAP-Abilitypunkte. Haben unterschiedliche Verwendungsm\u00f6glichkeiten. Fast jeder Skill im Spiel verbraucht welche und je mehr man davon hat, desto eher ist man in der Lage, feindliche Angriffe zu blocken oder ihnen auszuweichen\nCP-Konzentrationspunkte (oder Concentrationpoints) Sie werden f\u00fcr manche Techniken ben\u00f6tigt und sch\u00fctzen einen Charakter vor zust\u00e4nden, die seine Treffer- und Ausweichquote beintr\u00e4chtigen. Wenn der Wert 10 erreicht, gelangt man in einen Zustand, in dem das genaue Gegenteil der Fall ist. Die Treffer und Auswechquote werden erh\u00f6ht.\n\nSollte man es schaffen, einem Gegner die Kleidung zu besch\u00e4digen, erleidet dieser Abz\u00fcge in seiner Regeneration\n(Das ist also nicht nur ein grafisches Feature) \n\nEin in der Vorstellung bereits erw\u00e4hntes Feature ist die M\u00f6glichkeit, gefallene Gegner zu fangen. Das ist nicht sehr pr\u00e4zise ausgedr\u00fcckt, denn damit ein Gegner gefangen werden kann, muss man einen speziellen Skill auf ihn anwenden und ihn damit auch besiegen. Zudem darf der Gegner im Level nicht h\u00f6her sein, als der Anwender des Skills und von jeder Monsterspezies kann man nur ein einziges Exemplar besitzen.\n\nEine Sache, die mir erst als Gameplaypatzer ins Auge gefallen ist, ist der Umstand, dass niemand, au\u00dfer der Ritterin, die man von Beginn an steuert, durch Level-Ups wirklich st\u00e4rker wird bzw sich deren Statuswerte nicht erh\u00f6hen. In einigen Reviews wird das als schlecht dargestellt, macht aber in Anbetracht der Menge an m\u00f6glichen begleitern, die man haben kann, dem Umstand, dass Statuswerte nicht alles sind und der Tatsache, dass man recht bald zugang zu Attributseigernden Items hat (die Begrenzungen unterliegen, weshalb man nicht alles in die Protagonisten stecken kann)\ngarnicht mal so abwegig ist.\n\n[h1]Grafik, Soundtrack[/h1]\nDie Grafik ist recht gut und in HD. Die Artworks der Gegner und Cutscenes sind hochwertig.\nDer Soundtrack ist gut, kein zeitloses Meisterwerk, aber gut.\n\n[h1]Zusammenfassung[/h1]\n[b]Pro[/b]\n[list]\n    [*]gro\u00dfer Dungeon mit vielen Features wie Fallt\u00fcren, Geheimg\u00e4ngen und seichter R\u00e4tselkost\n    [*]Vielzahl an Gegnern, von denen die meisten fangbar sind\n    [*]taktisch relativ tiefg\u00e4ngies aber eing\u00e4ngiges Kampfsystem\n    [*]Viele gezeichnete Cutscenes auch ohne den Uncensoing-Patch (mit Patch sind es nat\u00fcrlich mehr)\n    [*]Ingamegallerie mit Cutscenes und Charaktersprites\n[/list]\n\n[b]Kontra[/b]\n[list]\n    [*]teils fragw\u00fcrdige Zensur (Viele Cutscenes sind nur mit Patch sichtbar und einige davon sind nicht expliziter als die, die ohne Patch sichtbar sind)\n    [*]Hauptcharaktere extrem overpowered im Vergleich zum Rest\n[/list]\n\n[b]Fazit[/b]\nSakura Dungeon ist, von der Seite betrachtet, ein normaler Dungeoncrawler, wo s\u00e4mtliche handelnde Personen junge Frauen sind (mit respektabler Oberweite). Fans von kurzweiligen Dungeoncrawlern und Fanservice durch leicht bekleidete Damen k\u00f6nnen beherzt zugreifen. Wer kein wirklicher Fan von diesen Dingen ist, wird am Spiel wohl auch keinen Spa\u00df haben. Ich habe gewusst, was auf mich zu kommt und wurde sogar positiv \u00fcberrascht (auf gameplayebene) daher von mir eine Kaufempfehlung.", "timestamp_created": 1505721472, "timestamp_updated":

good  game. The art is good, the story is good, the level design is good. The game engine is rather on the basic side, but it supports a great gameplay, enhanced by all the positive elements aforementioned. \n\nSure, the art is full of cute anime girls, and each one is very much sexualized. This is probably a selling point for the game  (NB: I played maybe a third of the game before I realized there is a 18+ patch. Then I installed it. And sure, it adds plenty of lewd scenes and images with the cute girls and cute monsters). But the gameplay goes far beyond its cute anime sexualized facade.\n\nIt's enjoyable and fun, and it lasts quite a bit, more than one expects of most games, nowadays. So, if you are  into dungeon crawlers and your tolerance (or attraction) toward cute/sexy anime girls (most of them are seen naked with the 18+ patch), I can recommend wholeheartedly this title for maybe 20 hours of exploration...\n\nI got it at a sacrificed price in a bundle, and I feel guilty for that.

Yeah, I get it, Winged Cloud's 'reputation' and all that, but even going into *that*, some of their other games aren't even really terrible(Fantasy was alright but the writer left the team IIRC, and Spirit had some kind of genuine quality put into it). I consider this some-what akin to the latest dungeon crawler I have played(Wizardry 8, more similar to the previous games that weren't free-roam and were more step-by-step gameplay). Another game that I believe is a lot more obscure that this is clearly inspired by is DMC(Demon Master Chris).\n\nI feel like I should touch on Gameplay first since that will surprise anyone straight off. Yes, this game has gameplay. It's a pretty decent dungeon crawler and, as another review stated, it's \"wizardry, with a modern touch of weeb\". Weeb jokes aside, it's very wizardy-like(as I consider wizardry a classic dungeon crawler series). The combat is simple turn-based. You use AP for abilities and HP for health. Under 50% HP, criticals remove what little your characters have on as clothing, because yes this has to be mentioned. This reduces your HP regen outside of combat and I believe inside of combat as well. Outside of combat, the gameplay is more or less your standard dungeon crawler exploring. One notable thing that bothered me was that lots of the destructable containers didn't really have anything in them, so some exploring felt pointless but I always like to fully fill out my maps anyways. Aside from that, the gameplay was very well done and near the end it actually started getting pretty fun.\n\nThe story is kind of a standard \"clear out the dungeon and defeat its dungeon lord\" fantasy story, except you find out immedietally that you play as the previous dungeon lord and someone else has taken your place over the last few hundred years you've been asleep. You are attacked by a knight adventurer, you defeat her, and then you put her under a contract of sorts to enlist her help. So thus' begins the adventure. I wouldn't say there's anything special about it but I also won't say it's bad. There's a few grammar issues, but it's mostly in misplaced words here and there. I will say that it was enjoyable to listen to every character's responses to each situation, as every character in your current party tends to say something at event locations.\n\nSoundtrack usually works alongside every Sakura game in a decent way. Soundtrack was pretty good in this game but nothing particularly special. \n\nNow, obviously there's the \"winged cloud makes porn games\" 'meme' and that's depending on how you look at it. With the 18+ patch, it adds in certain scenes you wouldn't see otherwise that are very descriptive, and the non-adult specific scenes have under-18 version to them. At the most, they are very implied in the under-18 versions. That being said, they're good at what they do and I would be lying if I were to say it specifically ruins the game. What I would say is that if you don't want to see it then you could just not get the patch and suffer through the ecchi scenes but you have to consider that it's still a Sakura game, it's going to be there. Usually it's amusing at the very least.\n\nI mean come on, this is winged cloud's \"first game\" as far as I know, and it's pretty good. I got 20 genuine hours out of it and I got it from the Humble Bundle for as cheap as... $11? Pretty good, and I'd say it was worth it. Possibly not worth $21 but definitely worth $10. They could definitely get away with making more games like these, maybe even expanding off of this game and making it better. What makes this game better is that all of their previous games were visual novels that everyone just sort of made fun of, and then they released this game and it's a full-fledged game that's actually *really* good. If you like dungeon crawlers and you know what to expect from a Sakura game, then go ahead and get this.

There isn't any tedious tasks to get certain items or crafting as you either give the items to the npcs in town or buy a limited set of items from the store so it's refreshing but, feels very simplified. The capturing system is pretty unique and in a way reminds me of SMT: Strange Journey which is vital to keeping a strong party in the game. The story isn't all that great because the characters don't seem to have too much depth and background but, they're fun to an extent since most seem to have pretty redundent lines affixed to their personalities. There is also a patch for those who are interested in seeing more explicit content.\n\nTo sum it up it's more of a harem collecting ecchi VN with dungeon crawler mechanics.\nIf you're into what I just described, I'd recommend it, If not, just give it a hard pass. (We all know this is for the lewd content anyways) \nIn my opinion it's neither great or bad. If you're looking for a good dungeon crawler there should be better at around the same price.

This game is actually pretty good, despite what it may seem at first glance.\n\nSakura Dungeon is a game that can basically be described by \"Wizardry but with a modern weeb touch\". In other words, it's a first-person dungeon crawling game with VN elements, RPG elements, and a lot of anime tiddies. If you've played other games developed by Winged Cloud, this is similar to those, but with a heavy emphasis on the RPG gameplay.\n\nThe game is actually quite good. The main character is an large-chested ex-dungeon master who awakens from a long slumber by a rowdy adventurer with... similar-sized assets. She then finds out that she had been sealed away, and in the meantime, her dungeon was taken over by an usurper. She then decides to retake her dungeon with the help of her newfound friend. Along the way, you befriend \"monsters\" in the dungeon to assist you on your quest, a la Pokemon. To be honest, the story isn't anything super amazing, but it'll keep you entertained. The best part of this game is the art and gameplay.\n\nThe art doesn't need to be mentioned about all that much. Just your standard, colorful Winged Cloud ecchi drawings. Most, if not all of them, contain ideal camera angles of anime girls in very suggestive positions whilst wearing little to no clothing. This time, there are plentiful CGs to unlock (two for each monster, and then some), so every time one is unlocked, it's always a treat. I, like many others, recommend you download the R18 patch, which can be found on WC's Patreon.\n\nUnlike other Sakura games, gameplay in Sakura Dungeon is reminiscent of first-person dungeon crawlers, such as Wizardry, Etrian Odyssey, old-school Shin Megami Tensei, etc. You move around the dungeon with WASDQE or the on-screen directional pad, and during battle you can use a mouse for selections. The combat system is a little hard to grasp at first, but you'll get used to it in no time. For a quick summary and explanation, see below (you can skip to the next section if you don't care):\n\n-All units have VP and AP (in other games, they would be HP and MP, respectively). Units also have CP as well (more info down below). VP and AP regenerate per turn.\n-AP is consumed when you do any sort of action outside of Guard, or when you get hit.\n-The lower your AP is, the easier it is for enemies to hit you. Therefore, it's better to use less-accurate, more-powerful attacks when the difference between your AP and the enemy's AP is significant. Use more-accurate, less-powerful attacks when their AP is high.\n-The more damage you take, the more your clothes will rip, until there is almost nothing left (the tiddies and the parts \"down there\" are revealed in all their glory [b]IF[/b] you have the uncensor patch, but nothing really sexually explicit). Your automatic VP and AP regeneration is slowed down, among various other nerfs. You will need to return home and pay a fee to fix your clothing.\n-When you land an attack, your CP increases by 1. When your CP reaches 10, you essentially become invincible and can spam your low-accurate moves to your heart's content. Conversely, if your CP reaches 0, you're pretty much helpless and should switch out to the backrow.\n\nI [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/407330/discussions/0/358415738179023426/][b][u]HIGHLY RECOMMEND[/u][/b][/url] downloading the excellent 'Abyssal Makeover' and 'Additional Dialogue' mods for this game by shadowwolftjc, in addition to the Uncensor patch by Winged Cloud. Shadow's mods really do overhaul many of the games flaws that other reviewers have touched on, and makes the overall experience much more enjoyable. You can find his mods in the Discussions page. Thanks, Shadow!\n\nOverall, Sakura Dungeon is a really fun game. If you're interested in old-school first-person dungeon crawlers or just really like anime tiddies (or both, like me), I definitely recommend this game. And don't forget the mods I mentioned!

Reminds me of really oldschool RPGs, back in the 90s, with some twists, and plenty of boobies :P I like the writing - again, not shakespear but the different characters have very distinct personalities and they chime in quite often, which adds a lot of life to the whole experience. I'm not sure how to write an informative review, so I'll leave it at what's been said - I'm just here to endorse the game because I enjoy it and from what I've seen in stands out in terms of quality.\n\nAlso, for you pervs out there, if you browse other reviews you'll find links (some broken, some not) to the \"uncensored patch\" which allows you to play the game how it was originally released, not the (in my opinion) overly censored steam release.\n\nEnjoy! :D", "timestamp_created": 1504698729, "timestamp_updated": 1504698729, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.608113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34770700": {"recommendationid": "34770700", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036145790", "num_games_owned": 555, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 1502, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505317696}, "language": "english", "review": "Asked a friend for a copy on HumbleBundle out of a joke and the game turns out to be ACTUALLY hell of fun dispite the naked chinese cartoons on it.\n\nIt's a classic and simple RPG battle system with Dungeon Crawling mixed on it, you know, the ORIGINAL dungeon crawling, where you walk on a 3D maze.\n\nAlso there's some kind of Capture system....

hard difficulty setting (don't mind the lack of achievements saying so, the restoration patch seems to screw up some of the achievements).\n\nSakura dungeon is a grindy, build-your-own team dungeon crawler. It doubles as an h-game, so don't expect an amazing/emotionally moving story. However, you can at least expect something to keep you tied to the game until the very end.\n\nIn regards to the gameplay; there are alot of things this game did right. For one, the challenge of assembling a formidable team at the beginning of the game was one of the most enjoyable parts of this whole experience. Until you obtain (or level up) some powerful characters you get later on in the game, choosing which monsters to bring into the dungeon was a unique experience. Each character has their own set of active and passive skills; and unless you're really lucky, those skill scrolls that you find in chest only come once in a while so you better make them count!\n\nThere is a fine balance between the three 'types' of attacks: melee, ranged, and magic. Although I did not find myself using ranged characters often, I found that fine tuning my team to fight off all types of enemies as I progressed through the dungeon was very enjoyable. You may find that one skill is unarguably straight-up better than another, but that character may have better stats/other skills that fit with your team. Overall, the team-building and combat system is balanced and I enjoyed it thoroughly.\n\nMy greatest gripe with this game is that it's as grindy (perhaps a bit less) than other dungeon crawlers I have played. At least for the hard difficulty setting, it's fine to fight the floor boss while being underleveled; Afterall, it's 6 against 1. As a sexy feminized version of Ash Ketchum, I want to collect all the monsters in the game so I can build the best team possible. It forces the player to use Ceri (or another character later) to be the same level of what you want to capture. This means that the game pretty much forces to use Ceri/whoever with capture always on your main team to soak up all the XP. At least Ceri eventually becomes one of the strongest characters in the game, but you may not use another character with the capture skill on your main team always. The game could've mitigated this by increasing the XP or having a fair-share of XP among all monsters in your party (The master skill, the one that does exactly this, is only for one character and it's still a tiny amount!)\n\nOverall, this is a great dungeon crawler to sink 30+ hours into. As a plus, most of the characters are pretty charming and they made the character development of a few characters actually legit. I don't plan on playing through the other sakura games as I enjoy my eroges with either real gameplay or an interesting story, but I can highly recommend this game if you don't mind the once-in-a-while tireless grinding.\n\nGrinding still not as bad as some games though.

You should know if this is your type of game from this premise alone, but I'll try to help if you're undecided.\n\nIs this game worth $19.99? Probably not. Animation is essentially non-existent, with only a few unimpressive effects for attacks, and dungeon crawling being a first person affair reminiscent of 80's RPGs. There's no voice acting work whatsoever either. However the character art is all solid, the background art that isn't the lame dungeon design looks generally gorgeous, and while the soundtrack isn't the most expansive I enjoyed all of the tracks, music ranging from relaxing to whimsical to being legitimately ominous. And of course there are many, many lewd CGs you'll come across that are pretty sexy. Still I'd try to wait for this game being on sale before picking it up.\n\nThe RPG combat itself is uninvolved, a turn-based menu selection affair with a focus on action point management. Only a handful of moves offer anything besides \"deal w damage to x targets using y type of damage at z chance to hit.\" It's not the most exciting thing in the world, but it's functional, and that was good enough for me. Critical hits will sometimes cause characters clothes to be damaged, revealing even more skin (which is the only sign of injury people sustain in this setting, amusingly enough), but it's not very relevant on a gameplay level. It doesn't require ludicrous amounts of grinding to level your characters decently, since exploring dungeon floors thoroughly will level your characters enough all on its own. The dungeon crawling itself is bare bones but passable as well, with each floor usually having some kind of gimmick to keep you interested, ranging from invisible walls to finding keys to pitfalls, standard fare.\n\nHowever the most disappointing aspect of the game is the 'capture' mechanic, which is billed as one of the most important features. It's very Pokemon-esque, where you're trying to lower opponent's health totals before capturing them (by the way I'm really glad this is an all-female game because a dude capturing random women would make me feel more uncomfortable, no matter how polite he was). But unlike in Pokemon you can't really pick favorite 'monsters' to optimize and level up. The unique characters you recruit over the game are flat out better than the capturable monsters, and unlike a typical RPG you can't change the movesets or abilities of your monsters to a significant degree, only being able to use  scrolls, very limited one-shot items that are the equivalent of TMs from Pokemon, to teach generic moves that aren't much better than what your monster starts with. You can also improve stats using seeds, but they're also hard to come by, and ludicrously expensive to buy from the item store, so you'll end up only significantly boosting the stats of a few characters. \n\nThis sucks because there are many, many cute monster girls, something like over 50 of them, that you'll run into while dungeon crawling. They have cute, boobtastic designs and they'll have amusing unique quips to say whenever they're part of your dungeon-delving party. But it's extremely hard to justify keeping them in your party for more than a few floors, since they'll become obsolete way too damn quickly. Leveling any character in your party will not improve their base states or naturally let them gain new moves, while new monster your see deeper in the dungeon will have higher base stats and somewhat better moves, and the unique characters you pick up will have the best stats and moves of all. And bizarrely there's no achievement for collecting monsters, so there's no incentive at all to \"catch 'em all.\"\n\nBut despite the mediocre gameplay and the failure of the capture mechanic, what makes me able to recommend the game is the lewdness (of course), the characters, and the writing, surprisingly enough. It's aware of its trappings as a generic fantasy setting and goes to minor lengths to explain the functioning of the setting, explaining why the main character had a dungeon in the first place, where magic comes from, how teleporters work, a little of the mythology of the setting, just minor lines here and there that do a lot to help sell the game as believable to me (even if they never, ever say why everyone is a semi-naked anime girl). Plus, despite the capture theme of the game it does a good job of avoiding feeling too rapey, always feeling bubbly and upbeat during its many kinky moments. The story itself is not very interesting, but I don't feel like that's all that important. Decent characterization is far more valuable in a game like this.\n\nThe main character, an ancient fox spirit named Yomi, is a pleasant, seductive, yet protective individual. She lives in a setting where literally every character and monster is a sexy, lewd girl, with almost all of them being friendly, and her characterization makes perfect sense considering that fact. True, she spends the whole game banging anyone who's eager and willing, but she also always tries to convince monsters to help her cause,  and is always fiercely protective of her underlings, to the point where it's almost her catchphrase. She says she loves every one of her subjects, and I can believe it. So basically if you have a MILF fetish you'll love her.\n\nThe other main character is named Ceri, an adventuring knight who is Yomi's first recruit. She's Yomi's plaything in the course of the game, being subject to relentless teasing and being compelled to wear ridiculous costumes like bikinis and lingerie into battle. But what's interesting about her is that she's a human, a middling adventurer who as the game progresses becomes more and more powerful and starts questioning what a person should do when they're capable of  eventually defeating gods. I was not expecting a porn game to ask what it means to be human, and while this game isn't very philosophical, the fact that it's brought up at all is impressive. Plus her and Yomi's growing relationship in the course of the game is honestly adorable to see.\n\nOverall I can recommend Sakura Dungeon. The gameplay sucks a bit, but if you don't mind that in favor of lewd girls doing lewd things then snag this game.

Before I do start with the real review, I will say that you should download the uncensored patch if you really want the full experience. With that out of the way, let's talk Sakura Dungeon.\n\nSakura Dungeon is a dungeon crawler, turn-based, hentai (with the uncensored patch), RPG where you have to guide your characters to the end of a dungeon because of two things: \"plot\" and story (if you get the joke, congratulations). The dungeon is divided into several sections to indicate progress and as your characters level up they will become stronger and you will replace them with new ones. The two protagonist are the only characters that can switch outfits, so the game offers several version of some of the \"monsters\". The story is a little bit better than what you would expect from a Sakura game, but the characters are really well made and have actual character growth. The game has a simple combat system, but its difficulty keeps it from getting stale (I played in hard and almost didn't grind so I was most of the time underleveled, but I had the most fun this way). The game has the same art-style as Sakura Spirits, Sakura Angels, Sakura Fantasy and Sakura Swim Club. The fanservice (or hentai with the patch) is what you would expect, just with monster girls instead of human ones mostly, and the game has good humor. In general, if you want a Sakura game with actual gameplay, or you are looking for a good anime game, or you just want a simple light-hearted RPG to play after you finished Diablo or Skyrim, then buy this game, download the patch and start a new game (I recommend in hard difficulty as it is the most fun for me).\nWarning: In case it was not clear enough: this game is not for kids because it has a lot of erotic content (and even more with the patch)!", "timestamp_created": 1492359609, "timestamp_updated": 1492359609, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31094675": {"recommendationid": "31094675", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069159152", "num_games_owned": 720, "num_reviews": 460, "playtime_forever": 892, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492191717}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a very interesting game. Out of all the Sakura titles this is the one likeliest to have the longest playtime. Mostly because it is a dungeon crawl with some Visual novel elements. You are trying to clear a dungeon while under the influence of a fox spirit that wants her dungeon back. That fox spirit does not seem like a really bad creature, just one that is... mischievous. Along the way you can recruit more party members, including the monsters you fight (for them it is more or less a better deal since the fox spirit is a far more benevolent ruler).\n\nThe game also comes with achievements and Trading Cards.

However, you know your off to a good start when the gamer creators add that obligatory reference to modern events in their games. In this case fucking Isis; not only that, but apparently their ruled by a Queen, who knew?\n          In this game you play as the Character Yomi, who is a Kitsune (A fox human hybrid for all you twats who don't know) that has been asleep for hundreds of years inside a magical crystal.\nThe main goal of the game seems to be to reclaim your position as the Dungeon Lord over the local dungeon, but in a game created to appeal to males that is not the real plot.\nAnd how does one appeal to the bloated cock demographic; simple by having a game in where you catch scantily clad females and control them; this is the main plot to capture them all for your sadistic pleasure, you dick. Its sheer amazing that the main protagonist isn\u2019t a male otherwise this would be a porn faster than you can say fuck. In any case I am sure that researching the level designs on google will turn up some porn for it anyways. Not as much as Overwatch at least.\nToo the game\u2019s credit the rpg elements are not entirely half bad and it was amusing to send bunny girls scurrying away after I blew their clothes off as the ultimate form of defeat and humiliation. \n            The dialogue seemed bland and uninteresting, and I found myself staring at my wall counting the vomit induced splotch marks from the motion sickness that seized me every time I switched between the 2d combat and the first person dungeon crawling. However, this could been because all the blood to my brain was being diverted back and forth.\nThe greatest part of the game is obviously the glorious pictures that millions will fap too. However, the developers Winged Cloud studios has taken it even farther in this game by adding a description along with the scenes that would make any weak willie pleased. The developers know that the targeted demographic has such a short attention span that they loaded tons of R rated material to keep any player happy for days. The biggest problem with this is that you have to fucking patch the fucking game to get that material. In conclusion Sakura Dungeon is an entertaining game to say the least and I found it enjoyable only after I put 2 hours into it. Now if you will excuse I\u2019ve got to go wash the stains out of my new shorts\u2026", "timestamp_created": 1491678299, "timestamp_updated": 1491678662, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 74,

(Level 36) and I've been playing for over 50 hours. So I don't know if I'm taking too long to grind for each dungeon boss or if I'm playing as intended. It's a really decent dungeon crawler. The content is mildly ecchi, some minor clothing damage and a few suggestive images but not at all bad. Nothing you won't see in most anime these days. Very cute drawings from Wanaca as expected. I'm disappointed that the story is a bit too silly. The main character Yomi always manages to recruit monster girls into her party with the mildest effort. There are also too many monster girls for a party of 6. I love how cute they all are but as soon as you catch one you get rid of her and because secondary skills cannot be obtained or upgraded for anyone but the main characters (Yomi, Ceri, Maeve, Sylvi) there's no use in leveling your Cat with her Reflexes when your Nine Tails comes with Conjurer, Serenity, and Prudent. The deeper you go into the dungeon the better they get straight out of the box. All it does is make you regret using your seeds on earlier girls.\n\nFun. Better than expected. Cute. Mildly ecchi.

out to me, but you've got to admit, more value for money is a pleasant surprise... no? They put some serious effort into making an actual first-person dungeon crawler -Shining in the Darkness was another good example of the genre. I found it enjoyable from start to finish, if a little grindy; this, sadly, is pretty much a staple of the game type. If there wasn't some grind, or elaborate floor designs, you could just walk from start to finish in one very boring line, couldn't you?\n\nAll that said, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone with severe -or even mild- mammarophobia, or any other reason to want to avoid looking at breasts... if you don't find them attractive, for instance, or if you're the sort of snob who insists they must be seen IRL or else one is <Insert Slight Here>. Anyone who feels it is religiously wrong to look at breasts will be pleased to know that you need to download a patch to get your full money's worth on that front -but less pleased that I will now tell you all that this patch can be found on the internet, easily enough, along with installation instructions.\n\nThe story isn't bad, the writing's pretty good -some annoying typos and grammatical errors in the latter half, but there's a lot of text and the dev team, as I understand it, was not huge. All things considered, it could be a lot worse. The main characters were enjoyable -caring, affectionate, reasonably classy. Even the naughtier scenes (again, patch needed) feel more affectionate and well-written than the half-butted junk you'd expect from... other forms of erotica. There's a very wide variety of monster girls to meet, fight and eventually befriend, as well.\n\nIf games like this offend you, make sure to buy the game and then leave it idle for 20 minutes or so, so you can then write a joke review about playing with yourself. Or about how people are weeaboos. No, seriously, do it -you're only helping to fund what you claim to disdain so much. Or alternatively, if its existence bothers you so much, I don't know... Don't look at it...? Don't think about it? Or do you have some issues you need to resolve with yourself before you figure out how you feel about hentai?\n\nSummary: Not a bad dungeon crawler and not a bad assortment of hentai. Needs its adult patch.

Granted the only things you need to do is get the monster's health low enough for the capture spell to kill it and make sure the one using \"capture\" is at least the target's level, so it's not complicated but it's fun.\n[*]The art is clean and adorable. Yes they are known to emphasize sexiness and YES there is an \"adults only\" patch should you find the need to uncensor your game. Let's not mince words there are obvious galleries on the main menu to review your acquired scenes as well as a sprite gallery that opens up post game.\n[*]Lots of fun and interesting attacks to make the game interesting throughout. I also enjoyed the cool passives that make encountering new enemies a challenge, figuring out how the passive works as you fight a new enemy.\n[*]Map exploration feels great as you uncover the full map and, when you reach it, look for hidden spots every so often.\n[*]Quite a few fun outfits to find, create, and put on your two main characters.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]NEUTRAL[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Money is rather hard to come by which means that buying upgrade seeds or farming ability scrolls for your favorite monsters is ridiculously difficult. The game really emphasizes the player cycle out monster allies as they recruit more, which is great at getting new, more powerful base monsters but is a bit depressing to lose favorites.\n[*]Unfortunately the auto battle is a little TOO GOOD so you'll be tempted to cling to it halfway through the game once you find out how incredible it is. I still liked to manually fight tough and new enemies, but using auto + skip was rather handy.\n[*]I wish I interacted with the store more than barely at all. There's just no money or good items to sell in this game so it's hard to do anything but buy warp stones.\n[*]I can understand giving you powerful characters, but Yomi is just hilariously too strong. Once you unlock her, she NEVER becomes weak and just grows in strength as she gains new incredible passives. I enjoyed fighting with her but I felt like I had 1 less slot to consider once she was unlocked.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]BAD[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]It's incredible how much minor level differences make in combat. No level difference = fair fight. 1 level under = fine but may miss a handful of attacks. 2 levels under = going to miss a few attacks but should be ok. 3 levels under = prepare to miss quite a bit and get hit with iron fists. 4+ levels under = find gods and pray to them.\n[*]Pretty bummed to see that some achievements have bugs, including two I happened upon. Despite fulfilling the requirements, I shall never unlock these unless I replay the game.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]SUMMARY[/h1]\nI came into this game looking for a decent first person dungeon crawler with monster capturing mechanics and that's exactly what I got. With fun combat, cute monsters, a variety of outfits, and a plethora of scenes to discover make this well worth the price.

yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil\nIt's me, my honesty's brutal\nBut it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though\nFor good at least once in a while\nSo I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle\nEnough rhymes to maybe to try and help get some people through tough times\nBut I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case cause even you unsigned\nRappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime\nI know there was a time where once I\nWas king of the underground, but I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind\nSo I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine\nAppeal with the skin color of mine\nYou get too big and here they come trying to,\nCensor you like that one line I said on \"I'm Back\" from the Marshall Mathers LP\nOne where I tried to say I take seven kids from Columbine\nPut 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine\nSee if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I've\nMorphed into an immortal coming through the portal\nYou're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though\nAnd I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for\nYou're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows\nYou're like normal, fuck being normal\nAnd I just bought a new Raygun from the future\nTo just come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad\n'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhether's pad\nSingin' to a man while they played piano\nMan, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel\nSo Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day\n\"Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you\"\nLyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, (JJ Fad)\nUh, sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming I'm a human\nWhat I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman\nInnovative and I'm made of rubber\nSo that anything you saying ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you\nI'm never stating, more than never demonstrating\nHow to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating\nNever fading, and I know that the haters are forever waiting\nFor the day that they can say I fell off, they'd be celebrating\nCause I know the way to get 'em motivated\nI make elevating music, you make elevator music\nOh, he's too mainstream\nWell, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it\nIt's not hip hop, it's pop, cause I found a hella way to fuse it\nWith rock, shock rap with Doc\nThrow on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it\nI don't know how to make songs like that\nI don't know what words to use\nLet me know when it occurs to you\nWhile I'm ripping any one of these verses diverse as you\nIt's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you\nHow many verses I gotta murder to,\nProve that if you're half as nice at songs you can sacrifice virgins too uh!\nSchool flunkie, pill junky\nBut look at the accolades the skills brung me\nFull of myself, but still hungry\nI bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to\nAnd I'm a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues\nBut it's still tongue in cheek, fuck you\nI'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat\nBumping Heavy D and the Boys, still chunky, but funky\nBut in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling\nAngels fight with devils, here's what they want from me\nThey asking me to eliminate some of the women hate\nBut if you take into consideration the bitter hatred that I had\nThen you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation\nAnd understand the discrimination\nBut fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then\nBut if I can't batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?\nDon't mistake it for Satan\nIt's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas\nAnd take a vacation to trip a broad\nAnd make her fall on her face and don't be a retard\nBe a king?

This is the only one I didn't refund (Stranger in Sword City and Winged Sakura: Demon Civil War were).\n\nNote on this review, I haven't finished the game yet.  Things may change.\n\nThe Good\n\n- The user interface is cleanly designed and easy to immediately read and navigate.\n- The mini map is quick to look at and figure out what's going on in.\n- Combat is simple at first glance, with a few complexities that place it around Pokemon gen 2 in difficulty to understand.  - Even then, the in game menus and tool tips explain things quite nicely.\n- The game was immediately fun for me, once I got out of all the dialogues.\n- The game is quite similiar to Pokemon.\n\nThe Netural\n\n- Art style is the same Sakura art style that everyone has come to expect from any game titled as such here on Steam.  The artist(s) could do with improving the looks of the women to not look so cookie cutter.  I will say that the backgrounds are nice and I do tend to look around them a bit more then is needed given prior dungeon crawler games.\n- While the game is not programmed in an RPG Maker, the combat animations look like they've been copied and pasted from it.\n- The game is an immediate grind fest.  Levels are not easy to aquire as XP is earned in one of three ways, each way gives a very low amount.  (( Levels are gained by being an attacker, by defending against attacks, and by just being there (which allows the party members not fighting to gain some XP should they ever be used again).)\n- This game is a very basic dungeon crawler in all respects.\n\nThe Bad\n\n- Grind fest.  I know I put this as a netural, but due to an immediate lack of different enemies to fight, the first two to three levels of the dungeon are boring.  Once you get to level 4 and beyond, there's more enemy types and combat gets more exciting.\n- The dungeon is of a fixed designed.  Play through and explore everything once, you'll know where everything is.  There's no randomness outside of combat.\n- The game is similiar in design to how Pokemon Gen 1 is, if you started off with Charmander or Pikachu.  Level 2's boss monster is heavily resistant to physical attacks.  Followed soon after by level 3 being filled with them.  Kinda like Brock and then Mount Moon with its Rock types. \n- No character generation.  You don't design your characters and they level up automatically.  The only customization you get is appearance for the two main characters, attack scrolls (TMs), and stat boosting seeds.\n\nOverall and with my experiences thus far, I do recommend this game if you're a fan of old school Pokemon, dungeon crawlers, and don't mind the constant fanservice that all Sakura titles have to date.", "timestamp_created": 1482943956, "timestamp_updated": 1482943956,

Statt durch R\u00e4tseln oder interessante K\u00e4mpfe, versucht es euch durch die Jagd nach immer neuen Gespielinnen und schl\u00fcpfrigen Bildern bei der Stange zu halten. \u00dcberraschenderweise funktioniert das f\u00fcr einige Stunden auch ganz gut. Auf Dauer ist das Spiel eint\u00f6nig, aber das ganze Konzept ist eh mehr auf ein Spiel f\u00fcr Zwischendurch ausgelegt.

I know that when one walks into the game the only first thing they can think about is boobs and anime girls, but there is more to the game then meets the eye. I really enjoy the turn style based fighting, one thing I wish was that the game would not limit seeds, what I mean by is that seeds/ the seed type can keep on adding on rather than what the game has which are sizes for the seeds, which then would eliminate the chance for a player to get really stronger so that they can stand a better chance in the game. One thing that is well provided is making monster levels higher then the player on a typical floor so that the player is forced to fight more fights to be able to even get through that level by going back to previous levels which also allows for the player to capture more monsters. I wish that there where more warping circles, like one on each level so you could warp back to home, because I found that it was kind of annoying to have to walk through a whole floor again just because I wanted to organize my party. The CG's or acheivements are good, but I wish they told you every CG, and second the recruiting of captain Bonny was broke or maybe I just lost it, and sencond I hate how to unlock the dual souls acheivement you have to beat annubis when you aquire it after deafeating her on her first life.", "timestamp_created": 1478624665, "timestamp_updated": 1478624665, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26485019": {"recommendationid": "26485019", "author": {"steamid": "76561198196258567", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 4828, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499173734}, "language": "english", "review": "Holy crap i didn't expect to play this for this long\n\ndamn i need a hobby...", "timestamp_created": 1478586097, "timestamp_updated": 1478586097, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26343889": {"recommendationid": "26343889", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041447858", "num_games_owned": 230, "num_reviews": 84, "playtime_forever": 632, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493933871}, "language": "german", "review": "Bevor ich Reviews verfasse lese ich mir immer gro\u00dfspurig andere durch, in der Hoffnung das es einige gelungene deutsche Reviews gibt. Bl\u00f6derweise sind die sehr kurz und nichts sagend. Manchmal mache ich mir schon sorgen ob ich vielleicht ein Problem habe, da ich mir diese Art von Spielen kaufe und sie anschlie\u00dfend sogar bewerte.\n\nNun denn, kommen wir also zum Kirschbl\u00fcten Verlies (Sakura Dungeon). Es ist, im gegensatz zu den anderen Spielen dieser Reihe, sehr teuer. Kosten [strike]40 Mark[/strike] 20 Euro. Man mag sich fragen wieso ist dieses Spiel dieses mal so teuer? Vielleicht, dachte ich mir, verlangen die Entwickler ja dieses mal Geld weil sie es endlich mal geschafft haben ein SPIEL zu machen statt rum geklicke. Ich h\u00e4tte erwartet es w\u00e4re so \u00e4hnlich wie Sakura Clickers. Abnutzen der Maus mittels schnellen Finger Klicks.\n\nNun ich wurde eines besseren belehrt. Es ist wirklich ein Spiel das sogar SPA\u00df macht. Ich bin positiv \u00fcberrascht aber nat\u00fcrlich liegt auch hier wieder der Fokus auf leicht gekleidete und reizende M\u00e4dels. Verschiedener Arten und Rassen. Hier kommt jeder Ecchi Fan auf seine kosten, selbst ich der mehr als gen\u00fcgend Fuchsm\u00e4dels zur verf\u00fcgung hat in diesem Spiel. Ich k\u00f6nnte jetzt Minutenlang \u00fcber reizende F\u00fcchsinnen schw\u00e4rmen aber ich beschr\u00e4nke mich auf das wesentliche.\n\nDie Story diesmal: Ein Abenteurer weckt einen alten Fuchsgeist der sich als Endboss im Dungeon raus stellt. Da die Kriegerin ein so unglaublicher Noob ist wird sie vom Fuchsgeist gepwnt. Statt sie aber umzubringen und sie so zum letzten Spawn Point zu schicken beschlie\u00dft der Fuchsgeist sich die Kriegerin untert\u00e4nig zu machen um so ihr altes Dungeon-Level zur\u00fcck zu bekommen (,,Btw, this was just the Tutorial Level you Noob!\" -Yomi) [spoiler](hat sie nat\u00fcrlich nicht gesagt, sie ist ja nicht so gemein wie ein MOBA-Spieler)[/spoiler]\n\nAlso machen sich Ceri (Klasse: Krieger) und Yomi (Klasse: Mage) auf um gegen den neuen unbekannten und voralldem weiblichen Dungeon-Boss anzutreten. Nebenbei fangen die beiden munter neue [strike]Gespielinnen[/strike] Gef\u00e4hrtinnen um gegen den Dungeonlord zu bestehen.\n\nDas war die Story, kommen wir nun zum Gameplay. Man spielt das Spiel mit der WASD Tastatur und klickt sich von einem Areal zu einem anderen. Es gibt Schatz Kisten, F\u00e4sser und Gef\u00e4\u00dfe zum Zertr\u00fcmmern die zuf\u00e4llig Geld oder Gegenst\u00e4nde dropen und K\u00e4mpfe. Es ist ein Rundenbasiertes RPG Spiel (so \u00e4hnlich wie Final Fantasy wem der begriff nichts sagt) jeder Charackter hat verschiedene Angriffe und F\u00e4higkeiten. Auch kann man den Gegner einfangen und ihn so zu [strike]zwingen[/strike] \u00fcberzeugen f\u00fcr einen in Zukunft zu k\u00e4mpfen. Allerdings kann man nur ein Mitglied von jeder Sorte haben. So k\u00e4mpft man sich durch den Dungeon, hat ab und zu einen Dialog, je nachdem wer einen begleitet, man levelt seine M\u00e4dels und sammelt Sch\u00e4tze und zerreist den armen gegenerischen M\u00e4dels ihre Kleider um die eigene Gier zu befriedigen (ein etwas unn\u00f6tiges Feature meiner Meinung nach da die meisten M\u00e4dels schon so knapp bekleidet sind)\n\nHier gibt es auch Taktische Elemente, man hat nur eine gewisse anzahl an Aktionspunkten und muss sich entscheiden ob man verteidigen soll, das Teammitglied auswechselt oder aber man aggresiv spielt und so zu riskieren das die Kleider zerrissen werden (was taktisch vom nachteil ist, jedoch nett anzuschauen ist) und man gefahr l\u00e4uft zu verlieren. Es wirkt etwas unbalanciert im Loot-System da die Preise viel zu hoch sind im Shop aber daf\u00fcr gleicht es sich im Kampfsystem gut aus. Auch kann man die beiden Hauptprotagonisten nett einkleiden mit Bikinis, frechen Kleidern und sogar einem Brautkleid (auch wenn man Yomi, die eigentlich Hauptfigur im Spiel, erst im Zweiten Kapitel spielen kann.) Speichern kann man immer im Spiel was dem ganzen etwas an schwierigkeit nimmt (da die gro\u00dfen Konfrontation meistens mit der Frage beginnt: K\u00e4mpfen: Ja, nein, vielleicht, Kleider ausziehen.)\n\nGut kommen wir nun zum Abschluss. Ich bin sehr positiv \u00fcberrascht, das Spiel macht spass, es fesselt einen (vom Gameplay) hat nett anzuschauende Szenen, einen sehr gut gelungenen Soundtrack (Mittelalter vermengt mit Japano Musik) und eine Auswahl an Fuchsm\u00e4dels (sogar eine F\u00fcchsin die sich mit einer ganzen Horde von F\u00fcchsen umgibt). Auch wenn ich mich etwas daf\u00fcr sch\u00e4me es zuzugeben aber ich kann sagen das ich bei diesem Spiel zum Schu\u00df gekommen bin, aufgrund der vielen F\u00fcchsinnen.\n\n[spoiler](Immer noch am lesen? Soviel aufmerksamkeit verdient nat\u00fcrlich Respekt also schauts mal in meiner Screenshoot Gallerie vielleicht findet ihr ja ein Fuchsmadel mit einem Interessanten Link f\u00fcr das Spiel ;) )[/spoiler]\n\nDieses Spiel ist mehr als gelungen, es stimmt wirklich alles. Gameplay, Soundtrack, Story kurzum ein Spiel das seiner Preis Klasse gerecht wird. Dies kann man sich getrost zum vollen Preis kaufen da man diesmal anst\u00e4ndige Qualit\u00e4t geliefert bekommt. Mach einer heult das es keine animation g\u00e4be und \u00fcberhaupt keine Arbeit drin steckt. Sicher und Donald Trump ist ein herzensguter und voralldem toleranter Mensch der nur mittels ehrlicher Arbeit seinen Reichtum bekommen hat.

The battle mechanics get kind of stale pretty quick. Sure, there's new monsters, but for the most part, everyone uses the same handful of abilities., just with stronger stats. Minus points for non-hero characters - none of them can learn additional abilities unless you teach them with scrolls (Occasionally found or dropped by defeated enemies)\n\nThe music in this game, I pretty much muted it after the first few floors. The random encounter theme is ok, but gets extremely annoying extremely fast hearing that tune more than the dungeon themes... as you get into battles after a handful of steps. For this reason I just threw on my own music on shuffle wandering through the maps..\n\nThere were some funny moments and the ce-censoring patch adds some \"Bonus content\" that can't be posted to Steam.\n\nOverall though, I can't justify anyone paying $20 for this game. If you're looking at this game and it's on sale, consider it if you're a pervert.\n\nIf you're looking for solid RPG mechanics, either get this game and play it with the Abyssal Makeover Mod, or go find another game that will serve your needs better.", "timestamp_created": 1475163947, "timestamp_updated": 1475164129, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25742016": {"recommendationid": "25742016", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130662409", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1929, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515121642}, "language": "japanese", "review": "It sexy", "timestamp_created": 1475080144, "timestamp_updated": 1475080144, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.423037", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25722693": {"recommendationid": "25722693", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060561507", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 672, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513274276}, "language": "english", "review": "Well anime is fucking gay, but hey we gotta oppai here))  10/10", "timestamp_created": 1474972349, "timestamp_updated": 1474972457, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.326444", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25635768": {"recommendationid": "25635768", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991546076", "num_games_owned": 243, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 72, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501185853}, "language": "english", "review": "it could be better...\nat best, this game might give horny teens 23 minutes in paradise\n(and that is being generous)\nother than that, you're better off finding something else.", "timestamp_created": 1474554715, "timestamp_updated": 1493117564, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25633418": {"recommendationid": "25633418", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107678873", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 467, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465259639}, "language": "english", "review": "Beating this game was the best accomplishment I ever made.

1479027032}, "language": "english", "review": "Reviewer's Foreword: Despite my negative recommendation, this review is actually meant to be mixed. In fact, I'd actually recommend this game (It's one of my favorites), but ONLY with some mods installed to really make it shine.\n\n--------------------------\n\nWhen I 1st heard of Sakura Dungeon from one of the people that I subscribed to on YouTube (specifically [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6d7Bbr3OAw]GullOfDoom[/url], my interest was piqued, so I checked out other YouTubers' playthroughs of the game (including LudaAaGames, TheLPBandit, Lost Pause, TheTwitGamer, and Negark to name a few). From my 1st impressions of the game from other YouTube LPers, I found that the battle system of Sakura Dungeon (and its spiritual predecessor, Demon Master Chris), despite how shallow it was, was innovative, and a more tactical alternative to the kinds of rpg battle systems that you'd find in games like Final Fantasy or Pokemon. Although I was never interested in visual novel games in general, I eventually decided to purchase Sakura Dungeon for myself. Little did I realize is that the game was so moddable that you could, say, flesh out the battle system to really make it shine, which was what I did when I made my [url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/407330/discussions/0/358415738179023426/]Abyssal Makeover mod[/url], or add more dialogue to characters like in my [url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/407330/discussions/0/360671247403417700/]Additional Dialogue mod[/url].\n\nStory:\n\nAs far as stories are concerned, I've seen far more interesting and engaging stories. In Sakura Dungeon, you play as Yomi, an ancient fox spirit that was once the ruler of the dungeon that you're trying to reclaim, but was sealed away for an unknown purpose. However, thanks to the unwitting actions of an unwitting adventuring knight named Ceri, whom you capture and bind to your service after she tries in vain to slay you, you are freed from your imprisonment, and are determined to reclaim your dungeon from its new dungeon lord, whom, according to dialogue from the many monster girls that you encounter, fight, and/or capture, has been treating the dungeon's inhabitants far more poorly than Yomi has. Without spoiling much, it's revealed that, in Yomi's absence, a massive power source has been moved to the bottom of the dungeon, and it's up to Yomi, Ceri, and the numerous characters that help them on their adventure, to save the world. Sadly, there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of plot twists, if any.\n\nAs is typical of rpg games, Sakura Dungeon is very dialogue heavy. Side characters occasionally comment on what's currently happening, but this isn't often, and side characters tend to run out of things to say after the 1st few floors since they were recruited to your party. This was probably done, since the developers probably didn't anticipate that players would grow attached to certain early-midgame party members that were captured, such as the Bunny Girl or Boar Girl, that they'd want to keep them in the party until end-game.\n\nArtwork:\n\nSimply put, I find the artwork for this game to be stellar. The character sprites are some of my favorites. The only turnoff is a lack of variety in body types outside of size D+ cup breast sizes.\n\nAlthough the version of Sakura Dungeon here on Steam has no nudity, there's an uncensored patch for it [url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/407330/discussions/0/357287935546522803/]here[/url]. However, I wouldn't purchase the game just for this, since we each have our own web browsers' search engines to take care of that.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThis was the main reason why I decided to purchase the game. In this game, you explore a dungeon in a 1st person view, with grid-like controls, like in Legend of Grimrock. However, the combat in this game is not unlike most JRPGs, including Final Fantasy or Pokemon, in which you have a chance of entering a random battle.\n\nWhat really sold me about this game is its innovative rpg battle system. Although I've already typed up a strategy guide about it [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=744964974]here[/url], I'll just say that, compared to most JRPGs like Pokemon or Final Fantasy, the battle system of Sakura Dungeon is more tactical. In Sakura Dungeon, AP, or Ability Points, are not only your main renewable resource to spend on executing various skills in the game, but it also provides a dodge bonus against attacks. Managing AP is important in this game, since if your character has very little AP, then not only will she have a high chance of getting hit, but she also has a high chance of receiving a critical hit. Thus, weak skills with low AP costs have their value alongside stronger skills with higher AP costs.\n\nThere's also a character's CP, or Concentration Power, to manage, which can be important for achieving the Flow condition, which is like turning Super Saiyan, as well as using it as another resource to spend on some of the more powerful skills in the game.\n\nSadly, as much potential as Sakura Dungeon's battle system has, I feel as if it's woefully underutilized. The vast majority of characters have no more than 3 abilities, which provide passive bonuses, and even they, individually, tend to have little effect in the game. Moreover, other than Flow and Panic, there's only one other status effect that you'll have to worry about, which is Paralysis, which grants a 50% penalty to hit rates with melee and ranged skills (but not magic skills). There's also a Spell Disruption effect that causes afflicted players to be incapable of using magic skills, but that's, sadly, underutilized, and chances are that you won't encounter it.\n\nMoreover, if you've mastered the basics of the game's combat system, the game seems too easy to beat, even on the hardest difficulty setting. However, I've seen players struggle with this game, even on lower difficulty levels, because they either ignore how accurate their moves are when used against certain targets (which pops up in green numbers for a second), or aren't aware of how AP in this game works (which has been discussed earlier in this review). Some players also seem to be too dependent on the auto battle system, which can optionally be turned on during battle with a hotkey. However, AI opponents are actually easier to defeat without the auto-battle system, since they aren't exactly programmed to be intelligent with their move choices, and since the auto-battle system is no less stupider.\n\nFinal verdict:\n\nOverall, despite the potential that Sakura Dungeon's battle system has, I feel as if the developers of the game have done far too little to flesh it out, and really make it shine. Moreover, the game seems to be structured in such a way that players are constantly incentivized to swap out the older party members that they obtained for newer ones, making it difficult to maintain an attachment to any single monster that you capture.\n\nI would only recommend purchasing Sakura Dungeon if you plan on playing it with the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/407330/discussions/0/358415738179023426/]Abyssal Makeover mod[/url] installed, and possibly the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/407330/discussions/0/360671247403417700/]Additional Dialogue mod[/url] as well.\n\nThe Abyssal Makeover mod is a must-have total overhaul mod that makes ALOT of gameplay changes, not the least of which is making Sakura Dungeon's otherwise shallow battle system shine as brightly as the JRPG classics, including adding new moves and abilities for characters, and new status effects like curse (negates abilities), and doom (KOes after time runs out). It also makes the game, as a whole, more challenging. Installing it (along with other mods) is as easy as moving all of the mod's files and folders into the following directory: \\Steam\\SteamApps\\common\\Sakura Dungeon\\game\n\nFinal score:\n\n5/10 without mods\n\n8/10 with the Abyssal Makeover and Additional Dialogue mods", "timestamp_created": 1473912568, "timestamp_updated": 1473912568, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 48, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.687291", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25494451": {"recommendationid": "25494451", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031697910", "num_games_owned": 210, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 7324, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481916338}, "language": "english", "review": "I played this game in the 'Abyssal' difficulty in my first playthrough after uncensoring it of course with the patch that can be looked up.

But DAYUM the lewdness! My friend and I was laughing throughout this entire game. (I was playing with a friend who had been watching via screen share on Skype).\n\nThis game is obviously 18+ and I'm recommending it for its unique style and the story, try seeing how far you can get through the game without getting the party killed, like an iron-man run, or come up with another idea, who knows what you can come up with, be creative, and there's a wide variety of characters to use too, remember that.", "timestamp_created": 1473775671, "timestamp_updated": 1473775671, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.557788", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25489609": {"recommendationid": "25489609", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045944938", "num_games_owned": 663, "num_reviews": 115, "playtime_forever": 776, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485848901}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u8131\u88633D\u30c0\u30f3\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3RPG\n\n[h1]\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0[/h1]\n3D\u30c0\u30f3\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u30b2\u30fc\u306b\u8131\u8863\u8981\u7d20\u304c\u4ed8\u3044\u305f\u3060\u3051\u306e\u5358\u7d14\u306a\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3002\n\u7279\u6b8a\u306a\u8981\u7d20\u306f\u4ee5\u4e0b\u306e\u4e8c\u3064\u304f\u3089\u3044\n\u30fb\u6575\u5473\u65b9\u306e\u8863\u88c5\u7834\u58ca\u306b\u3088\u308b\u8010\u6027\u306e\u4f4e\u4e0b\n\u30fb\u6575\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u306e\u6355\u7372\n\u30fbCG\u95b2\u89a7\u3001\u30af\u30ea\u30a2\u5f8c\u306e\u6355\u7372\u3057\u305f\u6575\u306e\u7acb\u3061\u7d75\u9451\u8cde\n\n[h1]\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e02[/h1]\n\u3053\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306f\u4ed6\u306esakura\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u540c\u69d8uncensor(18\u7981)\u30d1\u30c3\u30c1\u304c\u3042\u308b\n\u3053\u306e\u30d1\u30c3\u30c1\u306f\u521d\u56de\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u6642\u304b\u3089\u5c0e\u5165\u3053\u3068\u3092\u30aa\u30b9\u30b9\u30e1\u3059\u308b\n\u7406\u7531\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306f\u3001CG\u304c\u5dee\u5206\u8fbc\u307f\u3067\u5168112\u679a\u3042\u308b\u304c\u3001\u305d\u306e\u5185\u30a8\u30edCG\u306f\u7d0470\u679a\n\u30d1\u30c3\u30c1\u3092\u5165\u308c\u306a\u3051\u308c\u3070\u898b\u308c\u306a\u3044CG\u3084\u7acb\u3061\u7d75\u304c\u534a\u5206\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3042\u308b\n\n[h1]\u305d\u306e\u4ed6[/h1]\n\u3053\u3053\u304b\u3089\u306f\u500b\u4eba\u7684\u306a\u610f\u898b\u306e\u305f\u3081\u3001\u53c2\u8003\u7a0b\u5ea6\u306b\n\u307e\u305a\u826f\u3044\u70b9\u3092\u6319\u3052\u308b\u3068\n\u30fb[b]\u7537\u304c\u3067\u306a\u3044[/b](\u30b3\u30ec\u91cd\u8981)\n\u30fb\u88f8\u3092\u4e0a\u304b\u3089\u4e0b\u304b\u3089\u524d\u5f8c\u304b\u3089\u3002\u30b7\u30c1\u30e5\u30a8\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3082\u8272\u3005\u3042\u308a\u6e80\u8db3\u306aCG(\u679a\u6570\u3082\u591a\u3044)\n\u30fb\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u304c50\u7a2e\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3068\u8c4a\u5bcc\n\u30fb\u3084\u308a\u5fdc\u3048\u3042\u308a\u3002\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30c9\u8a2d\u5b9a\u3084\u30aa\u30fc\u30c8\u6226\u95d8\u3082\u3042\u3063\u3066\u96d1\u9b5a\u6226\u306f\u30b5\u30af\u30b5\u30af\u9032\u3081\u3089\u308c\u308b\n\u60aa\u3044\u70b9\u306f\n\u30fb\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u306a\u3057\n\u30fb\u5de8\u4e73\u3070\u304b\u308a\n\nsakura\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u306e\u5272\u306b\u306f\u9762\u767d\u3044\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u3057\u305f\u3002\n\u307e\u305f\u3001\u767e\u5408\u30b2\u30fc\u3068\u8a00\u3044\u5207\u308c\u308b\u5185\u5bb9\u3060\u3063\u305f\u306e\u3067\u3001\u305d\u3063\u3061\u306e\u65b9\u304c\u597d\u304d\u306a\u4eba\u306b\u3082\u30aa\u30b9\u30b9\u30e1\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1473745936, "timestamp_updated": 1473746602, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 38, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.798699", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25376845": {"recommendationid": "25376845", "author": {"steamid": "76561198167511315", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 1501, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477093653}, "language": "english", "review": "Best of the series, u can actually play this game! even with one hand :^)\nKnow what I mean??\n\nToo bad you cant post the R-18 Screenshots without Steam slamming the ban hammer on you.\nThe best that you can do is set it to private without these admins breathing down your neck on posting this kind of content.

I have seen a variety of these Sakura games pop up into my Steam feed lately, and I was curious to what they were all about. I took a chance on this title as it wasn't the \"visual novel\" style. I added the 18+ patch for this game, because why the fuck not. \n\nSome reviews praised the story. I've never been all about stories in video games, but this doesn't actually have one. You are some fox-woman, and for some reason not clearly explained, you have to go rip the clothes off other animal women in your old dungeon home... or something. There is a ton of dialgue, but it's campy and nonsensical. I ended up turning on the skip option on dialouge pretty damn fast. It's boring.\n\nThis product page lists this FPS dungeon crawling with \"catch em all\" kind-of mechanics, and even that is dry and boring. The combat system (to be fair I was playing on normal difficulty) can use the auto function in this game as easily as the dialog. The game warns that auto combat won't be making the best descions, but I still steamrolled all the battles.\n\nThe only redeeming part of this game is the cartoon titty pics you can unlock, which is great if you've never seen them in real life, or can't manage to find better hentai online. The booby pics are pretty vannila, like you might be graduating from the bra adds in magazines.\n\nIf you are an adolescent reading this review, yes you should be embarassed playing this. Go outside, practice pick-up, work towards self-improvement, and learn to have the stones to ask women out.\n\nTL;DR The \"gameplay\" mechanics of the title are overstated in the product page. The reviews are somewhat unclear, but seems to be all written by pre-pubescent teens. This is not a game, but a way for adolescents to see cartoon tits without their parents knowledge.", "timestamp_created": 1468344443, "timestamp_updated": 1468344548, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.383569", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24274666": {"recommendationid": "24274666", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074142104", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497033922}, "language": "english", "review": "i only like this game for the story", "timestamp_created": 1468331270, "timestamp_updated": 1468331270, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.466982", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24269477": {"recommendationid": "24269477", "author": {"steamid": "76561198274771569", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2565, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513892870}, "language": "english", "review": "I have not seen sun in days. \nI have struggled, time after time, to escape the boobs.\nNo method has worked.\nStripping the nekos.\nPlaying bondage with the foxies.\nNOTHING.\nI'm forever stuck in this cycle of boobs and butts.\nI'll see you in 84 years.\n", "timestamp_created": 1468309047, "timestamp_updated": 1468309047, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24266855": {"recommendationid": "24266855", "author": {"steamid": "76561198261320711", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2433, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471229351}, "language": "english", "review": "8/10 Way more than i would expect from a sakura game, 18+ patch is a must", "timestamp_created": 1468294672, "timestamp_updated": 1468294672, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493890", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24256126": {"recommendationid": "24256126", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099590491", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 500, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476295291}, "language": "english", "review": "Now this is what i call a sex dungeon.\n\n10/10 Would come to it again. \n\nDownload the uncensored for the real fun. \nScroll a bit up and down to find a link to it idk. \n\nPs. please don't tell my mom or i well tell yours.", "timestamp_created": 1468252501, "timestamp_updated": 1468252525, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519813", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24249392": {"recommendationid": "24249392", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052941497", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1696, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473339252}, "language": "german", "review": "Funny Game and nice Arts.", "timestamp_created": 1468226774, "timestamp_updated": 1468226774, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.443967", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24244253": {"recommendationid": "24244253", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056789698", "num_games_owned": 176, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489477868}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game. 10/10 :^)", "timestamp_created": 1468200666, "timestamp_updated": 1480042077, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.460788", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24235373": {"recommendationid": "24235373", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980577677", "num_games_owned": 608, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1438, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485124675}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun (and lewd) dungeon crawler RPG involving a neat Capture mechanic for adding party members.

Sony\u2019s console has age restriction features to prevent minors from playing mature titles and on the PC front you need a credit card to purchase software from Steam, which kiddies shouldn\u2019t have access to. Deviants seeking smut have however been catered to in recent years. Developers are starting to sell all age versions of their products on Valve\u2019s marketplace that can be uncensored through the wonders of patching. Thanks to this compromise under eighteens can safely enjoy Sakura Dungeon\u2019s RPG gameplay whilst perverts get to ogle all the boobs they could ever desire by simply downloading a small patch.\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nSakura Dungeon commences with a bashful adventurer named Ceri setting off on a quest to purge some catacombs of the monsters residing within its tunnels. Things don\u2019t go well however when she awakens the dungeon\u2019s former owner \u2013 a fox spirit named Yomi. After a brief tussle Yomi overpowers the knight, who interrupted her hibernation, before using sorcery to make Ceri her unwilling minion. With a new servant under her command, Yomi decides the time has come to venture underground and reclaim the lair she once ruled. Over the course of their travels Yomi and Ceri can bolster their ranks by recruiting defeated enemies to their cause. The well-endowed creatures guarding the dungeon won\u2019t surrender willingly though, so violence (and garment stripping) may be required to humiliate the hostile monsters into submission.\n\nVia the use of the capture command players can recruit an assortment of bunny girls, busty witches and anthropomorphic pandas to their group. By the time I finished the main campaign my party contained over forty voluptuous beauties, putting Tenchi Muyo\u2019s harem well and truly to shame. In order to successfully capture a gal their health bar needs to be depleted first, which is accomplished by smacking them with special moves and magic spells. Every attack drains a character\u2019s action points and has a chance of causing your target to suffer a wardrobe malfunction. With the adult patch enabled (which I only activated for the purposes of writing an accurate review) it\u2019s possible to tear a cat girl\u2019s attire so badly that her \u201cpussy\u201d will be exposed in more ways than one.\n\nVERDICT\n\nAnyone who has previously enjoyed Demon Master Chris should give Sakura Dungeon a download, as both games share many similarities. Providing that you aren\u2019t prudish, Sakura Dungeon is a good title for players trying out a dungeon crawler for the first time because, when compared to other examples in the genre, its difficulty isn\u2019t too taxing. That\u2019s not to say that the game is devoid of strategy though. Clearing each maze will require that you manipulate switches, circumvent traps, exploit the elemental weaknesses of enemies and shrewdly manage your team\u2019s action points. There are tough decisions to be made too; such as picking what embarrassing outfit Ceri should wear. Will you opt for the bikini, maid uniform or bondage suit?\n\nMy rating for Sakura Dungeon is a four out of five. It\u2019s probably the best game Winged Cloud has ever developed, as the increased interactivity masks the mediocre writing found in their wordier visual novels. Although funny at times Sakura Dungeon\u2019s script could be better, but it matters not as the onus is on exploring labyrinths, levelling up your characters and admiring the top-heavy character designs.

Yes, i'm admitting the sexy anime girls made me notice this game. I am a herterosexual male, after all, that likes anime, and my philosaphy is that there is a difference between finding a female form (flesh and blood, or drawn) sexy does not automatically mean a male thinks of women as sex objects. I believe in equality, so to my outlook women watching the chippendales (I'm sure I spelled that wrong, and that it's likely they're not around anymore) is no more or less a \"pig\" that a guy watching a topless woman dance. There are many double standards to gender on both sides, and assuming a guy is a \"pig\" or a woman is a [insert word for prostitute] for expressing thier sexuality, hetero, homo, or bi sexual, is wrong. Now, with that out of the way...\n\nMain Review:\nI haven't gone too deep in the dungeon, but it is better than I expected. I figured if it was just fan service with no real gameplay (like an anime with little plot but tons of nudity for no reason) I'd just refund and use the money for something else.\n\nI must say, the plot so far isn't too deep. Fox-spirit recruits human knight to reclain her dungeon, but the gameplay iself reminds me of other dungeon crawls with turn-based combat. Not complax, but I'm not bored to death. Fans of old school JRPG's combat systems will be on familiar ground in combat. The biggest difference is you can't use items in combat, and when an enemy is near death, the lady knight can capture the monster-girls as allies in combat. Potions are easy to get, and party members regenerate health as you explore, unless defeated. \n\nNow, if this game didn't have the monster-girl enemies/allies, and they looked like \"normal\" rpg monsters, the fox-spirit and the lady knight looked less sexualized, it would still be a solid old-school JRPG/dungeon crawl. People looking fot tons of items to craft and customize, a vast world, or other such innovations that modern RPG's have might not like Sakura Dungeon, but if you have a passion for RPG's thatremind you of the 8/16 bit era, with first person exploration mixed in, you just might load it up to kill a bit of time... just be careful where you play it, or people will look at you funny.", "timestamp_created": 1466803316, "timestamp_updated": 1466803384, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502514", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23767148": {"recommendationid": "23767148", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148414731", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 4273, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494900400}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has a great deal of assets.

It is a simple dungeon crawler with nice looking graphics and puzzles that are not overly complicated where you either need to find a key to open a door or find a button/ lever that causes certain doors to open.\n\nPROS:\n\nPuzzles are easy to solve and just require patience.  The music is nicely done and gets more dramatic when you reach the game final stages. Being able to capture other characters means that you can choose different melee or magic damage dealing types. Each character can learn the capture ability so you can have more than just one person with the ability to capture others. You can also have any character cast magic so even your melee charcters can use magic. I usually give them one magic ability that attacks multiple characters.\n\nIt is also good that you are able to stop and view the entire map to a floor so that you can see what areas you have not yet explored to find if that is where you need to find the area to solve a puzzle or to get to the lower floors.\n\nAnother nice touch is that certain bosses will join your group if you beat them or if you bring a specific item to them. Having a boss as a developed character is generally useful.\n\nThe game story that plays out is interesting and kept me engaged with wanting to see the ending to the game.\n\nCONS:\n\nLots and lots of grinding. Unlike traditional RPGs where you get hit points as you level up or points to spend in your strength for melee or mana for your magic users, your base stats do not improve as a direct result of leveling unless you find a seed or buy seeds from the shop and apply them to your character. In the beginning, the small seed is available for purchase at the shop for 1,000 but eventually you will get the medium seed for 5,000 and the large seed for 10,000. There is also an infinite seed that can be found in the dungeon that allows your character to go beyond the maximum of 8 in a category that is provided by the expensive large seed. While you will find chests / containers with currency, they are few and far between and the currency drop is not substantial and needs to be a lot more to avoid all the grinding for currency as you try to improve your player stats. \n\nYou will also have to make sure that you buy warp stones and keep a few spares for when you want to return back to the home area and turn one of the captured mobs into a character for your group. Eventually you will find a warp gem towards the end of the game that lasts infinitely so you will not need to purchase warp stones after that but it would have been nice to have it at an earlier stage of the game.\n\nOne particular part of the game that is unique is that you might wish to buy strength seeds to your magic user types. I know what you are thinking. Strength for a mage? Why? Shouldn't you be buying mental seeds to give them more magic or dexterity so that they hit more often? Well that is true, more strength means that your characters take less damage for melee types as their strength goes up. Again, this is why having to grind for money can be annoying.\n\nGranted in the later stages of the game, the currency amounts gained by killing the mobs goes up but still there was a lot more grinding than I wanted to.\n\nAnother potential problem is the fact that your characters are not able to use potions to heal during combat. Healing potions can only be used outside of combat which is not as useful as your characters will heal as you move so buying healing potions is a waste of currency. It would be better if characters could use potions during battles as well as the mending tonic to repair their armor in the middle of battle.\n\nAnother potential problem is using Yomi as one of your three main combat characters. The potential problem is that if she is defeated, it is game over even if your other characters are doing ok. Granted at the later stages of the games, she gains a dual soul ability that causes her to revive after the first defeat but again, it makes it dangerous to use her if the mobs target her and kill her. Yomi has a nice astro attack (one of the more powerful attacks in the game) but you are at risk of having the game end if she is defeated.\n\nThe other part is that the version currently sold is the censored version so some of the story elements that deal with how the characters interact with each other has to be left out of the game. I have the uncensored version and It is too bad that some story elements had to be left off since some of those elements were funny although I understand why they had to censor it. it means you lose out on getting the entire story between the characters.\n\nOverall it was fun game and I enjoyed it.

Party like its, eh, nevermind.  That is however, the year that we got True Love, the first H-game I ever played.  Even earlier than that was Wizardry, a seriously hardcore dungeon RPG that pretty much required people to draw maps on graph paper as they played, and where character death could be permanent and irrevocable.  Ah, the pain of teleporting a party into a wall on level 666.  All fond memories, and all so very long ago.  Video games have come so far since then.  Not this one though.  Sakura Dungeon stubbornly refuses to join us in the 21st century, and hands us an old school H-RPG without the micromanagement of a Wizardry, and also without the salacious detail of a proper H-game.\n\nI recommend this game pretty much on nostalgia alone, as it really is something you would have played twenty years ago and thought it was amazing.  The combat is stripped down, and the character development is nonexistent.  At the same time, the \u201cadult\u201d content consists mainly of boobs, of which there are many on the internet that you don't even have to do battle for.  Those that are on display in Sakura Dungeon are, as Sakura games tend to be, rather large, and unfit for any respectable hebe, if such a phrase can even exist.  If you really miss the old days, you might just want to snag a copy of Wizardry and Hizashi no Naka no Riaru,  but if you want a simplistic, big-boob dungeon crawler, then this might be the thing for you.

Developed by winged cloud and published by Sekai project on steam.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe gameplay of Sakura Dungeon shares a huge resemblance to Demon Master Chris a doujin dungeon crawler game. So lets look at some of the most important and basics of Sakura Dungeon first.\n\nOne of the most important mechanics of Sakura Dungeon is the \u2018capture\u2019 mechanic, where the player will be able to capture monster girls they encounter and add them to their party.\n\nNext is VP or Vitality point. When a character\u2019s VP reaches to zero, they are knocked out and can no longer fight. When all characters in your party are knocked out, the game is over. When a character\u2019s clothes are damaged, their recovery rate is halved\n\nAP or Action point. A battle skill costs AP to take an action in her turn. When you enter combat, the AP of each character starts off between 40% to 80% of their maximum AP. When a character does not have enough AP to use a skill, the guard skill allows them to recover AP only and no VP will be recovered.\n\nPretty simple to understand? Okay so let\u2019s go into some points I would want to point out. The very first problem is that the combat system that has been implemented into Sakura Dungeon sometimes feels a pain in the ass to deal with. Why it felt that way? Okay lets see.. I have the option of strong attack, weak attack, guard and some other spells. I would like to point out \u201cGuard skill\u201d first of that skill is useful of course because using that skill it lets me recover \u201cAP\u201d points so that I can spend them to attack BUT the guard skill does not recover health which is fine. But what ticks me off is that in battle there is almost no way to recover health, you can\u2019t even use health potions during combat that were bought from the shop at town.\n\nSo let\u2019s make it a situation where I am at 10 health and the opponent is also at 10 health [Basically a sudden death situation] and I have no \u201cAP\u201d left to do an attack and I would be forced to use guard skill which translates to death regardless of what I do. Because after guard, having no way to recover health once my turn is over despite recovering \u201cAP\u201d to attack I will not have any form of chance to even attack because I will be dead by then. Which obviously sucks especially when you are fighting a boss character and you are going to lose to it just simply because I have to guard because there are no other options available to me.\n\nOf course despite having that as a form of annoyance to me I think that the there were some redeeming values in its gameplay. There was a large amount of detail lets take for example \u201cCP\u201d or concentration power. When a character\u2019s CP reaches to 0, they gain the panicked condition. While she is panicking, she suffers a 25% penalty to her dodge, hit and critical chance. When her CP reaches to 10, she gains the flow condition. While flow is active, she gains a 25% bonus to her hit, dodge and critical chance. It also allows her to use skills that cost 1 or 2 CP at no cost. If she has a skill which costs 10 CP, she can use it while flow is active. When she does, flow will end. How long panic and flow last depends on the character\u2019s mentality stat. [For your info I did not find that out by myself]\n\nSo in conclusion, there were its positive and negatives for the gameplay but overall I do like the fact that there were details that are being paid attention too and I did enjoyed crawling through its dungeons.\n\n[h1]To sum up Do I recommend this game?[/h1]\nWill I recommend Sakura Dungeon? This is a tough question to answer if I were to give a straight answer I would say yes, I do recommend Sakura Dungeon but to a certain extent. Why to a certain extent? It\u2019s pretty simple if you are a person that has no interest in dungeon crawling this game is definitely not for you and it is also not one to be picked up to just give it a try, as I stated above the combat system is flawed in some ways.\n\n[url=https://azusantiara.com/2016/06/18/sakura-dungeon-review/]Click here for the review with images and more![/url]", "timestamp_created": 1466179824,

immer in Form von Frauen mit ansprechenden Outfits in Erscheinung treten. Die Monster k\u00f6nnen von euch eingefangen und f\u00fcr den eigenen Kampf benutzt werden. So sammelt man Items, Erfahrung und Monster um im Spiel voranzukommen.

Es gibt keine Video-cutscenes, falls jemand solche suchen sollte, aber das ist f\u00fcr Sakura-games nichts Au\u00dfergew\u00f6hnliches und aus meiner Sicht auch kein Kritikpunkt.\n\nLustigerweise habe ich das Spiel nach 48h Spielzeit noch lange nicht durchgespielt weil ich recht viel gegrindet habe, es gibt n\u00e4mlich auch eine praktische auto-battle Funktion. Man sollte aber an dieser Stelle nicht denken, dass man sich durch das ganze Game autobatteln kann.\n\nF\u00fcr Personen, die gerne Dungeons erkunden, sch\u00f6n animierte Frauen m\u00f6gen und Gefallen an erotisch ansprechenden Texten finden ist dieses Spiel auf jeden Fall empfehlenswert.

Lighthearted, sexy, and laughs.\n\nSakura Dungeon is a bit like Pokemon meets your average dungeon crawler. You go into the dungeon, you fight monster(girls) and you even capture them and have them fight for you. It's fun and even a little addictive.\n\nThe music is lovely. The artwork is gorgeous. And the gameplay itself is fluid. The mechanics of combat are not brainlessly basic, but they are a bit more than simple. However, they are easy to pick up on and in no time you'll be fighting your way through the levels while enjoying the beauty of your, ahem... surroundings.\n\nOf course, each monster/girl that you add to your \"collection\"(harem) isn't just a pretty face. They all have their own personalities and the interaction between the 'main' characters and those whom you have 'recruited' is nothing short of lovable.\n\nOn the downside, you may find yourself spending a bit of time grinding after every couple of levels in order to prepare for the next major enounter/boss. But, the combat is smooth and swift, so if you don't mind spending some time enjoying the 'beauty of combat', a little extra time spent preparing won't be a major put-off.\n\nPerhaps one of the best things about this game, aside from the more obvious points, is that no matter what sticky situation you get yourself into, you can get out of it. You heal quickly simply by walking around and there are waypoints every few levels so that if you need to make a hastey retreat out of the dungeon, you won't have far to travel to get back to where you were.\n\nIt should, however, be noted that you get only one life. If your party of sexy fighters wipes, its game over. So save, often. This is especially important because items cannot be used during combat. However, you do have front and back row fighters, whom you can switch out so that half of your party can fight while the other half recovers some health.\n\nCasual and easy to get into, with lots of stunning visuals and music, even if you don't get this game for the fanservice, get it for the gameplay and characters.", "timestamp_created": 1465755822, "timestamp_updated": 1465755822, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516256", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23521679": {"recommendationid": "23521679", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026644478", "num_games_owned": 632, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 2256, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467920078}, "language": "english", "review": "if theres \"no dead\" challenge on dungeon crawling game like Darksoul\n\nthere should be \"no boner\" challenge on this game", "timestamp_created": 1465743696, "timestamp_updated": 1465743696, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520813", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23521004": {"recommendationid": "23521004", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962696890", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 659, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499680809}, "language": "english", "review": "Addictive game in the Myst style.

I assume most people came for some good old toon boobs (har har) and dealt with the dungeon crawler; I on the other hand (har har) came for the dungeon crawler (har har) and dealt with the toon boobs. \n\nI also have no problem admiting that I enjoyed the RPG and dungeon crawling aspects of the game far less than I had hoped and enjoyed the toon boobs far more than I should have, which leaves me at a very odd crossroads. Should the game focus more on toon boobs in DLC and/or Sakura Dungeon 2 because they nailed it (har har) in this game, or should they focus on and enhance their combat system (which frankly only needed a handfull of meaningful pushes in the right direction for it to have not been such a let down) which would do wonders for the overall feel of the game and grow their base exponentially, when it might not be what the company is good at. \n\nAs far as a dungeon crawler this game takes you to first base (har har) towards something genuinly special, a pokemon \"got to catch them all\" dungeon crawler spawn but doesn't manage to bring it home. The toon boobs and animations feel like they have been drawn by 40 year old virgins while the story feels like it has been written by twelve year old girls.\n\nThe game was good and at the end of the day I actually enjoyed it, but frankly the experience was confusing as hell to a player (as I said above) looking for a game first and a toon bait second- it just didn't feel like it had a strong push (har har) in any one direction. I most likely will never play the game again, but for the price I paid and the time I got out of it I would say I don't regret anything (she does though... har har), I am however full of curiousity wondering what this company will do next with this new franchise- it could be something really special, or it could just flush down the drain of \"toon baits\" and amount to nothing.\n\nWhat could really change the dungeon crawling aspects of the game and make it a serious contender vs all other dungeon crawlers on the market?

When I bought this game I was expecting something pretty silly with lots of anime boobs all over the shop.\nI got that, but I also got a bit more. As a woman who likes hentai games, I've reconciled myself to most games having a male POV, so the all-female cast was rather refreshing. I found some of the characters pretty interesting, not simply buxom, which is not something I thought I'd be saying. I loved all the dialogue options and how much there was to explore (I installed the patch for the censored content btw).\nI love the use of the visual novel format too. My laptop is not built for gaming so I'm rather limited to what games I can play, so it was awesome to find a dungeon crawler which actually worked without frying my computer. I don't usually play these kinds of turn-based games, so I can't really comment on how it compares combat-wise to other games out there.\nMy one criticism is there were points where the levels got a tad tedious (the boobs definitely helped though), but this is mostly because I am an idiot and couldn't work out what I was meant to do. I also had to abandon it at several points for reasons I shall not discuss further, but which anyone with a filthy enough mind will be able to guess.\n\nIn short: if you don't like anime boobs, maybe not for you. If you do like anime boobs, give it a go!\nAlso: Someone should do a 'do-not-fap' challenge with this thing.

This is essentially the exact same concept, with a little less variety in breasts and body type, but a little bit more refined story telling.

It's done a good job, has overall quality, and frankly I'm a big fan of Demon Master Chris, so I was bound to like this game.  I won't bother going into details here as I don't want to spoil anything, but if you are okay with a level based RPG system that drags you through dungeon after dungeon and has a cute sense of humor while doing it, you should enjoy this game.\n\nGood Job Overall!\nSea.\n\nP.S.  I strongly recomend you get the patch for the full experience.  A simple search will find it on the developer website for free for you to download.\n\nEdit:  I would like to say the review on this game that Brother Johnny Bravo did was rather accurate.

time, which I can appreciate. Sure, I've had to grind up a level or two on hard, but that is expected with a RPG.\n\nThe cast of characters each have their own personality and don't fit into that cookie cutter mold of a typical lemming. I can say that you will defidently be keeping certain characters and shuffling though others as they get outdated on later floors. I've encountered about maybe 15~ monster girls but I know that's barely scratching the surface. Also love that they have unique dialogue. (Great sprites aswell)\n\nHowever there is one big thing I hate about this game, the save system. I really don't like how this game doesn't auto save but that's just me. I've only died twice and I've had to makeup about an hour of gameplay by forgetting to save. But this is mostly because I'm stupid.\n\nBesides that, all in all I reccomend you pick up this game as it isn't your typical VN and there are a lot of fun elements.\nBuy. This.

Art is awesome, the music can get downright gorgeous, and the combat is fast-paced and fun; though those wishing for some more strategy will be dissapointed.  \n\nEither way, definitely a good grab, though a little expensive.

If all sakura games were actual games like this , not specificly a dungeon crawling game, but just any other type of game. The action is pree legit, and and character models are the same \"type\" as previous sakura games. Only complain i have so far is that during combat, the options like escape,  use items, switch party members are not on the main screen, and there is no button to change from combat action to secondary actions like most rpg games does, instead you gotta go in ESC and do it, just very odd.  You can go around capturing various girls, who can help you for your combat, do not worry if you cant play them all, since they all gain experience and level up just the same as your front 3 characters. No weapons, no armors, just weapons and skins, so it isnt complicated.\n\nOut of all the sakura games, this is one that you should buy. \n\nGiving it a 8/10  \n\neNjoY =^-^=", "timestamp_created":

Sakura Dungeon lacks all of this type of depth I have come to expect from dungeon crawlers. All you have is 6 abilities per character (Half of which are chosen by default), and some basic stats.

On May 31, 2016, its spiritual successor, Sakura Dungeon, was initially released on Nutaku, the version of which I have played for many hours already. (It\u2019s why I have next to no time played on the Steam version, which I have purchased purely to leave this review. Yes, I care that much.) Now that it\u2019s out on Steam, I can leave a more visible review of it here.\n\n[b]I want to love Sakura Dungeon. I really, really, do.[/b] I have played and replayed Demon Master Chris for some triple-digit hours. [b]I\u2019ve sunk more than twenty hours into Sakura Dungeon already[/b], on the highest difficulty no less. Unfortunately, I\u2019m finding that the more I play Sakura Dungeon, the more it makes me want to put it down and instead boot up Demon Master Chris once again.\n\n[h1]Where Sakura Dungeon Succeeds[/h1]\n\nFirstly, let\u2019s not sell Sakura Dungeon short where it inarguably surpasses Demon Master Chris. The artist has noticeably improved in the three years between the games, and the music and SFX are of much higher quality. Frankly, I think the plot might even be a little better; I enjoy the personalities of the main protagonists more. [b]If you simply want to ogle cute and busty anime chicks in compromising situations, then stop reading here and buy Sakura Dungeon. It will be a purchase well worth your money.[/b]\n\nMy problem is that at heart, I\u2019m a tryhard and a grognard who likes to delve deep into the inner mechanics of games. Just what is the game engine like underneath Sakura Dungeon\u2019s new, sleek, and shiny chassis? What got tweaked from DMC that had me finding myself wanting to play the older version instead? In order to make a fair comparison and highlight the minor but important differences, I\u2019ll have to explain DMC\u2019s original system in more depth. [b]Here comes a massive wall of text.[/b]\n\n[h1]Demon Master Chris\u2019s Combat System[/h1]\n\nToo long for Steam.

Read the longform here: http://pastebin.com/nyTx2yZs\n\nMoar sparknotes:\n\n[list]\n    [*]Sakura Dungeon replaces Guard/Recover duality with a single, one-dimensional command that simply restores AP with no downside or other effect, thus removing the rock-paper-scissors triangle of Recover->Guard->Attack->Recover for an overly simple continuum of \"be defensive<-->attack more\"\n    [*]Dodge gain from high AP reduced, attacks are more accurate in general: now the majority of all attacks hit their targets without having to consider the target's own AP, meaning random encounters become boring and routine extremely quickly\n    [*]Critical Hits now far less dependent on AP state of target; attacks on low AP targets not guaranteed to crit, while high AP targets can sometimes still be crit anyways\n    [*]Less predictable nature of Critical Hits mainly serves to surprise and annoy the player, instead of directly rewarding you for playing well or punishing you for making mistakes\n    [*]Stripping to eliminate regen mechanic simplified; changes rhythm of boss fights entirely, turns bosses into statchecks rather than actual thinking challenges; devs outright encourage the player to simply grind to prepare for bosses, rather than rethink their strategy or try different approaches\n    [*]CP/Flow system that Sakura Dungeon introduced feels snowbally without adding very much interaction with the opponent; since bosses have been turned into statchecks, CP/Flow system only serves to reinforce the mindless, boring \"strategy\" of \"grind until you can beat the boss lol\"\n    [*]Where DMC plays like a fighting game with thinking forward and counterplay, Sakura Dungeon plays like a SNES-era Final Fantasy title where you just attack through random encounters and bosses alike repeatedly to eventually take them down at length\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Holy tl;dr Batman[/h1]\n\n[b]If you enjoy anime girls having their clothes ripped off in not-so-honorable RPG combat, go ahead and buy Sakura Dungeon.[/b] I will honestly praise the art, music, and overall aesthetic polish that are all a step above what\u2019s in Demon Master Chris. For all that I\u2019ve vomited about how the internal mechanics are RUINED FOREVER(tm), the game plays out as a respectable turn-based RPG in its own right; I have not yet encountered any major bugs or obviously unintended game imbalances or exploits. I will also continue playing Sakura Dungeon to its completion, exploring the CP system a bit more, as well as replaying it on a lower difficulty; my views on the game may change and if they do I will revisit this review.\n\nBut as far as I can tell right now, [b]if you prefer a better-oiled, more strategic and thought-provoking RPG underneath the exposed skin, skip out on this watered-down successor and play the original DMC instead.[/b] \n\n(Note: Demon Master Chris isn\u2019t on Steam, for obvious reasons. Google it yourself. You\u2019re an adult on the internet, you should know how. At least I hope you\u2019re an adult.)", "timestamp_created": 1465037925, "timestamp_updated": 1465041229, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 633, "votes_funny": 107, "weighted_vote_score": "0.714299", "comment_count": "43", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23377613": {"recommendationid": "23377613", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030228883", "num_games_owned": 334, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 86, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465040348}, "language": "english", "review": "Better then Uncharted 4.", "timestamp_created": 1465037055, "timestamp_updated": 1465037055, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 22, "weighted_vote_score": "0.360141", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23377425": {"recommendationid": "23377425", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073994062", "num_games_owned": 235, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1987, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498955304}, "language": "english", "review": "( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) The art in this game is astonishing ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)", "timestamp_created": 1465036305, "timestamp_updated": 1465036305, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.345471", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23376844": {"recommendationid": "23376844", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108017040", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484148289}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041a\u0430\u043a Demon Master Chris, \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0435. \u041c\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0442\u0430.\n\n\u0422\u0435\u043f\u0435\u0440\u044c \u044f \u0436\u0434\u0443 \u043e\u0442 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0447\u0438\u043a\u0430: Counter Sakura, Defence of the Sakura, Age of Sakura, World of Sakura, Supersakura, Street Sakura.", "timestamp_created": 1465033587, "timestamp_updated": 1465034004, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 109, "votes_funny": 228, "weighted_vote_score": "0.810457", "comment_count": "15", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23375012": {"recommendationid": "23375012", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991742910", "num_games_owned": 1365, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 4182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471549070}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6700\u8fd1\u548c\u7206\u8863\u6760\u4e0a\u4e86", "timestamp_created": 1465024182, "timestamp_updated": 1465024182, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.592928", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23374526": {"recommendationid": "23374526", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963455128", "num_games_owned": 308, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469916674}, "language": "english", "review": "When I bought this game:\n-My wallet cried\n-My mother cried\n-My dick cried", "timestamp_created": 1465021174, "timestamp_updated": 1465021174, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 108, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524222", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23374176": {"recommendationid": "23374176", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130415713", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 3382, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467917901}, "language": "english", "review": "\"The perfect blossom is a rare thing.

take this with the entire salt shaker. Also my playtime is inaccurate since the version I played wasn't on Steam, but my final playtime was 21:30 or so.)\n\nSakura Dungeon is one of the more self-explanatory game titles I've ever run across - it's a typical Sakura game, so there's a lot of well-drawn but kind of samey anime women, and it's a dungeon RPG, so \"Sakura Dungeon\" pretty well explains what you'll be getting. It's... surprisingly good, actually, in that I wasn't really expecting that much and it ended up being quite playable.\n\nHow does it actually work? Well, I'd say it's on the simpler side, but the mechanics still allow for some combat strategy - characters regenerate HP and AP each turn, and use AP to attack, but how much AP you have left helps you evade enemy attacks, so you're encouraged to use high-accuracy attacks against enemies with most of their AP left, and unload with high-power, low-accuracy attacks against enemies who have just drained all of their AP attacking you. In addition, each character has \"concentration points\", which work as a super bar, basically - it's used for some attacks, but more importantly, if it reaches 10, the character goes into a super mode, immediately refills her AP, gains significant accuracy/critical rate/dodge bonuses, has attacks that normally cost CP become free, and unlocks the use of super mode-only attacks, if she has learned any. Especially later in the game, getting your characters into super mode and keeping the enemy from getting into it becomes quite important, and makes boss battles (and normal encounters, in the postgame!) quite interesting.\n\nAs far as difficulty goes, I'd say it's not all that hard - I played through on Hard and had some difficulty, which might be understandable given the name of the difficulty setting, but at worst I had to sit around and grind up one or two levels on about three occasions, with everything else being something I could overcome with effort and filling out the map. Normal probably wouldn't require very much, if any, grinding, while Abyssal intentionally requires a good bit by reducing the rewards you gain from battle and making enemies tougher. I'm not sure I'd find that fun, though, as most of the difficulty I had came from enemies that I just couldn't hit - a lot of combat results, such as accuracy, are determined by the difference between your level and the enemy level, such that defeating enemies more than four levels above you is somewhere between nearly and completely impossible for most of the game because you just can't hit them, and even with the ridiculous attributes I had on a few characters at the end of the game, that didn't really expand to more than five levels above.\n\nThere's indeed quite a lot of playable characters, and the game rewards replacing older ones with newer ones frequently, except for the main character, Ceri, who both always has to remain in your party and always remains useful. You can also probably keep a second character you like a lot around easily - I kept Sylvi, a dark elf NPC who joins you early on, around until the end of the postgame - but most of the other characters, both face characters and captured monstergirls, got shuffled out of my party quickly as I captured more monstergirls and recruited more face characters. The characters all come with different attributes and attacks, but those can be raised with attribute seeds and added/replaced by scrolls respectively, so the real differences end up being in resistances, special abilities and personality. Each character has their own set of resistances and special abilities, causing them to take less damage from certain attacks, critically hit more often, or even revive from 0 HP automatically once per trip to the dungeon. Since these can't be changed (except for resistances, which you will get a very few items to increase over the course of the game), selecting a character or two with useful special abilities to try and keep around is probably wise.\n\nRegarding the story... it's a Sakura game. Don't really expect much, but it's not actively terrible. It's about an ancient fox spirit and her pet human knight going into a hole in the ground to reclaim it for the fox spirit, as it used to be hers. On the way they meet and do questionable things to a lot of monster girls. I didn't test the unrated version, so I don't really know anything about that part.\n\nAll in all, would I recommend it? Well, if the words \"Sakura Dungeon\" made you interested, yes, it's exactly what you think it is and it's quite good at being that, so you shouldn't hesitate to buy it. If you're looking for a dungeon RPG and dislike the Sakura series, I'd be a little more cautious, but almost all of the better dungeon RPGs out there are on handheld, with a few entries on console and the PC selection being rather lacking, especially of non-indie titles. Don't expect Etrian Odyssey or anything, but it's a servicable indie entry into the genre. If you're looking for porn... ask someone who isn't a big ball of spikes. :<", "timestamp_created": 1464984852, "timestamp_updated": 1464988462, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 130, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.769623", "comment_count": "21", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23366774": {"recommendationid": "23366774", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060163561", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466186298}, "language": "english", "review": "I usually have to trap girls in my dungeon, but now I'm trying to free them from one", "timestamp_created": 1464981578, "timestamp_updated": 1464981578, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 236, "votes_funny": 832, "weighted_vote_score": "0.626199", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23366603": {"recommendationid": "23366603", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969898414", "num_games_owned": 3405, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 2335, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475604619}, "language": "english", "review": "Howdy Doody Everyboody!\n\nYou can hear the enjoyment from me in my playthrough ^_^: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=693333744\n\nI have been waiting for this game since it was announced and so far it has exceeded my expectations.

The music is nice and relaxing, The battle system is well made and well balanced, The dungeon itself reminds me of the old Wizardy style and Strangers of Sword City.\n\nI'm very happy and pleased with the story of how the characters are and the very outstanding way they make use of the English language and not a typo anywhere. The story is very solid and the events actually chain together unlike some VNs i've read. The unique thing about Dungeon is the monsters are all girls made to look like monsters. The party system is good with some surprise characters joining Ceri and Yomi later on in the game.\n\nAs you can tell, I am very critical of how the story is put together and the way it was written. Sakura Dungeon nailed story and sentence structure out of the park in this VN/JRPG.

This is plainly a well made jrpg-dungeon crawler.\n\nThe battle system is really well done. Your stats won't go up levelling up but your level is still very important because it affects your changes to hit, your changes to evade and your changes to do a critical hit. Fighting someone 5 levels over you will be pretty difficult.\n\nYou get no experience if you fight weaker girls. Also, early girls won't be usable further into the game because their stats don't go up, which makes you change girls all the time. You get to see more girls, try more strategies and read different lines and opinions so don't get too attached to the girls (except for the protagonists).\n\nThere are 3 types of attacks: melee, magic and range. All those may also have an elemental effect. There is a different stat for every elemental resistance and for every type of attack.\n\n-Lots of options to customise how you play, like showing images when breaking the dresses of your enemies or not, fighting slow/normal/fast, stopping the fast forward automatically when needed...\n-Uncensored patch (the CGs are very well done).\n-A story that is not bad, lots of dialogues, each girl has its own personality and own lines.\n-You can save the game when you want, except on choices or battles. You will always be able to save just before a choice.\n-Secrets that you can find using logic, without needing a walkthrough.\n-Can be played with a controller. The menus are a bit slow with the controller though, nothing to worry about.\n-CG and sprite galleries.\n\nIf you have played jrpgs before you should play at least in the second difficulty (of 3). I chose the second one and it gave me some small problems here and there but even so no grinding was needed (if you don't run away from fights).\n\nAt some points the random battles get too easy, in those cases you can use the auto-battle + fast-forward in battles until you reach the next floor.\n\nIf you like hair... errr... down there... you won't find any here. Also, no flat girls and no guys. The cat girls are sooo cute but annoying af.\n\nPS: Don't go too often to the observatory,", "timestamp_created": 1518085254, "timestamp_updated": 1518085254, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39914787": {"recommendationid": "39914787", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120466022", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 1187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518578935}, "language": "english", "review": "I have been missing out.

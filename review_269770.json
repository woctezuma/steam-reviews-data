It's because when I do a review, its on the game itself, and only reviews I give negative for most of the time are for abandonment, falsely advertised as completed, or development team has deleted posts in regard to game issues. Trust me, I was tempted, but then why even bother write one to begin with. \nSecrets of Grindea is a fantastically written Ragnarok Online clone. You can play either single player, or multi-player, and can play your character either version any time. This means if you play single player, which I highly recommend playing multi-player, because you most likely will die a lot and its quite simple to be resurrected by a friend, but anyway, if you play single player, and suddenly your friends ask to join in, you can quit your game, then reload that same character and continue it in multi-player. \n          Game play is quite easy, easier than Ragnarok Online was to learn. I highly recommend this game over RO because not only do you get to run your own server with your own rules and not have to worry about strict rules, bots getting in your way, trolls, or even monthly fees for better access, you get to play in an environment you choose to have. This game is so family oriented, the whole family can actually play. Even a 5-year-old can join in with a little help. \n          The game is full of quests, and unlike RO, you can have and build your own house!!!! Something RO has always lacked for years. Sorry RO, but you met your match and have lost! Something else I love about this game, that RO lacks is the easy ability to change classes, if you can call them that. It used to be in RO that if you realized you don't like the class you're in, you either had to start completely over or wait a few years for a stat or class reset npc for an event to come out for a short matter of time. Or you would have to pay a LOT of real money for some type of item to do this. \n          The game has been in Early Release status for a while now, but its content is more than complete in the state the game is now. What\u2019s even better, is the fact with the extra DLC they sell, which is actually real, unlike EOS, it adds cute items not normally available to the game. They do this to bring in income, and quite cheaply if you ask me, so they don\u2019t have to say good bye and move on. For $15, the game is more than worth it, and as I said above, having multi-player capability, you can play with family, and as a parent, keep them safe which is a huge PLUS in my book!\n          The game has many skills, rare drops, recipes, and if you don\u2019t like something you choose, you can refund it and get your points back, to put them into another skill or stat. I should have said that above when I basically flipped off RO. RO isn\u2019t bad, its a good game too, but in my opinion, this game is MUCH better and user friendly!\n          So with all the positive review, why mention the possibility of giving it a bad review? Simple, it's not the game itself that is the problem, it's the support discussions forum for the game. Its completely overrun by kid trolls, and the developers do absolutely nothing about them. Don't get me wrong, there are some good people there who were nice and helpful, who pmd me because they were too afraid to talk out in public, which is a shame, because many who see the forums, might actually get scared into buying the game. My issue in the forums, was responding to an old post where someone who asked about healing items, got torn apart by trolls. It was a post over a year old, so figured I respond and see if there were any changes since then, which was asking if any healing items exist. I got the same horrible treatment as that poor girl who asked as well. Anyway, like always, I have looked into the game code, and most of the content is activated, and everything is in game, so had this game been put into normal sales, I would give it a thumbs up to say it\u2019s safe.\n          As for healing items, except for the drops, there are none. So, expect to die a lot until you figure the game out. If you have kids, who are young, and would like to let them play, but without the risk of dying, you can hop on over to CH and buy one for a few dollars which will lock the HP bar. You can do the same with a memory manager, but unless your highly skilled, I do not recommend doing this as you will ruin your game. Be fore warned though, over at CH the rules are never use their trainers on multi-player games. They do make some exceptions to people who run their own server and need the utility to help administrate their own server, but never use it on someone else\u2019s server, especially without the owners permissions. Doing so not only can get yourself banned from Steam, it can get you banned from CH as well. If your not sure, always ask. I should also mention, if you do let a child play, and use a trainer, they will have to play from the hosting pc. The trainer will not work properly except from the hosting pc. You can see this quite easily when they start dying with a full HP bar. This isn\u2019t due to protections, its due to the fact the calculations and real stats of each player are actually server side, unlike games like Terraria where the game client itself controls your stats. \n          Lets discuss some more features about this game. The hoster has the ability to make sure EVERYTHING gets split evenly. No more of those days where everyone has to throw what they get in a pile, then more time dividing the items. The game does this for you. It does not matter who picks the items up, they will all be split among the entire party. I\u2019m not sure if there is a limit to the number of players, but if you don\u2019t want just anyone joining your server, just password protect it. \n          Due to the small staff, the updates are slow, but from what I have seen in the forums, the wait is definitely worth it, because the content that gets added each time, is absolutely HUGE. As for the discussions section, I highly recommend reading them over before even thinking of posting there. Just to get an idea of how things work. If you have questions, but don\u2019t want the hassle of getting trolled, then just ask me. I\u2019m new to the game, but know the basics and be more than happy to help.\n          Lastly, I\u2019m in the process of opening up my own Review section for games, called L-XGI Lord-Xanthor Game Investigation, which will not only include reviews when it\u2019s done, it will also have mods listed for games without a Workshop on some titles. This is for games where the development team gives permission, I will never post information that shows how to edit someone\u2019s game without their prior consent. Till next time. Same Xanthor Time, Same Xanthor Channel, (Can\u2019t say bat, done want to get sued.

I have EP but the sword just does not respond. eventually it will time out and return to my hand, but for the 15 seconds or so that im without it i must use alternative methods of attack.\n\n-Graphical glitch: constantly looks like your charging your bow on another client. character seems to moves slower due to charging movement speed. but jumps when it recognises where you are. not game breaking but it looks like lag.\nshooting a couple of arrows seems to fix the problem\n\nPersonal issues with the game:\n- Gathering friends is a hassle. the more players you play online with the longer it takes to get everybody to one location to do an action. now this isnt an issue in moderation (eg: before a boss or leaving a map) however when every little action requires everyone to be there? its annoying. its tested our patience a LOT. we tried with 3 people? total nightmare. takes who knows how long to do every little thing. cutscenes your waiting for 5 minutes just for one guy to finish reading so you can move again. jumping through time rifts or changing the seasons? everyones gotta be there. and god forbid someone is in a menu or a shop. theres stuff to do!\n\nLoot drops:\n- so for our loot style we chose round robin. it works fine i suppose. no issues. \none thing i would like to see though is an even distribution of cards/ in multiplayer. just as a possible play mode. the reason being is that we worked as a team in the game. we were partners. so when someone gets a rare card? its pretty easy to get a bit salty. so it kind of winds up more competitive rather then based on teamwork. now im not saying competition is a bad thing, i can see how it could put you in the spirit of grinding. but we already share chest loot and money, so would cards really be that big of a jump?\nIt would just be a nice option to have for more casual players.\n\nplayer markers:\nits easy to get lost from your party members. there was a lot of \"where are you?\" \"over here by ____\" \n\"wait- where is _____?\" \"go up.\" \"i am up. nothing but trees\"\na player marker would be exceedingly helpful so i can tell what area my party members are in.\n\nfor the issues i described? i still had a lot of fun playing this and still will. \nhowever for now? 1-2 player is probably best if you want to make good progress. \nim really looking forward to seeing how the game advances and for its final release. \ni hope the info ive provided is helpful to the developers.", "timestamp_created": 1515390876, "timestamp_updated": 1515390876, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39172711": {"recommendationid": "39172711", "author": {"steamid": "76561198176641959", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 336, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 100, "last_played": 1515840354}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5341\u5206\u63a8\u8350\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f!\n17\u5e74\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u90fd\u6709\u73a9\uff0c\u5f53\u65f6\u7248\u672c0.5\u5de6\u53f3\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e09\u795e\u6bbf\u8fd8\u6ca1\u6709boss\uff0c\u548c\u51e0\u4e2a\u670b\u53cb\u8054\u673a\u73a9\u3002\n\u603b\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u753b\u98ce\u5f88\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u914d\u4e50\u4e5f\u6bd4\u8f83\u597d(\u67f1\u5b50\u5c71BGM\u4e00\u542c\u5c31\u505c\u4e0d\u4e0b\u6765\u4e86\u554a\u5582\u256d(\u00b0A\u00b0`)\u256e)\u3002\u73a9\u8d77\u6765\u5f88\u4f11\u95f2\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u611f\u89c9\u3002\n\u5173\u4e8e\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u64cd\u63a7\u6027\uff0c\u6211\u89c9\u5f97ok\uff0c2D\u7684\u4e16\u754c+\u725b\u76ae\u7684\u8d70\u4f4d\uff0c\u518d\u52a0\u4e0a\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u5f39\u5e55(\u771f\u00b7\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6)\uff0c\u73a9\u8d77\u6765\u624b\u611f\u5f88\u597d\u3002 \u30fd(\u00b0\u2200\u00b0)\uff89\n\u7136\u540e\u662f\u6e38\u620f\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u4e4b\u524d\u73a9\u7684\u7248\u672c\u5230\u73b0\u5728\u6e38\u620f\u66f4\u65b0\u4e86\u4e0d\u5c11\uff0c\u6280\u80fd\u4e5f\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u597d\u591a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u8f85\u52a9\u7c7b\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u6253boss\u4f1a\u8f7b\u677e\u7684\u591a\u3002\n\u76ee\u524d\u5df2\u77e5\u6700\u5927\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u5267\u60c5\u66f4\u65b0\u5f97\u592a\u592a\u592a\u592a\u592a\u592a\u592a\u592a\u592a\u592a\u592a\u592a\u592a\u592a\u592a\u592a\u592a\u6162\u4e86\u554a\u256d(\u00b0A\u00b0`)\u256e\u611f\u89c9\u66f4\u65b0\u5267\u60c5\u7528\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5168\u66f4\u65b0\u5728\u6e38\u620f\u6027\u4e0a\u4e86\u256d(\u00b0A\u00b0`)\u256e\n\u53cd\u6b63\u518d\u8fc7\u51e0\u5341\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u5c31\u8981\u51fa\u6b63\u5f0f\u7248\u4e86 \u30fd(\u00b0\u2200\u00b0)\uff89\uff0c\u5230\u65f6\u5019\u518d\u770b\u770b\u4f1a\u53d1\u5c55\u6210\u4ec0\u4e48\u6837\u5427\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1515387273, "timestamp_updated": 1515387273, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39142510": {"recommendationid": "39142510", "author": {"steamid": "76561198415164209", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 542, "last_played": 1516430254}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u597d\u73a9", "timestamp_created": 1515306429, "timestamp_updated": 1515306429, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39102841": {"recommendationid": "39102841", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114262475", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 522, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 92, "last_played": 1515381812}, "language": "english", "review": "love this game!!!!!!! incredible story, and its like zelda from back in the days.... for all those pixcel art fans, you WILL GET YOURE money worth.", "timestamp_created": 1515202216, "timestamp_updated": 1515202216, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516129", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39080700": {"recommendationid": "39080700", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038164722", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 212, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455835792}, "language": "english", "review": "A few cool concepts, but this game has been in early access for way too long for me to recommend it to you.

It's an Early Access game so be wary of that, but so far it seems to hold its content's worth and enjoys a cute and charming narrative with characters who, while token, aren't just wallflowers. The game takes its world quite seriously but the world itself is not terribly serious, which had me dragged up in the game's silly pace. Things like visiting Santa Claus and battling mobile pumpkins hail to the days of SNES. Combat is basically one button to attack, and skills set on various keys. \n\nThe skill system is where the game shows off its feathers, and it should be spoken for that this is probably where the game both A) needs the most improvement! and B) enjoys the most distinction. I personally play a character who uses a one-handed sword, and some buffing magic with an ice spell so that I can support people in combat. And this is just one of many potential builds you could make; a two-handed swordsman with summoned minions, a full-on mage who masters all elements. A spell-blade who wields sword and magic. Besides active skills, there are three pages of fifteen passive bonuses that include effects as mundane as bonus attack, up to adding a portion of your magic attack to your basic attack, or adding the ability to chill or burn enemies on hit. Needless to say, you can go in a lot of ways.\n\nExploratory or perfectionist sorts fear not, for the skill system is handled at anytime through your menu and resets are just a small gold expenditure away.\n\nAll-in-all, it's going to be interesting to see where this goes.

Not a bad game by any means, but I would hold off on a purchase until the full version is out. \n\nThe multiplayer is an entirely different experience, with lagging players and teleporting bosses and weird cutscenes. It was, again, a fun experience, but be ready to encounter rough development patches. \n\nI wasn\u2019t too fond of the leveling system, where you choose from an assortment of weapon powers and spells and passive buffs. You can refund your points easily enough, in case you run across a build you want to try or something, but if that is the case, it should just be some sort of badge system that you allocate your points into and can freely reassign.\n\nThe quest system was...interesting. I\u2019m not really sure if I care enough about quests in this game besides the main one? The rewards for doing them are nice, but it almost always boils down to \u201cgo here and kill so many of these\u201d and I understand that this is standard fare for these types of games, especially a game literally having \u201cGrind\u201d in its name, so I won\u2019t complain about it. \n\nYou are also encouraged to find these cards that drop off of monsters after killing loads of them, and the cards have different buffs on them but they usually raise your effectiveness against that particular mob. The mobs are your typical grouping of monsters, slimes and bears and such. They get more interesting as the game goes on, but in the end, you are just fighting the same types of attacks and a.o.e.s and you get items you can craft with and such.\n\nIn all, it\u2019s a pretty average game that has some neat bosses that have desync issues in multiplayer, with a power-up system from old RPGs that really needs a retuning, and an overall charming feel to the soundtracks and overworld. \n", "timestamp_created": 1514021489, "timestamp_updated": 1514021489, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.631187", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38562501": {"recommendationid": "38562501", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045418492", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 1006, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514337740}, "language": "english", "review": "i like it,,,,,,,,,,, I like it to the point im dying for it\ncause its a \"early access game\"\nstill waiting..........", "timestamp_created": 1514007715, "timestamp_updated": 1514007715, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38541579": {"recommendationid": "38541579", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079731181", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1841, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514553048}, "language": "english", "review": "A love letter to Ragnarok Online.

But it's Early Access, so that might get \n   fixed or wasn't a priority yet.\n-The story developement is kinda slow. If you expect to play through new story patches every other week, you'll be \n  severely disappointed. That's to be expected from a three-man developement team, though. I only put this here because \n  I know some people are too lazy to look up WHY developement is slow before complaining.\n\nIt's a decent game already, especially for coop, and I can only imagine how good it'll be once it's finished.\n", "timestamp_created": 1511708871, "timestamp_updated": 1511708871, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000",

they usually contain quite a bit of new content. \n\nNow for the actual game, visually as you can tell its very retro, nothing else really to say about that, it looks amazing if you're into that and will spark some feelings of videos games from days past.\n\nGamplay wise, it plays like classic Legend of Zelda, very actiony, very straight forward, as a plus it was a pretty solid RPG skill system that supports quite a few different play styles and builds, and to top it off it has fun equipment sytem, that offers different visuals for weapons, sheilds, and hats/glasses, so you can have a pretty unique charcter not only in terms of gameplay wise but also looks\n\nThis is a solid game, with a solid amount of gameplay for only being an early access game, I feel confident that DEVs will finish the game one day, and personally i can't wait till that happens.", "timestamp_created": 1511572874, "timestamp_updated": 1511572874, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

Some things are pretty tough to do without a worthwhile reward for doing so. About the game, though:\n\nYou are a young child thrown into the world of Grindea to become a Collector, which is basically an excuse to kill stuff and get cooler stuff. People will ask you for your help when they see you, but then refuse to really give a reward that was worth the time and effort (greedy bastards). Following the general storyline is all well and good, but without doing anything on the side, you probably won't be strong enough to beat the bosses. At some point you invade Santa's workshop for some honey or something. Then, you become a friend of the fairies and then you kill a fairy anyway. Even later down the road, you become a time traveler that has to fight a guy who's basically a god and survive.\n\nWhat I'm getting at is that the story is difficult and very GRINDE (;p), yet immersive and fun.\n\nTL;DR: Buy the damn game, it's worth $15.00 and will almost promise to suck out around 30-40 hrs of your life with an UNFINISHED game.", "timestamp_created": 1511392184, "timestamp_updated": 1511789137, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36849304": {"recommendationid": "36849304", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989601979", "num_games_owned": 551, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 4288, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514150517}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Secrets of Grindea \u00e9 um jogo sensacional, unico problema dele \u00e9 a demora pro novo conteudo ser introduzido no jogo.", "timestamp_created": 1511392033, "timestamp_updated": 1511392033, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36844118": {"recommendationid": "36844118", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999547038", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 963, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510353378}, "language": "english", "review": "While this game has been in development for awhile its not been without it's updates.

The story and adventure is very satisfying. The npcs are funny and really stand out with their own distinct personalities.

I've purchased this game about 4 times now, to show it off to my friends and each of them said \"What?!?! I can't wait for the next content update! I need more!!\" whenever we hit the end of each update.\n\n(Dear god the puzzles..)\nTheir puzzles are very unique and challenging. \n\nPros:\n\n- Great Story\n- Good Artwork\n- Funny Characters ; Facial Expressions\n- Challenging Puzzles\n- Gary\n- Very very large amount of game/show references\n- Rewarding Grinding ; Most drops sell for a good amount\n\n- Dev's are actually pumping out good content at a reasonable rate & they listen to their players! :000\n(Don't see that very often. o3o)\n\n- Skill Points used for Magic, Melee, or Support Class Magic\n- Pets aren't just for show and can be used for stat boosting\n- Challenging Bosses\n- Open World ; Many biomes\n- Minigames ; Arena\n- They know how to make the player feel included in the story.\nI'm sure I'm missing some really good points.. XD\n\n\nCons:\n\n- Minimal Character Customization ; Weapons (Melee & Shield), Hats, Masks\n(You get to customize the Shirt, Pants, Scarf, Hair and Skin colors in the beginning but that's all there is for clothes.\n You also get to choose the hair type but throughout the game, you're stuck with the same Scarf, Shirt and Pants.)\n\n- Port Forwarding/Hamachi required for multiplayer\n(It's a really not a hard thing to do, but for most players, it's a turn off to go out of their way to port forward.)\n\n- THE NEED FOR WANTING MOREEEEE!!\n(The Devs are nice enough not to leave you off at a cliff hanger but damnit, I want more!)\n\nIf I missed anything, I'm sure someone else will catch it.

If you like or at least tolerate pixel graphics, if you liked the classic Zelda games, if you like slashing, burning and shooting your opponents into submission, this game is the right pick for you.\n\nAs of this point, I've completed the Story Mode as it is so far. I must say the story line was bland and didn't have much to offer..At first. After the first two missions for the Collector's Guild, things start getting interesting. And by the time I finished the current story mode content, I was furious. You get back, talk to your Father in the Collector's Guild HQ to continue the story and \"Sorry, it's not finished yet.\" NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! It was JUST getting to the good part! It's like stopping your favorite movie RIGHT at your favorite part and leaving it there. Forever. The tears..So many tears...\n\nThe name itself suggests there will be mountains of grinding, but I just didn't see it myself. I spent maybe two hours total grinding for levels and some drops to forge myself a Crystal Shield at the Flying Fortress (I'm good at Perfect Guarding.) All in all, I'd say it's definitely worth the buy just for the Story Mode folks.\n\nKain.", "timestamp_created": 1511336338, "timestamp_updated": 1511336418, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0,

Some of the bosses in particular are difficult, and some of the enemies can get that way, too. I have definitely died a few times due to a lot of enemies at once + status effect DOTs on my character. A big part of the game is grinding (big surprise huh?) to farm items and cards that give you special perks. Once you find the best place to farm a card, the enemies start populating and re-populating until you have an endless barrage of enemies trying to kill you. A lot of them have certain attacks or defenses that can put a damper on being able to simply kill them with a few hard blows. For example, some enemies can only be killed by popping your shield at a specific time, some roll quickly around the room in a shell of spikes, some go underground and can only be killed when they pop back up on you. The game is very in depth for a little indie game. It seemingly has it all. Definitely worth $15. I'd even pay up to $45 for it...but don't tell the developers I said that ;)\n\nThe game is just fun.

This game has been in Early access for the longest time BUT I'd like to say that the latest \"arc\" added to this game is absolutely amazing and emotional. A MUST experience!

Even the inaccurate aiming and controls overall suggest this isn't a game that requires a whole lot of skill. However the game is very hard, especially during boss battles. You take huge amounts of damage and the only way to heal is by picking up health globes dropped by fallen enemies. The issue with this system is they only seem to drop when you're at low health and during boss battles, they don't drop at all. This mean you cannot heal during an entire boss battle. It took me 6 tries just to take down the second boss. \n\nIf this were a hardcore souls-like game, that'd be fine but that's not the case here. The controls don't allow for fine aim or perfect movement, causing you to often take damage or miss attacks, something you can't afford to do when a boss will kill you in only 5 or 6 hits.

Especially those with the tag, \"Pixel\". I'm a late 80's baby, and grew up on games such as Tibia, Final Fantasy, and more. Those early games shaped my attraction to games. This game is a tad chibi, but so far the quantity and quality of what is in the game (I.E., story, interactable characters, items, skills, talents, etc.) makes up for the child-like esk. And at the same time that esk is refreshing. There is something to be said about games that can bring a customizable twist to a simplstic world. So far... Secrets of Grindea does it well! I thoroughly enjoyed the first 1.5 hours I invested into this game. Think: Tibia meets Hunger Games, meets Boarderlands, meets Pixel, meets sword-and-board, meets magic, meets cute yet attractice game art, meets what the actual-where-have-you-been, meets smooth combat, meets fluid movement and terrain adventuring, meets addictive story element. That's this game. I found myself wanting to find out more and more, even though some games that have this esk have very assumable elements (typically repeated from other bigger games). This is hands down one of the most enjoyable games I have played on Steam in a while. I will be following, updating, and writing more to game devs on anything I see that could be a noteable point for development. I encourage you... the price makes the purchase feel questionable...

I plan on playing it so much more.\n\n  This game is beautiful will be the first thing I will say. The pixel art style is usually done in a blocky way now a days, however this game seems smooth with the style. If you couldn't notice from the title this game can be extremely grindy, but you don't have to spend all your time grinding away trash mobs if you don't want to. The story is predictable, but has arcs in it that feel like it hasn't happen in any other game I have played recently. Updates do come out fairly regularly compared to other games, so if you want to play this game for a few hours, put it down, and then return a few months laterthat is a legit way to play.  After 21.1 hours in the game I still don't have all the cards you can get, nor all the trash mob items, crafting, quests, and fishes. So I'm looking at maybe another 5 hours at most to get everything in the game now. However by time i think i get everything there will probably be an update for more content.\n\n  Another thing that makes this game so addicting and fun is the Arcade/ Arena mode. Where to progress you have to get better at the game. some people have over 60 hours in this mode alone, and still haven't got their town filled up, or have beaten the final floor's boss. Basically if you want to buy a game that makes you feel good about yourself when you play it, to see how far you can progress, i highly suggest this game. Another plus is that you can play with friends.\n\n  I really don't have anything negative to say about this game other than if you don't like to work for things and grind than this game isn't for you.", "timestamp_created": 1503866522, "timestamp_updated": 1503866522, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500063", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34532237": {"recommendationid": "34532237", "author": {"steamid": "76561198362569729", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 700, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507020526}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6781\u5177\u6f5c\u529b\u7684\u4e00\u6b3eRPG\u6e38\u620f\uff08\u6ed1\u7a3d\uff09\u3002\n\n\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u672c\u4eba\u9996\u6b21\u6e38\u620f\u8bc4\u6d4b\n\u7b97\u4e0a\u76d7\u7248\u5df2\u7ecf\u670930\u5c0f\u65f6\u6e38\u620f\u65f6\u95f4\u4e86\uff0c\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u6709\u5f88\u8212\u9002\u7684\u4ee3\u5165\u611f\uff0c\u6e38\u73a9\u65f6\u6709\u79cd\u56de\u5230\u7ae5\u5e74\u822c\u7684\u65e0\u5fe7\u65e0\u8651\uff0c\u4ee5\u81f3\u4e8e\u5728\u73a9\u76d7\u7248\u65f6\u5c31\u5df2\u7ecf\u505c\u4e0d\u4e0b\u6765\u4e86\u3002\uff08\u76f8\u4fe1\u4e0d\u6b62\u6211\u4e00\u4eba\u559c\u6b22\u5148\u76d7\u7248\u8bd5\u73a9\u518d\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e70\u4e0d\u4e70\u6b63\u7248\u7684_(:\u0437\u300d\u2220)_\uff09\n\n\u4e2a\u4eba\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6e38\u620f\u6781\u9ad8\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u8db3\u4ee5\u8ba9\u66f4\u65b0\u901f\u5ea6\u5f88\u6162\uff0c\u6781\u6162\uff0c\u975e\u5e38\u6162\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u53d8\u7684\u53ef\u4ee5\u63a5\u53d7\u3002\n\u624b\u67c4\u64cd\u4f5c\u5341\u5206\u987a\u6ed1\uff0c\u80cc\u666f\u97f3\u4e50\u4e0d\u4f1a\u8ba9\u4eba\u538c\u70e6\uff0c\u5267\u60c5\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u98ce\u683c\u90fd\u5f88\u5438\u5f15\u6211\u3002\n\u5c31\u662f\u6218\u6597\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u5f85\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u56de\u8840\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u65b9\u4fbf\uff0c\u52a0\u4e9b\u56de\u590d\u6280\u80fd\u4ec0\u4e48\u7684\u3002\u76f8\u5bf9\u672c\u4eba\u8fd9\u79cd\u624b\u6b8b\u515a\u7684\u6389\u8840\u901f\u5ea6\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u5c0f\u602a\u6389\u56de\u8840\u73e0\u51e0\u7387\u611f\u4eba\uff0c\u603b\u4e0d\u80fd\u6253\u7740\u6253\u7740\u56de\u4e00\u8d9f\u4e3b\u57ce\u5427\u3002\u3002\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u6211\u4e2a\u4eba\u4e0d\u592a\u9002\u5e94\u3002\u3002\n\u5176\u5b9e\u8fd9\u6837\u6709\u4e9b\u96be\u5ea6\u4f46\u4e0d\u81f3\u4e8e\u8fc7\u5206\u7684\u8bbe\u5b9a\u633a\u597d\u3002\n\u603b\u7684\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u5f3a\u70c8\u63a8\u8350\u7ed9\u559c\u6b22\u6b64\u7c7b\u578b\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u73a9\u5bb6\u3002\nPS:\u73a9\u76d7\u7248\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u8fc7\u573a\u52a0\u8f7d\u9875\u9762\u5c45\u7136\u4f1a\u63d0\u793a\u559c\u6b22\u7684\u8bdd\u8bf7\u4e70\u6b63\u7248\u3002\u3002\n\n\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u6709\u751f\u4e4b\u5e74\u73a9\u5230\u6b63\u5f0f\u7248\n", "timestamp_created": 1503848200, "timestamp_updated": 1503848200, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.601064", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34530675": {"recommendationid": "34530675", "author": {"steamid": "76561198315098752", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500304164}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd8\u662f\u7b49\u6210\u54c1\u51fa\u6765\u518d\u73a9\u3002\u3002\u3002\u73b0\u5728\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002\u3002\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1503843753, "timestamp_updated": 1503843753, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34530544": {"recommendationid": "34530544", "author": {"steamid": "76561198343596317", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1490, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507131874}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc7ac\ubc0c\ub124", "timestamp_created": 1503843404, "timestamp_updated": 1503843404, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34528805": {"recommendationid": "34528805", "author": {"steamid": "76561198388934179", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 750, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510752807}, "language": "english", "review": "After spending weeks looking for a good enough RPG to waste my time on, I can safely say that secrets of grindea is the PERFECT filler for that little RPG hole on your heart. It looks amazing, it plays really well and it's got every appealing aspect of an RPG nicely put in. Keeping in mind that the game isn't finished, it really doesn't leave you wanting much, it's a super satisfactory experience and it really is the BEST. The level system is thought out and it allows for specific character building, my only niggle with it being that you don't ever really get much mana which when paired with the summons makes for pretty limited spellcasting, AND it'd be nice if the final upgrade for blink gave unlimited usage instead of being free to use the first time and then mana costly afterwards (or a dodge/roll option). But admittedly those are just my personal issues and aren't nearly enough to stop this game being the absolute delight it is.

If you're a fan of old school 16-bit graphics like from Link to the Past or Secret of Mana, you're going to fall in love with this game. If you like online co-op, a witty story, and action RPGs- pull the trigger and buy it.\n\nPros:\n- Great for online co-op!!! Definitely the highlight of the game, I probably would have never played it otherwise. Playing with a friend made for a great experince.\n- The artwork is GORGEOUS!\n- Love the HP system. There isn't any healing and you have to rely on health drops which makes the game challenging at times.\n- Character build customization is really cool, you can be anything from an air bender swordsman or a mult-magic type summoner or bruiser 2-hand wielder.\n- The story and dialogue is hilarious. My friend and I were laughing out loud a lot during the game.\n- Boss fights, temples, puzzles are all awesome. The current last boss is crazy.\n\nCons:\n- The game is about ~75% complete. The fourth temple is not in the game yet, and there's also a few things you can't do yet.\n- You will probably beat the whole game in under 20 hours, and then there's not really much left to do.\n- Low replay value because of the linear story. However, because of character customization and online co-op it could be fun to play with others again and try new builds.\n- The game feels a little uneven after the first two temples. The third area/temple is like a whole story in itself, and there's not really a temple.

This game is fantastic for a number of reasons. Great music (though it can get repetitive) immersive skills, and challenging (oh man challenging) combat and boss fights. Some other reviewers will abstain from recommending this game solely because the bosses are \"too difficult\". But you have infinite enemies to grind up  your loot and levels so this isn't a long-term issue. I mean the game has \"grind\" in the title. \n\nIt is early access and the Devs seem to be updating fairly consistently. But don't let the Alpha dissuade you, the game is fully functional and highly enjoyable in its current state. I have encountered little to no bugs, and the multiplayer plays flawlessly. Many games today are built for singleplayer with some lower quality multiplayer on the side - like a wilted salad or mushy microwaved fries. But this game, while still fantastic solo, takes co-op to the next level including relevant dialogue to having 2 persons and so much more. I can't recommend this game enough.\n\nAs a message to the Devs - if they ever read this - I would like to make a few suggestions as this is early access. Firstly, while the music that is present is pleasant, there is only one track per area. And since a large portion of what you're doing in this game is grinding, it can get a little repetitive.\n\nAdditionally, it would be nice to be able to re-fight bosses on the path of grinding for levels and loot. Not in arena or endless mode, but by going back to the place you originally fought them and using a summoning item or something if you want to limit it. This would open up the possibility for boss cards, which would be pretty swell.\n\nFinally, age old complaint that I'm sure all developers get sick of. \"We want moaar!\" Honestly though it would be nice to have more melee combat options. Perhaps rather than having the bow as a side item with semi-limited arrows, have a ranger \"class.\" Right now there are only 1h and 2h weapons. Maybe specify them further to include daggers, 1h swords, 1h clubs/hammers, 2h swords, 2h spears, 2h clubs/hammers, and some specialty mixes each with specific abilities/skill trees. \n\nHonestly I love the game and want to help make it better from my limited perspective as a player.", "timestamp_created": 1503351934, "timestamp_updated": 1503351934, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0,

quickly suck you in. After one session I was left with an insastiable desire to play the game more. However, the second session left me frustrated, and with no desire to ever play the game again.\n\nTwo main points: Bosses and rewards.\n1. Bosses are very difficult in this game. And not like dark souls where you learn the bosses patterns and slowly become better and better until you can kill the boss without even getting touched. Every boss fight is terribly unfun and annoying as fuck, extremely gimmicky and straight up bullshit. I have no idea how you could possibly defeat most of the bosses playing solo, a friend is almost required if you want to play this game on the lowest difficulty level. Don't even get me started on the hard mode.\n\n2. Me and a friend defeated 4 bosses in our second session of play. All of these bosses stemmed from the same quest line. Not once did we recieve experience points or loot from ANY of these bosses. So we stayed the same level basically this entire questline as it become increasingly difficult to get enough xp to level from simple mobs. And the grand reward for this quest that took 4+ hours? About 1/3rd a bar of XP (at level 14) and a talent orb. Talent orbs are worthless and some of the bonuses you can unlock with them include 2% max health increase or 2% magic attack increase. This quest did not even give a skill point or a sword or staff or helmet or anything. There is no reward to playing this game: xp, new gear, and skills - arguably the most important part of an RPG - are scarcely given to you and I don't think I've ever felt more unrewarded for playing a game in my entire life. \n\n3/10, kinda fun game and absolutely abysmal RPG.", "timestamp_created": 1502949137, "timestamp_updated": 1502949137, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.400916", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34300210": {"recommendationid": "34300210", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009359525", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2422, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512338533}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uac8c\uc784 \uba40\ud2f0\ub85c \uc808\ub300 \ud558\uc9c0\ub9c8\uc138\uc694\n\uac1c\ud295\uae40 \uc4f0\ub798\uae30\uac9c\n", "timestamp_created": 1502946470, "timestamp_updated": 1502946470, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34279290": {"recommendationid": "34279290", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060725415", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 935, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508930278}, "language": "koreana", "review": "Well made game but tooooooooo short.\nupdate plz", "timestamp_created": 1502900331, "timestamp_updated": 1502900331, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34277973": {"recommendationid": "34277973", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095238480", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 457, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502895555}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ub108\ubb34\ub098 \uc801\uc740 \uc7a5\ube44\uac1c\uc218 , \uc2a4\ud0ac \ud55c\uc190\uac80,\uc18c\ud658\ub9c8\ubc95 \uc81c\uc678\ud558\uba74 \uadf8\ub2e4\uc9c0 \uc88b\uc9c0\uc54a\uc74c", "timestamp_created": 1502896108, "timestamp_updated": 1502896108, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34276266": {"recommendationid": "34276266", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076047071", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 7638, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513546117}, "language": "english", "review": "It feels like a more complex and complete cube world I am completely addicted to it.", "timestamp_created": 1502890341, "timestamp_updated": 1502890341, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34275442": {"recommendationid": "34275442", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143869716", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1340, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505294582}, "language": "english", "review": "So far I have about 18 hours in the game and am only 66% in.

slightly challenging at bosses. This is not the game you are looking for. \nI only recommend this for gamers who have experince playing hard RPGs. Otherwise I don't recommend this to anyone else. Below are some pros and cons to get a idea of what the game is like and some whishes for how it could improve.\n\n+ The art style is very pleasent to look at, no harsh colors or choppy animation\n+ Story so far is good, especially when your at the temple and read the data logs on the walls \n+ Monsters are easy to find and are fairly strong but not to difficult if they're not in mobs or boss levels\n\n- Game is WAY to difficult on normal mode, which should be the base line and not be hard mode in disguise\n- Bosses are also insanely difficult, mainly shown in the winter level and even the beginning boss. Which should introduce players how the boss system works out, Not make them rage quit.\n- Healing items are WAY to rare, usally only found in monster drops which are uncommon/rare and dont heal you all the way making you panic and run\n- Maybe just me, but the controls are also fairly weird and challenging. I sometimes accidently minimize the game which most of the time is me fighting a boss or a mob of monsters.\n\n* MAKE A EASY MODE or make the bosses easier so you dont scare away gamers wanting to play\n* If multiple tries are shown in a boss that is difficult for the player, make the boss slightly easier so they stand a chance or reduce minion spawn in bosses that have minions.\n\nHope this helps if you were thinking about getting this game or not!", "timestamp_created": 1502151716, "timestamp_updated": 1502677228, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.362211", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34075133": {"recommendationid": "34075133", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057665852", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 1188, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502709862}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uac04\ub9cc\uc5d0 2D RPG \uc544\uc8fc \uc7ac\ubc0c\uac8c \ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\uc9c4\uc9dc \uc81c\uac00 \ucc3e\ub358 RPG \ub290\ub08c\uc774\uc5d0\uc694. \uc624\ud508\uc6d4\ub4dc\ub9cc \ucc3e\ub2e4\uac00 \ud55c\ubc88 \uc774\uac70 \ud574\ubd24\ub294\ub370 \uc644\uc804 \ucde8\ud5a5\uc800\uaca9!!\n", "timestamp_created": 1502083528, "timestamp_updated": 1502083528, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34073728": {"recommendationid": "34073728", "author": {"steamid": "76561198390379595", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2305, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510872306}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a great game and very enjoyable with a friend (or three).

But I have to say, that the game is not that well balanced. Playing on hard was one of the hardest experiences of my life, way worse than games like Meatboy where its actually supposed to be insanely hard. Dark Souls 2 and 3 are a breeze compared to this.\n\nThere are many instances in the game where you feel you literally have no chance, and most of the spells or abilities you have access to won't help you at all in those situations, meaning you have to rely purely on luck and hope the enemy AI doesn't cast spells in a particular order or with a particular frequency. Example: Fighting the two fairies (fall and summer) in the winter palace. And this is, apparently only *3 out of 5 star* difficulty level, according to the author of the game.\n\nWhat the heck is five star difficulty? I probably don't want to know, it would be inhumanly difficult.\n\nIts definitely an interesting juxtaposition, to be playing a game that looks like its for kids, yet (on hard difficulty) is actually the most painful experience you will ever have.\n\nAnyway that's the main thing I wanted to get across. Besides that, I don't remember there being any music or noticeably good sound effects. The textures are decent. Every character is super-attractive (even the guards) which is kind of funny. Beyond that I liked the sense of humor. The fairies are kind of like cute babies, so I think this game will appeal to girls :P. And me apparently.\n\nThere is decent player progression overall, but a lot of the skills are unfinished, and they have been unfinished for years now as far as I can tell. I seriously doubt that this game will ever be finished. I think the developer left to start a different project, because no progress has really been made and its been about 5 years since I played this game last. I doubt any games takes that long to make, unless its Star Citizen in which case you will get to play it when you turn 80.\n\nThat's about it for this review.

Being purely luck based, the game could have you playing for hours on end without getting what you want, or simply getting it too quickly. Secrets of Grindea, if I had to explain it in the shortest way possible, I'd say this: Completionist's Wet Dream. Why do I say that? Well, continue reading and you'll see why.\n\n[h1] Early Access: 10/10 [/h1]\n\nThe reason I'm giving Early Access a 10/10, is because the developer has and continues to update the game, and allows us to see the process in which he is doing it, shows us what he is doing and tells us what he has planned for the future. He promised a housing system when I first got the game, one of the lastest patches gave us that housing system, with enough furniture for me to be pleased. This is what Early Access games should be like.\n\n[h1] Fighting: 8/10 [/h1]\n\nFighting is 90% of what you will be doing in the game. Although there are different things such as Fishing and Housing System, the game is centered around its fighting. It starts off simple, the game gives you your first weapons, a one-handed sword, a two-handed club and a shield. Now, different to the fighting system in most games, you get to use the shield for both. The Two-Handed weapons, and the One-Handed weapons contain different abilities you can learn through the game, 5 abilities for each, allowing you to polish your fighting style. In the future, you may also specialize in magic, having to choose from four different elements: Fire, Ice, Earth and Air.\n\nPersonally, I was a bit sad there were no classes in the game, but at the same time you may build your character however you want without any sort of limitation. I loved the fighting, nonetheless. I'll say it's one of the funnest fighting systems. More in-depth explanation in \"Talent System\"\n\n[h1] Talent System: 8.5/10 [/h1]\n\nThe Talent System is very easy to use. One-Handed and Two-Handed get a certain amount of abilities, which you will be upgrading as you level up. So the Talent System has multiple points you can utilize, one you can use on your abilities, in a basic matter (1-5) and from there you use another point, called the Golden point (5-10) which enhances your ability. I personally felt the two-handed and one-handed played very differently.\n\nThe last point, the third one is used on your passives. This is where you decide whether your character is tanky, by giving it +%HP or building your character crit damage, even Magic Attack. If you end up regreting your decision, you can click the ability and refund, which will cost you a bit of gold. You will be getting a lot of gold if you stick around to grind for everything.\n\n[h1] Grinding: 10/10 [/h1]\n\nWith that being said, let's move onto the grinding. The grinding in this game, is fantastic. Giving you multiple things to finish, farm, and complete. This is why I said, a completionist will love this game. Every zone has 5 fish which you can catch, it is very fun and fish are good for use in the future. [spoiler]When you get your pet, you feed fish, or the items animals drop to make it stronger.[/spoiler] Aside from the fishing in every zone, every monster in the game has a very low drop rate to their \"card\" .. These cards, give you permanent boosts, some to your magic attack, some to simple things like extra discount on items you buy. The most common card being a 0.3% droprate. If you dedicate yourself to getting all of these cards, it will increase your gametime exponentially.\n\n[h1] Controls: 9/10 [/h1]\n\nThe controls in this game are very simple. You move with the arrow keys, attack with Z and block with X. Your abilities also being close to the Z and X for easier reaction time (C, A, S, D, V, F, Q, W, E, R) All the keys being modifiable, and controller support making it great. \n\n[h1] Misc: 10/10 [/h1]\n\nThe Mechanics are very interesting. When you pick up an item of interest (Armor or Weapon) it will appear on the top right, comparing it to the item you have equipped. If you wish to equip your picked up item, you press Tab and ta-da! Your item has been equipped.\n\nAs for the menu, while you'll be going there a lot to check your talents, and there is no specific button to open it, it's extremely easy to navigate. Separated into 8 categories (Character, Equipment, Inventory, Crafting, Skills, Journal, World Map, System.) the game is easy to work around. Realistically speaking, you'll be using a maximum of 4 of those 8, but it's still nice to be able to see your character's stats.\n\nEverything you equip in the game can be changed into an item you own. If you have a two-handed weapon you like the way it looks, but it's weaker, you can equip it as \"Style\" and it will replace your current weapon. It's the same with your Hat, Facegear and Shield. And if you are not the type of person to care for it, you may always hide it by right-clicking on the original item.\n\nThe Housing System is great, but I will warn you now, it takes a lot of money. It's great because you may make it as big as you want (As far as I've seen, I haven't tested the limit but I have spent over 50k gold on it) with upcoming furniture and a very intuitive system to change the house around, allowing you to change even the lighting on different rooms, to how you want your house's structure to be. Keep in mind, the game is still beta and housing is still not perfect, missing some furniture to fill your house perfectly, you will get more furniture as you complete more dungeons.\n\nCo-op in the game works beautifully, with a very easy to set-up server for newbies, it's just a point and click with multiple options, You may set the loot to Round-Robin or Every man for himself, where you just run to get the items, first come, first serve. With an Arcade Mode that I haven't truly gotten around to trying and an arena zone, where you can play Player vs. Player, or unite all to try and kill waves of monsters, getting graded by your time and damage you took, making it interesting to have everyone screaming at each other because a person got tickled by a monster and now you can't get that perfect S.\n\nThe difficulty is flexible and can be changed inside the game, even during a fight. I wasn't much of a fan on the hard aspect of the game, because I never truly liked bullet hells, and it definitely turns the boss fights into just that. But if it gets too difficult, you can always go back to normal difficulty.\n\n[h1] Story: 6.5/10 [/h1]\n\nAnd last, but not least, the story in this game is pretty basic. Without getting too much into detail, you can play with your friends through it all, it adds no change, apart from the fact that you need to farm for more cards per player. I couldn't get into the story, some very funny characters I enjoyed interacting with, some I couldn't wait to get off my back. I laughed a lot in the dialogue, that I won't lie about. The con of the game, for me, was the storyline. But it did not make the gameplay through the story unenjoyable, I just prefered the aspects of farming in the game.", "timestamp_created": 1501423939, "timestamp_updated": 1501493219, "voted_up":

passes I had a very good impression of her . The game has plenty of pros : 1+ good graphics , just a great pixelart , I like doing and picked up you have a lot of chips ; 2+ DIVINE optimization , I'm playing on my old non-gaming laptop 2010 play the game of 2017 , 60 fps ; 3+ a good mechanic , there is nothing to add ; 4+ good system of fighting and pumping : the game has like magic and ranged and melee and this is all reinforced by skills and topics ; 5+ Coop ( additional praise for optimized Coop ) ; 6+ interesting story ; 7+ good music ; 8+ the possibility of moderation = open workshop ( sorry that is not used except to transfer ) . 9+ \u0421raft ; 10+ if there was a story , you can play arcade mode which is kind of endless .\n\n\nNow what I noticed and should fix and bugs etc : 1 challenging arcade mode ; 2 spotted a bug ( Coop , ping 100 , perhaps due to ping ) after killing the boss before the zone Tai ming = TiMeng , the health bar of the boss there ( the HP bar ) , but after rejoining the server the bug was gone ; 3 I noticed the imbalance between the magic of ice and fire : fireball ( golden charge ) that deals ~ 1500 damage , magical damage of the player 300 , despite the fact that the same statistics ice spikes ( golden charge ) is applied to ~ 800 damage , ice spikes after silver charge does not increase in length , I think it is necessary to increase a length of the spikes for 1/2 or at least 1/3 of the silver charge , I beg you , and then you begin to change the basic magic . \n\n\nmore pritenzy not ,what will and will edit the post , perhaps 9.5/10 while the game is not topilina . And so would the 10/10 set , thank you for such a stunning-cool game with the genre RPG passing her story , threw other other games . I wish you the best of drafting this masterpiece , I hope you listened to my problems and try to correct mistakes . I'm important to follow the patch and hope to fix the above .

However this was not the case, this game is very obviously inspired by the likes of The legend of zelda and old school RPG's, which to me is great, I love those games! After playing for a few hours with one of my steam friends I really started to like this game and its unique ideas that it is bringing to the table. I would highly reccomend this game to other users. But don't forget this game is in early access and is definatley not like other games in this state,  a large portion of the game is uncompleted and leaves you at a cliff hanger, if you opt into the beta its not that bad but still a large part of the game is missing. So in short this game is great, but unless you are fine with opting into the beta which does contain bugs, you will not get a full game.", "timestamp_created": 1500719742, "timestamp_updated":

Like you are stuck with one outfit throughout the entire game. And wearing different armor doesnt even change your appearance, although this game is in beta. So that might change.

think Secrets Of Grindea would probably become one of the most played games on the planet!", "timestamp_created": 1498960947, "timestamp_updated": 1498960947, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0,

the beta was pushed out in 2013 according to their dev blog.  With that said, below is a review based on my time playing the game and my concerns regarding its future development.\n\n*Note: This review does not include the multiplayer or arcade aspects and this should be taken into consideration when reading this review.\n\n1.) Visuals: 3/5\n- Reminiscent of Super Nintendo games such as The Legend of Zelda, Star Dew Valley and Secret of Mana but nothing new or exciting to the visual experience.\n- Animations are very basic but do not add to the genre.\n\n2.) Mechanics: 3/5\n- Follows the same templates as older SNES adventure/RPG titles and adds a little bit of depth to the real-time combat with the talent trees and progression systems but doesn't do much to seperate itself from other finished titles.\n\n3.) Sound: 3/5\n- Music is well done and helps to serve the landscape equally as well.\n- Sound Effects are basic and satisfy the requirements.\n\n4.) Story: 1/5\n- It's basic at best and unfinished at worst.\n\n5.) Overall: 3/5\n- The game isn't good but isn't bad and doesn't add to the genre.  It feels more like a rebuild of older SNES games with features picked from each to replicate what Nintendo has done to it's fans for decades (ie: selling nostalgia.)  From the visuals to the sound, the game offers little to be excited about since the story is unfinished (ie: restrictions from proceeding forward to the end of the game's story.)  If you're seeking a game that takes you back to the early 90s then this may be the game for you but expect to only get a few hours out of it before you get bored and move on.\n\nConcerns:\n- The dev team seems to be all over the place with no real plan for completing the game.  I say this because the game is full of features... and that's pretty much it since no single element feels complete.\n- Development started in 2011, Beta released in 2013, Early Accessed in 2015, Release date Still TBD... I don't attribute this to laziness but instead is a byproduct of likely poor understanding of tools, workflows and project management overall.\n- The dev team wants to polish the game as they go.  This means that they will have an extremely slow release cycle of impactful content since they keep revisiting and re-polishing the game over and over and over again.", "timestamp_created": 1498779718, "timestamp_updated": 1502579917, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.352334", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32992261": {"recommendationid": "32992261", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104750879", "num_games_owned": 423, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 800, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499057708}, "language": "english", "review": "1.

This dev know how to please their community. the Grinds are very rewarding.\n\n4. The Puzzle Design, every aspect of frustation, desperation, walking, dying, retrying, crying is here. it's really really COOL.\n\n5.The Animation. as i remember this game is the first 2D RPG that eye charming IMO, they nailed the animation. NPC coughing, Standing up animation, sneezing, and many more. everything feels so smooth.\n\n6. Character Interaction and Development. you will feel attached to NPC in this game, especially the major Character.\n\n7. The Music and Sound, Atmospheric and will give you Goosebumps.\n\n8. ROGUE LIKE MODE aka Arcade Mode.\n\n9. SO MUCH PUNS! pun intended\n\nEDIT #1:\n\nEvery Chapter is a new Concept. so yeah, you will always find every map is unique.\n\nEDIT #2:\n\nSo i'm already on the end of Beta 0.7 Stories.\nAnd i would love to see the next Chapter of this journey.\nThey really gave me Goosebumps, not just because of the Music, but the Story too.

I tried to remain spoiler free, but you know...\n\nAlso note that the review regards Frontline, not stable. Also it regards Stoy mode, not Arcade - Don't like that arcade stuff that much. Never did. I will maybe update the review at some point to incorporate Arcade too. \n\nEarly Access disclaimer: When I buy an EA-Title, I buy what is there. Not nececarily what is to come. Also, as EA-Customer I view myself, and all other buyers, as Quality Management. We get something that is still not finished. Which means we have the possibility of giving input and also we work as quality control. It is to be expected that game crashing bugs arise. It is to be expected, that balancing will be off at some points. It has to be clear, that it is not a finished product. Which means I disregard issues of this kind, as something normal. Not something to bitch about, as long as the issues are dealt with.\n\nI used to work for a software company, so I do have a bit of insight on how the business works and more importantly, how long it can take to get stuff done. The devs here do have a nice level of communication with the community and most importantly: The SoG Devs are honest with what to expect from them. It's a team of 3 people and the level of care for each new implementation is big. I play Frontline, which means I expect crashes, broken Savestates etc. in exchange I get to play new content sooner. Still, I had yesterday my first crash with the game and never did I have a broken Savestate. I have seen \"finished\" games that did not perform as well as SoG. That level of care takes time. Which means. If you expect big updates on a regular basis, then you should not buy this game yet.\n\nWhen I've first seen this game, it instantly reminded me of a mashup of Legend of Zelda and Secret of Mana. Which is and was exactly what I am looking for, since SoM is one of my all time favourites. So, after a few hours of reading through forums and the devblog I decided to buy the game. And I don't regret it. The game I have right now has given me plenty of fun time, enough to say this: I wouldn't be mad if they leave the project. I still have a game that is fun to play as is. But I am excited about every new content in Story Mode. \n\n\n[b]- General -[/b]\n\nBad things first. As of this moment there is only one thing I really dislike about Secrets of Grindea: No local Co-op and no direct plans for implementing one. I really hoped it would have a SoM like local co-op implementation and still hope it will get one. This is a game for the couch with friends. Period. I've found a dev comment within the forums that this topic is not entirely off the table, but also it's not sure to come. So that is the one big minus from me for the following reason: \n\nWhen this game will be finished, I will probably have already played it through 10+ times (I have finished my 4th playthrough already.) since I replay the whole game with every new major update (i. e. when there's a new region to explore.) to systematically look for bugs. As said I view myself as QC.\n\nStarting the game for the first time, the game didn't feel like an alpha or early access in general. The parts done seem to be done. The graphics are nice and feel exactly right. With little use of placeholders. If placeholders are used, they too fit well enough to be regarded as satisfactory. Which gets me to the second \"bad thing\" - which I personally do not regard as bad, but others do, soooo... the time between major updates is rather long which makes the game progress rather slow. \n\nPersonally I think this is a good thing. If you watch the Devblog, you'll get information on what work they do right now and how they progress. It's in not on hiatus, but the devs take the time they need to finish the game as they want it to be. I'd hate a rushed process, just because of *bleep* retards that have nothing else to do as to bitch around. Those kind of people will be the first to bitch if the game is rushed and not polished enough. So yeah, I don't care how much time it takes, as long as I see that there's work done and progress made. \n\n\n[b]- Character -[/b]\n\nAs we start the game we have the possibility of character customization. Meaning that we can choose our name, sex, hairdo, hair color and the color of our clothing. In general, we have a solid, not too fancy character customization.\n\nYou can equip different types of armarment for Stat purposes. In addition you can also choose a weapon, shield, hat or facegear for decoration, which will be seen ingame, if you fancy the look of a different weapon instead of the one you're currently wielding. That's an elegant solution to the age old problem of \"Oh, this new weapon is badass! *equip* that's bloody ugly\". I cherish that.\n\nAlso you have 12 commandslots at hand, which you can fill with items, weapons or spells. Makes for comfortable controls. \n\nThe game contains 24 skills at the time. 7 passive skills are still not implemented. The skills you get to choose from are either Melee-, Magic- or Support-Types. Each skill has 10 Levels of it's own. You pay for a level with Skillpoints. Skillpoints come in two types. \nBlue ones, which pay for level 1 to 5.\nGolden ones, which pay for level 6 to 10. \n\nThe game also contains a Talenttree with 30 Talents in total. Talents can have level up to 3 or 5 with Talentpoints.\n\nObviously you get those points through leveling up.\n\n\n[b]- Gameplay -[/b]\n\nYour aim is to collect cards and do quests. While you do that you get around the World. Which has 7 differently themed areas for now. \n\nThere's a card for every Monstertype except Bosses. Cards give passive boosts and are somewhat rare drops. You get them through Mobgrinding. The enemies respawn continously within the area, which allows for easy grinding.\n\nYou can get different pets, which give you stat-boosts as you train (feed) them. You choose one which walks around you. You can also change their skins/color.\n\nAlso you can craft a lot of different items. Which is rather simple. Just navigate through the receipe list and if you have enough materials, you can craft the item, wherever you are, at whatever time. As long as you can get into the menu, you can do that.\n\nYou have also the option to buy a house and decorate it. Since this is from the latest update I can't tell that much about it. Haven't used this function enough. \n\n[b]- Graphics -[/b]\n\nIf you like Pixelart, you will like this game's look. The artdesign is nice and with high level of detail. It feels just right.\n\n\n[b]- Soundtrack -[/b]\n\nI mute most games in favour of my own music, soooo.... I don't remember it well.

When this game first came out, I was the same way. But now that the developers have worked on this game and polished it up more and more, I've begun to enjoy it more as well.\n\nSo, the plot of the story is pretty good! I actually felt compelled to \"end\" of the story (at the time of writing this the game is not yet entirely done) and see what lies ahead. The characters are actually very memorable! And the names, dont even get me started, are pretty funny if you can catch afew puns here and there in them.\n\nThe mechanics are pretty explanitory in the name of the game itself. There is a chance you'll have to do A LOT of grinding if you're new to this kind of game or just want to kinda play it as it was designed to be played. The grinding is actually not boring, since you are actually doing it not just for money, or EXP, but for the rare cards that give you permanant bonuses that will help you out in the long run.\n\nSince there are an abundance of items in this game, you can experiment with different setups. Whether it be 1 Handed, 2 Handed, or Magic, there is plenty for you to play for 15$. Though, at the moment, for me what seems to be the most powerful is Magic (Flamethrower and Cloud are OP in hard mode) and 1H (Shadow Clone is really good).\n\nNow let me just explain a few negatives of this game.\n\nThe game can be kind of short depending on how fast you play and what you decide to do along your journey. Even though I took 100 hours, that doesnt quite mean that the game is extremely long, it just means I took my time to go through this game (obviously). \n\nI would like to ask the developers to possibly add a warning regarding taking your character to frontline mode. I recently put my character into the frontline beta mode and now I cannot take my character out of frontline. Please add a better warning so other people dont have to spend 40+ hours trying to get a new character up to speed with their original.\n\nLast Id like to say that sometimes the artstyle sort of changes on the characters picture (the one that pops up when you engage in a convo with them) that can kind of feel slightly out of place. Im not saying it ruins the game drastically but perhaps the devs could look at it if they could and fix that XD\n\nThanks for making a good game on steam! Im so glad I invested 15$ for some good quality 18 bit awesomeness ^__^\n", "timestamp_created": 1498184039, "timestamp_updated": 1498184039, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.640503", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32654040": {"recommendationid": "32654040", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030490187", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3482, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497896252}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty neat game, a challenge and progression that feels rewarding", "timestamp_created": 1498169861, "timestamp_updated": 1498169861, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32645399": {"recommendationid": "32645399", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147981908", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 532, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514113036}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u86ee\u6709\u8da3\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u59d1\u4e14\u7b97\u4e2a\u534a\u6210\u54c1\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u5427\uff1f\u5f88\u591a\u90e8\u5206\u6ca1\u6709\u5236\u4f5c\u5b8c\u6210\uff0c10\u5c0f\u65f6\u4ee5\u5185\u5c31\u80fd\u6253\u901a\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4e3b\u7ebf\u5267\u60c5\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u5230\u4e0d\u7b97\u592a\u8d35\u597d\u50cf\u80fd\u63a5\u53d7\u3002\u4e0d\u662f\u592a\u6e38\u620f\u8352\u4e0d\u63a8\u8350\u4e70\u2026\u2026", "timestamp_created": 1498146666, "timestamp_updated": 1498146666, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32630315": {"recommendationid": "32630315", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006386314", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4960, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507142499}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun game and even more fun when you're playing coop with a friend.

IF your a fan of the 16bit era of 'action rpg' games, ones such as Legend of Zelda, Secret of Mana, Secret of Evermore, and Chrono Trigger THEN this game is certainly for you, you won't be disappointed.\n\nHere's my PROS for BETA 0.007b release..\n\nGraphics: The graphics in the game are very colorful, vibrant and unique to the game, it almost reminds me of Earthbound graphics for the Super Nintendo/Famicom. I would NOT change anything at all with them, it suits the game well. The icons, monsters, houses, shops, character design menu, magic spells, the menus, etc are all really great and fits in well with the game also.\n\nMusic/Sound Effects: These are great, all the music fits well in the areas that are in the game for you to visit, and the sound effects for spells are great also. The minor little things like walking past NPC's as they giggle at you or HO! HO! HO! as you get near them is a great addition. Dynamic sound effects such as getting closer to fountains the water gets louder etc is also implemented into the game, another nice addition.\n\nStory: The story seems to be straight forward, collect 'Ancient Artifacts' that can help bring someone back to life, in the mean time there's someone keeping track of you gatehring these items for their own ends.. probably to rule the world or destory it.. (not got that far into the game where that person's reasons are revealed). So it's a pretty basic story but don't let that stop you getting this game.. it's fantastic.\n\nAdditional: There is tons of stuff to do in this game.. Crafting, Monster Card Hunting, Trophy Collecting & Achievements, Fishing, taking part in festival mini-games, Arena Challenges (solo and in challenge friends mode', Arcade Mode.. a soon to be added Housing System.. AND there is MUCH more planned for future update releases. The devs seems to be listening to the players and what they want, THIS is a good thing.. trust me.\n\nHere are my CONS for BETA 0.007b release..\n\n1. For the moment there's NOT that many side-quests in the game, it could do with more.\n2. The areas have so much wasted space that they could do with adding more things into them, like more side-quests.\n3. The towns dont have much to do in them to be honest.. other than 'Evergrind City', they need to add more stuff in.\n4. The devs need to work on getting more updates out quicker, I know there's only 3 or 4 people working on this project but it's been going on now for a couple of years, and asking people for money to buy the game should give them the incentive to push updates out faster.\n\nConclusion: In any case, the game is fantastic as it is for the moment, it's certainly a game I will be recommending to people on my website and also to the 'Facebook Groups' i'm a member of that are old school rpg gaming based. I can't wait for the game to be fully finished so I am able to play it right through without having to stop at certain points and wait for the next lot of patches to come out.

The graphics remind me of Maplestory...for some reason.\n\nI do like the combat/skill system but the controls are a bit weird to me. \n\nAnd like this one guy said, the difficulty spikes up for no reason, like you would be doing fine and having little to no issues killing mobs, when suddenly, you get your ass handed to you countless times by a boss. Honestly, I'd recommend the devs to lower the difficulty or at least add something that makes the combat way less frustrating to do.. I mean, the boss battles are so god damn difficult that I rage quit for an hour or so and there's no indication of what you SHOULD do in the boss battles, they just expect you to know what to do.\n\nI do love the multiplayer idea, and it seems like it would be a good idea to go for it at level 10 since the game starts kicking your ass by then...That is if you have any friends that want this game because it's rather unknown.\n\nAnd like I said before, I'd love it if they added health/energy potions, it would make combat more bearable to do because EVERYTHING wants you dead and will make sure of it. This game is like the Dark Souls of Old-School RPGs.\n\nCharacter creation is pretty okay, would be nice to be able to change outfits and such.\n\nMagic is pretty damn useful from what I've seen so far, I hadn't tried Melee all that much, but if you're looking to be a mage, then you'll love it. Most of the spells do some pretty good damage and while there are no healing spells yet (which is weird.) you should be able to keep normal mobs off of you without a problem...usually.\n\nAnd yes, as the name suggests, you do have to grind EXP..very..very often. Maybe a bit too often. Reason why is again, the bosses can kick your ass in seconds. lol\n\nThis is kind of an \"Ehhhhhhh\" to me, but I still recommend it, I've never played a game that's pissed me off, and frustrated me so much until now. I'm all for difficulty but it feels very unfriendly to players.

Beautiful art-style; it's rare to see such a breathtaking view when playing games with this sort of art-style but it really works here. The music is also serene and arcade-y.

I do believe it sill has a long way to go, as it's not just missing a few items, but missing whole skill trees.

I do think it's a good game, but it needs to really pick up and hook the audience if it expects a complete playthrough. The combat in itself is not varied and interesting enough to be the main reason to play this game. Even the art-style, arguably the game's strongest point, is the kind of art-style that will illicit \"wow\"s and \"woo\"s and \"cool\"s and \"nice\"s, but it's not going to keep gamers coming back.

What I didn't know, without checking the guide, [spoiler]is that it will die automatically, after its last stage, so you basically just have to avoid its bullets for a little while, till it dies.[/spoiler] I'm not a fan of having to look at a guide online, just because the game doesn't indicate its mechanics clearly enough.\n\nA character could easily say something like \"It's imploding on itself, just stay out of its way, and we're almost there!\" or something. There was no indication of what I should do, and this, frankly, is what happens quite a bit in the game. You're supposed to just \"know\" something completely random in order to progress. \n\nAnother gripe I have is that the difficulty spikes a lot, in various different places. You'll be feeling pretty proud of yourself for beating a boss, or grinding up a dozen levels. You'll be killing everything without issue, feeling like a bad@$$, and then suddenly your face gets smashed in by a boss that seems to be dozens of levels too high for you. \n\nThis will happen a lot, which left me feeling like \"am I going to have a good time, or am I suddenly going to face a challenge that frustrates me for two hours?\" \n\nAlso on my list of annoyances are the puzzles. I spent two hours trying to solve a single puzzle last night. In the end, I caved and looked at a guide. The solution rather pissed me off, because it was the ONLY solution involving moving around 12 pieces. So, a puzzle that involves 12 pieces on a grid of let's say 40X80, to find the exact right way to place each piece, this wasn't fun. The room design for that puzzle also wasn't at all suggestive of a solution, which is something most good games with puzzles do, suggest a solution through the level design.\n\nYou'd think with all my complaining, I'd not recommend this game, and in fact you'd be wrong.\n\nRegardless of its downfalls, things that I personally don't like, it's a really good game.

That being said, I have enjoyed this game so much all throughout each one of my runs. \n\nThe story is phenomenal and I keep noticing new aspects of the story that I didn't before. All of the boss fights are great. Each boss fight has its own mechanic that makes each one unique and fun. There are also a ton of options for character customizations: hairstyles; hair, skin, scarf, shirt, pants, and shoe color.\n\nAs with most early access games, there are some bugs and glitches, but the developers are very active and will fix the bugs/glitches that are pointed out to them on the forums.\n\nThere is also multiplayer with up to 4 people total. In my experience with trying to use this, it did not work. I could not play local multiplayer with my friends, and when we tried doing online multiplayer using each of our accounts and hooking up via Steam, it did not recognize that I had any friends with the game. It would be nice if that got fixed.\n\nThere are people that complain about how grindy the game is, but honestly, there is no need to grind, but if you do grind, the art style is nice to look at while grinding. A lot of the monsters are really cool.\n\nOverall, the developers really care about this game and put a lot of effort into making this a quality game.

The puzzles are satisfying, and the ability to tame different pets has a unique mechanic. The bosses and their accompanying temples are fun and challenging, requiring you to utilize new skills you pick up along the way. There's a great story to follow, and I look forward to each installment as the areas are added.\n\nI don't regret purchasing this title in its Early Access phase because, although the content is slowly added, I am able to watch everything develop. Usually I only see the finished product, but it's a neat experience to see everything come together. I will say that the controls are a little awkward, but I've managed to come up with a workable system with a fourteen-button gamer mouse. That's my only complaint, and it doesn't detract from my gameplay enough to push me away.\n\nI was hesitant at first to purchase it when some of the reviews accused this game of being impossibly slow to update. There's always that fear with Early Access games that the developer will decide to abandon it in its unfinished state and leave you wanting more. However, the developers do post pretty regularly, and they have an outside blog that is very thorough about their progress and future plans. (I'm eager for the next update, which will apparently include player housing! Sounds exciting.)\n\nAll in all, I recommend this game for a lot of different reasons, although I wish I could get some of my friends to play it. I'm sure it would be a lot of fun to try in multiplayer. I think once it's finally finished and polished up I will have more luck.

Barely only faster then games like Starforge which quit development. If you buy this, don't expect a complete game for at least 20 years. Don't be surprised if they never properly finish either (rushed content). \n\n\nSTANDARD ISSUE JRPG STORY?\nI don't personally care for the story much, and the gameplay is extremely repetitive (go into field, whack the mobs, repeat). \n\n\nOTHER GAME MECHANICS?\nThey added all sorts of things to do like fishing and crafting but non of these extra things are well designed nor very fun.\nFishing is annoying to do, trying to keep a small area lined up on a moving line or you lose the fish, and it's very unforgiving if catching a big fish. Probably the most uninteresting way to add fishing, even more boring then how ARK does it *quick time events*\n\nCrafting is structured in a way so that you never get higher level tier materials. You will only ever find CURRENT story progress relevant level materials, ensuring you can only ever make gear that is almost identicle in stats to what can be purchased at the store, or found as loot. There is no way to get future gear that makes current dungeons easier. Great, but, SO WHY HAVE CRAFTING THEN? IT doesn't do anything else and feels so hopelessly tacked on. It isn't even interesting in HOW you craft. Just get the mats, hit a button, done. \nYou don't harvest resources either, the mats are just from killing monsters. Seriously this crafting system is here only so they can brag about having a crafting system to sucker people into buying this ho hum game. =3\n\n\nBOSSY!\nThe boss fights are intense, and the only hard part unless you don't take time to grind for a while (Note I played on hardest)- you need to be a master at not stepping into the fire, and gear\\stats is secondary in importance. Expect to die die die die die over and over again trying to learn some of these fights, especially WINTER boss. Hard mode will definitely not be for everyone here.\n\n\nThe music was fair.\nThe art is really high quality.\nControls are fluid.\nMy butt is acid.\nerm...\n\nWhat else am I forgetting?\n\nThe roguelike mode was a HUUUUUUUUUUUGE disappointment. It isn't some random dungeons like your favorite roguelike game with exploration, oh no, it's more like playing smash TV with each room being a small arena and a few mobs to kill so the door to the next room unlocks. It's the near same thing everytime, same mobs, same pretty much everything. The only fun thing about it, is unlocking new shops and stuff in town to help future playthroughs not be as boring (hopefully).\n\n\nThe Secrets of Grindea are not much of a secret, and this game is only some small bits of fun to me. But this isn't exactly my bag baby, what with secret of mana not being amazing to me either. That is the game this is most similar to from the past I'd say, and most people will adore this game as the very high steam rating can show you.\n\nI recommend it, only because I know everyone is less jaded then me on games like this! But seriously dev team, finish it sometimes this decade please!\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1491893607, "timestamp_updated": 1491893607, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.448718", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31063010": {"recommendationid": "31063010", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028641925", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1642, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491776373}, "language": "english", "review": "I played the whole game until the end of the \"current beta\" (Spoilers)\n\nWhile the game is rich there are a lot of things that really made this game a bad experience:\n\nCombat seems to offer a lot at first sight but after playing it has a lot of flaws. I did not suck at combat, i think i did pretty well, i also farmed nearly all cards, but during combat a always felt annoyed, they are a chore:\n- The deeper into the game the more unbearable the combat system becomes. At first everything is fine and plays decent, enemies have some advertised charge abilities and some require you to block or dodge.\n- Then suddenly the enemies start to kite like hell and abuse your 4 directional attack restrictions of your abilities by dodging diagonally all the time (Skycastle). Next you have the Snowball jugging guys in the snow-areas which throw nearly invisible projectiles at you.\n- The gift-box enemies just throw an infinite amount of bombs at you to create random area-denial which taunts you to respec your combat style to spells but this costs much gold\n- The season temple was ok, except for the hydra fight which shows what is the biggest problem for the remaining game: The game sets up a framework for combat, and then completely cripples this framework by denying you in all sorts of ways in order to create artificial difficulty.\n\n[b]Good games create the challenge around the tools it hands to you, not by giving you good tools and then break them.[/b]\n\nThe hydra either does Area denial in a much too small arena, makes you blind (what a shitty design choice) or removes your ability to move responsively (ice-floor, even when you have the spiky boots) in a battle that requires evasion of charges, so you are fully dependend on your dodge ability, which makes the fight pretty easy again, as if the developer wants you to do things a certain way, like Apple. The fight vs the Winter-dude sucks because it has so much randomness and badly advertised attacks. I decide therefore to just gimp him by blocking the storm that was supposed to lure me the the opposite site of his long vincibility frame with the mushroom shield. This creates a blind-patch that boosted my crit by 25. That and a dmg-potion and he can be killed after two of his \"i just wait 30s until you pass through my ice-maze that totally abuses the shitty movement to damage you\"-phases. Did i mention that diagonal movment isnt normalized? so you move Root of 2 faster when moving diagonally.\n\nThe game has its zenit in the Crystal-cave- zone where every enemy and NPC is just designed to piss you off until you just skip them.\nThere are Worms that create Area Denial patches everywhere that must be outwaited in order to take no dmg. Mushrooms create blinding fields if you vanquish them. Shell Monsters do a random charge-bounce thing that is so fast that it WILL hit you randomly... All this artificial crippling is shoved into your face one last time with the fight vs the Power-Flower in order to remind you why you hate this games combat.\n\nAfter that you are having the most annoying npc interaction of the game so far with a caveling that is scamming you obviously, but you have to follow through and at the end you are completely mocked, 2 minutes later the game ends.\n\n\nOther:\n- You cannot really try every skill without grinding loads of gold because there is a somewhat hefty fee required everytime you want to respec your points. There is no way of trying abilities without spending your sparse points into it, maybe save game manipulation, the descriptions are detailed though\n- The bag (your travaling companion) constantly patronizes you and is in general a scum-bag (pun anyone?). It comments on your inferiorness every time you die, which really feels discouraging because some battles are really badly implemented and always regards you as an incapable kid through the course of the game. I would throw this thing away immidiately if i was given the option.\n- While the Pixelart-Animation is wonderful and very fluid, the Background Artwork lacks some texturing at the snow and grass areas which make them feel like MS-Paint-Jobs. The Woods and Caves are gorgeous. The dialog-box-faces look strangely out of place and i wonder if they where made by a different artist", "timestamp_created": 1491842193, "timestamp_updated": 1492069861, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.415125", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31054189": {"recommendationid": "31054189", "author": {"steamid": "76561198331243267", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 14, "last_played": 1516015779}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5f88\u68d2\u7684\u4e00\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u4e00\u79cdgba\u585e\u5c14\u8fbe\u7684\u611f\u89c9\uff0c\u6218\u6597\u7cfb\u7edf\u624b\u611f\u5f88\u68d2\uff0c\u89e3\u5bc6\u7684\u8bdd\u4e0d\u662f\u592a\u96be\uff0c\u8010\u5fc3\u4e0d\u597d\u7684\u670b\u53cb\u614e\u73a9\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u7838\u952e\u76d8\u3002\u753b\u9762\u4e5f\u5f88\u7cbe\u81f4\uff0c\u7ec6\u8282\u5f88\u597d\uff0c\u5c31\u662f...\u5236\u4f5c\u7ec4\u662f\u4e0d\u662f\u592a\u61d2\u4e86\u554a\u5582\uff01\u8fd9\u90fd\u591a\u5c11\u5e74\u4e86\u5267\u60c5\u624d\u5b8c\u6210\u8fd9\u4e48\u70b9\u3002\u6709\u751f\u4e4b\u5e74\u901a\u5173\u7cfb\u5217\u3002\u6709\u4e2d\u6587\uff0c\u8fdb\u53bb\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7b80\u4e2d\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1491800059, "timestamp_updated": 1491800059, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31054176": {"recommendationid": "31054176", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022908150", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1840, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513997767}, "language": "english", "review": "I really love this game i know they are still working on releasing the new areas but after  catching back up arcade mode is fustrating yet very fun, this is a game that you can play solo but is funner with a group i say. \nyou will grind to get new gear and it  reminds me of the old zelda's. so i think it is worth a few play threws. and for pretty much 15$ it isnt that bad.", "timestamp_created": 1491799988, "timestamp_updated": 1491799988, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31015863": {"recommendationid": "31015863", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155589688", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 35, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502500470}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u8d85\u9762\u767d\u3044", "timestamp_created": 1491651890, "timestamp_updated": 1491651890, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479745", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31010266": {"recommendationid": "31010266", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023436355", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492315264}, "language": "english", "review": "Very nice game.

game. It was just perfect. Exactly what I was looking for and I had so much fun. Just perfectly blocking stuff to reflect it, dodging things by using Skills, trying to figure out some puzzles. It was so much fun.\nBut I didn't like the Tai Ming Part that much, because it's just boss fight, fight vs 1000 mobs where parrying is useless and you just have to run around, followed by another boss fight, followed by a fight vs 1000 mobs... and so on. It's just not that much fun in my opinion, and the outplay potential is pretty low there.\nBut after finishing all the available quests I started enjoying the game again. Because after that I started grinding till I got every single item, monster card and so on.\n\n\nSo long term short: I loved the beginning of the game, but I don't like how it's developing.

Don't let it fool you- there's only a few hours of story content here, and not even good story at that. You won't be getting much out of this game other than the pretty visuals, and there are plenty of much better pixel art games out there that you could buy.\n\nWhile playing through with my friend we encountered multiple glitches that made the game unplayable or forced us to close it in order to get out of a never-ending loop of glitches. The storyline is nowhere near finished and hasn't been updated in months (if it ever plans to be finished). Don't even get me started on the rougelike. (It's not fun in the slightest and just seems like a shoddy thrown together attempt to make the buyers stop complaining about lack of content)\n\nOverall the best description of this game is soulless. It felt like it was made for the purpose of enticing people to pay more money than what the minimal amount of content is worth, It looks appealing to the eyes, but has no replayability and runs out of content incredibly quickly. This game is not and will never be worth 15 dollars in it's unfinished state, and it says directly on their dev blog they never plan to put it on sale  until it is finished, and I feel like there's a better reason for that than the shoddy one that the dev blog claims. As evidenced by the amount of content that has been put out in the past two years, they seem to be putting out the minimal amount of content to give the buyers hope that this game isn't completely abandoned.\n\nDon't purchase this game.

After playing through the 4 hours of storyline avaiable before it cuts off abruptly, I decided to give arcade mode a shot since I love roguelikes and roguelites. It seemed unbalanced and bluntly just wasn't fun as far as roguelites go. I requested a refund, and probably wouldn't have if I had any hope that the developer would continue working on this, but honsetly this just feels like a scam getting people to pay $15 for a half finished game.

However, that didnt stop me from really enjoying it. \n\nIts still in beta, but the story still gave me about 10 hours of gameplay, and it also has an arcade mode which is based on the fighting parts of the story. As of writing this review, i have spent 2 hours in the arcade mode, and I doubt i will be stopping there.\n\nDont let the fact that it's still in beta stop you from at least thinking about this game, as its already really good. Parts of the world map aren't free for players to explore as of now, and im sure they will take very long to make as the game looks astoundingly beautiful, but what there is currently is great. The main quest is also still not finished, it just abruptly stopped, though there is still alot of it. As i said, the game gave me 10 hours of gameplay, which i find is a very suitable amount of time for a game.\n\nThe story consists of puzzles, bullet hell styled boss fights, combat, side quests and obiously the story itself. Some of the puzzles were actually quite hard, to the point where i had to look up gameplay videos find out the solution, while others were a decent head scratcher that wouldn't last too long, or too short. The boss fights all take a couple tries to beat, but never enrage you like other games (namely shovel knight). \n\nI recommend this game to everyone, though especially to people who like The legend of

It has been in early access for nearly two years at this point and only a handful of updates have been made. The game was also released off of steam before it ever was released here.

Communication with the devs amounts to a weekly dev blog basically. If they are making weekly progress then updates should be coming far more often and the game should be much further along.

PROS AND CONS!!\n\n>Pro: The game is customizable with weapons, character design (kind of), and you can play with up to four friends (I think), reminding me of the Four Swords, which I also had fun with. The bosses were (some what) difficult so it made you grind giving more game time, also upgrading skills like magic and attack moves (pretty fun to do, in my opinion), and arcade mode, my God is it annoying, but it makes you want to play repeatingly, it's addictive, also fun (it's a con and a pro at the same time). \n\n>Con: it's short game but what can you do about that, not enough magic abilities but four different ones with only three different moves (I kinda wanted more magic moves), and I also have ass friends to play with (but that's just me).\n\nAlthough it's in early development, I enjoy the game so far. I doesn't have as much as a full plot line of a single story but it feels more of a- you're a person who has an adventure and does some quests along the way, no evil wizard distroying the world or anything, just full on adventure, Overall, I give the game a 7/10, can't wait for something new but for now- Imma suffer :3", "timestamp_created": 1487044289, "timestamp_updated": 1487044289, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29901009": {"recommendationid": "29901009", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095503414", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 910, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500998422}, "language": "english", "review": "really good", "timestamp_created": 1486996452, "timestamp_updated": 1486996452, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29887882": {"recommendationid": "29887882", "author": {"steamid": "76561198188519114", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2032, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513294152}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "melhor jogo", "timestamp_created": 1486950400, "timestamp_updated": 1486950400, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29886940": {"recommendationid": "29886940", "author": {"steamid": "76561198364940426", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496552837}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u539f\u6765\u73a9\u7684\u4e0d\u662fsteam\u7248\u7684\uff0c\u6211\u6700\u65e9\u4e0a\u5927\u5b66\u73a9\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u5c31\u53ea\u80fd\u6253\u5230\u795e\u5e99\uff0c\u57ce\u897f\u57ce\u4e1c\u90fd\u6ca1\u6709\u5f00\u653e\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c31\u4e0d\u73a9\u4e86\uff0c\u6709\u65f6\u5019\u6253\u6253\u8857\u673a\uff0c\u81ea\u5df1\u4e5f\u6ca1\u610f\u601d\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u5728\u8d34\u5427\u4e00\u76f4\u5173\u6ce8\u7740\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\uff0c4.5\u5e74\u8fc7\u53bb\u4e86\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u4e5f\u66f4\u65b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u5267\u60c5\u548c\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u90fd\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e86\uff0c\u5728steam\u4e70\u7684\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u4e00\u76f4\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0b\u53bb\uff0c\u4e5f\u4f1a\u65f6\u4e0d\u65f6\u518d\u7ee7\u7eed\u73a9\u4e0b\u53bb\u3002\n\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u753b\u98ce\u5f88\u559c\u6b22\uff0c\u5267\u60c5\u6709\u4e9b\u5730\u65b9\u4e5f\u5f88\u641e\u7b11\uff0c\u597d\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\u5c31\u662f\u505a\u7684\u6162\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u6e38\u620f\u591a\u505a\u4e00\u4e9b\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u70ed\u60c5\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1486948111, "timestamp_updated": 1486948111, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.604834", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29865536": {"recommendationid": "29865536", "author": {"steamid": "76561198276402095", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1510, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509676159}, "language": "english", "review": "Really, genuinely, the most fun I've had in a game for a long time.

Dificultad\n\nLa dificultad en modo Arcade llega a ser muy elevada, a tal punto que las partidas pueden durar hasta 4 horas en lo que vas del piso 1 al 12, todo ocurre debido al poco margen de error que existe, oblig\u00e1ndote a ser extremadamente cuidadoso, si te equivocas por un segundo veras notablemente las consecuencias.\n\nAunque los jefes y monstros cuentan con patrones pre-definidos, esto no facilita la experiencia en este modo de juego, pero si te obliga al 100% a memorizar todos estos patrones para poder completar este modo, por lo tanto considero que este juego deber\u00eda tener la etiqueta de Dif\u00edcil, ya que el modo Arcade se ve extremadamente por el margen de error tan peque\u00f1o que existe entre un ataque y otro.\n\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 tanto afecta esto la experiencia en el Modo Arcade?\n\nMucho, garantizo que morir\u00e1s al menos unas 50 veces antes de que logres llegar al piso 6. Y al ser este modo tan similar a The Binding of Isaac, l\u00f3gicamente con cada muerte perder\u00e1s tu progreso, pero iras sumando puntos que van desbloqueando beneficios al inicio de la partida. Esto no garantiza ni facilita el juego en el modo Arcade, y es la frustraci\u00f3n principalmente lo que hace de este modo de juego el menos entretenido y menos recomendado.\n\nEn el caso del modo historia, este no se ve afectado por el margen de error ya que al final no perder\u00e1s tu progreso con tu muerte y todo sigue siendo prueba y error. Aunque algunos jefes se te har\u00e1n imposibles en la dificultad dif\u00edcil, realmente sufrir\u00e1s te lo garantizo.\n\nFuera de esto no he encontrado otro punto negativo, pero es sumamente importante nuevamente recalcar que es muy frustrante el modo Arcade y si eres una persona temperamental independientemente no recomiendo este t\u00edtulo, ya que con m\u00e1s de 4000 horas que tengo en los mobas y despu\u00e9s de a ver experimentado un nivel por encima de la tercera dimensi\u00f3n de la frustraci\u00f3n. Con este juego por fin he podido experimentar eso que llaman la cuarta dimensi\u00f3n, es un nivel de frustraci\u00f3n tan grande que ya he cambiado varias veces de teclado.\n \n!!!!!S\u00ed buscas un titulo RPG con un toque de Rogue-Like, con un excelente Apartado en 2D dando honores a los Pixel Graphics y una dificultad que te obligara a aprenderte hasta el mas m\u00ednimo de los patrones de cada boss y enemigo para evitar ser brutalmente asesinado y terminar tirando tu teclado por la ventana, este es tu juego.!!!!!\n\nRecomendado! Por amor a diosss corrijan el modo Arcade ya he muerto lo suficiente, creo que estoy ciego.\n", "timestamp_created": 1486484134, "timestamp_updated": 1486484134, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.608414", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29756063": {"recommendationid": "29756063", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148689478", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1665, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497850174}, "language": "danish", "review": "Det et et godt spil til dig og vennerne.", "timestamp_created": 1486448928, "timestamp_updated": 1486448928, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29753864": {"recommendationid": "29753864", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155398406", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 979, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494186816}, "language": "english", "review": "Even though this game isn't fully completed I still loved playing through it!

Der Fokus bei dem Spiel liegt ganz klar auf die sch\u00f6ne deatliert gestaltete Welt. F\u00fcr mich ist Secrets of Grindea das beste Beispiel daf\u00fcr, dass ein Spiel auch ohne ultra realistische Grafik extrem sch\u00f6n aussehen kann. \n\nDas Kampfsystem ist eben nicht das Actionreichste, aber dennoch hat man viel Individualit\u00e4t beim skillen und somit kommt auch ein wenig mehr Abwechlsung beim k\u00e4mpfen rein. Man kann seine skills jederzeit f\u00fcr ingame Gold \"refunden\" und neu verteilen, was jedoch ein wenig zu teuer ist.\n\nDie Story ist eine Mischung aus witzig und ernst. Wir sind der Sohn von einem Vater der ein \"Collector\" ist. Wir m\u00fcssen am Anfang des Spiels eine Pr\u00fcfung zum \"Collector\" ablegen um in die Fu\u00dfstapfen unseres Vaters zu treten und wertvolle Artefakte und Geheimnisse der Welt zu erkunden. Die Story ist keine gro\u00dfe Besonderheit und eher mittelm\u00e4\u00dfig. Aber dennoch gibt es die ein oder anderen witzigen Dialoge, jedoch kommt Spannung bisher eher wenig auf. \n\nDie gr\u00f6\u00dfte Besonderheit von Secrets of Grindea im Abenteuer Modus ist die RPG Welt ansich. Es gibt viele Secrets zu erkunden und viele Items die man sammeln kann. Neben vielen Style Items, gibt es auch Karten von Gegner die dir einen permanenten Bonus auf diverse stats geben. Es gibt einige Waffe und Ausr\u00fcstung die man finden oder kaufen kann, welche speziell f\u00fcr Magie oder Physich gedachte sind. Neben dem Finden von Ausr\u00fcstung kann man sich auch Ausr\u00fcstung craften. \u00dcberall kann man Materialien finde, welche entweder f\u00fcrs craften sind oder f\u00fcr bestimmte Quests.\nEiner meiner gro\u00dfen Highlight im Spiel waren bisher die Tempel. Die Tempel sind sehr innovativ und bis auf das kleinste Detail sehr sch\u00f6n gestaltet. Neben R\u00e4tsel gibt es dort auch Bosse die allesamt mit einer bestimmten Taktik besiegt werden m\u00fcssen. Die Tempel sind leider etwas zu klein, aber daf\u00fcr extrem gut gemacht.\n\nAnonsten gibt es noch einen Arcade Modus, wo man sich durch mehrere Ebenen k\u00e4mpfen. MAn startet quasi mit null Ausr\u00fcstung und findet von Ebene zu Ebene immer mehr und bessere. Es gibt auch einen vorteilhaften Start, den man sich erspielen kann. Der Modus ist besonders gut f\u00fcr Spieler die einen guten Highscroe hinlegen wollen, oder einfach eine Herausforderung suchen.  \n\nDas Spiel ist wahrscheinlich noch lange nicht fertig, jedoch ist es bisher wirklich ein sehr gutes Indie Adventure RPG. Wer Lust auf ein sch\u00f6nes Adventure hat, der sollte sich das Spiel nicht entgehen lassen.", "timestamp_created": 1486267214, "timestamp_updated": 1486267214, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0,

The story line (so far) has kept me interested, and the side quests aren't just dull fodder. \n\nIt took me a a short while to get used to navigating the large menu, and I wish I could banish my pet to the farm (not the metaphor) instead of just \"hiding\" it. \n\nSometimes the graphics makes it hard to distinguish what is background art and what is moveable or collectable items, especially when first starting, but it doesn't take long to become used to it.\n\nAltogether I think it's a fantastic game, although I am very biased towards that particular RPG style its a real throw-back to old school gameboy games. I will definitely be getting the fully completed version and I'm glad that the developers are taking their time to make the most out of this game.

I just hope to see great variety of skills so everyone can make their own unique fighter . Don't get me wrong the skills system already is great but between short sword or two handed and magic not much other styles to choose from. Like every game i see I always look for daggers and dual wielding aspect of the game.  I'm the type of person who like to see great weapon variations along with skills with each specific weapon skills and animation. Would like to see things as a heavy weapons such as axe and claymore along with spears with each its own animation style and short handed weapons like claws daggers swords. The magic is great as is each with a skill for each element I would say be nice to have dark and light but light i can figure would be a problem since light usually represent heals and that alot would make people over powered and take the fun out the game. I enjoy the stat system that focuses on your style of gameplay such as i sacrificed most of my heavy def gear for gears that give me speed boost and decent crit rate. These are all just my opinion and I'm pretty sure its been crazy suggestions. I wanted to add my own input that would have you enjoy different styles of gameplay and still maintain a challenge to its styles. The dungeons is just like old school dungeon runners with real hardcore puzzle and the noble tempting chest that seem impossible to obtain but with enough work and shift in other puzzle u can maintain it with a great reward. The enemies are very challenging which I love lmao no one like a game way to easy thats unfulfilling nor does people enjoy games that are psychotically hard but this is right between I hope to face more challenging enemies in the near future.

Have been waiting for quite some time now, and I'm sure lots of fans are. \n\nOverall, its a great game, but until it's finished, you won't know how great of a game it will become.",

and grinding for tons of collectibles is fun! the battle is tight, with a few minor things and the graphics, the design, heck, even the missions that have depth to it, all of these components are really awesome and this game,. even in early access, is starting to already shape up as one of the better rpg games that ive played this year.\n\nTL;DR: This game is AWESOME! you like nostalgic zelda-like exploration games, but with more customization, collecting and crafting, really fun skill progression, abilities that vary greatly, and enemies that are designed smartly and with a challenge???  Then buy this game!\n\nGraphics: alright, its a top down 32 bit looking game. and man, do they do a wonderful job at making sure every pixel counts, and every animation is fluid! The graphics are nostalgic, and they are done well\n\nSound: Man, the music is really suited for an adventure game. i really was not diaaposinted by the music at all, very well done. the sound effects were plenty, and they had depth and actual weight and distinction to each move you make. Of course, its nothing too fancy, but its not done poorly, they made every sword swing, every fireball, and every crate breaking sound good\n\nGameplay: Man, I am very impressed with the combat. its quick, its fluid, the enemies variety are very challenging and require to think about how to approach each one, ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY START WORKING TOGETHER AND F*** YOU UP!! oh man, there were some parts where i was sincerely triggered cause i couldn't get past some enemies when i really wanted to blow through a part of the stage to complete my mission. I played this on the hard difficulty, so im sure that why they were much more difficult to kill. Anyways, what everyone will definitley enjoy about how the combat is done is by the way you character is...\n\nCustomization: Yes, this game is very customization friendly! You want to go nothing but tank? well choose the corresponding stats to boost you defense significantly, dump your points into two handing that tree bracnh you get when you first start out, and sponge away the many slimes presented, all the way until youre three hours deep into the pumpkin forest, trying to hack away at ghosts that keep friggin disappearing in front of your face, and even though you know thats not the way to kill them, youre already soo hellbent on getting the last hack on his ectoplasmic butt, because your a tank, with the brain of the sponge, and YOU DONT KNOW ANYTHING ELSE!!!..... But, if you do have a moment of awreness, you could totally respec you're guy on the fly! you can totally dump those pointe that went into tanking into something like a snow buddy. A cute little snowball dude who's totally loyal to the cause. And hey, why stop theree? You can throw your invstment into four different magic categories, earth, fire, ice,. and wind! And best belieive that your armor, and your clothes are customizable too! I REALLY appreciate the developers for going this route, AWESOME!\n\nLook, im gonna stop here and give you fair warning. As of this review, there are somethings that are still locked in the skill tree, because they are still indevelopment. Which leads me to one of the biggest troubles of this game. THERE IS LITERALLY NO HEALING. the only way to heal, is to pick up healt orbs from enemies (which drop pretty frequently), go back to town, or lvl up. Nopne of this was really an issue......until you start fighting bosses. OHHHHHHH man, this is the biggest flaw of this game.\n\nHOW THE HELL DO I BEAT THE DAMN BOSSES THAT ARE OP, WITH NOT A SINGLE HEALING POTION OR SKILL!!!!\n\nThis, my dear developer, is THE MOST infuriating thing in the game, I pray to the flying spaghetti monster that you include something, cause this has got me beyond vexed. And the only other thing i gotta complain is the way blckin is handled, it seems real unforgiving, and even a bit unresposive at times.

I think the game will get even better in time but its just... exactly what you should expect from an early access game. once that little message popped up saying \"the rest of the story is still being developed\" i was like..... \"oh, so soon?\" but it was a good ride and i cant wait for it to be updated more.", "timestamp_created": 1482372789, "timestamp_updated": 1482372789, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28513515": {"recommendationid": "28513515", "author": {"steamid": "76561198211699460", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1403, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513670148}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't usually like these types of game with the shitty graphics, birds eye view, and puzzles everywhere. \n\nTHIS GAME THOUGH IS FUCKIN AMAZING WORTH A BUY 100% DEVS PLEASE FINISH\n\nAbout 3-4 hours gameplay for story mode, a lot of replayability in the arcade mode.", "timestamp_created": 1482346107, "timestamp_updated": 1482346107, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28505957": {"recommendationid": "28505957", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084617081", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482311185}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a good game, but I honestly feel that it's extremely overhyped for what it offers--which isn't much.  \n\nI wouldn't really play the game for its story, as it seems pretty basic and I didn't find there to be much character depth.  It does try and it does give you some background to the characters and features a nice \"cinematic\" of the player's mom (which is actually really awesome because they made it so that her hair+skin color is the same as whatever you chose for yourself).  But that's more of a game feature than something specifically story related--the story itself, like I said is pretty stereotypical.  Some people might like it, but after playing so many games, it just feels repetitive--if this was an mmo, you wouldn't even bother reading it.\n\nThe combat has some nice elements (though I do remember being a bit frustrated with a few things--sorry, it's been over a year since I played this, so I can't remember the details very much) and the art is cute enough that I would like to continue playing it, but since the game is unfinished at the moment, my only options are to play Arcade Mode or to grind for cards.  I don't really want to grind for cards when their website's forum FAQ states there may be a potential wipe when the game is finished.  Maybe this has changed, but even so it feels odd to grind for something you may never use.\n\nThe problem isn't that the game is unfinished--we knew that going into EA, but what we didn't know until after we had completed all there is to do was that it's been in development since 2011 and is still only about 30% to completion.  The description on Steam with the link to the devblog in bold paints the picture that development is constant and EA will soon be over, but this doesn't seem to hold true.  \n\nMany of the areas in the game that you try to go to will give you a little notification that it's not yet implemented.  (Also on this, if you try to go to another map and you're cooping, you will be denied access unless all party members are at standing on top of you--just a heads up for those who might be bothered by this.)  As is, I think there are about 10 or so hours of content in storymode.  \n \nOn top of this, if you notice the Discussion Page on Steam features a locked sticky entitled, \"Haven't played in over a year...\" where in the last post, the developer states, \"New threads will be locked, and if the same user keeps creating new ones we're going to assume they're just rabble rousing and we'll use the dusty ol' ban hammer that's mostly sitting in the corner.\"  \n\n\n\nWhich boils down to: You are not allowed to mention the slow development.  Ever.  \n\n\n\n\nI don't know... I just don't think that kind of censorship is exactly right.\n\nAdditionally, the website's FAQ states that they are not looking for additional people to help with the project and all positions are filled, so while they say things are slow because they only have three people to work on the game, they're not actively trying to remedy that, despite people offering to help.  \n\nI checked out the latest post on the devblog again, and one of the things that was written, \"Definitely looking forward to another year of fun gamedev, and I hope you\u2019ll all stay with us through our journey!\" doesn't sound too hopeful that the game will be finished next year, either.  \n\nAgain, though, I'm not trying to say the game itself is bad; it's just that... there's not much there.  I'm really sad to leave this with a negative review, but I just cannot comprehend how these issues seem to be so overwhelmingly glossed over.  \n\nWe bought this game over a year ago and keep checking back only to feel really discouraged; fifteen dollars is a lot for someone to spend on something that doesn't seem to have a lot of hope at the moment and I just don't want anyone to be put in a situation where they end up disappointed.\n\nIf the game is ever completed, I would probably change my recommendation, but at the moment, I don't think I can recommend it, sorry.", "timestamp_created": 1482321602, "timestamp_updated": 1482321663, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 87, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.559286", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28491684": {"recommendationid": "28491684", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064329283", "num_games_owned": 313, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 603, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508774365}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "O game ainda est\u00e1 em desenvolvimento mas vou fazer algumas considera\u00e7\u00f5es.\n\n[h1] A Hist\u00f3ria.

Must-support and must-buy for fans of classic action-RPG and crafting.  Even in Early Access, it's impressive.\n\nLet's get the bad out of the way - this game is Early access, and as of mid 2017 I don't expect it to be finished at least until year's end.  That being said, if you love top-down action RPGs with crafting, you probably should be supporting this anyway, but if you want, read my review.\n\nSecrets of Grindea manages a difficult job.  It is a love letter to classic top-down button-mashing action RPGs Nintendo was famous for, but also packs in the \"best\" features of many games.  It is an homage to all those games, without limiting itself.  Finally it's a parody that's not mocking, but affectionate - and the parody elements even work into the plot.\n\nThe best comparisons I've found are Dungeonmans and Starbound, games that took their time, knew their subject, evolved, and turned into something amazing.\n\nIn the game, you are a young Collector in the world of Grindea, your aim is to collect artifacts and equipment.  The game offers:\n* Highly customizable skills.  You can focus on two kinds of weapons, four kinds of magic, and support skills.  You can also tweak \"talents\" that affect how abilities and skills function together.  Each of these abilities can also be leveled up, improving and changing how they work.  Build a combat maniac who mashes stuff with a hammer, a summoner surrounded by friends, a dashing and dodging ninja.  It's up to you.\n* Simple but effective crafting with depth.  Find enough stuff, make stuff is how it goes, but you'll need to explore and experiment to discover what unknown ingredients are needed.  Fortunately things you encounter that can be used are specially tagged.\n* Choose your equipment. Weapons, hats, armor, accessories, and more all affect how your character functions. Power up your magic with a sorcerous chapeau, find boots that speed up your movement while you charge skills, or stick a pumpkin on your head. You can also choose items to be \"cosmetic,\" changing appearance while you benefit from an equipped item.\n* Plenty of quests and sidequests and extras.  There's always something to do in Grindea, with plenty of rewards.  Don't forget to return to people you've talked to before.\n* The fun of the grind.  If you want to max out your equipment, you're going to mash monsters. Grindea, however, makes it fun, with ways to increase spawns, meet tougher monsters, or refight bosses.  You can even tweak skills and equipment for maximum, fast grind. Farming is actually fun!\n* Lots to do.  Go fishing. Raise a pet. Find minigames.  Look for hidden treasure. Up your hat collection with Mister Fabulous. Grindea offers you many things to do depending on goals and mood.\n* Your own expandable house.  Have fun building your own domicile as a break from adenturing.\n* A great visual style. The world's classic-cartoony not-quite-anime look is charming and appealing, the monsters have personality, the settings are colorful.\n* A great soundtrack. There's a classic game soundtrack here that sets the mood and is excellently composed.\n* Story and humor.  There's plenty of humor and an actual story (with some great twists) that's not all laughs. The game comes to life as well as making you laugh - then punches you in the gut with pathos.\n* Two game modes.  You've got your usual adventure, but also the roguelike random adventure mode that lets you gradually build a character legacy and a town!  It's literally two games in one.\n* Optional co-op. On top of everything else, play with friends.\n\nSound like a lot?  The game's staff also consists of three people as of this writing. It's pretty amazing what they've done since 2011.\n\nJust a reminder as of this writing it's early access.  The game is very fun, there's lots to do, but it's not done.\n\nNow who should get this if you're willing to go Early Access?\n* If you love old-school AARPGs you probably should just pick it up now to enjoy it and give feedback.\n* If you love looting and crafting and hunting up rare things and playing minigames, get it.\n* If the above review interested you.  This game hits a special sweet spot, it just \"fits\" some people.\n\nI picked it up and figured I'd check it out due to curiosity.

Plenty of challenges both in  Story and Arcade Mode. Skills and character movement are responsive, and there are subtle cancellations that make the combat somewhat customizable. The skill choices aren't limited in any way other than being less effective if you use certain weapons. The skills require a \"charge\" and unlock more powerful versions once you've leveled up the skills enough.\n\nStory-wise it has some solid moments. A cinematic-driven story with a lot of humor/comic relief. There are some potential plot twists starting to evolve and that may give the story a bit of a turn and spice things up a bit. Overall while i'm not a fan of story/cinema in games, it was enjoyable and not too dramatic or overdone like what a lot of titles do.\n\nCreativity-wise, there is a recipe-driven crafting system. You essentially grind some items and are able to put the items together and figure out what the \"unknown item\" is. The character's house is being implemented and there is potential that players will be able to add particular items to that house, and perhaps in a certain order. Other than that players also have some room on choosing their combat style. A player may be a meteor summoning \"shieldmaiden\" that uses a magical spear instead of the typical sword/staff.\n\nOther than that there's still a lot of the game being developed.

The 4th Wall is something it likes to smash down quite often as you'll come across many Easter Eggs and reference, one being the Triforce laying on the ground or a character mentioning \"/\" commands. Secrets of Grindea knows it's a video game and uses that to it's pleasure since it allows it to make tons of jokes. Heck you start out from a town called \"Startington\". \n\nThe characters are also quite pleasing to meet. Your father has a backstory and a driving motive that I find interesting to explore, as you plung further into the game his past is opened up to a point where you realize you aren't the only character of importance running around Grindea. The games controls seemed odd to me at first but I later came to admire how well they work. The arrow keys act as your movement while Z & X are your sword and shield. You have items and skills linked to the A,S,D,F,G,Q,W,E,R,T keys which can each be rebinded.

Recommended but see this as an investment, not a direct consumption item.\n\nFor a game that has been an on going project for this many years there are certain expacations to be made. However seeing it being an early access game made by a very small team some criticisim can be made and some can't. But that's the point of reviewing. You give critique so the creator can be better. The beauty for us gamers is that developers are like wine or whiskey. They are either good and becomes better, they are good but falls hard due to arrogance and godlike complex or they never were good to begin with. The devs of SoG are hopefully the first type.\n\nNow enough of that and unto the game.\n\nThe graphics are smooth and fantastic, for being 2D Spirites. That is however nothing bad as they simply tap into a bit of retro or nostalgia, depending on your age. For reference it's nostalgia for me. As I started this game it felt like playing a new Zelda game. A World to explore and you as the hero. The graphics help this mindset as you travel across the land and my god is the scenery gorgeues. Even with the limited graphics of 2D spirites they make everything flow smoothly and with an almost seamless action. The particles created by the various spells and skills as well as the various stages of boss fights make this game very good. During the harder difficult I died once due to the fact that I stopped and had to process I went from a Zelda-esque game to a Touhou level bullet hell. It was beautiful\n\nThe sound and music of the game aids the nostalgic/retro feeling and the sound effects made when you cast a spell or use a skill is quite satisfying. There is no lack of audio feedback on what's going on in this game. You will know when the enemy is about to charge you or a boss is starting a massive barrage of onslought. The feedback you get as a player in this game becomes even more valuable as you play on the harder difficulty when the bosses can go from \"oh look a large quantity of bullets\" to \"This went from casual to hardcore bullet hell real fast....\"\n\nAs for the gameplay and it's mechanics I'm happy to say that it all feels fantastic. The controls respond as expected and the game runs smoothly. It lacks any need to have a beast of a machine. This is a game I have played during lunch hours on my work and those machines could be from last decade. The mechanics are well thought and well implemented into this game. It's easy to plan ahead on how you want to combat an enemy or a boss as the various types of attacks have easy and memroable patterns to learn. The fact that you also can easily switch mid-game on how you want to play makes it a nice setup for various combinations of attacks. It does however cost some money but it's worth it if you want to experiment.\n\nThe game truly makes a good claim on old grinding games. It will become a massive grindfeast if you want to. I spent a good 10+ hours farming for various cards in the game, they are used to get passive boosts. The various mechanics in how you grind with combat can go from boring to a meditative set of moves. If you enjoy grinding that is.\n\nOverall the game works so good I really WANT the developers to finish the game but as I mentioned earlier in my TL;DR. This is to be the equivelent of a stock market investment. It may or may not yield profit in the end. Only time will tell. So far however, I've earned back my money spent in hours so for me this game was quite a good \"bang for the buck\" deal.", "timestamp_created": 1478647979, "timestamp_updated": 1478647979, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502678", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26496619": {"recommendationid": "26496619", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065401285", "num_games_owned": 270, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1059, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487513648}, "language": "english", "review": "A game full of challenges and humour, I was expecting a decent game, but it's actually a more-than-awesome game !

After playing the game, I can understand why. Secrets of Grindea is really, really good. Every single area in the game is polished to a diamond sheen. It's just a huge shame it isn't \"finished\".\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n+Great Animations and Soundtrack: I really am a fan of the animations here. While the character portraits are, in my opinion, a little offputting, the animations of the characters and enemies are top-quality and show action surprisingly well. The soundtrack is very well-made and fits the areas of the game well.\n+Fun Combat/Character Building: There's a lot of flexibility to the leveling system, and you don't have to fall into the Warrior/Mage/Rogue trope like many other games. The combat is fluid, and surprisingly challenging sometimes, even on normal mode.\n+Surprisingly funny satire: The narrative of Secrts of Grindea plays out like a satire of genres ranging from classic Legend of Zelda-likes to MMORPGs and Roguelikes. Unlike a lot of satire, however, it does this really well. Stick with the story, and don't pass it off as another edgy attempt at satire.\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\n-Updates all over the place: From what I can see, development time is slow. You can access the beta, and the content in the beta is just as well-made as the rest of the game minus a few sound effects here and there. This, however, is not a lot of extra content, and the current beta maybe adds an hour-and-a-half to total gameplay time. I find it hard to be too critical of this considering the polish of the game, however.\n-Sometimes a bit too challenging: Some areas of the game can get hard. Like, really hard. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, but due to some boss and enemy patterns, it can come down to rng more often than not. Skill will get you past it, but sometimes it can et annoying.\n\nOverall I would suggest waiting for the game to fully release, but if you're like me and don't care too much about early-access, I would recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1478455255, "timestamp_updated": 1478455255, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26459307": {"recommendationid": "26459307", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005525284", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1078, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478448185}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0430 \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0430: \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0438\u044f, \u043d\u0435 \u0442\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442, \u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0435 \u044e\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0430, \u043f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0430..\n\u041d\u041e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0430, \u0437\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043b \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u0434\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0443\u043b\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0439\u043e\u0442\u0443.\n\n\u0412 \u0438\u0442\u043e\u0433\u0435 \u0432\u044b \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0435\u0439\u0447\u0430\u0441 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044e \u043d\u0430 5-6 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432 \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c \u043f\u043b\u0435\u044f \u0441\u043e\u043b\u043e \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0441 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0437\u044c\u044f\u043c\u0438( \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043b\u043e\u0445\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0434 \u043a\u043e\u043b-\u0432\u043e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0432), \u043f\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0432\u0441\u044f\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0438 - \u0448\u043c\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0438 \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0433\u043e\u043d\u044f\u0442\u044c \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0430\u0440\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0443..\n\n\u0420\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0447\u0438\u043a\u0443 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u043e\u0439 \u0434\u0438\u0437\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0435\u043a\u0442 \u0437\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043a\u0442.", "timestamp_created": 1478448438, "timestamp_updated": 1478448438, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.470758", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26459273": {"recommendationid": "26459273", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029294992", "num_games_owned": 333, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 397, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497540102}, "language": "english", "review": "I absolutely love this game, which makes the update waits all the more painful.", "timestamp_created": 1478448345, "timestamp_updated": 1478448367, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26443629": {"recommendationid": "26443629", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055647045", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2773, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 14, "last_played": 1515886215}, "language": "english", "review": "Great Game", "timestamp_created": 1478380349, "timestamp_updated": 1478380349, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26438480": {"recommendationid": "26438480", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116870001", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488798702}, "language": "english", "review": "I really enjoy this game.

The developers are transparent with their project and unfortunately this isn't their full time job. If you're not the type who is:\n\nA) Interested in game design from a developer's point of view via blogs\nB) Interested in providing imput and feedback on a game in development\nC) Patient enough to wait as long as it may take for updates or full release\n\nThen Secrets of Grindea may not be for you, probably best to wait for the full release because you may be disappointed. Don't get me wrong, what's been already released is great. But you'll be left wanting more, like getting a three course meal and extra long for the entree. \n\nDevelopment issues aside, Secrets of Grindea is a combination of several action adventure titles, made into a unique experience. There's a lot of heavy influence from Secret of the Mana, but there's some Legend of Zelda, and Monster Hunter thrown in too, but in a way that meshes well to create something fun and engaging within itself.  \n\nOne of the best aspects is not having a class restriction. There's three skill trees: One Handed, Two-Handed, and Magic. You can focus on one, two, or a combination of three to create your own character, fully customed to your playstyle. Throw in the three passive trees: General, Melee, and Magic and you have ways to relly make skill combinations shine. So far the favorite build I've made is a Berserker that gets a magic attack bonus from less than 50% MP that randomly deals burn damage on attack and gets a physical attack bonus on burning enemies. (There are different types of support magic, but those are still in development) \n\nThe story is engaging for what's there so far. Plenty of overused RPG tropes, but done in a humorous way that pokes fun of the genre or even some twists on what you would expect. A handful of pop culture references mixed in too for lampshading purposes. It's short, sweet, fun but still a work in progress. \n\nThe real draw of the game is the Arcade Mode. Pretty much a Roguelike system where you run through randomly generated dungeons with whatever kind of build you want to try. This is probably where you'll be spending most of your time after \"finishing\" story mode. It feels like a roguelike, plays like a roguelike, and is as fun/infuriating as a rogulike. Good stuff, just make sure you go through story mode to avoid any spoilers. \n\n6/10 for what's on the table now. Most likely would get a 9-10/10 when fully released. Buy if you're interested, definitely follow it if you're curious. Just keep in mind that it's only three people with full time jobs making this game. Updates are pretty slow when compared to standards you may be used to with other Early Acess titles.

compelled by the story line, but that's probably because it's still in beta and hasn't had time to expand. So it will probably get better as the game grows.\n\nA couple things I don't like about the game is that it doesn't allow you to fight all bosses you've beaten before, it does with certain bosses that drop loot but not with others that don't, I hope this gets changed in the near future.\n\nAlso a certain boss feels as if they aren't even a challange, the boss of which I'm talking about is [spoiler]Phaseman[/spoiler] his attacks are fair and deal enough damage but he can't sustain enough damage to make it past he's second position, he simply dies too fast, I recommend that he's health pool should be increased dramatically.

It is very much feature complete and well polished for a game in early access, and not just features relating to gameplay mechanics, but actual activities you can occupy your time with. Campaign, a roguelite arcade mode, and co-op make for a healthy bit of longevity. Presentation is great, with good graphics, animations, and sound.\n\nPick it up!\n\n[h1]======================================[/h1]\n\n[h1][b]Pros:[/b][/h1]\n+ [b]Graphics:[/b] Clean sprites, animation, and backgrounds. Fun colorful palette.\n+ [b]Audio:[/b] Music is nice, sound cues are all reasonably distinct, excluding skill sfx.\n+ [b]Story:[/b] There's enough humor baked in to make it less pointless, albeit hit and miss.\n+ [b]Grind:[/b] Permanent buffs through card collection, tons of items, skills, etc.\n+ [b]Design:[/b] Satisfying level design, puzzles, dungeon length, progression, etc.\n+ [b]Heart:[/b] Some definite love has been poured into this product.\n\n[h1][b]Cons:[/b][/h1]\n- [b]Waiting:[/b] It's not finished, yet.\n- [b]Balance:[/b] Some playstyles fare better than others, but that isn't to say they aren't viable.\n\n[h1][b]Neutral:[/b][/h1]\n\u00b1 [b]Binds:[/b] Controller binding slightly limited.\n\n[h1]======================================[/h1]\n\n[h1][b]Introduction:[/b][/h1]\nDid you ever wish there was a game where you could just sit around and fish, collect, craft, fight, dungeon dive, level up, and more as you choose, with each element being satisfying, but ALSO you wanted it to be similar to games like The Oracle of Ages/Seasons in the Zelda series? Secrets of Grindea is for you! If you don't want the last aspect, go look at Stardew Valley.\n\n[h1][b]Gameplay:[/b][/h1]\nGameplay in Secrets of Grindea is simple. Interaction and weapon/skill use are on separate keys. With a keyboard, skills can be rebinded to specific keys. With a controller, skills can be swapped out inside of specific binds, you can't change the binds for shield and weapon use. Essentially, you're either interacting with an NPC, moving around, or fighting with your weapon and skills of choice. The fun comes from how many ways there are to execute these actions.\n\nYou can fish, which involves keeping a bar lined up over an icon, horizontally. It's relaxing, satisfying, and you can even fish up equipment from time to time! You can use ingredients and even previous armors and weapons to craft new armors and weapons. Talk to NPCs for fun, or quests (many of which reward skill or talent points.) Refight bosses with ease and convenience whenever you want. Fight mobs with specific spawn zones whenever you want. Respec your build and play a different way. Redo your hair and clothes, including colors. Progress in the campaign, solving puzzles and completing challenges to complete dungeons. Kill monsters and critters to try and complete your card collection, which grant permanent buffs. Capture specific critters/monsters as pets, which can be used to boost your stats. Amass wealth by selling drops you farm. Try your builds in the roguelite arcade mode. Play alone. Play with friends. Play with strangers.\n\nNo matter who you are, I maintain there is something to like in Secrets of Grindea...\n\nExcept those annoying bees.\n\n[h1][b]Graphics:[/b][/h1]\n\nOh, did I mention you can do all of this while being immersed in a cute colorful world with gorgeous sprites, backgrounds, and simple fun animations? Because you totally can do that.\n\nThe screenshots should speak for themselves.\n\n[h1][b]Audio:[/b][/h1]\n\nSo the sound in Secrets of Grindea may be the one weak point of the game. That isn't to say it is terrible, but simply that the rest of the game is so good, it has a bit of trouble keeping up with its current implementation. You won't find yourself buried in 100 different sounds blurring together and deafening you like some games, but at the same time, the diversity of sound applied to skills and actions can be a bit unsatisfactory. If all the skills had more distinct, appealing, impactful sounds that gave them more individual identity, the game would feel a lot better, as your character would then be something more individual you can be more attached to as well. Now, all that said, you probably won't be muting the game or anything, and the music is nice, although you may end up muting that if you hang out in certain hubs a lot. On the other hand, I found myself muting the music less often than other games, because it is appropriately relaxing and/or fitting for the areas and situations they go with.\n\n[h1][b]Conclusion:[/b][/h1]\n\nSecrets of Grindea is an RPG about variety and freedom. Oldschool gamers, adults, kids, casuals, and hardcore players can all find something fun here.

All of the animations are 10/10; really satisfying to watch which really helps to promote the depth of their combat mechanics and enemy actions.\n\nThe combat system is gold. There is a variety of incredibly rewarding abilities to choose from and the devs chose a fully open point buy system with the option of point buyback at a reasonably steep cost. IT'S SO GOOD. I feel liike my decisions matter, but also that i am free to try different abilities off the list to see if i like them without being locked in forever. There are also a surprising number of ways to coordinate different abilities together so you can get fairly creative with how you build your character. \n\nOverall good music choices; they reinforce the tongue-in-cheek comedy with which the game explores classic RPG tropes but nevertheless they in themselves well composed and very appropriately selected. No complaints regarding sound effects. \n\nAs you might expect the story is rather weak...then again, it's only real weakness is being predictable. Since we're following even the tropic story arcs of this games predecessors, you might expect them to seem rather generic.

Now a friend and I own Secrets of Grindea and it's [i]fantastic[/i]. It's everything a good RPG needs and it's not even finished yet. Here are some points.\n\n[h1] PROS [/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Fantastic, and I mean absolutely [b]extraordinary[/b] pixel graphics. Some areas completely blew my mind because of how wonderful the scenery looked.\n[*]Expertly crafted levels give a smooth feel to the game. The plains in the beginning felt chaotic. Felt like it had a sense of wildlife. The town had a clever building layout, the [spoiler]flying fortress[/spoiler] felt symmetric and not too maze like. The [spoiler]Halloween[/spoiler] map had a wonderful border effect, winding and narrow paths and perfect but not too difficult maze-like structure.\n[*]Upbeat and catchy soundtrack deserving of it's own DLC.\n[*]Excellent, sometimes halarious sidequests keep the player engaged every time a main story plot was advanced through.\n[*]Mindboggling puzzles and secrets that make you think in order to get the reward rather than have you kill a generic miniboss (While minibosses are a thing in the game, they are rare and require some skills to take out.)\n[*]Up to 4 player supported co-op that really shines. The main story has subtle changes to accomodate to a party with the host being considered the 'main character' while the others were his equally as powerful and important friends.\n[*]Competetive or Uncompetitive loot share allows for a race-to-the-loot type of co-op gameplay or a relaxed type of co-op gameplay where everyone gets the same items from chests but generic enemy loot drops are split randomly throughout the group so that everyone get's a slice of the bloodied pie.\n[*]Extensive skill system and trees allowed for all types of gameplay with no class restrictions. Be a Claymore weilding mage, or a Duelist that uses both a Sword and Shield and Two-Handed. Become a jack-of-all-trades with the 4 magic types (Fire, Air, Water, Earth) and a master of none.\n[*]Ingenious inventory system allows for both and equipment and vanity slots and also allows you the ability to 'transmog' your equipment such as wands, swords, and shields to look like previously collected weapons without the sacrifice in stats. Same goes for armor.\n[*]You can have a smiling cloud that craps lightning on your foes.\n[/list]\n\n[h1] CONS [/h1]\n[list]\n[*]With up to 4 player co-op, the screen can end up having a lot going on in one small space. This is especially true in some small boss arenas like the [spoiler]GUN-DAM[/spoiler] fight where you have to really pay attention to where you're going. While also making sure you and your friends stay out of harms way.\n[*]In some areas like the [spoiler]Halloween Forest[/spoiler], a lot of enemies can be in the same areas at once. This can make solo-play challenging especially as enemies respawn on a seemingly short respawn timer that can make battles turn hairy at a moments notice.\n[*]The mix of magic, skills, basic attacks, and enviornmental awareness can sometimes really disorient people. It's difficult to fight multiple small enemies at once while also keeping an eye on your remaining energy, switching between normal and special attacks, blocking with your shield, AND keeping an eye on your shield-block meter. This sort of combat inspires a rushed and adrenaline-fueld high octane battle enviornment giving people a rush to smash their keys as quickly as possible. At least that's what happens with me. And this usually ends up with me not noticing my health dropping or my friend ending up dead right next to me.\n[*]The crafting system is intuitive and mysterious, with some recipies not being able to be unlocked until you find a certain item from a dropped creature. For example, the icon for Honey was greyed out until I managed to kill a bee and get myself one unit of Honey. Along with this, the item your crafting tells you the stats OF the item BEFORE you make it, just so you don't accidentally make something you can't use. Why is this a flaw? Well this isn't a flaw in itself, the flaw comes from the process of MAKING the item. For example, to make an Apple Hat I had to take a Straw Hat and gather [b]60, count 'em, SIXTY APPLES[/b]. This can make the game feel grindy, no pun intended. I'm not exactly sure if that's an intended feature or not, but it's not a huge problem since crafting isn't the main focus of the game, and more likely a menu you will look through every-so-often just to check if you gathered enough items to fill a certain criteria.\n[/list]\n\n[h1] CONCLUSION [/h1]\nThat's pretty much it. I think this may be the longest review I've ever written, but I think SoG deserves it. At the time of writing this, I'm only 2 hours into the game and I can't wait to see what I can uncover next. This is truly an amazing RPG/Adventure game.\n\nI will update the review throughout the early access process and with my advancement of the game.

I mean that, Best $15 I've spent in a good while.\n\nThis developer earned my appreciation in a lot of ways in just 30 minutes. First, There is a free demo of the game. You can actually see, first hand, whether the game is going to run properly on your machine without spending a dime. Second, The game warns you of an error that makes some pcs run fullscreen mode badly in the demo. I do not experience this error, I find that it runs perfectly in fullscreen on my (rather old) pc. But the fact that they make that apparent in the demo shows an amount of respect for your time and money that, as a games consumer, I'm well accustomed to not getting. Third, The actual content of the game:\n\nTake the 2D Zelda titles, Update the pixel art quality, Add in Diablo-inspired skill trees, but hold the class restrictions. Then add active blocking with a timing mechanic that makes a perfectly timed block benefit you in some way, Differently depending on the attack being blocked. Then vary the weapons, One handed weapons for a swift attacking mobile build, Two handed for a slower hard-hitter, passive buffs on weapons for builds with other sources of damage. Then add spells; Simple fireballs, ice spikes, and chain lightning for damage. Utility spells like haste and damage buffs, Summons to support you, Debuffs to slow or continually damage enemies, and (Being a game in beta) More to come.\n\nThen there are the little things:\n\n*Pressing a key on your keyboard will change the control prompts to keyboard keys, Pressing a button on your controller will turn them into controller versions. No need to fiddle around with the options, It's automatic.\n\n*Downloading the demo before buying the game completes some of the full download, Reducing the time the download takes and minimizing redundant data use. \n\n*Your save files from the demo will be carried over to the full game should you (And you should) Purchase it.\n\n*And a tongue-in-cheek sense of humor present throughout that amuses me while not taking me out of the experience.\n\n\nI look very much forward to this game's future development and eventual completion, and to whatever Pixel Ferrets decides to do after.

It seems inspired by games like Link to the Past (one of my favourites) and has a similar feel to it.  I like that there is a lot of depth to characters, though if you go for a plain 1h or 2h fighter you'll probably end up with a sort of samey character as you level up all of the 1h or 2h skills.  That said, there are tons of options for combinations with various kinds of magic and skills, though I would like if leveling up skills had more of an effect than 1-2% at a time for most of them, to further increase character diversity.\n\nThe depth is very good in that there is a lot to do with your character, but not in a confusing way.  I was surprised when I found out you can also level up pet skills to further increase stats, and collecting monster cards also gives solid bonuses.  Looking back, it doesn't seem very complicated now that I've played through the current game a couple times, because it's easy to understand.  If you want to play through the game just mashing the attack button, that's fine (it will be really hard though), but you also have the option to level your skills in such a way that you can set up crazy combos and blow everything up.  The combat later on gets exciting enough that it's fun even to grind mobs looking for the card drop, both against the easy mobs and hard ones.\n\nIf you like the demo, and are willing to pay for a promising early access game, I recommend it.

And frankly, yeah, it's been in development forever. There is a dev blog and it is updated fairly often but there is still a lack of justification for the length of time it's taken to complete the game.\n\nThat aside, this is not like other early access games. This is a really, really well-made game with a lot of content already in it. There is clearly a lot of love that went into this game down to the sprite animations, the little cutscenes, puzzles, and gameplay itself. I went through the main portion of the content in 15 hours and beyond that there's achievements and arcade mode which is insidious and takes forever. Co-op is really fun and unique especially considering most games don't offer it, ever.\n\nThis was without a doubt worth the $15 even unfinished. I loved playing this game and I was instantly addicted. It's extremely refreshing to see quality of this magnitude with indie development. And yet, what's disappointing is the lack of additions in such a length of time.

Took me about an hour or so to bust through the new additions, then I spent some time in arcade mode.\n\nSo... Let's do some simple maths ('Cause I don't know how to do much else concerning maths);\n\n~1 hour of story content = 1 year of development.\n\nGame looks to be about 30-50% \"complete\" in its story. Wouldn't be surprised if the devs skimped a bit just to release a \"full product\" in a few years.\n\nLet's take a look at, say Cave Story. Took a guy 5 years (during his spare time, also in college and working a full time job) to make this game. Game's a masterpiece in its genre. Polished and perfected.\n\nLet's also assume that the 3 devs (I dunno if they hired anyone else, doubt it though) are also on this same schedule. Spare time working on the game only. 5 x 365 = 1826. 1826 / 3 = 608.733333~\n\nThat's just shy of 2 years in development for a completely finished product if 3 people are on the workload in an an equal capacity. So why has it taken 3 people 5 years to do the same amount of work as 1 guy? Why is the development of this game so slow and awful?\n\nI shall pose an answer for you in the form of a question; Say you pay someone upfront, the full price of the cost to put a roof on your house. What is the motivation to actually do the work? What's stopping this company from driving in a single nail per day and then calling it quits? They already have your money, why continue with the job at all?\n\nEarly Access is just... A bad business model in its current form. It's not bad for the business, that's for sure, as games like Starbound and this one will attest to. It's bad for the consumer, and for some reason the consumer just laps this garbage up like it's some sort of ambrosian nectar of the dev-gods. There really needs to be some sort of time-limit (One year at the most, 30 days after the deadline to clean up) for games to either finish their development and release a full product, or start refunding all purchases completely.\n\nAs it stands, there's absolutely no reason for anyone to ever pull \"Early Access Game\" from their pages it's basically free money for a tech demo and a couple of lines of \"story\" to sate the spasms of frothing, ADD-rattled fans.\n\nGaming has fallen so far, and I hope for another crash.", "timestamp_created": 1472432039, "timestamp_updated": 1472432039, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.338546", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25218155": {"recommendationid": "25218155", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970944678", "num_games_owned": 237, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454732618}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a scam.

What do you get for 10.99? You get a modern retro looking rpg clearly inspired by the SNES era, with the option to play solo or with up to 3 friends with either keyboard or controller (I recommend you use controller). The gameplay is captivating: the boss battles especially are well crafted and not to mention very challenging. These battles do a good job of incorporating the co-op aspect although the battles are almost as fun solo, albeit slightly easier.\nThe world has a variety of locations and each is unique both in visuals and inhabitants. The music and sound effects are excellent. The story is funny in parts but not the main attraction. Where the game really shines is with its weapon and class systems. There are lots of attacks to use whilst in combat using a range of melee weapons, magic and specials. The game constantly allows you to level up skills and gain new ones. Like in most games from this genre, you have the choice on which skills you'd like to focus on more, for example making your character's health high so you can act more as a tank, rushing into swarms of enemies whilst a friend attacks from afar with magic or a bow. Improving your attacks is rewarding and, in my opinion, is one of the most enjoyable aspects about Secrets of Grindea. \nQuests involve puzzles, exploration and quite a bit of reading (obviously, although cutscenes can be skipped). Overall it is a great game that is easily woth its price. \nThe only negatives would be: it has a mediocre story and missed the oportunity to make pets aid your character in battle (instead they just follow you around and that's it).", "timestamp_created": 1472329655, "timestamp_updated": 1472329655, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502550", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25179570": {"recommendationid": "25179570", "author": {"steamid": "76561198246530264", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 24, "last_played": 1515231415}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u786e\u5f88\u597d\u73a9\uff0c\u4e00\u53e3\u6c146\u5c0f\u65f6\u3002\n\u76f4\u5230\n\u672c\u6b21\u66f4\u65b0\u5230\u6b64\u7ed3\u675f\u3002\n\u8dea\u6c42\u5236\u4f5c\u7ec4\u5feb\u505a\u554a\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1472296613, "timestamp_updated": 1472296613, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529127", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25157791": {"recommendationid": "25157791", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040349286", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 427, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 164, "last_played": 1516423171}, "language": "english", "review": "Reminds me of Zelda link to the past.", "timestamp_created": 1472200994, "timestamp_updated": 1472200994, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25134292": {"recommendationid": "25134292", "author": {"steamid": "76561198169791939", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3895, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506774695}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc2a4\ud0ac \ubc38\ud328 \uc774\ud6c4 \ubc95\uc0ac\ub4e4\ub3c4 \ub098\ub984 \ud560\ub9cc\ud574\uc9c4\uac83 \uac19\ub124\uc694!\n\uc774\uc81c \ud558\ub4dc \ubaa8\ub4dc\ud560\ub54c \uc5bc\ubc95\uc815\ub3c4 \ub370\ub824\uac00\ub3c4 \uad49\uc7a5\ud788 \ud070 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc774 \ub420 \uac83 \uac19\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4!!\n\uc790\uc5f0\uacc4\uc5f4\uc740..\uc880\ub354 \ubc84\ud504\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud560\ub4ef..\n\uc591\uc190\uac80\ub3c4 \uc2a4\ub9e4\uc2f1,\ub2f9\uad6c\ub9cc \uc798\uce58\uba74 \ud558\ub4dc\ubaa8\ub4dc \ud63c\uc790\uc11c \ub2e4 \uc539\uc5b4\uba39\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4(\uadf8 \ub2f9\uad6c\uac00 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6cc\uc11c \ubb38\uc81c\uc9c0)\n\ud55c\uc190\uac80\uc740 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uadf8\ub9bc\uc790\uac00 \uc824 \uc88b\uc740\uac83 \uac19\uace0,\uc0ac\uc2e4\uc0c1 \ubcf4\uc870 \uc2a4\ud0ac \ud328\uce58\uac00 \ubc95\uc0ac\ub97c \uc0b4\ub838\ub124\uc694.\n\ud3ec\ucee4\uc2a4 \uac1c\uc0ac\uae30", "timestamp_created": 1472139457, "timestamp_updated": 1511445300, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25084481": {"recommendationid": "25084481", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061737589", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 874, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509790681}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u7ecf\u5e38\u5728\u6e38\u620f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5bfc\u81f4\u6e38\u620f\u53d1\u751f\u9519\u8bef\u5e76\u5173\u95ed\uff0c\u8fd9\u6837\u5bfc\u81f4\u89d2\u8272\u8d44\u6599\u4e22\u5931\u3002\u3002\u975e\u5e38\u9ebb\u70e6", "timestamp_created": 1471922520, "timestamp_updated": 1471922520, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523622", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25053042": {"recommendationid": "25053042", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150291920", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2560, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498910823}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u9664\u4e86\u66f4\u65b0\u6bd4\u8f83\u6162  \u5176\u4ed6\u6ca1\u4ec0\u4e48\u53ef\u6311\u5254\u7684\u4e00\u6b3e\u50cf\u7d20RPG\u6e38\u620f  \u8054\u673a\u4e5f\u633a\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684  \u5f88\u671f\u5f85\u540e\u7eed\u5267\u60c5", "timestamp_created": 1471785613, "timestamp_updated": 1471785613, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505859", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25046854": {"recommendationid": "25046854", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074822419", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 770, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471759122}, "language": "english", "review": "Do not play arcade mode.

NOTE: the dev team is made up of three people, so be patient!\n- Boss battles were designed to be beat in one go; meaning you have no health potions you can buy, but can pick up health orbs that will keep you in the fight\n\n1998/1998: would Grind and feel nostaligc about RPGs all over again", "timestamp_created": 1471220332, "timestamp_updated": 1497875293, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24923102": {"recommendationid": "24923102", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071687462", "num_games_owned": 359, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 676, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507492824}, "language": "french", "review": "super bon rpg rappel enorm\u00e9ment les rpg que nous offrais squaresoft super amusant j'attend impatiemment chaque mise a jour", "timestamp_created": 1471218067, "timestamp_updated": 1471218067, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24913213": {"recommendationid": "24913213", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059123532", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 790, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505774706}, "language": "english", "review": "It's not easy to find 'clean' games I can play with my younger kids, but this one is absolutely a hit!

Fighting mobs of enemies feels great, and there are some cool bosses. Quests and areas are easy to understand without being too straightforward. The structure is pretty linear but offers some fun diversions in the form of collectible items, crafting recipes, and short side quests. Cooperative play is well-implemented in terms of interface and networking code, but doesn't really require you to specialize your characters to fight as a team. Overall, it's fun!

La historia en si gira en torno al farmeo propio de estos juegos, eres un recolector (literalmente, est\u00e1s en un grupo de recolectores que viajan por el mundo recogiendo artefactos antiguos), no es nada del otro mundo, pero vas viendo y conociendo la mitologia e historia del mundo en el que te encuentras. Los bosses son muy dinamicos y muy estilo bullet hell, te lanzan cientos de ataques y t\u00fa los esquivas (o bloqueas). En si es un mundo muy colorido, con personajes y enemigos no muy originales, pero tiene su propio car\u00e1cter.\n\n-Modo arcade: es un rogue like, sencilla y planamente. Tu vas de planta en planta limpiando todas las salas de enemigos hasta llegar a un boss y subir a la siguiente planta. El elemento m\u00e1s diferenciador de esto pueden ser las misiones que te dan algunos NPCs que van apareciendo seg\u00fan m\u00e1s puntos acumulas y un sistema con el que puedes conseguir enfocarte en una clase al empezar el recorrido, como empezar con un mejor escudo, con mas vida, una espada de verdad o un bast\u00f3n de mago entre muchas otras. Lo mejor de esto es el multijugador online, te conectas con amigos y te pones a repartir mamporros a diestro y siniestro. Por otro lado, la \u00fanica manera de curarte es en la primera sala al llegar a la siguiente planta, si has tenido la suerte de llegar sin sufrir da\u00f1o te dar\u00e1n una poci\u00f3 de curaci\u00f3n para que la uses cuando quieras, pero ya est\u00e1.\n\nEl sistema de combate recuerda mucho a los Zelda de Game Boy Advance, solo que aqu\u00ed hay clases e incluso puedes combinar ataques de espada con magia, lo cual resulta muy \u00fatil, o especializarte solamente en una rama. Los escudos tienen barra de aguante para que no est\u00e9s abusando de inmunidad, pero tambi\u00e9n tienen sus propias mec\u00e1nicas, como la capacidad de darte cr\u00edticos.\n\nDe por si el juego no es ninguna revoluci\u00f3n, pero las cosas que hace en las mec\u00e1nicas de pelea las hace muy bien, sin embargo el lento desarrollo ha hecho que tenga un modo historia incompleto adem\u00e1s de lo frustrante que se vuelve en si al pasar las cinco plantas en el modo arcade. En estos momentos este juego vale sobre todo para jugar con amigos, pero no pagar\u00eda los 14 euros que cuesta, si encontrais un pack de cuatro en humble bundle o algo parecido, intentad aprovecharlo con otros tres amigos, saldr\u00e1 m\u00e1s a cuenta. A pesar del lento desarrollo, el juego sigue teniendo actualizaciones, pero puede llevar tres o cuatro a\u00f1os m\u00e1s para que est\u00e9 completo.

I was skeptical about picking this one up, but after 9 hours of non-stop playing, I can say that this is one of my favourite games of all time. There are so many skills to choose from, but since you can un-spend skill points for only a little gold, you can try out different combos without ruining your character. The two-handed melee skills are absolutely amazing and make you feel like you're ripping your enemies to shreds. One of the skills is literally batting enemies into other enemies, making them explode in a chain reaction of gold and slime goop.\n\nA word of warning for those who don't get it: [i]Grind[/i]ea. You're going to be grinding at some point or another, but since enemies constantly respawn and pile onto your slowly dying character, even farming is ridiculously fun for the majority of items.

Different skills can completely change how you fight, and you can pretty easily re-spec to try out other builds if you like. Fighting isn't a mash of pixels like bullet hell games. While it's a bit faster than something like Secret of Mana it still relies on skill and handling timing.\n\nThe graphics are much better than others you'll find on steam (like, wanderlust for instance) and work at large resolutions.  \n\nController support isn't the best, but using something like joy2key works fine.\n\nThere are two bad parts of the game:\n\n1.)

But I'll try my best!\n\nOkay so here we go! Secrets of Grindea, first look before buying it I though to myself, \"Eh, this games doesn't look too bad. I hope it's not like every other rpg I've played.\" So I bought this game knowing that it was still early access. What a gamble! \n\nOkay now lets talk about my first reaction.I booted up the game, (do people even say that anymore?) and was welcomed by a nice and catchy theme song, one I still cannot get out of my head. I proceeded to select stroymode, singlplayer and boom I was in the game! I played through the intro, the first boss, the second boss, and the first two areas. I fell in love with the game because it was really unique and interesting, let's not forget about fun!\n\nFighting! The combat is smooth and not boring, plus the cartoonish style makes it enjoyable. Two handed swords are slow, one handed swords are fast like they should be and wands make magic dealy but don't hurt much. The skills they have add a sort of customization to the game that can make a player speicalize in what they want wether its a tank role,  supportrole, or somwhere in between. Magic in the game is fun though some of the schools of magic,which are ground, wind, ice, and fire, are better than the other this can lead to a broken system where one school of magic in the game is never used making it pointless. \n\nAnother great feature of the game is the pets! You got to love the pets they're soo CUTE!!! *cough* *cough* On a professional note pets are a fun feature that really adds to the game. The best part of the pets is  that you can feed them certain items that boost your overall stats. This is great like I said previously but broken becuase the game itself has no protection against hacking. You could hack in a billion speed potions if you wanted to and feed them to your pet which makes you OP as heck and can ruin the gaming experience.\n\nLets talk about the gameplay, so far in the game at the date this is written you can only play the game up to Mt.Bloom, which is okay because the game is still in EARLY ACCESS. The monsters can be challenging at times and make you upset. I don't know how many I died by a monster and said,\" I am going to destroy your face!\" I am looking at you Halloweed. The leveling system is pretty fair with a great exp rate through out the story. The bosses are nice with a unique challenge for all of them, you have to create tactics and learn the bosses attack patterns before you can triumph over them. WARNING: Prepare to get creamed by some bosses!! The level spikes in each area you go to are mostly appropriate besides the third area which can get a tad tough becuase of certain enemies. ( I swear the Yeti species hate me >.> )\n\nWhat is an RPG without multiplayer, am I right? Secrets of Grindea goes about there Co-op experience just fine. You can play story mode with friends or play Arcade mode with friends. There is no match making feature currently in the game so you have to go make some friends to play multiplayer. During the story mode when you play multi player whoever is the host of the game it's their story, so don't expect to pick up where you left off in the story mode with your friends if you try to play solo. When you play solo it is your own story on the specific character. The Arcade mode is where you traverse through floors trying to make it to the end, if you die you start all over and loose your gear. There is a warning though, this mode could potentially ruin the story line.\n\nOverall this game is really fun and I reccommend that eveyone gives it a try.

So why the negative review? Well for one, Steam doesn't give me the option to have a neutral review, and two I want to give potential buyers some reasons as to why they wouldn't want to buy in. Most of the negative reviews don't really do that, at least not in detail.\n\nI've been following this game for a long time, a lot of love has gone in to its development, and it really shows through the quirky spritework. The problem with the development is that it's just been so painfully slow that I can't recommend spending $15 on it at this point, because the desire to check back in after a few months when nearly nothing new has been added fades away after over two years; and that's how long I've had this game. It was first released for beta purchase around April 1, 2014.\n\nOver the course of two years, the story has essentially gained one new dungeon (of which there was only one before) along with a marginal amount of content that shows this game is going to be in development for many more years. The content that's there is good, sure, but it's not so stellar as to justify playing through the story more than once or twice.\n\nThe real mode that seems to add playtime to this game is its arcade mode, which is roguelike in nature, and requires a good understanding of enemy/boss patterns to do well in. Players play through two floors representing each area in the story mode, complete with enemies from said area, and have no chances to heal except at the end of each floor. Despite having numerous floors and all of the enemies from the story mode, it's pretty light on content in terms of roguelikes. There are unlockables and such, but they only give minor advantages, and as a result adding more floors to the mode seems kind of pointless in its current state. Even after over two years of going back to this game I struggle to reach the 7th floor of what must be over 14 at this point. There isn't much incentive to bother trying to reach those floors either. \n\nSo should you buy this game? Well that depends on how patient you are. After two years I'm pretty burned out and don't see myself playing this game for a long, long time. If you think you can wait for what could be 5 years to play a finished product and want to support the developers, then by all means get this game. If not, keep an eye on it and pick it up a few years down the road when it has a more justifiable amount of content to offer.\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the support guys, since this review got so much attention I want to add a little more. \n\nIf you're worried about spending $15 on a game that won't be finished, don't be. This game is a safe buy in my opinion. Even though the development has been very slow, it has been extremely consistent and the team behind this game definitely has what it takes to finish the job. Secrets of Grindea has been in the works since 2011, and the quality of the content in it has only improved since. Their [url=http://www.secretsofgrindea.com/index.php/dev-blog]dev blog[/url] has a weekly recap that is posted nearly every week without missing a beat. So if you're interested, definitely keep an eye on this game, because it is one of the better early access titles out there, despite the slow development speed.", "timestamp_created": 1463073723, "timestamp_updated": 1463690613, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 453, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.894644", "comment_count": "10", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22923662": {"recommendationid": "22923662", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090274714", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461222609}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc2a4\ud0c0\ub4c0\ubc38\ub9ac, \ud14c\ub77c\ub9ac\uc544 \ub4f1 \ube44\uc2b7\ud55c \ub290\ub08c\uc758 \uadf8\ub798\ud53d \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \uc88b\uc544\ud558\uc2dc\ub294 \ubd84\ub4e4\uc774\ub77c\uba74 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \uc7ac\ubc0c\uac8c \uc990\uae30\uc2e4 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac8c\uc784\uc778 \uac83 \uac19\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc544\uc9c1 \uc815\uc2dd\ubc1c\ub9e4\uac00 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc9e7\uc740 \uac83\uc774 \uc880 \uc548\ud0c0\uae5d\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub178\uba40 \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \uc774\ud6c4 \ud558\ub4dc\ubaa8\ub4dc \uac15\ucd94 \ub4dc\ub9bd\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uba58\ud0c8 \ubc14\uc0ac\uc0ad(\uba40\ud2f0\uac00 \ub354 \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4\uace0 \ud558\ub354\uad70\uc694). \uc544\uc26c\uc6b4 \uc810\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc544\ub2c8\ub098 \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \uc911 \uc7ac\ubc0c\ub294 \uc694\uc18c\uac00 \ub9ce\uc544 \uc990\uac70\uc6e0\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4\ud310 \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \uc601\uc0c1 \uc720\ud2ad\uc5d0 \uc62c\ub838\uc73c\ub2c8 \uad81\uae08\ud558\uc2e0 \ubd84\ub4e4\uc740 \ud074\ub9ad!(\uad6c\ub3c5/\uc88b\uc544\uc694 \ud574\uc8fc\uc2dc\uba74 \uac10\uc0ac\ud558\uaca0\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4 ^^)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZcMRtb43Z8&list=PL7kXgX3VIcE4FEUYmRsIUY46_ww2ajF0T", "timestamp_created": 1463043900, "timestamp_updated": 1463043900, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.434659", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22918271": {"recommendationid": "22918271", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098269594", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 430, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487709744}, "language": "english", "review": "This game needs quite a bit of tweaking. \nAfter only 2 and a half hours of gameplay, not only have I had to restart the game from the begining, but I would have to do it again because half of the quests I do break if I exit and save only to come back the next day and find out that I apparentley I already did it even though the quest is still not done.\nAnother issue I encountered was that when I saved on my first session playing this game and came back the next day, even though I had all my equipment, all of my quest and story progress had been lost. Pretty annoying if you ask me.\nMy third and final issue that I found was that half the time while trying to run the game, instead of loading it up straight away like my other games, it wouldn't start up. So after clicking on the desktop icon a couple times, it finally loaded up but not properly. The game's resolution screwed up my screen size and zoomed in on a portion of my desktop in a lower quality without the game even loadind up fully. The taskbar icon for the game was active but the game itself wasn't running at all. It didn't even come up when I loaded task manager and tried to end task it. Manually closing it from the taskbar didn't help either. I tried to get a refund, but of course you can only get a refund for a game if you have UNDER 2 HOURS. Pretty dissapointed because not only could I have spent my hard earned cash on something else that would actually work, but I can't even get my money back.\nOverall, gameplay and fighting is kinda generic and well put together, but the amount of bugs in only 2 and a half hours is pretty horrendous.\n4/10\n\nP.S.

So far only played single player and am really enjoying it. The story and characters are rather cute and funny which is a nice change of pace from new age games and quite reminiscent of an old school RPG atmsophere. The puzzles are also well done. There was a few moments in the in the Fae forest that were top notch and had me thinking the whole time going in between back and forth desperately trying to figure out what to do. The combat is also very enjoyable. Very rarely can you just \"go ham\" and often you have to think before attacking. Boss fights actually being a challenge and needing strategy is a huge deal to me. AS for a score not sure what i grade it its good but i dont know if its that good. If this game gets some more content a littel more balancing and some final polish 10/10 easy. As is, I have to rate it a 7/10 due to lack of content and a few balancing issues, If they fill out that support tree make that a 8/10 (biased mage player here XD). Support is a staple to co-op play in any game so it will be nice to see what they will add. I must say i dont know how a healer or heal skills would be implemented but it would be nice for someone to be able to play \"Team Mom\" keeping everyone healthy and buffed. Maybe a regen over time heal or something. \nSo my final call if u dont mind spendning the money and it looks decent to you then by all means go ahead.

It remembers to the times when you have played Secret of Mana with 2 friends, but Secrets of Grindea runs over webbased protocolls to play it online or LAN based.\n\nHere the same: Be carefull, Full Controller Support means only XInput compatible Devices can be used.\n\nFacit: The Game is still in development, but in the current state is only once to say: \"Buy it or Regret it!\"", "timestamp_created": 1462446058, "timestamp_updated": 1462446058, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22806449": {"recommendationid": "22806449", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114360736", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 11267, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504305303}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u4ece\u51e0\u5e74\u524d\u5c31\u5f00\u59cb\u5173\u6ce8\u4e86,\u867d\u7136\u6e38\u620f\u5236\u4f5c\u8fdb\u7a0b\u7f13\u6162,\u4f46\u662f\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u98ce\u683c,\u521b\u610f\u4ee5\u53ca\u7565\u641e\u7684\u5267\u60c5\u548c\u5bf9\u8bdd\u90fd\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u4ef7\u503c...\u867d\u7136\u4e4b\u524d\u4e00\u76f4\u7b49\u7740\u6b63\u5f0f\u7248,\u5e76\u4ee5\u975e\u6b63\u7248\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5728\u4e00\u76f4\u8ddf\u968f\u7740\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u6bcf\u6b21\u66f4\u65b0,\u6700\u8fd1\u56e0\u4e3a\u542c\u8bf4\u66f4\u65b0\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5267\u60c5,\u6240\u4ee5\u5e72\u8106\u5165\u4e86\u6b63...\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u7edd\u5bf9\u662f\u6b3e\u597d\u6e38\u620f,\u81f3\u5c11\u6211\u5bf9\u6b64\u6e38\u620f\u975e\u5e38\u70ed\u5fe0!", "timestamp_created": 1462432250, "timestamp_updated": 1462432250, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22795526": {"recommendationid": "22795526", "author": {"steamid": "76561198185389053", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1081, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465733848}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4eca\u5e74\u73a9\u8fc7\u7684\u6700\u7d27\u51d1\u6700\u6709\u6e38\u620f\u6027\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u4e86\u3002\u97f3\u6548\u6253\u51fb\u611f\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u90fd\u5f88\u597d\u3002\u8fde\u4e0a\u624b\u67c4\u66f4\u662f\u723d\u6b6a\u6b6a\u3002\u5982\u679c\u753b\u9762\u518d\u73b0\u4ee3\u4e00\u70b9\u5c31\u66f4\u597d\u4e86\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1462375624, "timestamp_updated": 1462375624, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22794290": {"recommendationid": "22794290", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065600857", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 6285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467679187}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u503c\u5f97\u4e00\u73a9\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u3002\u5c31\u662f\u66f4\u65b0\u592a\u6162\u4e86", "timestamp_created": 1462370913, "timestamp_updated": 1462370913, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506185", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22784679": {"recommendationid": "22784679", "author": {"steamid": "76561198300201896", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2482, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482018444}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely love this game.

Been telling people all about it! So ready for more to come out, but understand that it takes time. I'm just so impatient!!! Noticed a few minor glitches/issues, but completely understandable due to being in beta still. If you are joining someone else's game, you have to from the get-go (meaning: before they even start their game: thus at the invite screen when hosting a game). You can not jump in mid-game or there will be issues (screen freezing, health bar stretching across screen, screen resolution messed up, major lag, unable to charge powers, etc). Also, if you are joining a game and you are fighting monsters from/or in the Haunted Forest, you get X and Y (what look like coordinates) in your text/chat box. A little upset over the chances of getting a card, but that makes me play the game more TO get cards. Overall though, I HIGHLY recommend this game for others. It may be in beta, but with the amount of game play time and the story line/plot and just how much fun it is... it's totally worth it! Please! If you're even CONSIDERING buying this game, please do! It's worth it, I promise! Plus, the more people buy the beta, the better it helps the developers/builders of this game.

I figured 17.00$ for a unfinished game might not be worth it even if it is good because it is still in early access and would have so little to the game that it is not worth it. The game looked like a higher quality indie maker game and that was not what I was interested in so I dismissed it. I wanted something that will have lots to do good gameplay and lots of replay value. \n\nI was really wrong about the game. It is so good it is a contender to be one of my favorite games of all time. The game has great replay value, online multilayer, great combat, the fishing mini game is actually okay and it has a interesting but overall funny story that is skipable.  \n\nThis game have great replay value there are many different monsters that can drop up to 4 different items when you defeat them, some are crafting items sometimes you can get some armor, a sword or a shield. Sometimes you need to gather crafting items to craft a new item or you can just find a new hat, sword if you kill enough monster that drop items. You can play the game with 4 players making the game harder the more people that play but the game is still fun to play because you can spend time focusing on collecting all the items in the game. I have almost played the game over 24 hours and I still have not gathered all the items, cards, achievement and even finished the story. You can change the game from easy to hard in the middle of the game making it very fair. The game has replay value because you could replay the game to have a magic user build otr a melee user build or something like that. \n\nThe gameplay is fun there is normal and hard difficulty hard adds a few more monsters to the levels makes them more aggressive, faster and stronger. The magic in the game is fair and not overpowered like it is in other games. You have powerful magic but summoning a monster reduces your energy while your summoned monster or passive spells is out. When you level up your base stats go up and if you want extra challenge you could play the game without leveling up and for a price you can respend your points on new spells and abilities. The game does something crazy it makes it fun and gives you a reason to kill over 1000 slimes. You would want to kill the slimes for exp, money, collectibles, cards, crafting items, and even if you already have these you can sell them for money and give them to other players. And the best part is killing slimes is fun they get smarter the more you kill and if your not careful even easy monsters can hurt you.    \n\nThe story is great it is funny, full of references to games like legend of Zelda other games anime movies etc. The story is interesting enough to watch a few times but thankfully you can skip it if this is your 20th time playing the game. \n\nThe game has fair DLC there is a 5 dollar hat DLC that is honest that if you play 5 dollars you will give the devs more money so if you want to support them you can. There is no cheap DLC that gives players an edge like golden armor swords or unfair things like that. \n\nThe games multiplayer is great and there is little lag for me and you can play arcade, the story, VS with other players and its not like the game needed that because the game is fun just playing by yourself. \n\nSo do I recommend this game YES it has great challenge, it has some of the best replay value I have seen in a story, the gameplay is great  the collectibles are fun and worth getting, the multiplayer have 3 fun modes VS, story and arcade ( you can also play mini games in the story with others) and they are still making the game? It is worth it for sure and when they keep this system add more content, collectibles and things like that this game would be my new favorite game of all time. I really thing you should consider buying this game for a fun game to play buy your self and a fun game to play with friends. the only posible thing that the game could add to make it better would be local multiplayer. the game has good gameplay like castle crashers, replay value and collectables somewhat like MMO games and a short but sweet story.", "timestamp_created": 1462115508, "timestamp_updated": 1462115508, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547227", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22736072": {"recommendationid": "22736072", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150478496", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506314265}, "language": "english", "review": "i love this game it is exactly want i want in a game and i cant wait for more to come out!", "timestamp_created": 1462077444, "timestamp_updated": 1462077444, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458136", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22734187": {"recommendationid": "22734187", "author": {"steamid": "76561198178802730", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1365, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511314617}, "language": "english", "review": "All I need to make this game one of the bast is to have local co-op.", "timestamp_created": 1462066836, "timestamp_updated": 1462066836, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22729909": {"recommendationid": "22729909", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058965194", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 203, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462070455}, "language": "english", "review": "I absolutely LOVE this game.

I did this on purpose so that I wouldn't be distracted by all the fluff in this game.  There is, as you can already see, a very pleasant and deliberate art style.  It's inspired, of course, by the tested and established Zelda franchise.  The gameplay also feels a lot like Zelda.  There are other inspirations from SNES-era RPGs, of course, but this is the most salient to talk about - and I'll explain why.\nWhen I say that this game feels like Zelda, I mean that in that it's both limiting and pleasant.  The walking speed is just about the perfect speed to be neither too fast or too slow - it's just pleasant.  The attack length is neither too much or too little - it's just pleasant.  At the same time, Grindea suffers from the same sort of creative stagnation that Zelda's combat had.  There's about 8 types of swords, 8 types of 2-handed swords, 1 bow to my knowledge (really, devs?).  To be fair, this is about the same level of variance that Link To The Past had in it's weapon variety.  But, if you're expecting a modern pc merging of Zelda swordplay and Diablo lootgrabbing, you will not find it here.  There's plenty of the former, none of the latter.  Even Secret of Mana - which you're undoubtedly going to compare this game to - had a more robust combat system where you had to time weapon swings and charge attacks... AND YOU HAD DIFFERENT WEAPONS BESIDES SWORDS!!\nI want to be clear, though:  I am enjoying this game.  I'm going to be playing it.  It's too early to tell how good the skill tree is - but I can already tell that levelling up is EXTREMELY satisfying and rewarding.  There is huge potential in this game.  I just really hope that the devs can stop being held behind by LoZ:LTTP and just let their imaginations go - or that the fluff and story make this game worth it.", "timestamp_created": 1462032960, "timestamp_updated": 1462033091, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22725387": {"recommendationid": "22725387", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018505090", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1224, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463517000}, "language": "english", "review": "Path of exile and Legend of Zelda had a baby and its called Secrets Of Grindea. 10/10 customization of characters. 10/10 puzzles and gameplay mechanics. all around a great game even i got to the end of the stable version within 9 hours i can say i enjoyed every minute of it including the many many deaths i had during some of the craziest boss fights.", "timestamp_created": 1462031582, "timestamp_updated": 1462031582, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22715955": {"recommendationid": "22715955", "author": {"steamid": "76561198301803883", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 972, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501235097}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u975e\u5e38\u597d\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u8bbe\u5b9a\u554a\u597d\u559c\u6b22", "timestamp_created": 1461989958, "timestamp_updated": 1461989958, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22715926": {"recommendationid": "22715926", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272808734", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1417, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502695113}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5f88\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u5b89\u5229\u5b89\u5229\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1461989755, "timestamp_updated": 1461989755, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22715604": {"recommendationid": "22715604", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119611734", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 3053, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508615752}, "language": "english", "review": "The artstyle is gorgeous, the story is great, and the variety of weapons, and skills is wonderful, this game has everything I love in an RPG and more, those of you on the fence about buying this game please get this game as it's amazing.", "timestamp_created": 1461987626, "timestamp_updated": 1461987626, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22707226": {"recommendationid": "22707226", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055865309", "num_games_owned": 148, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 462, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461945297}, "language": "english", "review": "After downloading the demo and then deciding to buy the early access game, 7 hours later I will say I am pleasantly surprised.

They can vary from a city to a spoopy forest,and they are all fun!\n\n*Combat,mixing skills,making awesome combos,and crafting another weapon to be stronger,REPEAT!\n\n*Pixel art is great!\n\n*The Story. The characters are lovable,and with time you will change your opinion about some,also,there's some plot twists here,funny jokes there,and TONS of sarcasm.\n\n*Cards,or Monster Cards if you like,are rare drops from enemies,if you got a card from a enemy,it will give you a random bonus and a cute artwork from the enemy you killed,which is ALWAYS a plus in my book.\n\n*Soundtrack is good\n\n*Balanced (at least on normal mode),like the Yetis are MADE to tank your attacks,and some other enemies are made to be annoying.\n\n*Easy to connect to MP through Steam and AWSOME controller support.\n\n*THE EASTER EGGS!!!!!! I managed to find a Triforce near the pile of gold in the flashback sequence!!!! :D\n\n*You can replay bosses to get more loot from them,well,everyone but...\n\nCons:\n\n*You can't replay Winter's or the Mt.

Bloom boss fights,but they could have some extra loot and the replay feature anyway :|\n\n*GRINDING,and i'm not a fan of it.It's not just walking in circles to begin a battle,you have to kill ALL enemies in the room to spawn another wave of enemies,although this sistem is great,it's boring to get the action going.\n\n*The crafting system could be improved,like seeing the item kinda faded away,because my friend thought the ''red emmiter matrix'' was a calendar,that's right A CALENDAR. And there's not enough recipies...\n\n*Not even at level 10 (max level of skills) my Frosty Friend could kill a Rabby in 1 hit,and a Rabby is the second enemy in the game,and it has \u2245 120 HP.\n\n*The cards are just TOO rare to make it fun to grind,and it's based around luck too,so just to get a Jumpkin card,I had to stop my playthrough over how boring it was to get a 0,5% of card drop,to try again the other day :|\n\n*The ''character portraits'' (the picture that appears when you talk to a character) are bad,they aren't pixelated,witch isn't that bad for itself,but they look more like a photo that has been glued there,the quality is horrible too.\n\nFinal Veredict:\n\n9/10\n\nIt's a really fun game to play alone or with friends,if you like an ARPG I would recommend buying it.It also has a Talking Bag...\n\n\nDid I say there was a Talking Bag yet??", "timestamp_created": 1461711666, "timestamp_updated": 1462194469, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22652523": {"recommendationid": "22652523", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065867780", "num_games_owned": 765, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 720, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473309840}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome, and slightly challenging game to play with your friends.

Despite its early access status, there is so much polish and attention to detail that, at a glance, it could pass as the finished product. I can tell the devs have put their hearts and souls into this game, and I'll be damned if it isn't paying off.\n\nIf I had to give praise to anything, it would be the skills and perks available. Players aren't locked into classes, so they have complete control over how their character develops and the niche they fill in battle. For instance, one-handed melee skills that deal multiple hits in one use benefit greatly from perks that improve critital hits. Then, tack on a movement speed bonus for charging skills or blocking with your shield, and you've built an acrobat that hits fast and hits hard.\n\nOf course, there are so many other praises I could sing -- the cheeky jabs at RPG tropes, the deliciously roguelike arcade mode, the atmospheric and memorable soundtrack, -- but words can only do it so much justice.

While the mechanics are simple to grasp, there are many unique bosses and mobs that require certain nuances to accomplish.\nThe leveling system works out relatively well. It never feels like an over the top grind (hah) until about halfway through, where it suddenly starts to feel like it takes longer to level based upon the monster EXP.\nPerhaps my only real complaint about the game lies in the skill system. They've set it up so that you get silver and gold spell points, where you spend so many silver points before you may only place gold points to further level up a skill. After spending 17 hours in the game, I've only been able to get one skill all the way up with gold points, as you only receive one point every few levels.\nStill, you can completely customize your hotkeys, and they made it quite easy and intuitive. Though it is early access, they've already thought of many convenience things that other games miss: equipping cosmetic items for free, pets that increase stats, NPCs that have witty responses, etc.\nIt's rare you find an unfinished game that leaves you thinking about it even while you're in the middle of working, exercising, and trying to sleep. I'm only sad it isn't finished! 9.5/10\n\nTL;DR - Buy this game. I'd regret not trying it. Smooth graphics, intuitive gameplay, conveniency in the game, and some light humor!

The enemies are cool n all but they get a bit challenging if you dont grind alot to get lvles and rare drops. the dungeons are fun with puzzles and all. The bosses are fun to play but can be a bit frustrating if you get mad easy. there is not alot of replayability on the story since its the same quests over and over again. The arcade got more replayability but not so much since its really easy to die because you dont get alot of ways to heal yourself and the nurse is a damn ripoff, shes way to expensive to use but i guess that adds to the difficulty. the classes are extreamly unbalanced since 1-handed sword is the only good option if you want to do dmg, the mage needs alot of EP for the tiny amount of dmg the spells are doing since that are the only source of their dmg, they take alot of dmg because of their low armor and doesent do enough dmg for it to be worth putting your points in to. The 2-handed choice is a bit better but still underpowered since the 2-handed weapons only do 10 more dmg than the 1-handed and hits 3 times as slow tho they can hit twice as far as a 1-handed weapon wich is good for a small amount of enemies like a plant or smt. later into the game your sheild becomes to important and it breaks way to easy if you dont get a perfect block. The pets are kinda useless atm you need to fish ALOT if you want to get a tiny bonus from it, for me the pet is just in the way since sometimes i think its an enemy and just hit in the air xD. The items are cute and themebased i dont have anything against them tho the crafting system is pointless aswell in the current state of the game since you need to farm a good amount for the items when you can just get a better item in the next area.\n\ni think i got everything that i wanted, i got nothing against the game its really fun if you got friends to play with and the fact that you become a cute ghost when you die is an awsome addon. i recommend that you try the game if you have at least 1 friend to play with, i look forward to uppdates and buffs to the underpowered classes.\n\nThis game at it current state get a 7/10", "timestamp_created": 1460642809, "timestamp_updated": 1460642809, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22406034": {"recommendationid": "22406034", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034124151", "num_games_owned": 193, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2812, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513050908}, "language": "english", "review": "Secrets of Grindea is a top down adventure game that immediately reminds me of the Legend of Zelda series in it's blend of combat and puzzles. While still an early access game at the time of writing, there is more than enough content to justify the fifteen dollar price tag. With an easy to learn combat system and the lack of distinct classes, combat feels smooth and genuinely fun, as one would hope a game with the term \"grind\" in the title would boast. Likewise, the characters are for the most part interesting, if perhaps not always particularly memorable.\n\nThe characters of Grindea tend to alternate between totally forgettable and completely memorable. Your talking loot bag, appropriately named Bag, your close friend Luke, and your somewhat obnoxious rival Marino all manage to establish themselves with completely memorable characteristics - Bag is very cynical and sarcastic, with what appears to be an mix of disinterest and dislike for all things not labeled Very Rare Loot. Luke, meanwhile, is a hardworking powerhouse of a boy, but isn't particularly bright. Marino is a rich, bratty noble, and while that's not particularly deep as a character, he does a good job of making it memorable. On the other hand, quest giver Quinton, a couple of clearly reoccuring, almost Team Rocket - esque thugs, and even the player character's own father all seem to have virtually no personality. In the interest of fairness, these characters haven't recieved nearly as much screentime as Bag, but the problem is that the charcters I found memorable made themselves memorable from the first meeting, whereas all of these less memorable characters have appeared at least twice and still have yet to make any sort of impact on me.\n\nCombat in Grindea, as I mentioned above, is a very easy concept to grasp, if a little hectic in practice. The Z key is your basic melee attack with whatever is equiped to your weapon slot, X raises your shield, and the A,S,D,F,C, and V keys all bind to the various special attacks and spells you pick up over the course of the game. This means that a solid blend of melee and magical combat is more than plausible, although the effort to make that blend work is probably more than a strictly melee or magical style. That being said, the only character I've made so far is very focused to the ice branch of magic, and so I am unable to comment on how balanced the various skills are as of now. Despite this, it's worth repeating that the combat system itself is very enjoyable, and the more polished parts of the game are an immense pleasure to play.\n\nHowever, it's also worth repeating that this is an early access game, and it began to become extraordinarily obvious when I was coming close to the end of the story mode content simply because the majority of the major fights became seriously unbalanced towards solo players. Perhaps it becomes less of a headache with coplayers in the mix, but one particularly noteworthy boss fight required me to keep putting damage on the boss while at the same time destroying remarkably resilient minions that were spewing poisonous gas across the battlefield. Forget to put enough pressure on the boss, and he will fully heal his minions and render them invulnerable until you go back to putting damage on the boss himself. As a solo player, the task was almost too much for me to handle, and I was only able to scrape by thanks to the points I'd put into my summonable snow golem. I don't take issue with the idea behind the boss fight, but it's more than evident that the devs have yet to find an appropriate balance that challenges a group of playeres and still remains manageable for solo players.\n\nThat fight notwithstanding, coming closer to the end of story mode also saw a lot of interesting puzzles and challenges spring forth. There's a dungeon in which the changing of the seasons is required to open up different paths to progress, and there's a sequence closer to the end of the existing content in which a teleportation power from earlier is used to cross elaborate labrynths of cannons, using mirrors and timed launches to get across. While difficult, I found myself enjoying the sequence, and look forward to seeing how the puzzles might further develop with the release of future content.\n\nAll in all, Grindea is a fun game that is definitely worth the price, despite it's glaring flaws, and it shows a lot of potential in where it can go from here. While not yet finished, it's a very enjoyable product and looks to be a fantastic game in the making.", "timestamp_created": 1460610085, "timestamp_updated": 1460610085, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22403785": {"recommendationid": "22403785", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138242473", "num_games_owned": 209, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1323, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468823431}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm very excited to see more of this game!

Above average story, fun, engaging script, and likable character tropes.  The visual style lends itself well to all aspects of the game.\n\nHowever, this is a game where combat is the bulk of play; in its current state combat is just a little too clunky for my liking to give this game a solid recommendation.  That being said, much of player control is surprisingly tight and responsive.  The problem is that there are too many zerg-rush rooms to let skillful control shine.  Anemic character reach is punctuated by punishing post-swing recovery, and the mobs of enemies ensure that, whether you hit your target or not, another enemy will likely be shooting you in the back during your recovery frames.  Shield-block input seems sluggish deciding between whether you told the character to strafe with the shield up or to change direction to block the sword about to slash your back open.

As in, so amazing, that I have to write a review. Anyway, this review will have minor spoilers. I try to avoid them as much as I can, but there will still be spoilers.\n\nYOU HAVE BEEN WARNED\n\nAlso, this review will only talk about story mode, not arcade. There's a TL;DR at the bottom.\n\n[u] STORY [/u]\n\nSo, the game starts out with you waking up for your Collector's Exam. You are then explained to by your father that you have to get ready to be a Collector, as they are the defenders of humankind and collectors of loot.\n\nOh by the way, you are given a sarcastic talking bag who is going to be your companion for the whole game.\n\nSo, I'm going to try and avoid spoilers as much as possible, so I won't go into the story much further.\n\nThe story is really good. It's not a game where you just decide to become an adventurer and drop everything, but there are actually a group of adventurers called Collectors, and you're training to become one.\n\nYou then go through a bunch of challenges (after running into a boss I won't spoil) that teach you the basic mechanics of the game.\n\nYou are then faced with a GIGA SLIME, which is basically just a giant slime. After defeating it, it explodes and dies, but summons one last slime. You run up to it and kill it, and then BOOM! YOU GOT A TRADING CARD! I'll explain what those do later in the guide, but they're basically just powerful buffs. The announcer gets a hilarious expression and goes crazy saying 'They got a card! That hasn't happened in XXX years!' I don't know exactly what they said, but it was somewhere along those lines.\n\n[u] GRINDING/COLLECTIBLES [/u]\n\nIf you haven't already figured it out from the title, this game has grinding. And I'll be the first to say, I [b] hate [/b] grinding. I've dropped tons of games just because you have to grind. But this game does it [i] amazingly. [/i] \n\nYou feel like you are all powerful when you're grinding. You kill and kill and kill hoping to get that one drop you need, or a card. 'What's a card?', you ask again. Well, I guess I'll go into cards now.\n\nCards are an extremely rare drop from almost every enemy in the game, that gives you a permenant buff. The Frostling Rogue lets you have a chance to steal gold when you hit enemies, the boar gives you an attack speed boost, and so on. That's really the main focus of grinding, as you'll probably get enough items to craft that sword/armor you really want along the way.\n\nAlso, there's no healing items. This might seem bad, but it's actually really good. The game would be way too easy with them, and it adds a whole new level of strategy. You don't realize it, but in most games we're a bit careless because we can heal. I didn't even realize until I died about twenty times trying to defeat a boss.\n\n[u] SOUNDTRACK/GRAPHICS [/u]\n\nIt's beautiful. The music goes so well with wherever you are. I'm speechless.\n\nThe 8-bit graphics are amazing too. Somehow, the devs made every motion in the game extremely smooth.\n\n[u] DIFFICULTY [/u]\n\nI'm just starting my hard run, so I can't say muchy about that, but on Normal it has a very good difficulty curve. If you don't grind too heavily, then you'll be just powerful enough to beat all the bosses. \n\nIt also does a very good job of surprising you with the difficulty of the bosses. You could be plowing through enemies, thinking that the boss would be super easy, seeing as the enemies for that zone are. You walk into the room and BOOM! You just died 20 seconds in! Remember that talking bag I mentioned earlier? He gives you tips on how to do better. Some of them are just crappy ones like 'Watch for a pattern!' but others are really good.\n\nTL;DR GO BUY IT ALREADY!\n\n[u] OVERALL RATING [/u]\n\nGraphics: 10/10\nSoundtrack: 10/10\nStory: 8.5/10\nDifficulty Curve: 9.5/10\nGrinding: 1/1\nHumor: 9.75/10\n\nBet I got ya with that grinding rating huh?", "timestamp_created": 1459288207, "timestamp_updated": 1459288302, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22124007": {"recommendationid": "22124007", "author": {"steamid": "76561198280132966", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468416474}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\u4f11\u95f2RPG  \u6bd4\u8f83\u6709\u8da3 \u6e38\u620f\u6027  \u591a\u6837\u6027\u90fd\u8fd8\u4e0d\u9519   \u603b\u4f538.5\u5206", "timestamp_created": 1459259267, "timestamp_updated": 1459262790, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22123085": {"recommendationid": "22123085", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997031695", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509110084}, "language": "koreana", "review": "2D\ub85c \ucd9c\uc2dc\ud588\ub358 \uc824\ub2e4\uc758 \uc804\uc124\uc774 \uc0dd\uac01\ub098\ub294 \uac8c\uc784\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4\n\uc7ac\ubc0c\ub294\ub370 \ud55c\uad6d\uc720\uc800\uac00 \uc801\uc740\uac8c \uc880 \uc544\uc27d\ub124\uc694\n\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4\uac00 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ub418\uc9c0\uc54a\uc73c\ub2c8 \uc5b4\uca54 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc9c0\ub9cc...\n\uc2a4\ud300 \uce5c\uad6c\ub4f1\ub85d\uc774 \ub418\uc5b4\uc57c\ub9cc \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uac00 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc800\ub294 \uc624\ub298\ub3c4 \ud63c\uc790...\n\uae30\uc220\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub3c4\uc640\uc904 \uc0ac\ub78c\ub9cc \uc788\uc73c\uba74 \uc9c1\uc811 \ubc88\uc5ed\uc774\ub77c\ub3c4 \uc2dc\ub3c4\ud574\ubcf4\uace0\uc2f6\uc740 \ub9c8\uc74c\uc774\ub124\uc694", "timestamp_created": 1459255751, "timestamp_updated": 1459255751, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507317", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22117529": {"recommendationid": "22117529", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023006605", "num_games_owned": 303, "num_reviews": 76, "playtime_forever": 1684, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460872796}, "language": "english", "review": "If you enjoyed Secret of Mana this game is for you.

Fix your combat skills.  As smooth as the movement is, the skills feel like you have to touch the enemy to land half of them.  Also: in multiplayer health orbs not only are actually hard to pickup due to the 1 mm hit detection, but they arent shared with the team.  thumbs up on boss fights though.  for instance, in the first dungeon I really enjoy how you presented them.  even if your gear is such dogsh*t that if you get hit a few times you get dropped.  button mashing won them... not skill placement", "timestamp_created": 1459057667, "timestamp_updated": 1459057667, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.425717", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22072628": {"recommendationid": "22072628", "author": {"steamid": "76561198185263207", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1479, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512066482}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a good game but could use health potions so you don't repeatedly teleport to Evergrind or leave Boss Fightsso you don't have to restart them!", "timestamp_created": 1459029709, "timestamp_updated": 1459029709, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22071755": {"recommendationid": "22071755", "author": {"steamid": "76561198285619651", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2808, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496628519}, "language": "english", "review": "If you love easter eggs, definitley a game for you *^-^*", "timestamp_created": 1459026433, "timestamp_updated": 1459026433, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22067954": {"recommendationid": "22067954", "author": {"steamid": "76561198290729866", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 651, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498829750}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5f88\u4e0d\u9519\u7684RPG\u6e38\u620f\u3002\u4e0d\u7ba1\u662f\u7ec6\u8282\u8fd8\u662f\u5267\u60c5\u90fd\u53ef\u5708\u53ef\u70b9\u3002RPG\u4e2d\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u6280\u80fd\u4e5f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5f88\u597d\u6cd5\u672f\u7269\u7406\u76f8\u8f85\u76f8\u6210\u3002\u9053\u5177\u7684\u5408\u6210\u548c\u5361\u7247\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e5f\u8ba9\u6e38\u620f\u5237\u602a\u7ec3\u7ea7\u53d8\u5f97\u6709\u4e86\u610f\u4e49\u3002\n\u95ee\u9898\u53ea\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\uff0c\u5c31\u662f\u66f4\u65b0\u592a\u6162\u4e86\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u4ece0.6\u7684\u7248\u672c\u53f7\u6765\u770b\u6e38\u620f\u4e5f\u505a\u5230\u4e86\u4e2d\u540e\u671f\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u80fd\u5c3d\u65e9\u505a\u5b8c\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1459013479, "timestamp_updated": 1459013479, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22062960": {"recommendationid": "22062960", "author": {"steamid": "76561198263781331", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 197, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500724704}, "language": "english", "review": "Similar to pokemon, but sightly more challenging.", "timestamp_created": 1458997629, "timestamp_updated": 1458997629, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471698", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22055424": {"recommendationid": "22055424", "author": {"steamid": "76561198196051987", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1628, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497654341}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best RPG Co-op games I've ever played wth my boyfriend <3<3 Can't wait for more content <3<3", "timestamp_created": 1458961718, "timestamp_updated": 1458961718, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22054247": {"recommendationid": "22054247", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105251225", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 859, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459759879}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun little gem.

Especially good that there nothing like healing potions, life regeneration or life steal. Meaning: The player needs to use the shield and evade enemy\u2019s attacks probably in order to master the game\u2026 at least at the difficulty \u201chard\u201d it is mandatory.\n\nFor me, the complexity of the card- and the pet-system could be increased to give the player more flexibility to customize the character for the different kind of builds. Here some rough ideas for inspirations for the Story Mode:\n\nCard System:\n-\tThe Player is able to fight Cards more than one time. Cards are categorized in 3 different type of cards: Melee Atk, Magic Atk, Def\n-\tThe player needs to equip these cards in order to get the bonuses in a new interface\n-\tThe interface consists out of 5 columns with each 3 rows. In these columns the player can put the cards which he already has found. \n-\tThe combination of the cards in one column will result in some kind of a bonus. For Example if the player combines three \u201cmelee atk\u201d-cards in one column, the benefits of the cards will be multiplied by the factor XX. This is only one example. The combination of 3 different types of cards should also bring an interesting bonus, for example: Increased Damage for a special Skill or something.\n\nPet System:\n-\tDifferent pets could have different kind of base stats. Depending on the characters build he will use different kind of pets. Or for example: For the pet \u201cGift\u201d it takes less needed points to increase the \u201ccritical strike\u201d-value (Luck) but instead more points to increase the life bonus.\n-\tPet Transformation:  Assumption: Pets can be caught more than once. On Level 10 you can combine to Pets by a percentage of XX. If the transformation succeeds the new transformed pet will be stronger than before. \n-\tEqual to the Elite and non-elite enemies, pets can be caught as elite-version. This will be much harder (mini-game) but the base stats of the pet are higher than normal and the bonus by leveling up the pat is increased.\n\nThat\u2019s it for the rough ideas. I am sure you had some of these ideas already on your own. If some of the mechanism could be included in the game the complexity and therefore the playtime for each player will increase because especially the hardcore gamer will try to find out the best combination between builds, pets and cards \uf04a\n\nI am looking forward to see and experience you upcoming work.\nGreat job so far!\n\nBest Regards\nInch\n", "timestamp_created": 1458721944, "timestamp_updated": 1458721944, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21997997": {"recommendationid": "21997997", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272116720", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1311, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459031393}, "language": "spanish", "review": "es muy bueno el juego, quien me agrega para poder jugar  :D", "timestamp_created": 1458721172, "timestamp_updated": 1458721172, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21996805": {"recommendationid": "21996805", "author": {"steamid": "76561198249930874", "num_games_owned": 213, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 781, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497696960}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6e38\u620f\u5236\u4f5c\u633a\u7cbe\u7f8e\u7684\u3002\u7b80\u76f4\u662fRPG\u7cfb\u5217\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u7cbe\u54c1\uff0c\u552f\u4e00\u53ef\u60dc\u7684\u662f\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\u6a21\u5f0f\u5927\u6982\u53ea\u66f4\u65b0\u5230\u4e8650%\u5de6\u53f3\uff0c\u5165\u624b6\u5c0f\u65f6\u5c31\u628a\u6700\u9ad8\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\u6a21\u5f0f\u901a\u5173\u4e86\uff0c\u8fd8\u73a9\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7248\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u611f\u89c9\u4f5c\u8005\u8fd8\u662f\u5f88\u7528\u5fc3\u7684\u53bb\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6bcf\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u5361\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u8054\u673a\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u611f\u89c9\u4e0d\u8054\u673a\u73a9\u8d77\u6765\u4f9d\u7136\u6ca1\u6709\u538b\u529b\u554a\u3002\u5c31\u662f\u5e0c\u671b\u4f5c\u8005\u5feb\u70b9\u628a\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u66f4\u65b0\u5b8c\u5584\u597d\uff0c\u6bd5\u7adf\u50cf\u8fd9\u6837\u6b63\u7edf\u7684RPG\u6e38\u620f\u53ef\u662f\u4e0d\u592a\u591a\u4e86\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1458714963, "timestamp_updated": 1458714963, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21993857": {"recommendationid": "21993857", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099244252", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 837, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504765791}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u975e\u5e38\u7ec6\u81f4,\u53ef\u60dc\u8fd8\u6ca1\u5f00\u53d1\u5b8c,\u5e0c\u671b\u80fd\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\u5feb\u70b9\u66f4\u65b0", "timestamp_created": 1458698486, "timestamp_updated": 1458698486, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21991836": {"recommendationid": "21991836", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970290399", "num_games_owned": 332, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1179, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504778709}, "language": "english", "review": "Classic little gem.

fine,but when you get used to it, it becomes a bit easy, there is a lot of things to do, like side-quests,puzzles,boss and mob farm for loots to complete your journal also some craftings  and in the end, the Arcade-mode,which it's pretty challenging,\nSaber Light sound??10/10\nFighting mobs in some spots is really nice cuz they start spawning  more and more, but boss fights is the real deal, it's awesome and challenging,hope they add like hundreds of bosses in upcoming updates.\nand if you like legend of zelda, this is a must have for you!\n", "timestamp_created": 1458281389,

"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458684809}, "language": "english", "review": "For some odd reason, the game reminds me a lot of Paper Mario for the N64. I'm not exactly sure why... there's hardly any similarities.\n\nI tried the demo of this game (lead up to the arena fight), and it had me sold. I was hesitant to buy it at the time, on sale, or was released... the formar took over (and I'm glad, worth every $ and then some). This game just... pulls me in and refuses to let go. I have to pry myself away from the game! (or till I feel my bladder being full to the brim...)\n\nI picked hard difficulty as normal felt... easy for me... I have completely underestimated hard difficulty than I usually do for RPG games! At first I thought the game was just a collection of popular and maybe hardly used RPG tropes... well I'm not completely wrong. The story in the game is... interesting to say the least (up to what I reached)... at least I think there's a story? Somewhere? Maybe I overlooked it half way...\n\nThe game does encourage AND reward you for grinding/farming. I've noticed several times the spawn rate increases if it registers you grinding/farming, unlike other RPGs the spawn rate will decrease and/or would spawn mobs elsewhere instead of the spot you're on. (Looking at you MMORPG's... especially the F2P ones...) For some reason... grinding/farming isn't so trivial or boring than other games. Probably because I'm not seeing high leveled players showing me up one-hitting everything while I'm struggling (Always saw that as bad form) or the struggle isn't worth it.\n\nSome of the mobs I feel move a bit too fast for hard mode. Strong, more HP, and additional moves I understand but... some just don't pause at all. Rather have the mobs pause less than in Normal than not pausing at all. Be nice if mobs had a weakness and resistance. Having a hard time just trying to kill them with no disadvantages.\n\nThe boss fights... either the bosses need a little tweaking, the leveling system needs bit of a fix, and/or the skills need to be reworked. There's been a few boss fights that nearly made me just go to normal difficulty ([spoiler]I had to temporary for the sentry mini-boss due to the stupid orbs![/spoiler]) Either too much is going on for me to register what's happening, I'm unable to get strong enough to properly face this boss/foe, and/or the skills I have are weak than they should be.\n\nI've nearly crafted every item on the current list... on bit of a card hunt now. See cards as a reward for grinding/farming excessively as they give you benefits whether to your stats or purchases (that I've seen so far). Wish leveling actually increased your stats than just give you points to spend... I shouldn't feel so weak than I should be for (current) end-game bosses ([spoiler]toward Winter, Hydras, Toy Machine, etc.[/spoiler]). Granted it's hard, but shouldn't be dark-souls difficult! (That's what it felt like most of the time after the numerous times of being frustrated at bosses to the point of nearly tossing my laptop out the one story window!!!)\n\nPick this up at its price of $15. Shouldn't wait for a sale, unless you're low on cash, to enjoy this. If you rather play a finished product than in development, then you'll be waiting for quite some time. Half of the story content is in the stable beta right now.\n\nI'll most likely either update or completely rewrite this review when the game is finished. I think I'll wait till this game is finished before I continue any further in the story though.\n\nUpdate: Tried a bit of Arcade Mode... it's not very forgiving that it discourages me. Reminds me of Rogue Legacy but harsher...\n\n-----\n\nCheck out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/BPUGL]BluePaw's Underrated Games List[/url]\nJoin and/or follow if you wish.", "timestamp_created": 1458217485, "timestamp_updated": 1482754706, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549651", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21882612": {"recommendationid": "21882612", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041667942", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2442, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509002352}, "language": "english", "review": "I haven't played for very long, but every part of what I've played is AMAZING.

Finding new pets seemed neat at first until we realized they all start at the same stats, so changing pets just sets you backwards.\n- Love the hats and the masks, wish you could see the different shoes on your character. \n- Fun story :)\n- The open skill system with added effects at later levels.\n- Love the music, very nostalgic. \n- The card collecting adding stats was a GREAT way to make a seeminly simple mechanic actually worth using. \n\nCons:\n\n- Some of the boss battles feel cheap, the hydra comes to mind as they will wait to attack the only time you have to attack the one that's on the ground, so you just end up running around in circles with your thumb up your rear. \n- Some boss fights have attack timings that rely more on lucky character placement as you can't react fast enough to block it or avoid it. They are still fun, but we def. ended up fighting Winter like 5 times :p. \n- \n\n- More recipes, more gear, more skills, just need more content. \n\nOverall, both my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed what this game had to offer so far, and were glad to support the developers and look forward to future updates. \n\nP.S.

(I still havent managed to catch either the bee or the present.)\n\n(2) In arcade mode health should be returned automaticly upon lvl up and this effect should be reduced depending on how many people are in your game. IE: solo = 75% per lvl, 2 people 50% and so on. This would make arcade mode much more playable in singleplayer.\n\n(3) Would love to see more items added next update. My frontline char has over 25000 gold because there is nothing for her to buy anymore. I feel uneasy about saying this but I would gladly wait patiently for more story if it ment we got new items to buy/find/craft every second update or so.\n\n(4) My last and perhaps pettiest of gripes is that arcade mode is too damn hard. Ive spent half of these 20 hours in arcade mode and ive never made it past the 6th floor. Perhaps it was designed to be played in co op mode but seeing as none of my friends own this game and there are no dedicated servers for multiplayer Im kinda shit out of luck. Perhaps if my second gripe is implimented this would become much less of a problem but as it stands arcade mode is a bust for me. \n\nAnd thats about it.

If you just want to enjoy the story and explore the world, you can advance fairly quickly through the story. Boss battles are often very tough if you're underleveled but with a correct strategy, they are very beatable without power grinding. You unlock new areas to explore by advancing the story and you are free to roam the areas you've unlocked. The enemies are visible on the map and they are all avoidable.\n\n[h1]A 2D SANDBOX WITH TON OF STUFF TO DO[/h1]\nFor the completionists, there is a ton of optional things to do. There's fishing, potion-making, side-quests, secrets, puzzles, pet catching, pet leveling, arena-battles, crafting and a ton of mob drops that are hard to get. I myself have already spend at least 2 times more than my Steam play-time shows in this game, doing all the optional stuff. That was over a year ago when there wasn't this much new content in it yet. \n\nThe leveling system is very nice since you get points to spend on skills as you please. There is a good amount of different skills to choose from and all of them have strategic value. There is also a lot of different equipment which you can buy, craft or get as a drop from the monsters.\n\n[h1]YOU DON'T PLAY POKEMON-GAMES FOR THEIR STORY[/h1]\nThe story isn't awful either. It's not the focus of the game nor the main reason to buy the game. It has enough meat in it to keep you motivated to go further and to give some context to your adventure but don't expect it to move you to tears or grab you emotionally. Think Pokemon games and their story and you'll know what level of story-telling to expect.\n\nAs a big fan of stories and powerful story-telling in games, I would've wanted a more compelling story-telling personally but because of the strong gameplay, the lack of PSX-era Final Fantasy-esque story telling doesn't bother me much at all.\n\n[h1]TOO LONG, DIDN'T READ[/h1]\nAll in all, this has been my #1 most anticipated indie-game since 2013, when I bought the pre-order beta. SoG is a a good balance of excellent gameplay, exploration and story.

I'm on the fence about this one. If steam offered a \"maybe\" option, I'd pick that.  It was number one on my wishlist for a long time. A LONG TIME. Having a baby this summer, so prob not gonna be able to play much games when that happens, plus the development is taking centuries on this one, so I figured I might as well enjoy what I can out of this game now since it might not happen later.\n\n\n\nThe Good: The game sings of polish and love. What is done is fantastic. It looks simply amazing and you can tell there has been a lot of talent and devotion put into what is playable. The gameplay is freaking awesome. So much diversity, so many options for builds. You can go pure range caster, you can go one handed dps build, or put points into heaving hitting two handed skills that'll take a quarter of a bosses hp down in one well timed hit. There's a lot of choice. And you can also respec at a hefty in game currency price for those who like that option. The gameplay is a 10/10. Really ace. \n\nMost pickups are shown aesthetically on your character. The hats (which is arguably the most viewable part of your character over boots and armor since your head is huge) are viewable, while the chest pieces and boots are not. It's basically just headwear and weapons. You also have the option to have \"style items\" which are items that always show regardless of what you have equipped. Like the witch hat look? Equip it in style, and put a better stat hat to boost you. \n\nReplayability: It's definitely there. I'll likely replay the story mode several times at least, just to try different builds. One handed, two handed, caster, etc. It'll be fun. \n\n\n\nThe Not Nearly As Good: For having been in development for many years, really, like five years, I was both surprised and disappointed at the scarcity of actual content. There are only a handful of quests. There is a laughable amount of items. For example, I went with a two hand warrior build my first playthough, and I counted five weapons. FIVE. I have all of them. And they all have the same attack animation. A swing arc in front. I was kind of picturing a little more... There are only a couple of areas in the game right now. I don't know how many more are planned but the game felt about half done progression wise to me. To give you an idea, you can fight your way across the entire map in about 15-20 minutes. \n\nThe temples are cool, but they're short! The first took me maybe 30 minutes. The second, took about 30-40. And that's it. There's two temples. I looked for side quests of which there are many, but they're short too.  For how long the temples are, I was expecting ten of them. Nope. I think story mode took me about five hours in total and I got 72% on completion. Some of that was spent mindlessly farming for combat's sake and some more of that was spent in the arena doing the two challenges over and over to get them perfect.\n\nArcade mode is another beast. I want to love it, but it honestly frustrates the shit out of me. It seems way unbalanced. It's basically a roguelite within the game. You start at level 0 and fight through small arena level maps called floors, to a boss, onto the next floor. And it's hard as balls. Hence the frustration. Take damage 3-4 times and your dead. There are NO HEALTH DROPS when fighting. You get a measly health orb when you beat the boss and progress onto the next floor, but honestly, I think the whole arcade mode just needs rebalancing, or a freaking difficulty mode option. Make it so enemies do less damage, or drop health orbs, whatever. I've played it for several hours and only gotten to floor 3 like twice. Out of what, 12? I'm frustrated when I play arcade mode. \n\nNot to mention the slow as turtle progression system associated with arcade mode. You get \"essence\" which you can spend to unlock perks to start arcade mode. For example you can buy the perk which unlocks a small metal sword to boost damage from 25 at start to 35. Great. Except it takes FOREVER to get the essence. They're not guaranteed drops and I maybe get one every 3-4 runs of arcade mode. And it costs ten to unlock the lowest perks? Then fifty for a second perk slot (so all your perk unlocks are useless because you can only bring one perk at a time until you unlock another perk slot) and 150 for the third and final. Good crap. This could be fixed by lowering perk costs, or guaranteeing drops based on point scores, but as of now, I could put 100 hours into the arcade mode alone before I unlocked another perk slot. Frustrating. \n\n\n\nOverall: Like I said in the beginning, I'm really torn. I absolutely adore the combat and look of this game. It's amazing. I just wish there was more of it. It really only wet my whistle. I am left wanting. The arcade mode? I want to like it, but am left.... not liking it due to the current (albeit fixable) issues I see in it. I'll rate this up, but I really recommend just waiting for release... in 2020. Then you can play the entire game at once.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1455312055, "timestamp_updated": 1455312055, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.755408", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21145059": {"recommendationid": "21145059", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997429264", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1504, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514556295}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow.

If you like intense combat that actually requires you to stay on your toes at all time, I really recommend this game. Even though it is an early access game, and that a lot (if not the majority of EA games) just aren't worth it, trust me on this one, this one really is.\n\nPros:\n- Even though it's an ea game theres at least 5-10 hours of gameplay in the story mode so far.\n- Beautiful artwork.\n- Engaging combat system, with a variety of classes/skills that will make you wanna play it for a second time, just to test them out.\n- The story itself is fairly interesting and you'll most likely have a good laugh every now and then.\n- A big variety in the monsters and bosses, most of them function in different ways, making the game more interesting and not repetitive. \n- You can play with up to 4 friends, choosing whichever character you've saved. (There's I believe, 9 save slots atm)\n- Once you've played through whats been released in the story mode, you can just jump over to the arcade mode, which is sort of like a rougelike mode, which is super fun and addictive.\n- There is also a crafting system where you can craft weapons and armors.\n- There's a pet system, as for now it is pretty useless, but it is fairly fun to play around with.\n\nCons: \n- It's an unfinished game, you will get to the point where there is no more content story wise and at that point you will be crying, begging for more.\n- I don't know if it's meant to be, but the crafting system is pretty useless in the arcade mode, since you never get enough materials to actually craft anything.\n- There's not that huge of a variety in items. There's a few for each class and so on, but after a few playthroughs the items will be a bit repetetive.\n\nOverall, if you like rpg style games, killing monsters, completing quests, fighting epic boss battles and taming crazy rabbits, then this game is definitely for you.

So it may either be a very skillful game or a very slow one as you agro each enemy 1 by 1 or avoid/block multiple attacks repeatedly. Its a very hard game if you do not think about your tactics and just mindlessly wail on enemies.  \n\nBut regardless, I highly recommend playing with a controller, as the game fully supports it and is much easier to work with compared to the keyboard and mouse. There is no voice acting from what I can see however the story is enthralling and very well written. Its well worth the read, so if you can, make sure to read the dialogue.\n\nWhoever wrote the scripts, make a book. I'll pay to proof read it no matter how many rewrites you do!

I bought the game, already half knowing what to expect, and my idea that this game was a good one was reaffirmed by the update. It's a good game, with puns and lines that make you kind of cringe in the way of, \"Oh why would you say that? That's just...no, just...no.\" The gameplay is good too, with a unique playstyle that I haven't heard of before (though, that's not saying much), and a nice little challenge that you could spend some spare time doing when you are looking for a nice adventure. The bosses are various, and, in some cases (*cough* Winter *cough*cough*), the bosses take quite a few lives and not a little amount of patience. The characters are unique and have a little bit of background, and if you are expecting some dark twist, then you will be disappointed. Some of the advanced mechanics are a little troublesome, but they come with time and practice. You will also eventually have to learn how to cluster enemies or just plain run away to get breathing space, as enemies are prone to try to trap you, or just plain overwhelm you. However, in the end, it's a game in progress, like so many great things once started as, and has started off beautifully, and will hopefully grow and flourish into something worthy of praise and awe like so many games out there, like Undertale, or Minecraft, to name a few. If a few of you do not match my opinions, that is fine, everyone is entitled.

It also brings a lot more creation to you for your character, allowing you to customise your appearance and choose the way you level your abilities/skills (one of the main reasons I love RPGs). Not to mention that you can play with 3 other people, who make their own unique characters too. My brother and I bought this game yesterday and have had a blast playing it together, which was quite helpful as some of the boss fights would be a real pain by myself; farming for crafting materials too.\n\nOf coarse it is still in the beta and there are a few paths that are blocked off as the next map has literally not been added to the game yet, but my concern at this point, is worry for how big this game will be; My brother and I haven't played that long (though it has been a few hours) and it appears that we are about halfway through the story. You can have up to nine characters, but there isn't a whole lot you can do different between plays (you can make it more difficault and play alone for a real challenge or try a different build for your character) and I fear I may get board once I've finished the game once or twice, but thats just me; others might like shorter games.\n\nHaving said that, I have no idea what the creators plan and what plot twist there could be, which could have this game spiralling much deeper and longer than it appears; my hope is for a game at least as long as the games I mentioned above. It is in beta after all, and so far I love this game.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1453772835, "timestamp_updated": 1453772835, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20752596": {"recommendationid": "20752596", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060624218", "num_games_owned": 259, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 358, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1438004980}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u30ab\u30b8\u30e5\u30a2\u30eb\u306a\u898b\u305f\u76ee\u306b\u53cd\u3057\u3066\u30a2\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306f\u610f\u5916\u3068\u30b7\u30d3\u30a2\n\u96e3\u6613\u5ea6\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u306f\u30dc\u30b9\u304c\u305f\u307e\u3052\u308b\u304f\u3089\u3044\u5f37\u3044\u3067\u3059\u3002\n\n\u305d\u308c\u306f\u3055\u3066\u304a\u304d\u3001\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc\u306f\u306a\u3093\u3068\u306a\u304f\u3067\u9032\u3081\u3089\u308c\u308b\u8907\u96d1\u3055\u3067\u3001\n\u82f1\u8a9e\u306f\u5206\u304b\u3089\u306a\u304f\u3066\u3082\u81ea\u5206\u306f\u306a\u3093\u3068\u304b\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\n\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\u6027\u304c\u305d\u3053\u305d\u3053\u3042\u308a\u3001\u88c5\u5099\u3067\u898b\u305f\u76ee\u3082\u5909\u308f\u308a\u3001\n\u7d20\u6750\u3092\u96c6\u3081\u3066\u3001\u81ea\u5206\u306e\u30b9\u30ad\u30eb\u69cb\u6210\u306b\u5408\u3063\u305f\u88c5\u5099\u3092\u4f5c\u3063\u3066\u3044\u304f\u306e\u3082\u306a\u304b\u306a\u304b\u9762\u767d\u3044\u3067\u3059\n\u632f\u308a\u306a\u304a\u3057\u306f\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3082\u306e\u306e\u30b9\u30ad\u30eb\u306f\u614e\u91cd\u306b\u53d6\u3063\u305f\u307b\u3046\u304c\u826f\u3044\u3067\u3059\uff08\u7d4c\u9a13\u8ac7\uff09\n\n\u307e\u305f\u3001\n\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u5185\u306e\u52d5\u304f\u30c9\u30c3\u30c8\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u304b\u3089\u306f\u8003\u3048\u3089\u308c\u306a\u3044\u304f\u3089\u3044\u30d0\u30bf\u81ed\u3044NPC\u3068\u306e\u4f1a\u8a71\u7a93\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u3082\n\u306a\u304b\u306a\u304b\u4e59\u306a\u3082\u306e\u3067\u3001NPC\u3068\u8a71\u3059\u305f\u3073\u306b\u300c\u3075\u3075\u3063\u300d\u3068\u7b11\u9854\u306b\u306a\u308c\u308b\u826f\u3055\u3068\u3082\u8a00\u3048\u307e\u3059\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1453749183, "timestamp_updated": 1453749183, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502172", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20751989": {"recommendationid": "20751989", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061446008", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2639, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483835537}, "language": "english", "review": "Stop reading this review and buy the game!", "timestamp_created": 1453746929, "timestamp_updated": 1453746929, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20750803": {"recommendationid": "20750803", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092659596", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 427, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454860791}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10.\ngot characters from Robin Hood and \"I Mummidalen\" (Norwegian lads will get it).\nbetter than fnaf world\naddictive as fk.\nliterally help meh dudes.\n\nHISSSSS", "timestamp_created": 1453742822, "timestamp_updated": 1453742822, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20749969": {"recommendationid": "20749969", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062727354", "num_games_owned": 236, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1601, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 741, "last_played": 1515545856}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is supa HOT jus like PEPSI!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1453739999, "timestamp_updated": 1453739999, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20741646": {"recommendationid": "20741646", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995752227", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1440, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454907036}, "language": "english", "review": "Secrets of Grindea looks and plays exactly how you expect.

I love how I can use different attacks as well as switch weapons as fast (though I would love if i could just toggle weapons with the same button,I play with a CONTROLLER,I haven't tried keyboard because I've known epic failure).Character customization is great and vanity items thankfully exist, not that i don't like the carrot sword but i'd rather have a wooden one. Surprisingly but still great and I love it, no classes like warrior, sage, mage, shaman,etc. just a free-lancer with all kinds of abilities, so make the most of it and become a unique class of your own. I'm not much of a 'craft' person but I have to admit it will take you far in the game, though I think we need more craft-able objects, I don't think you'll do ALL of them, but the material is fairly easy to procure given your 'grind'ing in the whole game. Side activities are plenty and good too( i still grinded more than doing them but they are definitely not boring, its a time to time thing).\n\nIf you love the 90s versions of zelda and sword of mana. You will definitely like it. Although it's not completed yet Arcade mode is still something to die for literally in-game, something you can't miss, the story mode so far makes me feel like the updates are not enough, I went through the story but just couldn't get enough of it. I'll probably start from scratch and grind my way through the story again.I would definitely consider buying story-based dlc if ever put out in the market.\n\nGameplay and features is all that matters to me and I got the best of both of it without the need or urge to have to m0d it like in more popular games,same genres (it's a compliment).\n\n I highly recommend it, don't download demo, buy the game, like I said, if you love zelda or sword of mana you won't regret it.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1453566754, "timestamp_updated": 1453566754, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20700315": {"recommendationid": "20700315", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997894373", "num_games_owned": 410, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 812, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469286611}, "language": "french", "review": "A zelda-like/secret of mana-like with coop, plus a rogulike mode ? 100 times yes !\n\nChallenging, with a nice combat system, cool levelling, in a word: awesome.\n\nCan't wait for the final release.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1453554345, "timestamp_updated": 1453554345, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20681156": {"recommendationid": "20681156", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980251131", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1361, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506094316}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome Game!", "timestamp_created": 1453479298, "timestamp_updated": 1453479298, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20679831": {"recommendationid": "20679831", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973418684", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 393, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508787690}, "language": "english", "review": "An epic classic RPG with attention to details in a world dominated by mass-produced games like e.g. the witcher, fallout.

My friend's ice summon was named Baby Meta/ Baby Metaknight <3, and the cloud summon I use is named Malo. It seems my friend though has the heart of the cards as she finds them all leaving me in the dust. We'll play this game till we get 100% for everyone. Thank you so much for your hard work. You've made two best friends so happy.", "timestamp_created": 1453454416, "timestamp_updated": 1453454416, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 55, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.764663", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20660485": {"recommendationid": "20660485", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132207949", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5632, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502228644}, "language": "english", "review": "i like pie", "timestamp_created": 1453385929, "timestamp_updated": 1453385929, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20654546": {"recommendationid": "20654546", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049983563", "num_games_owned": 329, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2862, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487433291}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]This game is excellent but suffers some problems.[/b]\n\nSecrets of Grindea is a Zelda style action RPG with levelling.\n\nEdit: Originally I had a paragraph here stating that the game is way too hard, but then I learned that I set the game to \"hard\" when I started - so to complain about that would be dumb :P. The next paragraph still stands though, regarding some of the hard parts of the game.\n\nI think this could be remedied with a pretty simple fix - another branch of magic that lets you heal/buff. The game has no health potions, so you're at the mercy of health drops from enemies.\n\nAlso, it suffers from a lack of content. This isn't a hard negative - it's still in early access! From the looks of things, the developers have a ton of content planned. As far as I've gotten though, there are very few side quests or optional dungeons, and not a lot of equipment variety.\n\nProbably the most disappointing thing is that, after I started a multiplayer playthrough with my friend, we don't both get Monster Cards together. Loot in general is shared evenly (in Round-Robin sharing) but monster cards take so long to get that it is very very disheartening to not get one when it drops and your friend gets it.\n\nMy last negative point  - the soundtrack is only mediocre. Lots of games these days have phenomenal soundtracks, so you almost expect it when a game hits \"Overwhelmingly Positive\". I think this game can get there - but the soundtrack isn't helping. It's not bad, but it's not good enough.\n\n[b]But the positives. Oh man, I could go on and on. So I will.[/b]\n\nThe first thing is the graphics - it's BEAUTIFUL. Some of the best pixel art I've seen in years.  Your avatar can be customized with a ton of different styles and colors, and they all look great. Every enemy and character is gorgeously animated . The environment is amazing. This game is just overflowing with great visuals.\n\nThe gameplay is a TON of fun. Combat is great with a few snags in my opinion. The skill system lets you pick whatever skills you want first, with 4 different magic elements and physical skills to choose from. There's a good amount of variety in builds and if you have (quite a lot of) money you can respec all your skills. You can stagger enemies and get bonuses from precise shield blocking. Sometimes if you attack too quickly, it eats your input and you just stand there, so that can be pretty annoying.\n\nYou have a bottomless bag (No inventory management! 5 Stars right there). Enemies drop stuff ALL THE TIME and its really satisfying to collect it all. And there's a ton of stuff to collect. It's a grind-lovers dream. You can refight bosses to get their rare drops.  Every enemy in the game has an ULTRA-RARE drop as well, which can be fun to farm for.\n\nThere's a crafting system that lets you build new equipment with all the drops you collect. IMO the game needs more mage equipment - I still only have 1 wand, from the beginning of the game.\n\nThere are so many [i]well-done[/i] mechanics in this game - collecting things is a blast, refighting bosses is excellent, there is a challenge arena, good variety of enemies. It's a ton of fun to play and I can't wait for the full version to come out.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend this game to anyone that likes RPGs or the Legend Of Zelda series.", "timestamp_created": 1453349807, "timestamp_updated": 1453518639, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20654099": {"recommendationid": "20654099", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013095418", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 5839, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458703616}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u30c9\u30e9\u30af\u30a8\u3068\u304b\u30bc\u30eb\u30c0\u306b\u4f3c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u304c\u597d\u3080\u5143\u7956RPG\u3068\u3044\u3046\u304b\u3093\u3058\u3002\n\u826f\u3044\u3068\u3053\u308d\u306f\u3001\u3053\u308c\u3092\u30d5\u30ec\u30f3\u30c9\u3068\u4e00\u7dd2\u306b\u5192\u967a\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3002\n\u3053\u3046\u3044\u3046\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\u306e\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306aRPG\u306f\u3001steam\u306b\u6b86\u3069\u306a\u3044\u306e\u3067\u500b\u4eba\u7684\u306b\u3068\u3066\u3082\u5b09\u3057\u3044\u3002\n\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u65b9\u306e\u5185\u5bb9\u91cf\u306f24\u6642\u9593\u3042\u308c\u3070\u6b86\u3069\u904a\u3073\u3064\u304f\u305b\u308b\u3002\n\u30af\u30a8\u30b9\u30c8\u3060\u3051\u3092\u6de1\u3005\u3068\u3053\u306a\u3059\u3067\u306a\u304f\u3001\u30ec\u30a2\u30c9\u30ed\u30c3\u30d7\u96c6\u3081\u3084\u9b5a\u91e3\u308a\u3067\u30da\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u3048\u3055\u3092\u3042\u3064\u3081\u3066\n\u81ea\u5206\u306e\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30bf\u30b9\u3092\u6e80\u8db3\u3044\u304f\u6570\u5024\u307e\u3067\u4e0a\u3052\u308b\u3060\u3068\u304b\u3001\u30ec\u30d9\u30eb\u30ab\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u307e\u3067\u3081\u3056\u3057\u3066\u30ec\u30d9\u30eb\u4e0a\u3052\u7d9a\u3051\u308b\u3060\u3068\u304b\u3057\u305f\u3089\n24\u6642\u9593\u3067\u306f\u8db3\u308a\u306a\u3044\u3068\u601d\u3046\u3002\u307e\u3060\u307e\u3060\u5185\u5bb9\u304c\u5c11\u306a\u3044\u306e\u3067\u6ca2\u5c71\u306e\u30b5\u30d6\u3092\u80b2\u3066\u3066\u904a\u3093\u3067\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1453347409, "timestamp_updated": 1453347409, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20652758": {"recommendationid": "20652758", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064273255", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 688, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507215754}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e0d\u9519 \u73a9\u8d77\u6765\u8fd8\u86ee\u4e0a\u763e \u671f\u5f85\u6b63\u5f0f\u7248\u8d76\u5feb\u63a8\u51fa", "timestamp_created": 1453340083, "timestamp_updated": 1453340083, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20643747": {"recommendationid": "20643747", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973679687", "num_games_owned": 228, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 542, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467313779}, "language": "english", "review": "Steam is telling me to write a review:\n\nGame is good!

The combat is fluid, more so than that of Legend of Zelda and equipping a Two-Handed weapon does not take away your ability to use a shield. \n\nThe character sprites are amazing and dynamic, you rarely find an NPC doing nothing physically as most have a nice implemented action to make themselves seem more lifelike. Ones that you find in-game that do this range from flipping their hair, kicking a wagon, turning a crank, and even sipping tea or sneezing. It makes the world come to life more and each NPC has their own individual character portrait to show that they aren't just faceless boring no-name people in the lush world of Grindea.\n\nSkills take another aspect of the game in that they ARE diverse but there isn't a lot of them. Your main weapons will consist of a sword, either one-handed or two-handed and that is the limitation of your weapons. You will find others such as a bow and arrow while exploring but that is just a side weapon which left me wanting a more diverse weapon system. I wish there were more weapons such as a double headed spear that an enemy NPC had or even another skill branch for the bow and arrow but alas there is none. \n\nThe world of Grindea itself is nice and all the sprites are beautiful and amazing, however that does not excuse the games limited exploration. Throughout my playthrough I had tried to explore numerous pathways to other parts of the world only to be stopped by an invisible wall and a text box saying. \"You can't go there! That part of the game is not yet implemented.\" This kills exploration as there is only on path you can take instead of being able to explore the world as you like which leads me wanting more.\n\nFor the price of 14.99$ this game is not bad, and is actually amazing. I just wish that there was more diversity in weapons and one pet peeve of mine is that equipment (such as gloves, shoes, or armor) does not show to change the characters clothes as if appearing invisible. That being said however, this game is not worth 15$ but IS worthy of your time as the world of Grindea is still being made, hopefully once finished it will be worth its expensive price.", "timestamp_created": 1452644715, "timestamp_updated": 1452644715, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497537", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20492900": {"recommendationid": "20492900", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045458165", "num_games_owned": 293, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 961, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473158410}, "language": "russian", "review": "[h1] \u041e\u0411\u042f\u0417\u0410\u0422\u0415\u041b\u042c\u041d\u041e \u0420\u0415\u041a\u041e\u041c\u0415\u041d\u0414\u0423\u042e!\t[/h1]\n\u041a \u0441\u043e\u0436\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044e, \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044f\u0448\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0432\u0441\u0451 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u0438 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0447\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044b, \u043e\u0442 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0445, \u0432\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u043a, \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c \u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0436\u0438\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0448\u044c \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u044b.. \u043d\u043e \u0443\u0432\u044b \u0438 \u0430\u0445. \u041e\u0434\u043d\u0430\u043a\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0443 \u0438\u0445 \u0444\u0438\u0430\u0441\u043a\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f \u044d\u043f\u043e\u0445\u0430 \u0438\u0433\u0440, \u0430 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u0418\u043d\u0434\u0438, \u043e\u0442 \u043d\u0435\u0438\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043c\u0430\u043b\u044b\u0445 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0447\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432, \u043e\u0442 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0445 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c \u043d\u0435 \u0436\u0434\u0451\u0448\u044c \u0447\u0443\u0434\u0430 \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0447\u0435\u0433\u043e-\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u0449\u0435\u0433\u043e (\u043a\u0430\u043a \u0431\u044b \u043d\u0430\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f). \u0410 \u0432\u043e\u0442 \u0442\u0443\u0442 \u0438 \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u0449\u0435\u0435 \u0447\u0443\u0434\u043e!\n\u041a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u044b\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0447\u0438\u043a \u043f\u044b\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u043f\u0430\u0444\u043e\u0441\u0430, \u0437\u0440\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0449, \u044d\u043f\u0438\u043a\u0430 -

I haven't tried multiplayer and arcade mode I've only tried a small amount, so realize this isn't the most complete review.\n\n[b]Pros[/b]:\n[*]The game has an action rpg feel with it's talent trees and skills that is like diablo 2/torch light. There's alot of depth here for you to customize your hero into a full warrior or a mage or a hybrid of the two. \n[*]The retro look makes it seem easier to pick up\n[*]As you go deeper into the game the boss fights become more challenging, to the point where I can almost guarantee that you'll die by the 4th or 5th boss\n[*]There's a crafting system that reminds me of dragonquest XIII, it's pretty dope. You take misc. items and you combine them to form stronger swords, shields, etc.\n\n[b]Cons[/b]:\n[*]The story seems like a parody of other games, many bosses are references to old games and anime like a gundam boss and things similar. And the title of the game itself, Secrets of \"Grindea\", is a reference to grinding, or hours of constantly doing monotonous tasks in mmorpgs in order to get something. Many of the cities like EverGrind are references like this too. You can definitely see where the creators drew inspiration and they take alot of time to give nod to that but I also wish that they'd take their own story and lore a bit more serious. Admittedly I haven't really taken the time to read much of the chat boxes but that's the impression I get from some of the bosses and atmosphere.\n[*] Some of the spells feel lackluster at first and I find myself constantly respeccing my hero.\n\n[b]Would I recommend it?[/b]\nI would to someone who's already a fan of a scott pilgrim beat em up or like diablo 2/torchlight type of action rpg or someone who's into games like the older zelda games like link to the past. For $6-$10 I think this game is well worth the price. There are promised updates with more dungeons in the future which I'm really looking forward to. I'm only level 13-14 at the time of this review and not even close to finishing all of the content, there's definitely enough content and grinding to keep a player in the game until updates arrive.", "timestamp_created": 1452181880, "timestamp_updated": 1452182736, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20371941": {"recommendationid": "20371941", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133640825", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1971, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485869406}, "language": "english", "review": "its awosme and good more of that igave this to my friend and brother and me ofcourese we played it was keep the good work youre one of the that impreed me like undertale anyways kepp the work 10out of 10", "timestamp_created": 1452165351, "timestamp_updated": 1452165351, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20370995": {"recommendationid": "20370995", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082124360", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495325920}, "language": "english", "review": "In love <3 <3", "timestamp_created": 1452161502, "timestamp_updated": 1452161502, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20369061": {"recommendationid": "20369061", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095836016", "num_games_owned": 290, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1832, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499696372}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5f88\u8d5e\u7684\u6e38\u620f\n\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u63a5\u89e6\u662f14\u5e74\u6691\u5047\uff0c\u90a3\u65f6\u5019\u57283dm\u4e0a\u770b\u7684\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u5f88\u5438\u5f15\u4eba\uff0c\u753b\u98ce\u4e5f\u633a\u559c\u6b22\u7684\uff0c\u5c31\u4e0b\u4e0b\u6765\u4e86\uff0c\u5f53\u65f6\u4e00\u53e3\u6c14\u73a9\u4e86\u5f88\u4e45\uff0c\u53ef\u60dc\u4e3b\u7ebf\u592a\u77ed\u4e86\uff0c\u6253\u5b8c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5c31\u5b8c\u7ed3\u4e86\uff0c\u90a3\u65f6\u5019\u5c31\u81ea\u5df1\u4e00\u76f4\u73a9\u8857\u673a\uff0c\u628a\u6240\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u90fd\u505a\u4e86\uff0c\u57ce\u9547\u5347\u5230\u505a\u9ad8\u7ea7\u4e86\uff08\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u96c6\u8981999999\uff09\uff0c\u5f53\u7136\u633a\u83dc\u7684\uff0c\u8857\u673a\u6700\u591a\u5c31\u5230\u8fc7\u7b2c7\u5c42\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6ca1\u51fa\u5b8c\u73a9\u4e86\u4e00\u6bb5\u65f6\u95f4\u5c31\u5f03\u4e86\u3002\n\u524d\u4e0d\u4e45\u56e0\u4e3a\u4ee5\u6492\u80ce\u8863\u5165\u4e86\u6b63\u7248\uff0c\u770b\u5230\u7adf\u7136\u6709\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u771f\u662f\u5f88\u60f3\u4e70\u554a\uff0c\u4e00\u76f4\u82e6\u82e6\u7b49\u6253\u6298\uff0c\u7b49\u8fc7\u4e86\u611f\u6069\uff0c\u5723\u8bde\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u636e\u8bf4\u4e0d\u51fa\u5b8c\u4e0d\u6253\u6298\uff0c \u90a3\u90fd\u591a\u5c11\u5e74\u4e86\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u5fcd\u4f4f\u5c31\u5165\u4e86\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u73a9\u4e86\u4e00\u904d\uff0c\u6c34\u5e73\u6bd4\u4ee5\u524d\u83dc\u4e86\u5f88\u591a\u3002\n\u4e0d\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e00\u5e74\u591a\u66f4\u65b0\u7ed9\u6211\u7684\u60ca\u559c\u5427\uff1a\n\u4e3b\u7ebf\u66f4\u65b0\u4e86\u5f88\u591a\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u6253\u5230\u4e86\u56db\u5b63\u6bbf\u4e86\n\u52a0\u4e86\u88ab\u52a8\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u52a0\u4e86\u5ba0\u7269\uff0c\u52a0\u4e86\u597d\u591a\u6709\u70b9\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u8ff7\u5bab\n\u7f3a\u70b9\uff1a\n\u6ca1\u6709\u4e2d\u6587\uff0c\u82f1\u8bed\u6e23\uff0c\u5f88\u591a\u5267\u60c5\u90fd\u770b\u4e0d\u61c2\uff0c\u5f53\u65f6\u73a93dm\u6b63\u7248\u597d\u6b79\u6709\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u4e2d\u6587\u4f30\u8ba1\u51fa\u5230\u6b63\u5f0f\u7248\u4e4b\u524d\u662f\u4e0d\u4f1a\u6709\u4e86(\u521b\u610f\u5de5\u574a\u66f4\u65b0\u4e86\u4e2d\u6587)\n\u4ef7\u683c\u6709\u70b9\u8d35\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u662fearly access\n\u66f4\u7684\u592a\u6162\u4e86\uff0c\u592a\u6162\u4e86\uff0c\u592a\u6162\u4e86\n\u6709\u751f\u4e4b\u5e74\u7cfb\u5217", "timestamp_created": 1452151314, "timestamp_updated": 1479950883, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20361296": {"recommendationid": "20361296", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997374054", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6007, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513990510}, "language": "english", "review": "The game rocks.

However, this combat is a blast to play as there are many different builds and playstyles that you could choose so that every run-through isn't the same as the last one. You could be a fire mage, throwing fireballs or shooting down meteors or a summoner or a savage berserker. So many choices are present! The enemies are also never too bland and the ones that are do it because of a reason, as in the case of the slime being generic simply because it's the first monster you ever encounter. Every enemy attacks in a different way or pattern and with the mechanic of perfect blocking which is blocking almost exactly when the enemy attacks, there's a decent amount of skill involved.\n\n-------------------------------------------STORY-------------------------------------------\n\nNOTE: I am just going to address this because of the countless idiots writing reviews about how the story isn't finished. The game is literally in EARLY ACCESS. Of course the story isn't done, but the dev team is working their hardest to provide some crisp quality content and the content that is currently avaliable is so excessive and polished that I find that hating on the game simply because you did one rushed playthrough of the story is simply sad.\n\nThe actual story revolves around your journey across the world accompanied by your stingy companion Bag, who is a magic Bag that gives you hint, throws snide and comical remarks about the world around you, and is an essential story factor as Bag acts as an explanation for your endless inventory. I don't want to give too many spoilers, but each encounter feels unique and like a whole new experience. You'll encounter the likes of sentient artifacts, giant slimes, apocolypse causing people and more and the story that revolves around these people and creatures feel unique and as in the case of the last current story arc (as of writing this review), you feel somewhat emotionally impacted about what happens.\n-------------------------------------------GAMEPLAY-------------------------------------------\n\nThe game is full of puzzles, some ranging from easy but there are a lot of hard ones that make you boggle your mind. There are also a bunch of side quests which will occupy your time while or after you do the main story.\n\n-------------------------------------------ARCADE MODE-------------------------------------------\n\nThis mode is unlocked without anything and is a fun and challenging way for you to have fun while you wait for more content to be unlocked in the story mode. You traverse through several floors and you do not regain hp until each floor completion which makes learning how to dodge and perfect block essential. It's a way to help you get good at the game in a fun manner.\n\nAll in all the game is pretty nice and is definite refresher from some of the more mediocre games in it's genre!", "timestamp_created": 1451402990, "timestamp_updated": 1511722877, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20062371": {"recommendationid": "20062371", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141954892", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 825, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453647286}, "language": "german", "review": "Also ich habe dieses Spiel erst 2h gespielt und habe mich entschieden ein Review zu verfassen.\nIch bin mehr als nur begeistert von dem Spiel!!!\nEs ist zwar noch EarlyAcess aber f\u00fcr mich hat sich der Kauf gelohnt.

This game is as advertised.  It's a game similar to Secret of Mana (SNES), Crystalis (NES), Zelda-esque, Final Fantasy Adventure (Original GB)  and many other old RP games.\n\nYou can customize your character physically by gender, colour of your clothes, hair style and colour, and name.  Additonally, you get a vanity part for your hat, face, weapon, and shield.\n\nThe gameplay is very nice, you can be a full warrior, full mage, whatever you want to be; a combination if you want.  Although, being a healer is not an option.\n\nThis is a beta game, it's not complete, from my estimation it's a little near half done, if that.\n\nYou can play cooperatively, over the internet, using your steam friends list or direct IP!  This is awesome!\n\nYou grind in the game, if that wasn't obvious.  (What old school console RPG didn't have you grind?  It's part of the fun!)\n\nThe transition between keyboard and controller playing is seamless, you just start using your keyboard and it swaps to keyboard mode, you use your controller, it swaps to controller mode.  I found this particularly great!\n\nThe host of the game's save file is progressed in the story, however - if you're not the host - you keep everything you gained.  You simply have to play through the story (by hosting or single player) to go through it.  The rewards though, you do not acquire again, you already have them!  :D\n\nThis is an awesome game!  As far as I'm aware only three people are working on it and they're from Sweden.  They have me as a fan.  The sprite animation is awesome, the artwork for the avatars is great and expresses much emotion, and the game looks very polished for a beta that is not even half done!\n\nI used to pay $50+ US dollars for games like these, and wait years for the next to come out.  I love the game very much, and I haven't even started exploring the Arcade Mode.\n\ntl;dr - Buy this game if you loved Secret of Mana or any similar games on the console or PC.

It's simply a lot of fun and also challenging. Did have some issues with infrequent disconnects and crashes, but players can join an existing session so it's not too troublesome.\n\nThere's a lot of potential here, but the story mode is just too short right now.

Furthermore, there are a fair amount of bosses whose patterns/attacks the developers have taken creative liberty to make unique, unexpected, and enjoyably difficult. Characters are not class bound; rather each character has a limited number of usuable skill points and the same pool of skills they can choose from. This allows for multiple unique playthroughs on both story and arcade (roguelike) mode. I haven't found a similar game that brings forth the amount of depth, polish and nostalgia that Grindea has.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1448756276, "timestamp_updated": 1448756276, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.740299", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "19336212": {"recommendationid": "19336212", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053840703", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1250, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501317376}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is so much fun!

(Seriosely though, Devs, Great job on the jumpkin pet, Love it, Love it, LOVE, IT...)\n\nnow the cons (Note: i don't have too many because the rest are mostly one nuetrals):\n-YES the game is very grind-ish at times, gaining materials, certain armors, weapons, I'm just placing this here because even I have to admit that this CAN get mind numbing, BUT take note: This one is least concerning, why? The word \"Grind\" is in the title, so really... well that IS what you're getting a peice of... but to be fair, you don't HAVE to grind to get through the story, again, don't pay TOO much attention to this one.\n\nNow the Nuetrals:\n_Custimization: Yes i do like the costume feature, and yes i can basically make myself in real rife... for the most part, still missing facial hair, but we are playing as a young child... my point in this one is, Yes it's there, just not much of it is there at this time, which the reason it's a nuetral? \"Early access\" is why.\n-Armor, and when i say this one, i mostly mean chest armor appearance, basxically... it never changes, no form of changing it accept colors, i guess you could say this is SORT of a request, but a deal breaker by any means, Just a small request to let us change from simple shirt and scarf to say leather or metal armor? to appropriate to the class? robesx for mages, leather for rogues, metal for tanks? mostly for appearance, like in costumes...\n-Difficulty, i don't mean for the common enemies, i just mean for certain bosses it CAN be rather... unforgiving... until you find some form of work around or loopole to the boss...\n\nThat's about it really, again, the game is early access, so not TOO much can be said upon it quite yet, it does look promising so far, heck, if i had friends or people to play with, or someone to help get through the story, i'de go for i9t to be honest, but any ways,  at the current time, i would give this game... 7.5/10 seem fair? for it's current status, this is in no way the final grade, but yeah for those who just want a charming, nice, Mostly friendly game to play, i recommend this plenty!", "timestamp_created": 1447829735, "timestamp_updated": 1447829735, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "19138574": {"recommendationid": "19138574", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045735996", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466904825}, "language": "english", "review": "Totally Immersive and has lots of fun things to do.

Aber dieses RPG vereint vieles, was man in anderen Spielen oft vermisst hat. Bspw. die Bewegungsgeschwindigkeit ist sehr angenehm; der Schild ist wesentlich n\u00fctzlicher als zB. in Zelda; Ausgepr\u00e4gter Skillbaum mit der M\u00f6glichkeit sich auf Melee, Mage oder Support festzulegen, oder aber auch auf eine Mischung daraus. Wobei man sich aber auch verskillen kann, wie ich gemerkt habe. Kein Problem: einfach ein bischen Gold farmen und schon kann man Skillpunkte einzeln zur\u00fccksetzen. Quests gibt es bei Vollendung hoffentlich wesentlich mehr! Waren mir nun doch etwas zuwenig, allerdings trotzdem nettausgedachte. Die Umgebung ist sch\u00f6n gestaltet, besonders die Pumpkin-Woods gefallen mir sehr.\n\nJetzt aber zu den Gegnern und Bossen: Die Bosse sind mit jedem Mal mehr herausfordernder. Hier gilt es besondere Achtsamkeit auf das Ausweichen zu legen. Weckt aufjedenfall den Ehrgeiz dran zu bleiben. Die Angriffe sind n\u00e4mlich mit einem vertical-shooter vergleichbar und dementsprechend schon anspruchsvoll. Aber hat man die n\u00f6tige Konzentration, schafft man das. Und wie gesagt, es weckt den Ehrgeiz und das mag ich besonders an Spielen. \nWas die gew\u00f6hnlichen Monster angeht: Auch hier waren die Entwickler sehr kreativ! Alle haben verschiedene Verhaltens- und Angriffsmuster. Es wiederholt sich nichts. Und hin und wieder trifft man auch auf eine Eliteform von einem Monstertyp, der dann etwas ausgepr\u00e4gtere Angriffe hat. Daf\u00fcr aber auch bessere Drops!\n\nMen\u00fc: Im Spiel sowie im Men\u00fc gibt es sehr viel zu entdecken. Man kann beispielsweise ein Monster mit gewissen Items z\u00e4hmen und auch f\u00fcttern und sich somit Passive Buffs/Effekte verschaffen. Weiter kann man im Spiel sogar Karten von Monstern bekommen, die ebenso einen permanenten Effekt haben. Das Craften habe ich jetzt noch nicht ausprobiert, aber auch das ist bisher in kleinem Umfang m\u00f6glich.\n\nIch hoffe sehr, dass dieses Spiel bei weitem gr\u00f6\u00dfer wird und die Entwickler weiterhin mit Herzblut am Ball bleiben.\n\nMfG\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1447625069, "timestamp_updated": 1447625069, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "19096915": {"recommendationid": "19096915", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973948924", "num_games_owned": 766, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 973, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450176662}, "language": "english", "review": "The game has a stable foundation unlike many other Early access games.

I really like its pixellated art style and its level system! Its level system is especially great because of its distribution of normal and gold skill points, basically to level skills (which I may add arent limited to a certain class you can choose any skill or spell regardless!) you need to get skill points but eventually once the skill is a high enough level normal skill points wont work and you need to use golden points to make the skill stronger these golden skill points are much more infrequent than normal skill points this provides a way of making it so that you dont get super strong super fast giving you a much more challenging aspect. Another great aspect of the grame is its great side activities! You can fish, tame pets do fun sidequests, herd chickens, and craft strong weapons and armor! I love the crafting system its simple but still needs a fair amount of grinding for certain items, which is great because its well IN THE NAME and it gives you great satisfaction when you finally craft the item! One of the only complaints I'd have about the game is it only lets you play with steam friends which is ok i geuss but I'd like to be able to play with people online I could make new friends with, not neccesarily for story mode but more for arcade mode, which i may add is a little cruel. Other than what i have already stated I have no complaints I really look forward too the games further development in which something I hope to see is a skill line for the bow and different kinds of bows like there are swords, another thing I REALLY HOPE TO SEEEE is healing! while I understand enemies drop health from time to time I feel health potions would be very useful and would bring more attention to the potions shop in Evergrind, another thing regarding healing I hope to see in the game is a healing skill for the support skill line I personally would really like this because healing teamate would make the game a lot more fun with friends.

Theres a simple fishing minigame, mainly for providing food to your pets, who gives different permanent buffs depending on what you feed them, and some not so hard puzzles. \n\nI dunno how much of the game (story mode) is finished atm, mabye 1/4? (hope its less :p ) The content that is in the game seems 100% done and everything is working great, very polished, unlike most early access games... Didnt notice any bugs. As of now theres about 10-12 hours worth of the main game (mabye a bit less if you play on normal and just blaze through) + xx hours of arcade mode, wich is a sort of semi random series of \"rooms\" where you try to get as far as possible before you die while building up your character on the way, and get your high score in the global ranking, great fun. Havent tried it in co-op mode yet so cant comment on that. \n\nI can confidently recomend this to anyone, any age, who likes this sort of game. Its a good challenge on hard. Again, the combat gameplay is great, you have to time it right and use the shield, reflect projectiles and know when to go all out and when to hold back. Truly a gem in the making.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1445508546, "timestamp_updated": 1445508546, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497738", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18620810": {"recommendationid": "18620810", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039792476", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 522, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458507644}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game", "timestamp_created": 1445487354, "timestamp_updated": 1445487354, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.975124", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18605691": {"recommendationid": "18605691", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131883434", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1619, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448824121}, "language": "english", "review": "Very enjoyable.

(mobs will respawn quickier if you grind in one place, it's also easy to travel around the map without timer or charges or any annoying time gate. Grinding is fun and that's awesome !)\n- Combat (not too easy, not too difficult either. It's fun and not boring. It helps a lot with the grinding point too !)\n- multiplayer : easy to host or join a game. Just becarefull of the ping :p\n- Arcade mode : addictive and hard !\n\nWhat I don't like :\n-\n\nWhat I would love to see in the game :\n- Housing ! I found some housing item so I guess that will come.. maybe ? :D\n- more mini games !\n\nYeah there is nothing in the \"what I don't like\" list, it's normal.

The animations are smooth, the storyline is enticing, and the combat, surprisingly, is quite interactive. \n\nThe ability to pick and choose whichever skills you want with no restrictions really allows you to create your OWN character. There is no \"optimal\" skill set, you just find the one that works for you. The game is extremley challenging on HARD mode, requiring players to strategize on every single fight; giving you a great feeling of satisfaction after clearing a room. Speaking of feelings, the gameplay intertwined with the storyline does an outstanding job at provoking feeling within you. Satisfaction, anger, happiness, confidence, sorrow; it's all there. Of course the game isn't complete, but I am sure that upoin completion the game will take players on an emotional rollercoaster, which will leave you saying \"damn, that was a great game\"\n\nThe developers constantly update their blog, so that players aren't waiting for new on new content for extended periods of time. They've even bothered to include special dialouge which will let you know when you have reach the end of the stable/ frontline beta (for the time being). And, of course, there are plenty of witty comments that you can sense took time and effort from the team.\n\nPros: Everything\nCons: Not complete yet\n\nI'd have to say, aside from some very slight bugs (which I am sure they will fix) this game deserves a 10/10. \n\nIf you're looking for a game with classic graphics and modern mechanics, this is the game for you.

A quality, amusing, fun, multiplayer RPG that lets you be who you want to be and play with your friends.  A lot of the game is simple enough to pick up, while other aspects seem frustratingly incomprehensible (at first).\n\nThe Good:[list]\n[*]Can choose the colors of your character's clothes and hair to stand out from other players\n[*]Can change your character's hairstyle to stand out as well\n[*]Can not only equip masks to look different, but can equip a \"style\" for masks, weapons, and shields, to allow your character to look a certain way without sacrificing the stats on their gear.  Major props to the developers for that mechanic.\n[*]Humor.  This game has plenty of it.\n[*]Active developers who read their forums and respond to feedback.  They not only tell you what they're doing every week, they show images and animated gifs that prove it's not just hot air.\n[*]Experience Cap - You can avoid outleveling your friends by hunting in areas that are beneath you, so you get money and items but no XP.\n[*]Arcade Mode - A randomly generated series of rooms that let you play a character with your friends and work toward the development of a town.\n[*]Puzzles - The Temple of Seasons especially.  The use of seasons to not only affect the monsters' abilities, but also affect what can be done with the room, is amazingly well done.  Some of the other puzzles (like the bells) require a little attention to detail to figure out.  includes puzzle-related humor as well.\n[*]Fishing - Because fish!  Ok, because it's a free way to get pet food, and the time investment doesn't make it feel cheaty for the return.\n[*]Pets! - Because pets!  They don't fight for you, but you can increase your stats by feeding your pets certain items/fish.  The more they level the more food it will take, so you may wish to devote specific pets to specific traits.\n[/list]\n\nThe Not-so-Good:[list]\n[*]Characters only ever have one clothing style, regardless of colors.  Perhaps my character wants to run around in robes, while my brother's wants to run around in a martial arts outfit like the monks in Evergrind.  What if my friend's female character wants to wer a dress, impractical as they are for adventuring?  Male or female, you only get one (the same) set of clothes.\n[*]Small development team - While not really a bad thing, it does make the updates take a lot longer.  I applaud their desire to keep with a stable core that isn't going to lose interest and disappear during a project, but at the same time I wish they could produce updates just a little faster.  The forums show multiple offers of assistance, which are politely declined.\n[*]Arcade Mode - Every time you die, you start over at level 1.  This doesn't make for a \"grind\" as much as a monotonous loop of re-leveling and trying to get back to where you had been.  While being too weak in the story mode allows you to backtrack and level, or hunt cards, the Arcade Mode forces you to keep moving into progressively more dangerous territory, and one bad spawn can reset you to zero instead of just backing off and leveling some more.\n[*]Equipment limitations - With a good drop on one of the bosses you can have one of the best 1-h weapons in the current release of the game, halfway into Story Mode.  Most caster gear is functionally limited until far into the second temple, while you can get great melee armor and weapons throughout.  Even buying all gear and dropping/crafting all\narmors as of the end of the current release, some of the most useful caster gear was either available 1/3 of the way into the game (MP regen robes) or at the end of current content (temple loot/drops).\n[*]Monster Cards - While I do believe they are awesome and useful, I feel the benefits they grant are so powerful in some cases that you become reliant on them, rather than simply empowered by them.  To change them now might require some major balance tweaks, but Bloomo and Pecko are the two that spring to mind.  Without them I stood little chance alone in the Temple of Seasons against the mini-boss, after XP slowed to a crawl.  It seems awkward relying on those to beat a few fights...  Later in the game, unless more high-HP boosting cards are added to balance tough fights, I could see them being less useful.  For now though, they're pretty much a necessity.\n[*]Economy - It never really seems like you have to worry about money in this game.  By the time I stopped hunting all the cards and mob drops, I had enough money to raise my Jumpkin to level 10 purely off potions.  Buying anything else was like picking out pocket lint, for all the impact it made in my savings.[/list]\n\nI believe that the game has incredible potential, and is great fun as it stands now.

Stardew Valley is a game made by a single person, and it hit the shelves complete, intricate, and incredibly well made and thought out. This game has multiple programmers, and despite it being a great idea, there is just not nearly enough content at this point to warrant a whole 15 dollars. Save your money. If you are looking for some SNES nostalgia, get Stardew Valley, it's not at all the same game, but it shows what is possible for a single programmer to achieve with dedication and diligence. I waited two years to inch a tiny bit closer to a story I really wanted to see unfold, only to realize, at this rate it will be another ten years before I will ever see any kind of conclusion.

While the whole game isn't available yet bug free thankfully they have given us the option to play stable or frontline. stable is obviously bug free and frontline lets you go farther but with bugs so you can play how you choose your style.", "timestamp_created": 1443872381, "timestamp_updated": 1443872451, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18305456": {"recommendationid": "18305456", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971405144", "num_games_owned": 303, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459703911}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u611f\u89ba\u4e0d\u932f\u73a9!!\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u4e2d\u6587,\u4e0d\u7136\u53ea\u6703\u6253\u602a\u7df4\u529f,\u770b\u4e0d\u61c2\u6545\u4e8b\u5167\u5bb9", "timestamp_created": 1443870389, "timestamp_updated": 1443870389, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18298523": {"recommendationid": "18298523", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018856360", "num_games_owned": 760, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443828544}, "language": "english", "review": "THIS GAME IS GOOD, IT HAS BAGS AND FAIRIES and SANTA", "timestamp_created": 1443828578, "timestamp_updated": 1443828578, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18286453": {"recommendationid": "18286453", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994686268", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1090, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457827386}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a game for people who liked to play secret of mana.

I mean, after 20 minutes the game is already throwing you into a deep and fun story. after an hour you have already laughed your ass off more than once, and the game does a damned good job of not taking itself to serious.\n\nFor an \"ARPG\" with great elements from zelda, secrets of mana, and God knows what else lies ahead, it plays any RPG fan into a lifetime of fun. The game excessively reminds you it's about the grind that RPGs generally have, yet you don't feel underpowered at all when you rush through something. On the flip side - it forces you to go back and grind because you feel like you are missing something if you don't.\n\n\nPros --\n\n-Great Storyline\n-HOURS of content in a tiny little package\n-Devs clearly care about the game because it gets constant attention\n-Has parodies of all types of games (no spoilers)\n-YOU CAN FISH\n-Side story is still amazing, even in alpha/Early Access stages\n-Character options are not limited. You can be a mage, tank, DPS, or all, or a mix of whatever. \n-YOU CAN FISH!\n-Fishing has rewards\n-Fish have a purpose\n-Fish have multiple purposes\n-Fishing is seriously fun in this game\n-FISH\n-I see a ton of replay value\n\nCONS ----\n\n-No timer letting you know you have been playing for 6 and a half friggin hours straight.\n-Seriously, I can't find any cons for this game, and that scares me.\n\n\n\n\nOverall, this game is amazing.\n\nGraphics - 9.5/10 - They are amazing, a great homage to classic gaming.\nSound - 9/10 - Some sound effects are a bit overbearing at times, and if you drop the volume you miss out on the little effects.\nMusic - 10/10 - Great score. The entire game has music that keeps you going. At no point did I dislike it a bit. I almost didn't even notice myself humming to it all the time.\nGameplay - 10/10 - The gameplay is perfect. For it's genre and subs, it has all of the elements in the right place. PLUS you have so much freedom in character creation.\nControls - 9/10 - Id give it a ten, but sometimes the placement of things feels a little off. May be a bit better after you get used to it more I guess. Nothing is actually bad about them, but personally I miss keys from time to time when I need to chain things together. \n\nOverall, this game has a solid and simple 9.75/10. I mena, just buy it. You wont regret it a bit. They creators have done an amazing job, and I can't wait till this game is complete, and a sequal is in the works.", "timestamp_created": 1443327268, "timestamp_updated": 1443328855, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 45, "votes_funny": 27, "weighted_vote_score": "0.702115", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18212128": {"recommendationid": "18212128", "author": {"steamid": "76561198145102198", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 9054, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502317845}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game so much!

Its not done and some parts of the game feel a bit out of place with the crafting system being hard to come by or just boring grinding. Boss fights are amazing and one of the best parts of the game but is one of the only good parts to look foward to in this game. \n\nThe leveling up system feels out of place and I know that the devs wanted a game where you can do anything you want with no class or items that truly make you different with others but honeslty that what makes a good RPG or even games with simular things like WoW, Fallout, Skyrim and etc, hell even Terraria does it well. So many times me and my friends found items that were just better that what we had already so having no other choice we use it hoping maybe it will help us. With No Classes thier no reason to build up to a certain classes or benifits really because at times it seems like your character is no different then the other people who play this because everyone justs goes for something thats good and only the good moves and perks making it kinda pointless when just everyone gets the same shit, taking the varity out of the game and really nothing to say\" I made this character to my play style or even a cool build\". \n\nMoney is also Pointless at times and just used to buy junk at the blacksmith because you dont wanna grind or dont even know about the bad crafting system in the game. The crafting system is never really introduce and its just there at times not really showing you anything about it or some of the cool items you can make. Two choices that best describe the crafting system is thats it there use it or don't because you will probly forget about it or don't care.\n\nStory is good, fun and amazing but at times its like left 4 dead, by just walking from point A to point B making it really boring along with the never ending spawning of enemies that just are annoying as hell at times.\n\nThis game brings alot of cool elements and amazing coop gameplay that just make it feel right. I truly want to play this game more but theres nothing atm ( AND THE GAMES NOT DONE ) that makes me want to come back with buddies and play. Its a great adventure but with mechanics that don't feel right but is not afriad to try something new but Im just not sure if it fits the game while this game trys to be more than one genre and even then it hardly fits them.

I promise you that. \n\nEnjoy. \n\nP.S to the developers - You guys rock... thank you SO much..

The game does unfortunately seem to be lacking a little bit in terms of character customization, but that's not a terribly bad thing, just something I wish would be improved upon. In fact I'd even say this game sort of handles like some of the old-school The Legend of Zelda games, except with more RPG elements to it. Plus, as someone who generally couldn't care less for dialogue, the dialogue in this game is actually pretty good. I actually laughed at a few parts and rarely found myself skipping through dialogue.

The story mode is probably about 50 percent complete, by the time i reached the end i was really yearning for more. There are tons of collectibles and several mini games including pets. Perfect game for the kind of person that loves additional content after the story, especially those who enjoy some grinding.\n\nFor those tired of playing in the story, there is a very well crafted arcade mode that is of course also multiplayer and has almost infinite replayability. \n\nThe real seller with this game though is the combat, which takes you back to old school SNES 2D top-down games like Link to the past and Secrets of Mana, but it is so much more then that. Once you find a build you enjoy whether you're just sitting back grinding enemies or facing the highest difficulty challenges, time just flies by.\n\nAs you can tell I highly recommend this game.

Currently low on content (about 6-7 hours to do all main quests and side quests).  While I recommend this game, it is NOT worth $15 at this stage (9/1/2015).\n\nDetailed Pro's: \n\nThe encounters (11/10!) in this game are incredibly well tuned and the clear highlight of this game.  There's no healing that I'm aware of, which means you will be challenged to learn each of these encounters as you die many, many times, similar to Super Meatboy or Dark Souls.  Like Meatboy, you will respawn instantly, and like dark souls, being greedy never pays off; slow and steady wins the race.  \n\nThe world is also quite nice with beautiful pixel graphics.  I would describe the dialogue as 14-year-old humor that harps on many RPG tropes.  The writers clearly have a sense of humor, which is nice.  The (side)quests are about a 4/10, really only designed to have you revisit old areas.  Some of them have unique bosses, those are cool.\n\nThe gameplay is also about 8/10, very tight controls.  I really only played 2H with a few extra spells, but the game will allow you to play archer, sword n board, 2h, or a mage in any/all of 4 magic schools.  Plus, there are support spells that help both melee and caster.  The spells seem really weak at low level but quite good once \"leveled up.\"  Points can be re-allocated for gold, which is great because you can try something for a price.  \n\nCons: Not much content yet, but it is still a solid stable and polished beta build.  If they keep creating more of the same, this game will be a fantastic modern version of its predecessors like Secret of Mana/Evermore, Link 2 tha Past and others.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1440953515, "timestamp_updated": 1440953515, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479042", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17794050": {"recommendationid": "17794050", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001681528", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1244, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453683995}, "language": "english", "review": "This game brings me right back to my childhood passing the controller between my sisters and I playing games like secret of mana, zelda, chrono cross, etc. I absolutely adore this game and can not wait until more content is added!", "timestamp_created": 1440943926, "timestamp_updated": 1440943926, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490463", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17789077": {"recommendationid": "17789077", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047566797", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1594, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1440496548}, "language": "english", "review": "Will be very enjoyable when its complete, so far a great game :)", "timestamp_created": 1440923414, "timestamp_updated": 1440923414, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17785622": {"recommendationid": "17785622", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985744876", "num_games_owned": 632, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 933, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513574455}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a lot of fun!

It is by no means close to being finished but it has an incredibly solid foundation. The first thing I need to mention is the art style is phenomenal and the game has one of my favorite soundtracks of any game out there. As I'm writing this review, my character is in the Flying Fortress just so I can listen to the music. The music gives me Final Fantasy vibes that I love. Let me also mention that the art in this game is awesome. The game is full of color and it's a beautiful game to look at.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, there are many choices to be made. There are skill sets for 1H or 2H weapons and the magic is divided into fire, ice, earth, and air (which should be called lightning...). There are no classes so you can mix and match between all of these sets (For example, you can be a 2H user that also specializes in ice spells. If you freeze an enemy, you are guarenteed your next physical attack to crit). \n\nSo far, there are 2 dungeons in the game that both have very strong themes and art styles. There is not a single part of this game I dread going through. I loved Tales of Symphonia but I HATED some of those dungeons/temples (especially the sewers, oh god). Let me also mention that the second dungeon has a mechanic involving changing seasons that I have never seen before in any game. Watching the whole room change colors is quite the thing to see. My only issue with the dungeons are that they are too short. I WANT MORE.\n\n-There are 6 notable bosses in this game and they are all designed very well each offering very different strategies to conquer them.\n-Each type of enemy has a small chance to drop a card which gives your character small permanent bonuses (5% discount at shops, Atk/MAtk/Def buffs, AtkSpd and CastSpd buffs, etc)\n-\"Farming\" is very easy in this game. If you kill a group of enemies, stick around for about 2 more minutes fighting enemies and the spawn rate at that location will increase like crazy. There's a room in the toy factory that will spawn endless amounts of presents for you to kill repeatedly. I probably did it for a solid 30-45 minutes and it was great!\n-This game also features Arcade mode which is essentially a rogue-like version of the game. It's pretty darn hard but fun I suppose. I haven't played it enough for the purpose of this review though.\n\nI'm looking forward to seeing more updates for this game. Not sure if you want to buy it yet? No biggie, PLAY THE DEMO! \nThanks for reading!

You can respec for a doable in-game fee. Smooth and fluid animation.\n-Multiplayer, which I did not try out. This can be done in the story mode and arcade mode.\n-The environments are awesome, the character artwork could be better, and the music is good, but nothing I see myself humming to.\n-Many cameos from other video games. Zelda, RE4, Honeydew, to name a few.\n-There's a stable version and a \"frontline\" version. Pretty self explanatory. The latter has more frequent updates (every few weeks) the former every month or two, from my understanding.\n\nCons:\n-The amount of monsters you have to kill and the many hours it takes to get a drop does not line up with an items rarity most of the time. It is not unheard of to spend 4-8 hours killing the same monster all to get a drop that is probably not better than what you already have JUST so you can work towards 100% completion. This is never a requirement, but the cards you can get in particular offer small permanent bonuses, and it can take you anywhere from 30 minutes to 8 hours to find the one that you want.\n-It's short. But the game's not done yet. The current story can be done in about 4-6 hours. Getting collectibles could get you another 10-20 hours, depending on your luck. Question is, do you want those mostly mediocre drops bad enough to spend all that time?\n-Arcade mode as a single player is quite a challenge. I usually opt for the harder options in video games like Kingdom Hearts on Critical but this mode is hard from the get go if you are alone. I would like to see some scaling in difficulty to make it more doable (maybe there already is, and I just suck.) But if you're looking for a challenge, you've got it here. An option to turn down the difficulty would be nice though.\n\nThese problems can be easily remedied with time, however. The creators are friendly and interactive with their community, and they post frequent updates.\nSo the question is, do I recommend this game? Is it worth the current price of $15.00?\nYes it is. For the amount of playtime I got out of it, for the potential of what it can become, and for the multiplayer, which I didn't even touch, which is sure to add many hours.

Haven't had an indie production be this fun for a while without it being some sort of sandbox requiring multiplayer to be fun, this game is fun both multiplayer or singleplayer and it works well both ways!\n Although still a little bare bones in some ways(I understand being a small team it must be awful work so i wish you best of luck and maybe you shall get more support in the future) and in need of some balancing on difficulty and melee damage also leveling up and crafting gathering mechanics being a bit of work and keeping yourself healed can be harsh with waves of mobs gets frustrating after an hour, it's still i have to say quite an experience worth to try in early acess, with a friend it makes it even more fun, get a copy for them or invite them to get one if it's possible! This really feels like a game that needs immense support, i tried to buy a more expensive bundle sadly my ways of payment cut me off that, such a shame i couldn't get the soundtrack but let me continue on this to say why this game is amazing.\n\n It brought me back to this feeling of playing a game fresh and new for the first time i doubt i'll ever forget, simple but quite entertaining battle mechanics and a neat little skill system with melee, support and magic to choose from, fighting so much enemies though with little health recovery and waves of enemies is a bit of work though, 2-handed melee users be aware. \n The dungeons and puzzles are also quite something, typpical Zelda stuff but still feels like an achievement to go trought them and both so far are amazing and unique! All packed with fitting enemies for the the zones and the bosses, oh boy, they're work to fight against a few continues i had to go trought for the first main one, but the battle was still so memorable, even mid-bosses are have the same impact!\n World building, design and characters, maybe a little bit of work one could do on the world, it's beautiful i have to say the scenery is amazing already for starting areas and the animation of the sprites is so fluid and nice to the eyes and the colors all mesh well but sometimes things can get a little cluttered and confusing especially on a certain double boss. The second temple is amazing and in my opinion so original i couldn't wait to see it before having seen some of the screenshots before purchase.

Solid music, good combat, and some pretty good humor make this a great time, and really makes me eager for future updates. There really isnt much to complain about here, but there are a few nitpicks. I noticed a few typos, picking up health orbs is a little annoying (as you need to stand right on top of them to collect them), some of the bosses need a bit of tweaking, and some of the characters artwork could be touched up a bit, maybe smoothed out a bit and varying the facial features, as many characters look similar. None of those nitpicks really take away from what you get here though, a fantastic look into what I hope will be an amazing finished product.

The game was successfully Kickstarted and went through Early Access where it attracted endless negative reviews; missing features, promises that weren't kept and deadlines that weren't met. The cynical among us might suggest a completely new product means a fresh slate for Steam reviews - but it's a damning indictment of a company's misuse of Early Access.\n\nIt's a shame because, for the most part, Early Access has been a phenomenon, allowing games to grow and developers to get real feedback on what's working and what isn't and make changes based on those player responses. Secrets of Grindea has recently hit the Early Access scene and, after a successful demo launch earlier in the year, stands out as a shining example of development done right.\n\nSecrets of Grindea is a 2D RPG in the vein of the older Zelda or 'Of Mana' titles. it has the same charming art style but has a quality of animation that gives the whole game a modern feel, that unfortunately doesn't translate especially well into screenshots. The game focuses on a young boy leaving his village to become a man (stop me if you've heard this one before) and to do so he must first collect his sword and shield and make his way to the nearest town.\n\nOn the way you'll learn the basics of combat and get a real feel for how exceptionally well animated Secrets of Grindea is. The sway of a cloak as you dash, the hunched shoulders of a defensive position and the theatrical swirl as human enemies pirouette to the ground in defeat.\n\nThe premise of the game is, aside from killing and leveling up, that you are a collector. A type of champion who's tasked with chronicling and cataloging things within Grindea's gorgeous and vibrant world. There's a hint of Pokemon about it all, but Secrets of Grindea wears its influences proudly; and why not? This is an excellent reimagining of some classic ideas and franchises.\n\nThe levelling up system itself is more reminiscent of Diablo than any other franchise. As you level up you get skill points which you can put into various areas; magic, defense, skills etc You can unlock new, castable abilities which subsequent points will improve, or level up several of your passive skills. It's adequate, though I'm yet to come across a level up system that I could ever describe as anything other.\n\nI've finished all the content available in Secrets of Grindea's Early Access build outside of the game's Arcade Mode which I'll delve into when the full release arrives. As it stands, though, I would have no reservations about recommending Secrets of Grindea to anyone. It's been a while since a game has been so whimsical, light-hearted and, as simple as it sounds, fun. It's gorgeous, colourful with a stellar soundtrack and is more than an homage to 16 bit classics. This is a faithful re-imagining of the tropes of old with a modern shine and it does it so much better than everyone else. \n\nhttp://www.permanent-beta.net/previews/2015/8/19/early-access-investigations-secrets-of-grindea", "timestamp_created": 1439989994, "timestamp_updated": 1439989994, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495050", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17610103": {"recommendationid": "17610103", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135634033", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5091, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 30, "last_played": 1515746683}, "language": "english", "review": "Killed Slimes until I could wear one as a helmet.\n10/10 would kill slimes again.", "timestamp_created": 1439963967, "timestamp_updated": 1439963967, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458701", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17606132": {"recommendationid": "17606132", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065271471", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1140, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455514327}, "language": "english", "review": "Alright, Secrets of Grindea, played through what the game has in it as of writing this, have been playing the frontline version.

The graphics are very good and well animated (for a 3 person team, from what I've heard!).  But that's probably not what you want to hear; you probably want to hear about the gameplay.\n\nThe attacks are very satisfying, going up two types of charges: silver and gold.  And if you don't like your build, you can use money to reset it, which is very nice.  You're not restricted by classes either, so you can switch freely.  What's better than hitting the (current) last dungeon and ohko'ing everything with your 2h weapon and a crit build?  Probably a billion dollars but if I'm trying to convince you to buy this game, you probably don't have a billion dollars.  Sorry.\n\nThe story is quirky and cute, and the puzzles are pretty easy so it's not hard to get by the story.  The references are great too.  And if the story's not enough for you, but you don't want to do arcade mode, there's always the grind (for loot and cards)!\n\nArcade mode is quite a challenge (at least for me and my trio of inept friends.  Oh god, the bees) but it's fun and so far seeing the perks and trying to get town upgrades motivates me to keep trying. (We've made it to the second floor.  A true display of skill.)\n\nHowever, some things I'm not so keen on, such as:\n\n- Bows.  Do you even really need them? (except for that one area that I won't spoil)  I was doing 1.1k+ damage with a 2h weapon on a crit, but only 255 damage on an arrow crit.  Not to mention that the ammo is limited.  I would like for there be a more traditional ranged weapon class, so I'm hoping that later editions will introduce stronger bows, perhaps.\n\n- For some reason the hair stylist sometimes glitches out and the previews of the hair icons are all glitched.\n\n- Leveling pets is a bigger grind than I thought it'd be, but it's probably because higher level food drops haven't been implemented yet (I'm hoping.  Oh god 1000 apples no why).\n\n- Marino needs to be stopped.  I hope the devs write in a side quest for this.  Thanks.\n\n- CHICKEN HERDING\n\nI'm very much looking forward to future updates and the full release of the game!

I absolutely love co-op RPGs, and this ARPG has potential. It has a Secret of Mana/A Link to the Past vibe, and after trying out the free demo, I immediately bought it. While the game is still in early access, there is plenty to do. Once you run though the story (as far as you can, it's still in development), there are likely still items to craft, a pet to level to increase your stats, and an arcade mode that is challenging and addictive. As of right now, the game has controller support for a wired 360 controller, and you can use software to bind buttons of other controllers to specific keys, so you can make different controllers work (I'm using the PS4 controller) - the game feels great with a controller, so it's definitely worth doing if the keyboard set-up just isn't working for you.\n\nI strongly recommend at least trying the free demo - as there's nothing to lose. It's a relatively small download, and while  you could probably rush through pretty quickly, if you take your time to explore and take things in a little, you'll get a decent amount of content for a demo. The demo can also be played cooperatively, so it's probably worth trying to get a friend or two (or three, if you can) to try it with you!", "timestamp_created": 1438629079, "timestamp_updated": 1438629079, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17363287": {"recommendationid": "17363287", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052912243", "num_games_owned": 937, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2376, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499579874}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]This review is based on the game in its current state at the time of posting and is completely my opinion.

Not a single track sounded out of place in this game.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Things I didn't like all that much[/b]\n[list]\n    [*]The story was a bit short. But that can be attributed to the fact that it's in early access.\n    [*]The limited supply of weapons available was quite disheartening as I found myself wielding the most powerful one-handed sword in the game about 1/2 of the way through the story with not much choice on what else to use.\n    [*]Player customzation is unfortunately incredibly limited with the only changable things being colour of clothing, hair style, hats, and facewear.

Many references, fun story and gameplay but tough as nails bosses.\n\n[Some minor spoilers ahead, be warned]\nWhat is good about this game:\n- Being able to select the visual appearence of one item while keeping the stats of another if you choose. No longer must you choose between style and function. You want a chicken hat with the protection of an iron helmet? you got it.\n- So many references. In my 7 hours I have notices 3 Pokemon references, a Mario reference, multiple Legend of Zelda references, 2 South Park references, a LITERAL Gundam boss, a well-known youtuber cameo in character and probably multiple more that I have missed.\n- Funny dialogue and interesting characters.\n- Impressive variety of skills to learn and base your playstyle on. (Several elements with 3 spells each plus many one and two handed weapon skills)\n\nWhat is bad/can be improved:\n- Menus are a bit annoying. For example if I want to make something and I lack the items needed, I can see if I have enough of item A, if I need more of item B or if I havent discovered Item C, BUT It will not tell me how much MORE of item B I need, which is a bit annoying. The difference between Silver points, Gold points and Talent orbs could also be explained better. I got a fair way into the game before realising what Talent orbs were and that I could spend them.\n- Some of the bosses feel a bit like Bullet Hells, and it can be VERY frustrating having to redo bosses over and over again since you keep dying to an onslaught of attacks on the screen. Maybe this is intended and I'm just not used to the difficulty, but I think if it is impossible to beat a boss with 1hp, you are doing something wrong as the boss is becoming less Skill based and more Luck based (such as the [spoiler]Winter[/spoiler] boss, where he [spoiler]teleports several times and creates multiple ice pillars while launching fists of snow. He can effectively box you in to a point where you end up being hurt by his fist because you cannot move, or by the spikes as you try to avoid said fist[/spoiler]. Or the [spoiler]Present machine where you have 6 presents, multiple bombs falling from the ceiling and several trains moving past[/spoiler]).\n- Block mechanics can be improved slightly. I find myself taking damage if I drop my shield after an attack, even if the enemy has moved back or the projectile has vanished.\n\nI have high hopes for this game and hopefully this game is finished into the masterpiece it has the potential to be, and isn't another forgotten Early Access game.", "timestamp_created": 1438295580, "timestamp_updated": 1438295580, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539796", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17303978": {"recommendationid": "17303978", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020610922", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4401, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513547636}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is absolutely awesome!\nThe game provides a great story and a mind thinking gameplay!

If you stay in one place and kill things for a bit you will see that enemies will begin to spawn more and more frequently. This allows for quick leveling and farming for items. It also means that grinding gets more challenging in that spot. It is well worth it for more than just leveling, enemies can also drop special cards that give your character permanent stat boosts.\n\nI could go on but I think one would really have to play the game to get a good impression.

I did this because I felt I didn't need to know much about the game, my very first impression from the trailer and a youtube video sold me on the spot. And I can say, roughly 9 hours into the game as of this review, that my first impression was spot on. If you enjoy the classic action RPGs of the 1990's and early 2000's, such as Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, Illusion of Gaia, or (obviously) Secret of Mana, then this game is for you and is well worth your time, money, and intrigue.\n\nFrom my perspective, this game offers 4 distinct areas of interest that define the experience:\n[list]\n[*]Story Mode \n[*]Arcade Mode\n[*]Multiplayer\n[*]The Progression System (Skills and Talents) \n[/list]\nI will be covering all 4, explaining my experiences and impressions of each.\n\n[h1]STORY MODE[/h1]\nWhile a bit lacking in the engaging story aspect, Secret of Grindea's (SoG) Story Mode offers something many RPGs have failed to have for a while now: the elegance of simplicity. Many modern titles have an obsession with creating a novel's worth of narrative. Cutscene after cutscene, wall of text after wall of text, the experience of these titles are moreso about the story and presentation of it than the actual game.\n\nSoG takes the short and simple approach, where it gives enough story and narrative to provide context and motivation, but is spaced well enough where it does not feel like a chore to read through it all (having the option to skip cutscenes helps too). Not to say that the story isn't interesting, though. While simple and somewhat of a parady of other RPGs, many of the characters are likeable in their own right and their clever interactions are both entertaining and humurous. It's clear a lot of heart was put into the devolpment of this game from all of the silly and minor references to other games and characters.\n\nPutting aside the storytelling aspect of SoG, there's quite a bit of content packed into what is currently available (game is still in beta as of this review). From collectables, to crafting, to minigames, puzzles, Zelda-esque dungeons, side quests, arena challenges, and engaging and replayable boss fights, there's a lot to do. But my favorite aspects are the inclusion of a genuinely difficult hard mode that can be toggled on or off at any time and the ability to customize the look of your character in the form of hats and accessories (that override the look of your currently equipped armor).\n\nTo review:\n\nPros:\n[list]\n[*]Simple but effective narrative\n[*]Interesting and humurous dialogue\n[*]Plethora of activities, side quests, and minigames\n[*]Interesting boss fights\n[*]Hard Mode\n[/list]\n\nCons:\n[list]\n[*]Game not complete (with no ETA)\n[/list]\n\n[h1]ARCADE MODE[/h1]\nArguably, this is where most of your time will go. This mode is SoG's roguelike feature, where you attempt to progress as far as you can through a serious of increasingly challenging rooms and obstacles on a single life. Much in the way of other roguelikes (such as Rogue Legacy), you have the ability the make succeeding runs easier in the form of unlocking perks. These are unlocked via a currency you obtain randomly as a drop and from completing quests and achievments.\n\nThe farther you go and the better you do, the more points you will recieve. After each death, your points are tallied up and added to your total score across all games. After certain thresholds have been met, you will revieve rewards, such as cosmetics (hats and accessories), more NPCs to interact with, and more buildings/decorations for your hub. There is also a global leaderboard for the mode, so if you're into that sort of thing you can sate your fancy here.\n\nAs for the actual content of the mode, it's challenging but rewarding. Like any other roguelikes, there are a lot of elements of randomness involved. The dungeon layout, challenges in each room, and the loot you get are all up to chance. However, this works as the combat system is based on skill moreso than raw stats. You will get farther in the dungeon because you got better rather than because you got some good luck on your drops. You find that you are excited to get as far as you can as that shows just how much better you got at the game more than anything else.\n\nPros:\n[list]\n[*]Unlockable Perks\n[*]Achievments\n[*]Leaderboard\n[*]Replayability\n[/list]\n\nCons:\n[list]\n[*]Can have a somewhat harsh learning curve\n[*]Can feel repetative at times\n[*]Like story mode, not all of the floors are implemented yet.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]MULTIPLAYER[/h1]\nWhile I have no personal experience with this feature myself, I have seen examples of this in videos and streams. From what I have seen, multiplayer is fairly smooth and simple to do. Multiplayer is available for both Story Mode and Arcade Mode, so if you have a group of friends you can enjoy all aspects of the game together with up to 4 people.\n\nBe that as it may, it's not perfect. Currently, there is no option to play with your friends locally. You will need to connect to each other through different computers, and each person will need to have a copy. Additionally, it lacks some quality of life functions such as being able to join someone from your friends list. And, as one would expect from online play, there can exist some connection issues and bugs (although I've yet to see any).\n\nPros:\n[list]\n[*]Can play with up to 4 people\n[*]Can play in both Story Mode and Arcade Mode\n[*]Smooth and stable online play\n[/list]\n\nCons:\n[list]\n[*]Can have some connection issues and bugs\n[*]Lacks QoL polish\n[*]No Local Play\n[/list]\n\n[h1]SKILLS AND TALENTS[/h1]\nAn RPG needs to have some form of progression, and SoG does it with it's ability system. What makes this one stand out from the rest is its simplicity and its lack of restrictions. There are no skill trees, no level/stat requirements, you just choose the skills you like and roll with it. And so much is added to this game because of it.\n\nThere are a varity of skills that appeal to all forms of play, be it aggressive, defensive, evasive, melee, range, single target, AoE, Burst, DoT, etc. And given the lack of restrictions on obtaining skills, you can create a massive amount of different and interesting builds. Want to be an aggressive and fast melee striker? Go for it. Want to be a long-ranged magic nuker? Sure! Want to combine both melee and magic for a hybrid spellsword? That's cool too.\n\nAdditionally, a lot of the skills from different branches work well together. For instance, Static shock is a spell that will do additionally damage very time you hit with a physcial attack. You can restore charges for this skill from using physical skills or doing perfect guards, meaning this skill can be used in all kinds of builds, both offensive and defensive.\n\nWhile I would argue a need for more skills, the simplicity of the current design is also appealing and useful. While some talents prove to be more useful than others, many of the skills have their uses and can work well given the right circumsances.\n\nIn the end, what gives this game a lot of replayability, both in Story Mode and in Arcade Mode, is the progression system and the appeal of trying out new builds and tactics.\n\nPros:\n[list]\n[*]Non-restrictive\n[*]Skills work well together\n[*]Interesting and thoughtful effects\n[*]Easy to make and try new builds and tactics\n[*]Simple and easy to understand\n[/list]\n\nCons:\n[list]\n[*]Some talents not as useful as others\n[*]Arguably not enough skills to facilitate variety\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1437798428, "timestamp_updated": 1437798428, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.653684", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17214085": {"recommendationid": "17214085", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058378464", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1020, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1439088439}, "language": "english", "review": "For an as-yet-to-be-finished product, this has to be some of the best $15 I have yet to spend.

from a lot of games from the SNES era of RPGs. The game is played from a top-down perspective and combat is done in real-time, comparable to Secret of Mana and 2D Legend of Zelda games. If you like the combat in those games you'll probably enjoy Secrets of Grindea.\n\nThe skill and customization options in the game are very unique in how much freedom the game gives you as a player. The game gives you several options as far as play styles, but you can mix and match the skills as you desire and create a unique playstyle and skill set for yourself. You're also given 2 cosmetic item slots for your characters to customize your hat and/or face accessory so that you can look good, but keep the stats of much better items instead.\n\nThe Pixel art is great, everything looks vibrant and is very reminiscent of the SNES era, but at the same time has a very modern feel. The Music is fits well, and is exactly what you'd expect from most RPGs. The humor and references are great, if you've played a lot of RPGs, you'll really appreciate the games' dialogue and subtle nods to other franchises.\n\nThe Arcade mode adds great replayability to the game by adding a roguelike element in randomly generated areas and starting from the beginning if you die, great for those looking for a challenge and wanting more of the game.\n\nDid I mention the game supports (Online) Multiplayer? It does, this game can be even more fun with friends! You can go through the Story Mode or Arcade together and this only adds to the game's merits. Local Co-Op is currently unsupported unfortunately.\n\nAt the time of writing this review, the game is in early access and incomplete and Story Mode is a bit short, but I strongly suggest trying out the demo and trying the game for yourself.

However it also adds in some nice new shiny features, the biggest one being build customization. I guess the closest comparison on the build system would be something like Skyrim or Kingdoms of Amular: Reckoning (as in non linear, pick whatever you want but there's still progression within each). \n\n  The controls are responsive however being an old goat I got hand cramps after the first hour and switched to Xbox 360 controller and enjoyed it a lot more after that (could still probably be solved with some manual rebinding). It's a little quirky to get used to the menu controls being that it behaves exactly like an old SNES title (no mouse, nested menus button press down and back up).\n\n  The dialogue is pretty funny, it has a lot of fourth wall humor often poking fun at itself and the genre. So far the score is decent but I'm only a few hours in.\n\n  I got a few friends to buy it and we've been playing together and having a blast, the steam integration makes this super easy. You can choose whether to scale the leveling or not which seems nice but hasn't actually been tested by me yet, we're all pretty low level so I didn't see the point. Also loot options can be customized I didn't bother though as round robin seemed to work, the nice thing is it seems that if you haven't got a chest yet in story mode and another player opens it up you still get it. It doesn't seem to scale the enemies much in 2 player, so you can sort of cheese some content by ressurecting a downed player, but you have to time it properly so I guess it's not the end of the world. Oh and other than that, there's no healing in the game beyond picking up a certain drop (sort of like old Mega-Man games).\n\n I was nervous buying on early access but feel that this genre was worth the investment, we don't see many and I was pleasently suprised by the quality of this early access and the decent amount of difficulty in the game, you'll probably die quite a bit, but it's pretty fair. So yeah would recommend.\n\nEDIT: After playing with 3 the difficulty does indeed scale, though perhaps not enough I removed the con from the list.", "timestamp_created": 1437403399, "timestamp_updated": 1437947472, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500380", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17140900": {"recommendationid": "17140900", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095543821", "num_games_owned": 378, "num_reviews": 102, "playtime_forever": 2058, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505338373}, "language": "english", "review": "i played the demo for 1 hour and i know this will be amazing adventure.

This game also has amazing level design that makes you want to keep playing and playing. The mobs in the game are fun to fight agensts and learn how they work and move, and from the start to the end of the game the mob design gets better and better keeping the game intresting and fun. And once you've killed enough of the mobs you can then move to the MANY Bosses this game has and there are one of the great aspects of this game, the boss disign is amazing, kinda remids me of a Dark Souls boss disign with how you have to learn the bosses and see how to fight them, some are easier than others but i feel as the game progresses in development they will only get better and better. Another great feature of the game is the skill pages. theres so many skills you can pick from to improve your character. I cant really explain it but as soon as you look at it you'll know what i mean.

The gameplay is very intuitive and fun, and the story is great. You are a collector, and you explore the world looking for cool loot, when you discover that you bag is a living artifact, created long ago, and he's not the only one. In the temples of this game, you must get the artifact at the end, and it seems repetitive, but the game has different ways of getting you into the temple, and (of the two that are in the game currently) each temple has it's own gimmick that makes it stand out from the other(s). \n          If you finish the story as it is now, there is an alternate mode which has more of a Binding of Issac gameplay style as you go through randomly generated floors and fight monsters and attain treasure. But there's a twist; As you progress and earn points through playing Arcade mode, your town upgrades and you can do different things in the town. \n          None of my friends have this game so I haven't gotten to play multiplayer, but if it's as good as single player, I'll love it. \n          Basically, this game has no class restrictions, so you're allowed to grab whatever spells you want, as long as you have skill points, which I absolutely LOVE. This makes chaining spells with your melee attacks incredibly fun and rewarding, but one con I have with this game is that some spells aren't in the game yet.\n          Buy this game if you have the patience to wait until ths game reaches its full potential.", "timestamp_created": 1437337081, "timestamp_updated": 1437337081, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17129335": {"recommendationid": "17129335", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020571618", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 1979, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470170997}, "language": "english", "review": "Note, before anything else I just want to direct you to this: http://www.secretsofgrindea.com/index.php/dev-blog\n\nThis is the dev blog. as you can see, this has been in development for four years, and over the course of these years, they have keeping us up to date, with less the a post per week being non-existent for a long time now.

There are people who care about you and don't wish to see you go down this path (not me per se, we've only just met. But I'm sure there are people who love you very much. Like your grandmother or that neighbor with the nice rack. Anyway, I'm going off topic here).\n\nSecrets of Grindea is a tongue-in-cheek RPG that draws heavily on the nostalgia of games like Secrets of Mana, Zelda: Link to the Past, and Illusion of Gaia. The sprite animations and colorful backgrounds mimic classic 16-bit games and go well with the fluidity of combat. NPCs are prevalent in towns and in the overworld to the point where the world does not feel empty and that their character is not some lone warrior living on a planet full of monsters (though that sounds like an awesome game idea. Dibs). Each area has its own unique feel that you will hopefully enjoy because the aforementioned grinding will have you staying in one area killing the same enemies for drops.\n\nThe combat is extremely straight forward where your basic attack is spamming one button or having a charged skill where you hold and release one button. Let me go on record to say that I do not think this is a bad thing. Sure, you won't be chaining attacks that culminate in your wooden sword hitting with the power of a tactical nuclear device, but you will be unlocking and upgrading skills that define the way you, the player, wish to play. The skills are limited (for now I hope) to a 1 handed skill set, 2 handed skill set, and a magic skill set. The player is able to mix and match these skills however he or she wants and has the option to refund some or all of the skill points that were spent by spending gold (this is done in the menu rather than with an NPC). There is a bow the player can get from a sidequest but so far doesn't have a dedicated set of skills to leveling up the damage.\n\nThe story is pretty straightforward for an RPG of the era it emulates: You are a guy or gal that wakes up, is handing a magical bag that can hold anything without weight restrictions and are sent out to become a renowned member of the \"Collectors\". It seems, from the start, that these \"Collectors\" are a bunch of people that go out and collect cool, rare things. It is all very prestigious. And dangerous. And sexy. Seriously, so far every NPC that isn't a Collector is jealous of you. Normally one would have to buy seven sports cars and have an attractive life mate to get that kind of recognition. This game hands that to you right off the bat (Disclaimer: The developers of this game will NOT buy you cars nor introduce you to hot people for a hook up).\n\nMy main concern with the game is that it seems too short and I say that knowing full well that not all the features in the game have been implemented; this is not the reason that I feel the game is too short. The in-game journal keeps a record of all the enemies in the game and what they drop when killed. Enemies you haven't killed yet appear in the journal as silhouettes. Upon counting (yes, I did a math) I found that there are only about thirty (30) enemies total in the game including boss enemies. This, in my opinion, is a low number which may make gamers shy away from the game. An increase in not just the number of potential enemies but different types of enemies will add more variety to the grinding while still keeping the player's interest high. I eagerly await the areas that have not yet been implemented to the game.\n\nNow, I'm not going to end this review by giving the game a number based off of 5 nor 10 nor 325745456415 (<--- not sure what this number is. It just punched my Numpad to come up with something ridiculous). I will end this review with just a few simple words:\n\nI enjoy this game.\n\n\n\nI hope you enjoy it too.\n\nStill enjoying the game after so long.", "timestamp_created": 1437206724, "timestamp_updated": 1479958413, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 69, "votes_funny": 59, "weighted_vote_score": "0.784566", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17103529": {"recommendationid": "17103529", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013001990", "num_games_owned": 320, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 1033, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495959177}, "language": "english", "review": "Solid game out of 10!", "timestamp_created": 1437204169, "timestamp_updated": 1437204169, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17101998": {"recommendationid": "17101998", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000097740", "num_games_owned": 1170, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 30193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1439727715}, "language": "english", "review": "good game only played it a little bit though :)", "timestamp_created": 1437192827, "timestamp_updated": 1437192827, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 101, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475031", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17101697": {"recommendationid": "17101697", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081712851", "num_games_owned": 421, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 539, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442593789}, "language": "english", "review": "(TL;DR version at bottom)\n\nJUST BUY IT ALREADY, THIS GAME IS AMAZING IT'S LIKE...

Unfortunatly, I have a couple of opinions :/ First of all, I think that pets should be able to help out in fights. Second, I think that Mages are a little OP. Third, there should be SOME form of regen like Health Potions sold at the Alchemy Shop, or some kind of Spell that restores health. Forth, Boars are insanly difficult and frustrating to battle considering they are incredibly fast and deal heavy damage, so you cant easily take them down without heavy damage. It doesn't really help that you have to perfectly time a Quick-Block. Fifth, I found an easy way to exploit the fact that you can cut off the attack recharge by Quick-Blocking. For example, if I were to Attack and Block really quickly alternating, i can attack twice a second and deall about 400 damage per second. I also used a whole lot of differant things that i could label as a little broken. First, Phillip (what I call the adorable little snow monster), I want to know whether or not i shoul consider him broken.

These drops are listed in some kind of codex but unless you find them, they are blackened out. Besides that there are also very rare cards which drop only once and improves your characters abilities permanently. These two features provide a lot of motivation randomly hunting monsters for their loot while following the main storyline on the side. It's almost a pokemon-like feeling where you try to complete your pokedex.\n\nAs I said, I haven't played much, but till now the story is pretty basic stuff. Starting in a small village, doing a test to finally become whatsoever and heading out to great adventures. This is not necessarily a bad point, because you still keep track of the story, even if you skip some dialogues. The dialogues on the other side are quite funny and self-ironic. They make fun of some very stale RPG-cliches, like the bottomless bag of the game's main character.\n\nThe main story holds up with some big boss battles, which are more or less challenging, depending on how much you grind on the side. If a boss can drop unique loot, the battle can also be repeated at any time. As far as I discovered, the game also provides some side-activities like fishing or treasure-hunting. \n\nThe game's skill system allow to spend an active skillpoint in melee, magic or supportive and a passive skillpoint in general, melee or magic on each levelup. There are some skills that aren't implemented yet, because the game is still in early access. Nevertheless there are plenty available skills which can be combined freely. Every skill can be charged up to unleash a more powerful attack, which variates based on the amount of skillpoints put into a single skill. All in all the skill-system provides a wide range of different gaming-styles.\n\nAlso, there is an arcade mode, where you have only one life to conquer a randomly generated world. Everytime you die, you start all over again in a newly generated world. But there are some unlockable permanent advantages.\n\nSummary: Buy the game!

Though there isn't much content in the story mode which i find strange because this game has been in development for years now and they have only managed to finish two temples and a few zones (then they have the cheek of asking for money to go towards coffee breaks in the form of day one DLC) it's still a great bit of fun and the arcade mode adds a lot of replayability. I can't say i'm a fan of the fact they have placed in a online leaderboards as to me that encourages cheating and there's no way you're going to get the #1 spot unless you too cheat and then it makes it seem pointless to do if you're wanting to take part in the arcade mode for the competitive purpose of beating other players. Though this is and the current lack of content in the story mode (at the time of this build i'm sure this will change in later versions) are my only complaints about the game.\n\nThe music and sound effects are spot on and you can tell they have heavy inspiration from older RPG games and has a great nostalgic feel about it. I played through the game co-op with one friend and i have to say the net code is spot on and we had no problems with lag what so ever and the game seemed input perfect along with not being too restricted to where you can go in co-op. You and your allies still all have to commit to going to a new zone before the game takes you all there but you're not bound together when you're in that zone. The gameplay is flawless in design too and you feel like you have all the control over your character and when you fuck up and die it is YOUR fault and not the game's. The game has the perfect balance of fun and challenge and the spells/abilities all seem to have their uses though some seem a lot weaker early game and some also seem a lot weaker later game so it's worth experimenting with the abilities as some may be more usefull early game but end up being weak towards the end.\n\nHighly recommend checking this gem out as it lives up to the hype and i am extremely excited in seeing what they add in future updates.", "timestamp_created": 1436983997, "timestamp_updated": 1495055577, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0,

I will be going into a lot of detail about the game and why I love it so much, so hold on to your seats!\n\nGameplay\n\nThe game has a story mode and an Arcade Mode. The story mode is currently unfinished (along with the Arcade Mode), but the game currently boasts a lot of sidequests and collectables along with the story. I have managed to collect almost all of the cards (the rarest collectables in the game, one unique to all normal enemies) as of the 15th of July and I continue to collect even more in the future when I have the time and patience to do so! The game features many sidequests, puzzles and hidden items to find and collect, which required thinking and pure potential in your combatting skills. Currently, the game is very difficult in its Arcade Mode and Hard Mode of the story. \n\nArcade Mode is the true challenge of the game and the main feature that people will come back to after beating the story. Similar to many roguelike indie games such as The Binding of Isaac and many more titles, the game offers a mode that offers permanent death and restarting all over again upon death, which will truly test your skills. Many of the enemies are buffed up versions of monsters seen in the later parts of the story, beefed up bosses from the story mode and some completely unique enemies that are not (yet) available in the story mode. For anybody who likes roguelike games, this is for you! This also is a good option to play the game without the story being spoiled for yourself if you would like to play the story from the beginning until the end with no interuptions!\n\nFor you bustling people with many friends, both modes offer multiplayer aspects, but more people doesn't come with no risk. More players often means newer moves (at least in the story mode) and higher enemy HP, that truly will test your skill instead of making the game a breeze. \n\nSoundtrack\n\nThe soundtrack of the game isn't extremely special, but the music fits the game very well and really creates the mood of the game. Often faster-paced/more upbeat versions of the songs in the story mode are used in Arcade Mode corresponding to the area that they are found in. The music is definitely highly atmospheric and I definitely reccomend the soundtrack for any outer-game listening purposes!\n\nDesign/Artwork\n\nThe art of the game is very detailed and is drawn to a great extent. All of the places in the game are drawn in photoshop and in good detail. Sprites and other things are done seperately but the game blends in and really feels alive. Many of the animations used in the game are done very well and the artwork to follow the characters are also done to perfection. The game is crisp and looks good all the time!\n\nOverall Rating\n\nI think this game is possibly my favourite game I've played in a very very long time, and the game isn't even finished yet. I would definitely reccomend this game to anybody who wants a good game!\n\nRating:\n9.5/10\n\n+ Great Visuals and Animations\n+ Replayability is done very well\n+ Challenging compelling gameplay\n+ Completionists Lucid Dream\n\n- Some game artwork scaled down and doesn't look as good as the original\n- The game isn't out yet, not the full experience yet.\n\nIf you would like to form your own opinion, there is also a Demo.

Every enemy in the game has at least one rare \"drop\" to collect so this really is a game for players who love to collect/farm/grind! There is also a crafting system that can *GASP* actually make powerful and useful gear!\n\nThe combat gives off vibes of Secret of Mana but its much less rigid and limited than the old school RPGs of yore are. You can choose freely amongst 1h melee with shield, 2h melee and 4 schools of magic (Fire, Earth, Ice and Air). You invest skill points into whatever skill you desire and then the combat becomes an awesome weave of offense and defense as you bust out your skills in real-time!\n\nBoss battles are great and plentiful as well! Really, this is a great action oriented RPG with a major emphasis on its addicting collection system (GRINDea, get it? :P) Usually \"grinding\" is looked poorly upon but honestly its quite addicting in this game and every enemy and boss can be beaten without taking a single point of damage so ultimately you don't actually have to grind - if you're really good!", "timestamp_created": 1436811818, "timestamp_updated": 1436811818, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567669", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17030262": {"recommendationid": "17030262", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011047574", "num_games_owned": 377, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 422, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480097388}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is so much fun, especially in coop.

Quick swordplay with an oldschool-meets-polish aesthetic that's filled with charm. Combat is quick paced and - with over 20 skills and spells with multiple charge levels, along with 30 talents - more or less unique for every character made. Every attack, skill and spell feels as if it has weight behind it for a thoroughly satisfying brawl through hordes of monsters and challenging bosses.\n\nThe story is serious at times, tongue in cheek in others without outright resorting to cheese. There's plenty of side-quests, mini-games and collectables, but contrary to the name no grinding appears to be necessary. The shield is as relevant to the gameplay as the sword is, every attack can be blocked if you know the exact timing, reminding me of the days of 'Timed Hits' from Super Mario RPG and Final Fantasy 8.\n\nThe music is beautiful, the characters well written to make you love or hate them, I can't say enough good things about Story Mode. The only shame is it's incomplete, but between pet taming, treasure hunting, fishing, card collecting, playing with 4 player online co-op and duking it out in the arena, there's more than enough content to keep me busy between updates.\n\n[b]Arcade Mode[/b]: All the rules from Story Mode no longer apply, Arcade Mode feels like an entirely different game. Less Secret of Mana, more Binding of Isaac. You start in an empty plain and delve within a randomized roguelike-esque labyrinth. Each room is different every time, filled with traps and all manners of enemies or bosses not present in Story Mode. HP is precious, mastery of skills, spells and shielding is required.\n\nArcade Mode is perfect for sinking endless hours into as you try to go deeper and deeper into the labyrinth, gaining points and essence to level up and expand your town, unlock new NPCs to aid you, take on quests for rare and unique loot not found anywhere else. Skills and spells are best experimented with in here to see which build suits you best. With friends it's harder, but with 4 people on screen the monsters barely stand a chance once you hit your groove. The online leaderboards for Arcade Mode help to give it even more replay value by trying to do better than your friends or complete strangers to try and hit #1.\n\nIf you have any doubts whatsoever, try the demo. With an hour of Story Mode gameplay, several hours of Arcade Mode and co-op bundled into the demo, it's a great teaser for what to expect moving forward.\n\n[b]Tip[/b]: Opt into 'Frontline' by selecting SoG in your library if you want quicker updates. The normal version receives slower updates, but your experience in the game will be much smoother.", "timestamp_created": 1436806964, "timestamp_updated": 1436807634, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 66, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.812406", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17029918": {"recommendationid": "17029918", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053887834", "num_games_owned": 172, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2513, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514225415}, "language": "german", "review": "This game ist just awesome!!!!\n\nThe story ist at the moment not that much playtime i guess 12-16 hours with everything.\n\nBut there is also an arcade mode which is pretty fun frustraiting and hard XD\n\nYou can unlock there stuff for the story mode and upgraid the town in arcade mode.\nThe items you get there for story are not need but its cool when you get cat hats and stuff :D\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1436806552, "timestamp_updated": 1436806552, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499357", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17029673": {"recommendationid": "17029673", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021839074", "num_games_owned": 329, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 478, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508130486}, "language": "english", "review": "This game reminds me of secret of mana wich is good\nThis game has nice pixel art\nThis game is awesome but not complete\nBuy this to support the dev\nCant wait for this game to be released", "timestamp_created": 1436805734, "timestamp_updated": 1436805734, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.468500", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17029525": {"recommendationid": "17029525", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014202143", "num_games_owned": 275, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2519, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509029527}, "language": "german", "review": "Tolles Spiel.

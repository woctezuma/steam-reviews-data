It is exactly as described and it delivers exactly what it says, but I lost interest quickly.  I would like it more with an 'undo' and some sort of measurement of gallery visitor reactions (like a tally of how many people visited and percentage or count of their reactions to various paintings -- and maybe a way to mark a painting 'ready' so visitors aren't critiquing blank canvases). \n\nPros: \nnice music\nnice reactions from gallery visitors\nnice stencils, though limited \nrelaxing\n\nCons: \nno undo \nno mirroring effect\nlimited rotation options\nthe extra stencils you can buy are more numerous, but a stencil is a stencil.\ngallery visitors don't count for anything, so there's no point trying to please some majority (which, to be fair, isn't that different from the actual art world)\n\nOverall, the controls are too limited to let you do any meaningful 'art' so to make something nice, you are better off editing elsewhere and manually adding to your gallery -- but then why are you bothering to add anything to gallery rather than posting it to your favorite

I exchanged photos with friends and it was really fun making a game out of it. Out of all, I totally reccomend you play, but if you want to know more, read below.\n\n\nCanvas The Gallery is an artistic game to \"Express Yourself\".  Albeit that could totally be what it's used for, I just fucked around in it, spraypainted the walls and pissed off my visitors. The game is amazing, although it does deserve more mechanics, maybe this game could be turned into the classic Artist sim, where you create your art and then sell it to unsuspecting customers who think it looks like total shit and tip you 4 dollars, because they're dissapointed but still feel bad. All jokes aside, the game needs a bit more polish but I think it really just needs better models, textures, sounds and a new UI. The plain, basic UI of this game is boring and bland compared to the game and its' creativity. I reccomend a UI creator for the community, possibly a workshop for it because like I mentioned before, it looks bad. Really bad. The spray paint animations need a bit of redoing, especially when switching to a new color because a mist of the color you chose goes everywhere and just doesn't make much sense. The model doesn't look the best, but it's not that important. I do feel that there needs to be a day-night cycle in the game just because, it'd be nice to see the paintings in different, more ambient lighting. Possibly a new place to paint or a different section with different sized canvases.\n\nOverall, this game is great and is definetely deserving of a go, being free and all. And I totally think you should buy the DLC, it may not be much and you may not use it every day, but the devs need the money so that they can update this game and possibly make it into much more than it already is. I love this game.\n\n\nTl;Dr: Get the game, and get the DLC if you can afford it. The game needs a bit of polish but is great.

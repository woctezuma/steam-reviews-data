The game is laid out like a metroidvania-lite.  What I mean by that is that there is one big level and as you gain new abilities as you progress, these abilities let you access new areas, and these areas are designed to use these abilities to their fullest.  The reason I say \"lite\" is because there is very little backtracking(a good thing IMO), once you finish an area you get warped back to the start of the game and then you can use the acquired ability to reach a new area.  \n\nThe gimmick of this game is that it only uses 2 buttons, left and right on the keyboard, or L and R on the controller.  The control is super responsive but the odd control scheme may cause some to shy away from it.  When I first started playing the game I loved it, as more abilities became unlocked my enjoyment of the game faltered a bit as I was dying more to the control than the obstacles. I gave up on the game and posted a negative review.  \n\nThe developer saw my review and we began talking about it, he then messed around with the code of the game a bit and emailed me a version of the game that addressed my concern, and the game played like a dream.  The fact that a developer would take the time to listen to the complaints of a single customer and implement a fix tailored for that customer is pretty mindboggling.  Developers who care this much about their customers are a rare breed and this fact alone is enough for me to want to support him.\n\nHaving said that, once the fix was implemented the game played like a dream.  The controls are super tight and the game offers a very nice challenge.  This game is tough, everything kills you in one hit and there are tons of obstacles everywhere.  There are very liberal checkpoints in the levels and instant respawns which means the game is rarely frustrating, it is simply addicting and each death makes you want to try one more time.  \n\nLevel design in this game is perfect, each level looks unique, and is loaded with unique challenges tailored to that level and that particular ability used to access it.  The variety of obstacles in this game keep things fresh and it never gets boring in the 2-3 hours or so it will take you to beat this game.  \n\nIf you want a great retro themed platformer with an interesting gimmick, give this game a try.", "timestamp_created": 1509321839, "timestamp_updated": 1510461383, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.627657", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36121380": {"recommendationid": "36121380", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077889168", "num_games_owned": 1885, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 176, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510435220}, "language": "english", "review": "Only two buttons is a shitty idea.

Voc\u00ea pode pensar que isso \u00e9 imposs\u00edvel, j\u00e1 que esse estilo de jogo \u00e9 caracterizado por um mapa aberto, no qual o jogador coleta habilidades para passar por caminhos que inicialmente est\u00e3o fechados, mas acredite, o jogo entrega o que promete.\n\nBasicamente, os comandos do jogo se resumem a ir para direita e esquerda, sendo que outros movimentos adquiridos durante o jogo, s\u00e3o combina\u00e7\u00f5es entre esses comandos, como o pulo que pode ser usado quando voc\u00ea apertar rapidamente o bot\u00e3o duas vezes para o lado desejado. Os comandos respondem muitos bem tendo em vista a limita\u00e7\u00e3o a qual o jogo se imp\u00f5e, pois a primeira vista, o uso de apenas dois bot\u00f5es pode dar a impress\u00e3o que o jogo ser\u00e1 mais simples, mas em v\u00e1rios momentos desejei poder ativar as habilidades com um bot\u00e3o separado para ter maior precis\u00e3o e acredite, voc\u00ea vai ter que ser bem preciso ao usar essas habilidades, pois a dificuldade \u00e9 insanamente alta. Em v\u00e1rias salas, em que eu entrei, pensei que n\u00e3o tinha como passar, mas tentando diversas vezes acabei conseguindo, o que despertava em mim aquele sentimento de realmente superar desafios, assim como os jogos antigos faziam.\n\nCom o tempo, peguei o jeito, o que foi um m\u00e9rito do jogo, pois ele sabe que o uso dessas habilidades n\u00e3o \u00e9 algo exatamente f\u00e1cil de dominar e que ele pretende cobrar que o jogador as domine bem, por isso, o jogo te ensina a usar as habilidades sem nenhum tutorial, atrav\u00e9s do pr\u00f3prio design de fases. Por exemplo, logo depois de pegar a habilidade de pulo, voc\u00ea s\u00f3 pode sair de l\u00e1 saltando alguns buracos os quais v\u00e3o ficam mais dif\u00edceis de forma gradual, isto \u00e9, o jogo testa as suas habilidades e te ensina como us\u00e1-las sem que voc\u00ea perceba que na verdade aquilo \u00e9 um tutorial, o que mostra o qu\u00e3o bem feito \u00e9 o design de fases. Os desafios nem sempre exigem apenas habilidade, pois alguns deles s\u00e3o quebra cabe\u00e7as que demandam uma resolu\u00e7\u00e3o para poder seguir em frente.\n\nA simplicidade domina o design de Necrosphere. O jogo n\u00e3o conta com muitos recursos, mas usa os poucos que tem de formas diferentes e criativas. Muito dif\u00edcil voc\u00ea pensar que uma sala \u00e9 parecida com a outra, isso inclusive ajuda o jogador a se guiar pelo cen\u00e1rio de mundo aberto, pois o jogo n\u00e3o conta com um mapa como outros metroidvanias, mas raramente n\u00e3o sabia para onde ir. As novas habilidades tamb\u00e9m facilitam a explora\u00e7\u00e3o, para que o jogador n\u00e3o tenha que passar por partes dif\u00edceis novamente, deixando a procura pelo caminho certo n\u00e3o ser t\u00e3o frustrante. Se voc\u00ea ainda estiver se perdendo, existem marcadores por todos os locais, os quais se acendem quando o personagem passa e assim voc\u00ea saber\u00e1 por onde passou. Esses recursos deixam Necrosphere ser muito mais divertido de explorar, pois como n\u00e3o tem mapa, voc\u00ea sente que \u00e9 o cara com o maior senso de dire\u00e7\u00e3o, desbravando um cen\u00e1rio sem ajuda nenhuma, mas na verdade est\u00e1 sendo guiado sem saber.\n\nO que deixa o desafio menos frustrante \u00e9 que assim que voc\u00ea morre, sem carregamento nenhum, voc\u00ea volta para o \u00faltimo checkpoint, um ponto que o jogo salva automaticamente bem perto do local da sua morte. Ainda sim, em alguns momentos, eu empaquei e resolvi parar de jogar um pouco para descarregar a frustra\u00e7\u00e3o, o que \u00e9 uma pr\u00e1tica recomendada para aproveitar melhor um jogo t\u00e3o dif\u00edcil. Para voc\u00eas terem uma ideia, uma das conquistas na Steam \u00e9 finalizar o jogo morrendo menos de 100 vezes. Sabe quantas vezes eu morri para finalizar esse jogo? 1659 vezes. Isso mesmo 1659. Eu desafio algu\u00e9m a desbloquear uma das conquistas mais dif\u00edceis da Steam que \u00e9 finalizar esse jogo sem morrer NENHUMA VEZ. N\u00e3o tem como.\n\nSei que muitos n\u00e3o gostam de gr\u00e1ficos pixelados demais, mas eu n\u00e3o tenho esse problema e at\u00e9 acho charmoso, por esse motivo, gostei bastante da apresenta\u00e7\u00e3o de Necrosphere, mas poderia passar um pouco mais a ideia de mundo de vida ap\u00f3s a morte, no qual a hist\u00f3ria tenta imergir o jogador, o que n\u00e3o faz muita diferen\u00e7a no final das contas, pois acredito que quem vai jogar algo assim, est\u00e1 mais interessado em jogar do que ver uma hist\u00f3ria.\n\nO fator que mais amenizou a frustra\u00e7\u00e3o de morrer tantas vezes foi a trilha sonora, que sem d\u00favida \u00e9 o ponto alto do game. Ela \u00e9 agitada e viciante, sendo divertida mesmo depois de ouvir uma mesma faixa diversas vezes.\n\nNecrosphere acaba sendo um jogo para aquelas pessoas curiosas por uma experi\u00eancia de jogabilidade diferente e que buscam um bom desafio. Se jogos como Super Meat Boy s\u00e3o divertidos para voc\u00ea, deveria tentar Necrosphere.", "timestamp_created": 1508113765, "timestamp_updated": 1508113765, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35755271": {"recommendationid": "35755271", "author": {"steamid": "76561198312627286", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508090670}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Bem, para quem procura desafios at\u00e9 que esse \u00e9 um jogo bom, porem simples demais e com controles que no in\u00edcio achei interessante, mas no fim s\u00e3o detest\u00e1veis (dominar os controlhes \u00e9 o maior desafio do game).

Nachdem ich ihn nun gekauft habe, hat er mich ernsthaft begeistert. Auf dem Computer ist es \u2013 zumindest meiner Meinung nach \u2013 einfacher als auf dem Necrosphere Controller, aber das ist Geschmackssache.\n\nDas rote Level dient lediglich als \"Versteck\" f\u00fcr DVDs und als Zwischenstation, die alle anderen Level verbindet. Die Musik bzw. das Main Theme finde ich nett, und es hat sogar zum Teil einen Ohrwurm Charakter. Sie ist motivierend, und die R\u00e4tsel sind in diesem Level nur, um allgemein das Spielprinzip zu verstehen aber nicht als ein ernsthaftes Hindernis zu sehen.\n\nDer Anfang bzw. das gelbe Level ist relativ einfach und leicht zu erledigen. Trotzdem macht es Spa\u00df, und, wenn man alle DVDs erhalten will muss man auch in jedes Level nochmal mehrfach gehen und kann besonders hier das f\u00fcr mich tragischste Easter Egg entdecken. Um an dieser Stelle nicht zu spoilern, schreibe ich erst nach einer Spoilerwarnung, wenn es sowieso um das Ende geht, \u00fcber dieses spezielle Easter Egg. Die R\u00e4tsel im gelben Level sind \u2013 insbesondre in dem Aspekt, dass man nicht springen bzw. sich in die vertikale Richtung nach oben bewegen kann \u2013 geschickt gemacht, und auch, wenn man einen geringen Funktionsumfang hat, ist es f\u00fcr den Anfang nicht so einfach, wie man als neutraler Zuschauer denkt.\nDie Musik ist in dem gelben Level sehr ruhig und entspannend, je nach Track hat es mich auch an eine W\u00fcste, was zur Gestaltung des Levels passt, erinnert.\n\n\nDas gr\u00fcne Level hat schon schwierigere Hinweise, die auf die gelernte F\u00e4higkeit im ersten Level aufbauen. Insbesondere die Extras, die man bei dem ersten Durchspielen des Levels nicht bemerkt, sind fordernder als zuvor. Die Idee mit den Zombies, die einen verfolgen, ist gut, da man sich, um diese zu \u00fcberwinden, interessante neue Strategien ausdenken muss. Auch der Charakter, eines Labyrinths, bei dem man instinktiv das Gef\u00fchl hat, dass man es nicht \u00fcberblicken kann, wurde weiter ausgebaut. Die Musik im gr\u00fcnen Level f\u00fchlt sich f\u00fcr mich an wie eine Kristallgrotte: edel, aber auch dunkel und fordernd. Die Musik passt dabei perfekt zum schwieriger werdenden Spielgeschehen und eine der in diesem Level versteckten DVDs ist f\u00fcr mich im besten Versteck des Spiels.\n\nDas finale bzw. blau Level hat es eindeutig in sich! Die Schwierigkeit wurde hier massiv angehoben, insbesondre, wenn man in dem Turm nach oben muss. Ich ben\u00f6tigte beim ersten Spielversuch allein f\u00fcr dieses Level gleich viel Zeit wie f\u00fcr alles andere zusammen. Das Erfolgserlebnis, wenn man oben ist, ist unfassbar, da man wirklich, wirklich viele Versuche braucht, wenn man das erste mal den Turm hoch will. In dem finalen Level ist die Musik zun\u00e4chst fast nicht vorhanden. Diese minimaiistische Musik passt genau zur Stimmung und zur Gestaltung des blauen, kalten Levels, was auf das Ende hinspielt. Man fragt sich auch, w\u00e4hrend die Stimmung zunehmend d\u00fcster wird, was mit Terry passieren wird\u2026 Allerdings beginnt die Musik, wenn man den Turm wieder hochgeht wieder, aber auch in diesem Level ist die Musikgestaltung passend, sie gibt, nachdem man durch das Fehlen sehr d\u00fcster gestimmt wurde wieder Kraft und die Motivation um den Finalen \u2013 und mit Abstand schwersten \u2013 Teil des Spieles zu meistern.\n\n\nDas DLC Terry's Dream behandele ich hier nicht, allerdings werde ich / habe ich eine eigene Review auf der Seite des DLCs gemacht.\n\n\n\nDas Ende & weitere Spoiler\n\nIm Laufe des Spiels und in den Nachrichten wird ersichtlich, dass die ehemaligen Kollegen von Terry ihm helfen. Was allerdings nicht klar wird, und nur in einer einzigen versteckten Nachricht, die so geheim ist, dass man den Erfolg, alle Nachrichten gelesen zu haben, auch ohne diese Nachricht freischaltet, ist, dass die Kollegen ihn wirklich vermissen.\nDiese Nachricht ist im gelben Level auf dem linken Weg an der Stelle, wo oben die Stacheln sind. Wenn man an einer der drei linkesten Stacheln durchfliegt (man braucht die Special Power), dann entdeckt man eine letzte, geheime Nachricht.\nAu\u00dferdem ist die speziale Power relativ gut gew\u00e4hlt, da manche Stellen durch die Feuerb\u00e4lle immer noch schwer sind, aber man eben solche Geheimnisse und auch DVDs relativ gut verstecken kann.\n\nDa ich das Ende schon durchgespielt habe, bevor ich die Nachricht gefunden und gelesen habe, bekam ich wirklich G\u00e4nsehaut und Respekt vor dem Spiel, denn diese einzelne Nachricht verst\u00e4rkt die mysterische Trauer und Melancholie des Endes noch einmal. Gerade der letzte Satz, \"I have an eternity to pray for a miracle\" sagt alles. Er hat sich bem\u00fcht, und es geschafft, und wurde dann verraten und still und heimlich, ohne dass seine Kollegen bzw. Freunde, die ihn so vermissen, etwas davon wissen, exekutiert, um ihn loszuwerden. Es ist die perfekte Stimmung, und auch, wenn ich normalerweise solche Enden \u00fcberhaupt nicht mag, und eher f\u00fcr das traditionelle \"Happy End\" bin, finde ich, dass dieses Ende das einzige ist, welches das Spiel voll und ganz w\u00fcrdigt, vielleicht auch, weil dem Spiel eben genau der Spagat gelingt, so viel \u00fcber die Figuren, und in der geheimen Nachricht auch \u00fcber die Freundschaft der Figuren, zu erz\u00e4hlen, dass einen das Ende ein bisschen niederschmettert und nach dem Tatendrang, Terry zu befreien, ein Gef\u00fchl der Trauer, das er es nicht schaffen konnte, entsteht, aber die Bindung nicht so stark aufzubauen, dass das Ende einen wirklich entt\u00e4uscht und man sich \u00fcber die quasi verlorenen Spielzeit \u00e4rgert. Au\u00dferdem gelingt es dem Spiel, noch einen Funken Hoffnung zu lassen, so dass man auch legitim glauben kann, dass Terry es noch schaffen kann oder auch ein im Ende genanntes Wunder eintrifft.\nDies ist auch eine St\u00e4rke des Spiels. Das Ende entt\u00e4uscht einen nicht und ist perfekt, obwohl es warscheinlich bei jedem anderen Spiel entt\u00e4uschten w\u00fcrde.\nAu\u00dferdem ist das eine perfekte M\u00f6glichkeit f\u00fcr einen Nachfolger. Allerdings ist es mir lieber, dass kein Nachfolger entsteht, als das einer entsteht, der diesem grandiosem Spiel und insbesondre diesem genialem Ende nicht w\u00fcrdig ist, denn dieses Spiel setzt wirklich hohe Ma\u00dfst\u00e4be!\n\n\nBugs:\nTats\u00e4chlich hat das Spiel so gut wie keine Bugs, aber zwei sind mir doch aufgefallen:\n1. Wenn man auf einer Plattform, die sich vertikal bewegt, anf\u00e4ngt, zu fliegen, fliegt man, auch wenn man losl\u00e4sst, die ganze Zeit eine Winzigkeit \u00fcber der Platform, ohne, dass der Balken auftaucht.\n2. An einer Stelle im gelben Level funktioniert einmal die Abfrage, ob man mit den Feuerb\u00e4llen zusammenst\u00f6\u00dft, nicht, wenn man mit Hilfe des Jetpacks eine Szene falschrum flog,\nAllerdings sind diese Bugs f\u00fcr das Spiel nicht wirklich schlimm.\n\n\n\nFazit:\nDas Spiel ist vielleicht nicht f\u00fcr jeden geeignet, aber f\u00fcr mich ist es warscheinlich der beste Platformer, den ich je gespielt habe. Die Musik ist immer auf die Spieloberfl\u00e4che, die R\u00e4tsel sowie auch den Inhalt in den Nachrichten abgestimmt und es passt perfekt, warscheinlich, weil es von einem kleineren Indie-Studio entwickelt wurde.\nAllgemein gef\u00e4llt mir auch das Design sehr\nDas Ende gef\u00e4llt mir auch sehr und passt meiner Meinung nach zur Stimmung des Spiels und der Handlung.\nAlles in allem freue ich mich sehr, dass ich dieses Spiel auf der Gamescom gefunden habe, denn mit inzwischen \u00fcber 30 Spielstunden (mit DLC) hat es sich f\u00fcr mich vollkommen gelohnt, und ich hoffe, dass die anderen Kunden das auch genauso finden.\nIch bin gespannt, ob es einen Nachfolger geben wird; als Spieler w\u00fcrde ich mich sehr freuen, aber ich w\u00fcrde das Entwicklerstudio \"Cat Nigiri\" nicht dr\u00e4ngen, denn das Spiel sollte dann genauso reifen und ohne Druck entwickelt werden wie sein Vorg\u00e4nger.", "timestamp_created": 1507653771, "timestamp_updated": 1507653833, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35593249": {"recommendationid": "35593249", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987270895", "num_games_owned": 818, "num_reviews": 109, "playtime_forever": 85, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507579000}, "language": "english", "review": "Hard puzzle-platformer in the veins of VVVVV but the gimmick of this clever little game is that you only use two buttons - to move left and right.

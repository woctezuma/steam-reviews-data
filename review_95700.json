You will learn of characters such as Kermit Roosevelt, the main CIA agent that engineered the fall of Mossadegh. You will learn that the bribe budget to oust Mossadegh was approximately around $1,000,000 USD. You will learn of the Iran's Shah,  Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, and how he temporarily got his throne back due to Kermit Roosevelt's aid.

The premise is an allegory about British and US foreign policy toward Iran in the 20th century. It's free and short, and it's good.\n\nMohammad Mosaddegh was Prime Minister of Iran from 1951 until 1953. He was a champion of secular, democratic values, and sought to modernise Iran by nationalising its oil industry. Having been democratically elected by the people of Iran, he was overthrown in a coup organised by the CIA and British intelligence services.\n\nWhy was nationalisation of oil so contentious? In the early 1950s, many key industries in Western states were nationalised, or part-owned by the state. The UK had itself just nationalised its coal and steel industries. But as the Cold War developed, the US became more hawkish about any states showing socialist tendencies. As the UK's might withered and its postwar ration economy continued to struggle, the British state attempted desperately to assert its interests in the Middle East.\n\nThis revanchiste British foreign policy, upheld by a Conservative administration but instigated by a Labour Prime Minister, would eventually culminate in the disastrous attempt to hold the Suez Canal of 1956. It also meant protecting British supplies of cheap oil. If the Iranian government were to control the nation's oil reserves, then it could set its own prices. When Mossaddegh sought to limit the influence of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC), the AIOC refused to cooperate. Iran responded by nationalising their assets. The UK initiated a worldwide boycott of Iranian oil, and began an extensive programme of bribery and co-ercion to protect its interests in Iran. The situation escalated into a coup signed off by the British and US governments at the highest levels. A democratically-elected government had been overthrown by a foreign power for trying to take a local resource into the people's hands.\n\nThe Cat and the Coup briefly tells this story using a few headlines, photographs, mockups, and collage art. The game is a sequence of about six vignette puzzles, each of which takes about two minutes to complete. Mossaddegh's ghost enters a room symbolising a moment in his own memory, and the player, his cat, forces him to leave or encourages him to follow a falling object. It's all rather strange, and not overly polished, but it's intuitive enough, and not difficult enough to be frustrating. The animations are lovely.

Not as a game you play to pass the time, but as a game you play to learn something.\nThe game is simplistic, the puzzles are simple, you don't spend too much time on it, it's not intended to be a challenge in and of itself, it's intended to provide a light challenge so you're motivated in going forward.\nThis is the sort of \"project game\" universities should discuss, even if only for one or two meetings. There is value in the simple story-telling which summarizes Iran's coup between 1950-1965. This is interdisciplinarity, it provides a brief history lesson in 10-odd minutes, opening up room for further discussion on the subject.\nIf you're someone interestedi in education as a whole, this game is a prime example of how many subjects we can place inside one simple game.\n\nThis list is what I compiled by thinking about education and the game while writing this review, it's not a well-thought and not even near well-developed, but it is a starting point of possible topics to discuss with students, friends, family, dealer, bro you met at the party last night, whoever you want to:\n- History (clearly);\n- Art - too broad and too much to even try to specify, so I'll leave it at that (there are many artistic examples worth noticing);\n- Game development;\n- Learning processes.\n\nAnd these are topics that would require further development, but also very much possible to discuss:\n- Geopolitics;\n- Language teaching/learning (my area);\n- Programming/Coding;\n- Other coups in the world (with iran being a unique case);\n- Law studies/processes (also my area);\n- I'm absolutely sure you can think of much, much more, especially if you're a professor.\n\nIt is a very short game, quite fun and interesting, I have to admit I felt really bad when I finished it, that empathy you feel for people/situations that you could not change, but you know they could have gone completely differently if not for the interest of one involved party.

A perusal of the Wikipedia page regarding the coup might be a good idea before playing.\n\nGameplay-wise, it's a bit like walking through a picture book, with a few simple environmental puzzles to solve along the way. The game is very short (I finished it in 15 minutes without rushing) and boasts a unique art style: a mash-up of Persian motifs and Western surrealism, with a few agitprop touches along the way. I've never seen anything like it in a game before.\n\nIs it fun to play? I guess so. Given how short it is, it definitely doesn't outstay its welcome. And seeing as it's free-to-play, there's no risk of suffering buyer's remorse. Unless you have a pathological aversion to anything that could even remotely be construed as an \"art\" game, I would recommend giving it a whirl.\n\nOn a personal level, I was very struck by the opening image of Mossadegh as an old man, lying on his deathbed more than a decade after his overthrow. A sound recording of one of Mossadegh's speeches (announcing the nationalization of Iran's oil industry -- an act that galvanized the West to plot his downfall) also struck a nerve. Before playing this game, I was already familiar with the history of the coup and its awful aftermath (the reign of the Shah and his secret police), but I had never given much thought to Mossadegh the [i] man [/i] before. It was also the first time I had ever heard his voice, despite having read much about him. In other words, [i] The Cat and the Coup [/i] not only succeeds in bringing to life an essential piece of 20th-century history, but it also humanizes the individual at the center of that story. In so doing, it conveys the sadness and cynicism of the coup in a visceral and memorable way.", "timestamp_created": 1460279836, "timestamp_updated": 1460281259, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.596309", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22315434": {"recommendationid": "22315434", "author": {"steamid": "76561198250755698", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 24, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460213323}, "language": "turkish", "review": "i cant understand anything", "timestamp_created": 1460194754, "timestamp_updated": 1460194754, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22310567": {"recommendationid": "22310567", "author": {"steamid": "76561198277463494", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 41, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507437044}, "language": "english", "review": "If you are already familiar with the history behind this game and have read about the personality of Dr.Mosaddeq, you will enjoy it much more. \n\nThe game has a very symbolic narrative which I love it. \n\nAlso ,I specifically loved the art of the game (both graphic and music).

I really liked it. I wasn't sure what to think when I saw the advertising and also that this was on the \"Video Games as Art\" article on Wikipedia (which they also included \"Tempest 2000\" and \"Vib Ribbon\"... for some reason), but needless to say I was very impressed.\n\nI really like the storybook aesthetics of the game, like you're seeing this history unfold across tapestries, old photographs, and pictures cut out of magazines. Along with this, the animations on Mossadegh and the Cat look very blocky but still well-animated, like they belong with the rest of the scattered images in the game. And the game mechanics and story are influenced by you as a little, black cat pushing around the unfortunate Mossadegh, which is incredibly symbolic.\n\nSee, throughout the game, a lot of the puzzles involve balance, almost as if saying that the Prime Minister was trying to find a balance between his people and the other countries looking to get that oil, but because of bad fortune in his path, he just happened to be a stepping stone for the U.S. to grind their feet into, and a door for the Iranian people to knock down, and move onto a better life. He's constantly falling and being messed with by the cat, which really makes you feel sorry for the poor chum. He was just trying to do what any man would do in his position, and he keeps getting sh** on. \n\nI can't think of any issues I had with the game, personally. The over-realiance on text here and there bothered me a little (but that's more of a personal gripe). Beyond that though, it uses intuitive puzzles to tell a story in a unique and intriguing manner.

1428151393}, "language": "italian", "review": "The Cat and the Coup viene definito \"un videogioco documentario\". Questo suo dualismo va preso alla lettera e, insieme a una direzione artistica di primo livello, inteso come vero punto di forza dell'intera produzione. Perch\u00e9 \"documentario\": il titolo, dalla durata che oscilla intorno ai 15 minuti, descrive la vita di Mohammed Mossadegh, Primo Ministro iraniano, che negli anni Cinquanta del secolo scorso ebbe a scontrarsi con gli \"interessi\" solo europei prima, anche statunitensi poi, finendo infine per soccombere. La storia viene narrata \u00e0 rebours, iniziando dall'ultimo istante di Mossadegh e progredendo dall'alto verso il basso in senso spaziale, ma dal basso verso l'alto in senso temporale per ripercorrere i principali eventi della sua vita politica dopo l'acquisizione della carica e la sua decisione pi\u00f9 importante in ambito economico, che viene giustamente vista come \"inizio\" della fine. \"Toccato il fondo\" del gioco una rapida risalita ripercorrer\u00e0 in senso inverso la vita del politico proponendo degli approfondimenti e dei chiarimenti. Questa interpretazione del tempo assolutamente non lineare e \"mossa\" rende assai pi\u00f9 accattivante e \"ludica\" l'intera vicenda storica. Quest'ultima viene narrata con poche pennellate di scritto, in uno stile cronachistico essenziale che ci tiene fino alla fine a non trasmettere interpretazioni tramite le parole, ma piuttosto tramite simbolismi espressi con elementi grafici. Vedo che su questo punto molti si sono \"lamentati\" per un'eccessiva oscurit\u00e0 dei simboli, che richiedono al giocatore un background di conoscenze storiche  non del tutto scontate. In realt\u00e0, su sfondi visivamente impressionanti di motivi persiani, si sviluppano messaggi che hanno perlomeno due chiavi di interpretazione, di cui la pi\u00f9 superficiale \u00e8 facilmente fruibile e ugualmente appagante: per non rovinare le sorprese, menzioner\u00f2 qui i pi\u00f9 espliciti \"animali politici\". \nArriviamo dunque alla seconda parte della definizione: perch\u00e9 \"videogioco\". Uno degli elementi pi\u00f9 apprezzabili di The Cat and the Coup \u00e8 che non rinuncia ad avere un gameplay e una interattivit\u00e0 abbastanza estesa con gli ambienti proposti. L'alter ego del giocatore sar\u00e0 infatti il gatto nero di Mossadegh che, come \u00e8 noto, essendo capace di vedere i fantasmi, cerca in tutti i modi di far ridiscendere l'anima del padrone attraverso i gironi pi\u00f9 drammatici del suo personale inferno. Questo in pratica si trasforma nel cercare un modo di interagire con le varie \"scenette\" storiche, simbolicamente dondolanti come se fossero appese a un filo, per far scivolare o brutalmente spingere Mossadegh e farlo cadere negli abissi della storia, fino appunto a \"fargli toccare il fondo\". Solo allora un getto infinito di nera cupidigia umana costringer\u00e0 a una travolgente ascensione l'anima del defunto, sommergendo nel processo tutte le tappe della sua vita che vengono cos\u00ec implicitamente definite \"storia sommersa\". Le soluzioni di ogni scenetta non sono affatto immediate e lasciano sempre un sorriso (amaro) sul volto del giocatore. \nAzzeccatissimo corollario dell'esperienza \u00e8 la scelta dei brani musicali, uno straniante mix di Nine Inch Nails e Satie. Ultimo tocco magistrale di un titolo che trasuda tutto il tempo, la dedizione e l'attenzione \"accademica\" che gli sono stati dedicati: particolarmente evidente \u00e8 il coinvolgimento di un'istituzione universitaria (la University of Southern California).  In definitiva The Cat and the Coup \u00e8 un altro bel colpo a favore dell'elevazione a arte del videogioco: pronto alla musealizzazione in una galleria interattiva, \u00e8 sotto tutti gli aspetti un titolo che pone sotto ben altri riflettori il noto motto \"History is our playground\".", "timestamp_created": 1428746624, "timestamp_updated": 1428746624, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15300878": {"recommendationid": "15300878", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131405534", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1428727448}, "language": "english", "review": "Short but interesting", "timestamp_created": 1428727012, "timestamp_updated": 1428727012, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15280030": {"recommendationid": "15280030", "author": {"steamid": "76561198187464878", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476697303}, "language": "english", "review": "Despite the straightforward in-game mechanics and my considerable experience with the surreal, it took awhile for me to wrap my head around the puzzles, due to the sheer strangeness of it all.

This game wasn't 'fun' in the traditional sense, but rather it was more intriguing, as well as somewhat haunting with it's bizarre imagery coupled with the sad lingering soundtrack.       \n\nFor those who didn't understand the metaphors in this game, I will explain below.  \nScroll down or 'read more' for spoilers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\nYou play as the black cat, traditionally established as a symbol of misfortune, who manipulates the various items and situations in a series of rooms.

Note that at no time is it stated that the cat belongs to Dr. Mossadegh, but rather it is a cat that incessantly follows him around.  \n\nThe rooms are a double-metaphor serving as both the various political/social occurrences at the time, and as stages of Dr. Mossadegh's life.  The cat is a metaphor for the CIA.  The cat's behavior is the covert tampering that CIA agents performed to maneuver Dr. Mossadegh into the situation where he would be removed from power.  The bulldog represents British interests who, behind closed doors, asked the Americans for undercover aid to depose Dr. Mossadegh from power.  The reasons for Britain doing this are spelled out at the end of the game in the vertical assent back through the imagery the cat initially fell downward through.  So, long story short, when you play this game, you play as the CIA covertly creating a social/political environment necessary to bring about a coup in Iran in the 1950's.  \n\nWhy was the story told in reverse?

It took me 20 minutes to play through it because there aren't any real directions and a couple of the rooms were really confusing for me, in regards to what you had to do to progress. In order to get further into the brief history lesson, you have to interact with the environment in such a way that leads the human to fall out of the room you're in and into the next room. The music in the game, paired with the art and photos, gives it a great atmosphere. I am definitely having my history buff friend play this, just because it was an interesting game. I got to have fun while learning something new. Now if only all history classes were taught like this, I think more kids might pay attention. \n\nDid I mention Nine Inch Nails is on the soundtrack?

This game is also actually a game on a technical level, as it has challenges to solve through manipulating a character, although it really just barely qualifies as a game. The animation and art is really wonderfully done, and is stylized in a way that has aristic value and restraint not usually seen in gaming. The downside is that it is boring, as a story, and that the gameplay is essentially a frustrating element designed to keep the story from being told in a rapid series of clicks. So in the end it is worth looking at the concept, as it is entirely brilliant; the content, however, is hit-and-miss, with the art as the major notable hit and most everything else a near- or far- miss.

It may be that that's due more to its being billed as a game than anything else, and that somewhere in the back of my mind i felt a little tricked when \"Coup\" quit being interactive. I'm a huge fan of Joe Sacco's purely journalistic comics, and interested in similarly untraditional ways of telling people's personal histories, but I guess part of why I felt tricked might have something to do with the fact that this wasn't a person's story. It was mere names and dates, and seeming laziness on the part of the illustrators and programmers. Like they made a third of a game and got tired of it, deciding to just get the process over with and publish. If you can get past this, and the history is unknown to you or interesting enough to spend fifteen minutes on, have at it. You'll enjoy it. And to be fair, this is my first encounter with subject material like this being disseminated in this way and for that the publishers deserve credit.\n\nI'll recommend it with a \"Meh\".", "timestamp_created": 1392844080, "timestamp_updated": 1392844368, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9168557": {"recommendationid": "9168557", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126995347", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 16, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1392831106}, "language": "russian", "review": "amansdasdadasdad", "timestamp_created": 1392740005, "timestamp_updated": 1392740005, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540481", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9148455": {"recommendationid": "9148455", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984724340", "num_games_owned": 220, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 86400}, "language": "english", "review": "Fuck nah, son.

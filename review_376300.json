After gamechanger events of GG2:Overture series returned to 2D fighting game convention, and it did with style.\nStory mode wasn't made traditionally, this time we have long animated cutscenes which take place after Arcade mode scenarios.\nArcade Mode mode contain cast of 17 character plus 3 DLC characters unlockable by in-game points or real money, including some newcomers : Bedman, Leo, Ramlethal and Elphelt. Every character is a perfect 3D sprite creating illusion of anime 2D silhouette. Fighting system is preety various, we can not only perform normal attacks and combos but also bursts and instant-kills, perfectly performed combo can even take out 100% of enemy health. Keyboard users can change keyset or even attack some combinations to one button making themselves equal to controller users.\nM.O.M is a mode that let you fight characters with different skills, stats and also level up your character to unlock various items making him or her even more powerful.\nPlayers can also test their skills in Mission mode, allowing us to train numerous combinations in arranged situations.\nThe Gallery is the place when we can buy color palettes, DLC characters, concept arts and music usable in online and versus modes, including those from previous GG games. \nSoundtrack from this one is not worse than in precedessors. My Favourite tracks are \"Reunion\", \"Marionette\", \"Lilly of Steel\" and \"When life comes\".\nThe only thing I do not like here are english voices, they just do not suit characters.\n\nThis one gave me many hours of fun so I will give it 9/10.", "timestamp_created": 1516359399, "timestamp_updated": 1516359399, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583333", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39114600": {"recommendationid": "39114600", "author": {"steamid": "76561198309871540", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 606, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 309, "last_played": 1515574618}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6c42\u52a0\u597d\u53cb\uff0c\u4e00\u8d77\u73a9", "timestamp_created": 1515237627, "timestamp_updated": 1515237627, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39104570": {"recommendationid": "39104570", "author": {"steamid": "76561198168010239", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 871, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1515946113}, "language": "english", "review": "Good enough", "timestamp_created": 1515207212, "timestamp_updated": 1515207212, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39011084": {"recommendationid": "39011084", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110103070", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 376, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514882642}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ub7a8\ub9ac\uc370 \ubc11\uac00\uc2b4 \ud558\uc545\ud558\uc545", "timestamp_created": 1514986743, "timestamp_updated": 1514986743, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39001662": {"recommendationid": "39001662", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161069012", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 14732, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514957728}, "language": "english", "review": "+Fantastic art direction/art style\n+Rockin OST\n+There is an English dub for those who want it. Overall quality is hit or miss; there are issues with delivery, voice clip editing, audio balancing, etc. I find it worthy enough to be a positive \n+Very solid gameplay \n\n~The input buffer is slightly finicky; this is my opinion, and it\u2019s listed here as an observation, and not a review point\n\n-This game was played entirely on a keyboard, and using the button configuration menu was a hassle \n-The menus use their own fixed button configuration for navigation, and you can\u2019t change it\n\n-MOM mode is poorly executed, and ultimately is tedious and frustrating to play:\n--There is a timer, which when empty, results in an automatic loss; this discourages defensive and cautious playstyles, and encourages you to be risky and aggressive\n--Armor mode allows the computer opponent to attack with infinite super armor and unlockable supers. This mode is supposedly balanced by having the computer follow a set of rules, so the player has a chance to win. The problem is that the computer can break these rules whenever it wants to, and will do so\n--Winning against multiple opponents in row results in a streak bonus. The idea is that the higher your streak bonus, the more challenging the next opponent is to beat. The issue is, that instead of having the next computer use more complex AI patterns, the game will instead increase stat numbers to the point where you cannot beat it\n--The only way to compete against the increasing stats of your opponents is to level yourself up. It eventually becomes such a tediously long grind to so, that you end up wasted large amounts of time for little reward   \n\n-Mission mode generally puts you in several instances with very little time to prepare yourself or react. I personally feel like it then judges your performance too harshly as a result; it gives you little leeway, and expects too much, especially if you\u2019re a beginner\n\n-Technical issue: \u201cGuilty Until Proven Innocent\u201d achievement has issues triggering \n(Going through arcade mode with a DLC character [Sin, Elphelt, or Leo] may be the root of the problem which causes this hiccup. I suggest avoiding them to trigger this achievement)\n\nStory mode mini-review:\n~It\u2019s decent overall. \n-The production value is generally low, and a lot of waiting around and empty filler happens within the context of the story itself. \n+Seeing the how characters interact with each other is nice, and the main plot thread tying the story together is solid enough\n~The most surprising thing to me, was that for a game praised for its great character animation during gameplay, I counted one scene that had animation of that same caliber\n-There is no game to play in story mode; it is essentially an anime to watch", "timestamp_created": 1514962767, "timestamp_updated": 1515463847, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38997343": {"recommendationid": "38997343", "author": {"steamid": "76561198195345935", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 38, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506721837}, "language": "english", "review": "GG Good Game", "timestamp_created": 1514949367, "timestamp_updated": 1514949367, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38997076": {"recommendationid": "38997076", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101902589", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 53, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510972614}, "language": "spanish", "review": "el juego me anda como el \n*\u00af\u00af\u00af'^^~-\u201e\u201e\u201e----~^*'\"\u00af \"****'\u00af\"\"****':\"\"\"****\"****'\u00af\"\"****':\"\"\"***\") (\"*'.\".'.: \"\\,\n.:.:.:.:.\u201e-^\" : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : :) ( : : : : : \"\\,\n:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.: : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : ) ( : : : : : : \u201e|\n.::.:.:.:.:.:.:.:. : : : : : : : \u00b8: : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : :) ( : : : : ,~\"\n:.' : : '\\ : : : : : : : ;\u00b8\u201e\u201e-~\"\u00af\"\"\"****'\u00af\"\"****':\"\"\"****\"****'\u00af\"\"****':\"\"\"****'\" ( :~~\"\"\n:.:.:: :\"-\u201e\"\"***/*'\u00ec\u00b8'\u00af\n:.': : : : :\"-\u201e : : :\"\\\n.:.:.: : : : :\" : : : : \\,\n:.: : : : : : : : : : : : '\u00cc\n: : : : : : :, : : : : : :/\n\"-\u201e_::::_\u201e-*__\u201e\u201e~\"\n{", "timestamp_created": 1514948557, "timestamp_updated": 1514948557, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474138", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38965421": {"recommendationid": "38965421", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101046775", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 339, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 35, "last_played": 1516447533}, "language": "thai", "review": "\u0e42\u0e04\u0e23\u0e15\u0e21\u0e31\u0e19\u0e2a\u0e4c !!!

And the future isn't promising either.\nGuilty Gear XX Reload is a Fighter Masterpiece - but this version has less than half the original roster basically. Most of the iconic and beloved characters are missing.\nArc System releases full priced GG games on  (basically) an annual basis. Adding just a tiny pinch of the original XX Reload roster - we all been waiting for - every time - in order to make us wanting for more and leave room for future yearly releases and worse - DLCs.\nYes - they also release some of the #1 iconic franchise characters as paid DLC. Including Dizzy for instance. \n\nSadly, at the current state of the games,  I can only recommend getting the latest game at a super-sale.\n\nBut in my opinion - it may be better to just wait several good years for Guilty Gear XRD to finally complete the roster.\n\nThe game could have been so much more:\nThe graphics here are simply incredible and spectacular. Best 3D visuals - mimicking 2D old school classic anime ever. \nThe responsiveness is top notch. The gameplay is hardcore, lightning fast and powerful \nThe music is amazing. Hard rock & heavy metal. Not as good as the older GGs - but definitely in the same spirit.\nThe animations are superb. \n\nThis is still the successor to the world's #1 fighter. It's by far the  best 3D made into 2D fighter implementation I have ever seen.\nThe way they recreated the gameplay of the original 2D games from the days of old  is impeccable.\n\nWhich is why the lack of a full roster is a huge disappointment, that unfortunately has not been fixed yet in the next titles.

The game runs in a 3d engine, but somehow, I guess it was through cell shading or something, it pretty much looks like an enhanced version of the 2d cartoon/anime style the previous guilty gear installments had. It's really revolutionary from my point of view: a game that is made in 3d but manages to look just like 2d anime. At first, you only notice it's 3d when you win a round and the camera spins around you and your opponent, displaying the final blow. Oh, if only game series like KOF could follow this art direction instead of those horrendous PS2 graphics...\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nGameplay is kinda based on the Marvel vs Capcom series: most characters have A->B->C combos that end into a special move like a fireball or something. There are also longer combos with aerial launchers but I didn't dive that much into the guilty gear combo system to pull off those easily (on a side note: I hate tutorials!). Overall, the gameplay seems to be much deeper that the typical anime fighter and it requires hours spent on the training mode to able to achieve a decent level with a particular character.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nI don't have much to say about the story, it just sounded like some weird weeaboo bullcrap full of weird names and cross references. Fortunately, you dont need to know anything about the story whatsoever to start punching faces and throwing fireballs on the arcade mode.\n\n[b]I Rate it 3.8/5.0[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1495327428, "timestamp_updated": 1495327428, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.617376", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31858946": {"recommendationid": "31858946", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110524121", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3297, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494568353}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5e05\u5230\u7206\u70b8", "timestamp_created": 1495280987, "timestamp_updated": 1495280987, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31854521": {"recommendationid": "31854521", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128291514", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495263113}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Vou ser bem direto nessa analise ent\u00e3o...\n\nGUILTY GEAR Xrd>>>STREET FIGHTER V\n\nA BOA DO JOGO\n-Gr\u00e1ficos 2.5D top demais!\n-Som de alta qualidade S\u00f3 ROCK N\u00b4 ROLL FREN\u00c9TICO!!\n-Boa Proposta de jogabilidade\n-Historia bem curiosa e dessa vez estar mais focada nos personagens\n-E o mais importante em um jogo de luta...

I have no interest in almost all of the characters. The characters themselves are all so varied that learning to play one character doesn't necessarily carry over the way it does in other fighting games. At the same time, the offerings in terms of grapplers are horribly sparse; most seem more like \"strikers\" and rely on flashy anime combos. The one character that I found interesting is one I struggled so much to play I stopped having any fun at all. The online scene is already so experienced that there's no hope for new players. The story pathetic. The arcade mode is bland. The extra single player mode, M.O.M., is just more difficulty that wasn't teaching me anything.

Is it a good fighting game? Abso-f*cking-lutely. But for anyone not playing Fighting games super seriously at a competitive level this is just not enjoyable.\n\nIt is also the most complex one I have ever tried in my life. You have like 3-4 meters to manage. Counter moves upon special counters upon even more different kinds of counter moves, cancels, slow-times, instakills, overdrives, reversals... There's just SOOOOO many mechanics. The only thing it lacks are combo moves. You can combine attacks any way you want. It is up to you to find out which ones are the good combinations. \n\nThe fact that it took me 2 hours just to get through the tutorial in order to understand and memorize anything at all, speaks volumes. And that taught me only the \"basics\". The game actually has a very extensive tutorial system, with missions where you can practice a particular set of mechanics, frame-timing, reactions, moves, etc. The weird thing about this tutorial is that it doesn't teach you how to play with each character. Instead, it teaches you how to play [i]a fighting game[/i] properly. It teaches you the mentality behind it and gradually combines all the stuff you learned.\n\nThis game has a ridiculously high skill ceiling (and probably also skill floor). People playing fighting games at the very highest level will enjoy this, because it gives even them a challenge. This isn't Mortal Kombat, kids. This isn't Street Fighter. It's not Injustice (and that was a game which was already a bit too complex for my friend after playing MK and that game doesn't even come close to Guilty Gear).\n\nIf fighting games are like something like your \"main\" games, sure, go ahead, buy this.

1495061147}, "language": "english", "review": "Guilty gear Xrd was, and is, a revolutionary fighting game - not to mention a new take on the medium of videogames and fighting games as a genre.\n\nAt the time of this writing, the game's largely obsoleted by Revelator. While the original plan was to have just a single 'Xrd' game, with new content added as DLC updates, meddling on the part of Valve ('a contract is a contract is a contract!'), as well as Arc being new to the whole thing, that didn't came to be, and Xrd is essentially a graveyard.\n\nHowever, one must remember it for what it was, is, and aimed to be, not what ended up as. Rather than the 'traditional' formula of essentially zero singleplayer content, heroic scale characters, karate men with karate uniforms doing karate sumo wrestling on each other from 1992 to 2015, little to no continuity, and an unwillingness to challenge established norms, Xrd returns to what made the series so great and successful, and refuses outright to deviate from the, and I quote, red path. No corners were cut, no challenge considered too great, deadlines were met, and no expenses spared - which considering the small team and minimal budget, is quite the accomplishment.\n\nIf you don't know, and odds are you might not, GG has and always will be masterminded by Daisuke Ishiwatari, a man who has a very clear, very defined vision. When other franchises go wild with singleplayer modes, he and his handpicked teammates read between the lines. It's not singleplayer that's in vogue. It's an entire experience. So Xrd features an extensive three act anime movie, that while not comparable in technical prowess to what would come in Revelator, features an all-star cast, and ties up ten years of questions, while also weaving in formerly very unpopular/poorly received features, like guilty gear 2 overture's story changes.\n\nEverything, the anime movie included, has an 80s style to it. 80s guitars, characters with lines that would have fit in just fine in fist of the north star, plot twists that seem absurd at first glance, but make more than enough sense when examined even cursory, not to mention designs that go above and beyond the self-parody that is modern day final fantasy. For instance, Sol Badguy has a grand total of 34 zippers and belts, which is more than your average FF character, but he carries himself with a purpose and flair that makes him less about the belts and zippers, and more about his 80s brit-scene metal theme songs, his gameplay flow, and the voice acting. In short, the whole package.\n\nIn a sudden return to form, Ky, formerly perfectionist child soldier and warrior prodigy, is allowed to grow as a character, while also returning certain essential characteristics that haven't been seen since #Reloaded and the accompanying books and drama CDs. Hint. he's a devout christian, and has had a lifelong struggle with the fact that all he's ever been good at, all he's ever had in life, and all he's ever been noted for, is how incredibly, utterly, incomprehensively masterful he is at killing everything and everyone, but to mark that he's actually for real grown, rather than the traditional, casual call out that he's setting up for a finisher ('sacred order ultimate forbidden technique. RISING FORCE!') he recites his oaths to his family and kingdom in a most biblical fashion, no calling the move necessary, charges full speed through a master level lightning magic circle, to remind us of why this regular human dude is able to hang with bio-weapons, monsters, the undead, and other assorted weirdos, gives a most humiliating, but for once actually true, one liner, puts on his cape, and just walks away matter of factly. I believe it's up there in the top ten most boss moments of videogames.\n\nSpeaking of the voice actors, you'll be hard pressed to find a franchise with a more star studded cast, and like the gameplay and attention to detail, it's never waivered, and never will. It's hard to believe it's been almost two decades since Takeshi Kusao starred in the first ever guilty gear on the playstation, and in a sense, he's largely typecast himself as Ky. A fun little thing is watching the future Trunks episodes on dragon ball super. He tries very hard to do Trunks, but in the end, they give him a lighting sword, sacred edges, and lets him do the equivalent of a rising force destroy on the big bad, and it's hard to disbelief his conviction.\n\nSo would I recommend a fighting game that's essentially got no future due to executive meddling? For 15 dollars or less...surprisingly, yes. There's enough singleplayer stuff here for at least 20 hours of fun, and I consider Xrd an essential purchase for anyone who considers themselves a guilty gear fan. While a lot of mocking has been thrown at the animemes, the production value makes it worth your while, and just getting the universe explained to you, especially if you maybe played an X2 game in the long distant past, is pretty useful. Also note that while Rev is the future, Rev as far as we know will never feature the Xrd singleplayer stuff, mostly importantly the story mode. Another important thing to note is that Arc, unlike about 99.99% of all other publishers, absolutely love and cherish their fans and community, and will give you price cuts on future games in a franchise if own old entries.\n\nFuture updates will be added to GG Revelator. When you're reading this, odds are, that game is on Rev 2.\n\nAs a side note, it's incredibly interesting to me that 80s animation tricks and voice actors that actually knows what they're doing manage to outshine, outperform, and completely obliterate modern day anime, even when the anime is merely a fanservice addition to a fighting game, and the fighting game in question is on unreal 3 of all engines.", "timestamp_created": 1480112353, "timestamp_updated": 1495064520, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.421466", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27556739": {"recommendationid": "27556739", "author": {"steamid": "76561198200448969", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 153, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480238730}, "language": "english", "review": "Best Fighting Game! ^_^", "timestamp_created": 1480111864, "timestamp_updated": 1480111864, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27553197": {"recommendationid": "27553197", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030139951", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 40, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480110317}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0423\u0445 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u044d\u043f\u0438\u043a, \u0424\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0433 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0442 \u0434\u0443\u0445 \u0437\u0430\u0445\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0442\u044b \u0432\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0435 \u0441 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0434 \u043f\u0438\u0432\u043a\u043e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0435.", "timestamp_created": 1480110428, "timestamp_updated": 1480110428, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27466209": {"recommendationid": "27466209", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104019609", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 28989, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481385857}, "language": "koreana", "review": "My best game.\ncomplicated and difficult fighting game but this game has endless strategy.", "timestamp_created": 1480084445, "timestamp_updated": 1480084445, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27462354": {"recommendationid": "27462354", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998697844", "num_games_owned": 372, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482458671}, "language": "english", "review": "Best example of Non Photo Realistic art in a video game.

remember the first time I laid eyes on the [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKGPhKu3jNg]first trailer[/url] for this game.  It was sometime in March, 2013, and I was immediately glued to the screen.  It had been a long time since Accent Core, and after so many Blazblue titles, I was starting to think that [i]Guilty Gear 2: Overture[/i] would be the last game in the series.  When I saw Sol and Ky having a quick chat, my initial thought was, \"Huh, so they did update the sprites.  They look kinda bulky, but not bad!\"\n\nAnd then the camera [i]rotated[/i] and I was stuck staring, wide-eyed and open-mouthed at the witchcraft playing on my screen.\n\nSeeing just how pitch-perfect everything was, from shadows to animation to the feel of impact in each attack, was amazing.  I couldn't stop watching.  I repeated it over and over, trying to find new details, trying to absorb the sheer magnitude of what they'd accomplished.  Normally, the wonder would diminish as I get more and more used to it, but watching their [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhGjCzxJV3E]GDC presentation[/url] of how they did it only makes me marvel at their genius and skill all the more.  This game is a prime example of why aesthetics will always trump technology.\n\nEven mechanics-wise, it's an excellent revision, cutting away or better integrating the added mechanics and techniques from Slash to Accent Core, and reworking the Roman Cancel system to make the game more accessible to newbies while offering plenty of depth to veterans.  While -SIGN-'s gameplay isn't as good as its sequel, -REVELATOR-, the framework is all here, and it's easily the best-looking and one of the best-playing fighting games available on Steam.\n\nThey sure kept me waiting, but I'm still ready to rock.", "timestamp_created": 1480042634, "timestamp_updated": 1480137501, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503207", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27362361": {"recommendationid": "27362361", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069864859", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 969, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480038727}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u662f\u4e0d\u662f\u6211\u4f53\u8d28\u539f\u56e0\u5b58\u6863\u4e0d\u80fd\uff0c\u561b\uff0c\u4e5f\u6ca1\u591a\u5927\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53ea\u5e0c\u671b\u80fd\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u8bf4...", "timestamp_created": 1480038735, "timestamp_updated": 1480038735, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27355919": {"recommendationid": "27355919", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065560127", "num_games_owned": 1147, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 6418, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467431450}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is beatiful and pure art 2D.

One of the best fighting game series ever made became even more awesome.

Every one of them has a distinct personality and set of moves. The exellent story for many may be an addition to a fighting game, but if you're playing a game only for the story you won't get disappointed. Xrd features a massive glossary so if a in-game term is confusing just check it out.\n\n[b]But what about the audio-visual experience?[/b]\nAmazing graphics, eye candy, in my opinion this is the way fighting games should look like, just check out the screens for yourself. The soundtrack is a masterpiece, I keep listening to it just like I would to any epic album from the top charts.\n\n[b]But I'm not good at fighting games.[/b]\nThats not a problem, this game has a great and very long tutorial that explains the game mechanics. There are also missions and trials for every character to help you getting started. The community is very helpful too.\n\n[b]OK, but does this game have any flaws?[/b]\nNothing is perfect but this game is very close to it. I wish all characters from previous GG games would fit into it. And it seems like slowly they are making their way into the game with the new iterations coming out.\nI also wish the player base would be bigger.

Could you want more than this? Oh right, getting Revelator on PC and probably a Baiken DLC, but I guess we'll [i] probably [/i] have to wait another couple of months. ...Or years.\n\nBut let's get to the quick review, shall we?\n\n[h1] Positives [/h1]\n\n[list]\n[*] It's an actual [b] NEW [/b] Guilty Gear game.\n[*] Graphically it's a masterpiece. How many people do you think got fooled and thought it was in 2D with HD sprites, huh? 'Cuz I was one of them.\n[*] It's a new Guilty Gear.\n[*] Soundtrack is composed by Daisuke Ishiwatari (At least the metal ones). 'Nuff said.\n[*] Did I mentioned that it's a new Guilty Gear? I DID, but to be honest, I'm never tired of saying it.\n[*] The story (If you [i] actually [/i] care), it's pretty good (or at least entertaining) and unlike [i] other games [/i] this one is actually pretty easy to understand and has pretty good characters too. At least to me, I not disliked the characters. Not one bit. ...Except Bedman, but it's actually a pretty cool guy at the end of the day.\n[*] If you don't understand something, there's a library where you can find all those little bits of data. And there is a ton of character information, in case you wanna know more about your favorite characters. Or maybe you're just like me and read all those things because you [strike] had nothing better to do [/strike] got interested and wanted to know more.\n[*] 17 [b] UNIQUE [/b] characters. Seriously, every character has a different gameplay. Not one is a copy of another character, unlike a certain game with some dudes fighting on the street.\n[/list]\n\n[h1] Negatives [/h1]\n\n[list]\n[*] First off, this actually may be a personal problem because I love unlocking unnecesary things, but c'moooooon, couldn't you guys put more in the gallery? BlazBlue has like a... How do you say a number when it has a ton of zeroes? Anyway, the thing is that it has a TON of things to unlock. Guilty Gear on the other hand... It has a couple of songs, some movies and, if you didn't bought the character DLC, Sin, Elphelt and Leo. There ARE some few more items that you can unlock, but nothing more. So yeah, within, what? ten hours you can unlock all? Shame on you, ArcSys... Shame on you...\n[*] Netplay is as dead as it could be. Try and find a room. I dare you. I Double Dragon dare you.\n[*] The AI is too easy. Way. Too. Easy. Seriously, you can beat the arcade mode on maniac and you will barely get pounded like three to four times, and if you're good at the game, you will most likely do the same as me and put the game to best of 8 because battles last like a minute and a half. And M.O.M. is a liiiittle more difficult, but it's mostly because it's survival mode and you'll most likely end up starting a fight with barely any HP. So yeah, AI sucks.\n[*] The Vocal Collection is cheap. Veeery cheap. 10 songs in 192 kbps. C'mon, if you're gonna give us so little music, at least give it to us in high quality.\n[/list]\n\nOverall, Guilty Gear Xrd -SIGN- is a pretty fun game, with fun mechanics, like when you clash with your opponent and you enter the \"Danger Zone\" as I like to call it, when [b] EVERYTHING [/b] can make a combo with [b] ANYTHING [/b], and all your hits are Criticals. Do I recommend it? I couldn't recommend it enough. Is it worth buying? Absolutely. Is Elphelt the best waifu in Guilty Gear? [b] HELL YEAH [/b].\n\nSo yeah, go buy it, especially now that, at the moment of this review, has a 50% discount. Once you've bought it, play it. Play it until your fingers become metal.", "timestamp_created": 1479951326, "timestamp_updated": 1479951326, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26963046": {"recommendationid": "26963046", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063204625", "num_games_owned": 663, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1056, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491095914}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ub0b4 \uc778\uc0dd\uc744 \ubc14\uafd4\ub193\uc740 \uac8c\uc784", "timestamp_created": 1479947765, "timestamp_updated": 1479947765, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26956754": {"recommendationid": "26956754", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961219754", "num_games_owned": 213, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3048, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483164090}, "language": "english", "review": "yes", "timestamp_created": 1479946382, "timestamp_updated": 1479946382, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26954886": {"recommendationid": "26954886", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044694309", "num_games_owned": 187, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 15289, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481415427}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Get DESTROYED by unblockable 14 active frames GREED SEVERS the game\" 10/10 would recomend!", "timestamp_created": 1479945972, "timestamp_updated": 1511466321, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26943259": {"recommendationid": "26943259", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981272743", "num_games_owned": 532, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 21937, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481673714}, "language": "english", "review": "The best fighting game on PC right now, despite the fact it's a version behind.", "timestamp_created": 1479943616, "timestamp_updated": 1479943616, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26940699": {"recommendationid": "26940699", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071939046", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 18472, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479950467}, "language": "english", "review": "Guilty Gear Xrd -Sign- is a fantastic fighting package offering lots to love for both series fans and newcomers alike.

In the midst of endless amounts of Blazblue re-releases, it's so refreshing to play a more straightforward fighting game with a less convoluted plot for once.\n\nThe 2d-but-actually-3D look is really impressive and adds that extra oomph to finishers and special moves. The soundtrack might not be as harsh and full-on, balls-to-the-falls heavy on the rock department as its predecessors, but it'll grow on you as you listen to it while trying to perfect that one frame perfect move in the middle of that excruciatingly long combo, but that's besides the point. The English voice acting is a mixed bag of some really good and unique performances(Faust, Slayer, and Bedman to name a few), though generally I'd recommend switching to the Japanese one.\n\nThe gameplay has taken a few steps back, e.g. removing certain moves and systems, the cast is only half as big etc., and, as such, resembles XX2: Reloaded a lot more than its updated re-releases. However, this in my opinion streamlines the gameplay so it is easier to pick up and learn, also thanks to the decent tutorial and challenge modes, but is still hard to master. The time window when executing a a Roman cancel has also been made a bit longer and more visually noticeable, which is always nice, and being too defensive is very much discouraged with penalties affecting your tension gain, so an aggressive playstyle is the way to go.\n\nNow for the less important stuff. Unlocking miscellaneous stuff, such as new characters, announcers, color palettes etc., doesn't take too long, as completing challenges and clearing each character's arcade mode nets in-game currency quite fast, though you can just buy them with real money if it still feels too tedious. The story this time around is told in a visual novel format. It's still advisable that you complete the arcade modes to understand some scenes, but you won't miss anything too special if you jump straight into story. I do kind of miss having the story be more ingrained to the gameplay and the various branching story paths, as they added more replay value and also presented some cool what-if scenarios. As of the story itself: it's okayish, though I would have preferred if they hadn't just copy-pasted ideas and plotpoints from Blazblue to Guilty Gear.\n\nAs of now, Guilty Gear Xrd - Revelator hasn't come to Steam yet, so this is still the definitive GG experience. However, knowing Aksys Games' publishing schedules regarding pc releases, Revelator might be coming at least in early 2017.

Guilty Gear pas\u00e1ndose a las 3D. Pero de una manera que nadie nos hubi\u00e9ramos imaginado y con un acierto que a d\u00eda de hoy ning\u00fan otro producto cell-shading (exceptuando los juegos de Cyberconnect 2) ha conseguido.\n\nGuilty Gear Xrd es la \u00faltima parte de una saga de lucha muy reconocido por sus mec\u00e1nicas profundas y su gran roster de luchadores. Este Guilty Gear no se queda simplemente en los dise\u00f1os cl\u00e1sicos de los personajes y los evoluciona dejando toda su esencia intacta e incluso mejorando lo presente (como siempre Ark System Works haciendo su magia) a la vez que a\u00f1adiendo nuevos personajes que encajan perfectamente dentro del universo del juego.\n\nLa BSO de Guilty Gear Xrd sigue la misma l\u00ednea que toda la saga, rockera, intensa y muy cautivadora. La m\u00fasica es el perfecto complemento a la hora de jugar y hay cierto elemento que no todo el mundo tiene en cuenta, la m\u00fasica se adapta a lo que est\u00e1 ocurriendo el combate, enfatizando las situaciones y sobre todo animando al jugador a meterse dentro del ritmo de la lucha. Un 10/10 en este aspecto como siempre.\n\nLa jugabilidad cl\u00e1sica de Guilty Gear sigue presente dentro de este juego con un par de a\u00f1adidos que hacen que la profundidad de este juego siempre sea bastante amplia y te obligue a aprenderte el roster para sacarle el m\u00e1ximo jugo a los match ups y poder aprovechar al m\u00e1ximo las posibilidades.\n\nEl modo historia es un a\u00f1adido realmente interesante y no enga\u00f1a, es s\u00f3lo historia, donde se profundiza sobre la historia mediante una serie de cut-scenes realizadas con el propio motor del juego que demuestra el potencial del motor Unreal modificado por Ark System Works. Reconozco que me he quedado con muchas ganas de ver c\u00f3mo continua la historia y que me he re\u00eddo varias veces con las situaciones de este modo.\n\nEl modo online cuenta con dos variantes, rankeds, que funcionan por personaje y no por la cuenta en si, y con casual. Lo mejor de ambos es el systema de hub online dise\u00f1ado para poder jugar en una misma sala con varias personas a la vez. No comprendo como otros juegos de lucha no han hecho esto a\u00fan y no es obligatorios en otros t\u00edtulos dentro del mismo g\u00e9nero. Lag m\u00ednimo y partidas muy divertidas e igualadas.\n\n\u00bfRecomendable? S\u00ed, demasiado. Como amante de los juegos de lucha con un arcade stick competitivo puedo decir que este juego me da todo lo que pido y m\u00e1s.

Steam permet d'avoir un contenu incroyable en terme de jeux. Nous trouvons des titres ind\u00e9pendants, des genres oubli\u00e9s comme les shoot them up et bien d'autres styles.  Et si on poss\u00e8de un PC r\u00e9cent, on se prend au jeu de comparer diff\u00e9rentes versions d'un titre. En effet lorsque nous voyons SF V sur PS4 et celle d'un PC, on peut clairement affirmer : il n'y a pas photo, sur vos b\u00e9canes tout est lisse et extr\u00eament fluide et bourr\u00e9 de d\u00e9tails.\n\n. Les jeux versus Fighting trouvent une renaissance sur steam et on peut avoir une tr\u00e8s belle collection, en l'occurence avec la s\u00e9rie des Guilty Gear qui a connu de droles d'\u00e9volutions, une saga en dents de scie, et le novice ne sera pas quoi choisir.\n\n. Avec son ambiance m\u00e9tallo-dark, des looks \u00e9nerv\u00e9s du casting aux riffs de guitare \u00e9lectrisants, Guilty Gear joue un peu le r\u00f4le du bad boy des jeux de baston. La s\u00e9rie est aussi connue pour toujours proposer un spectacle l\u00e9ch\u00e9, s'illustrant avec des personnages hauts en couleur et des animations p\u00eachues. Belle comme un camion, elle fait n\u00e9anmoins peur \u00e0 bon nombre de pr\u00e9tendants. Son syst\u00e8me de jeu extr\u00eamement riche et relativement complexe, tel le playbook du plus cal\u00e9 des quaterbacks, demande en effet une tr\u00e8s (trop ?) grosse p\u00e9riode d'apprentissage. Avec Xrd, Arc System Works a revu sa copie pour plaire et correspondre au plus grand nombre. Pour le meilleur et pour le pire ?\n\n. En revanche, le design g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, pourtant jusqu'alors premier atout de la franchise, a subi un lifting pour le moins incongru... A la rigueur, que GG Xrd ait suivi cette tendance de rendre les protagonistes moins longilignes et plus costauds, comme d'autres candidats du VS Fighting\n\n... Je ne vais pas me replonger de nouveau dans le gameplay qui demeure riche pour les fans de la s\u00e9rie. On notera cependant que ce titre semble perdre du terrain face \u00e0 la s\u00e9rie Blazblue (quasiment les m\u00eames \u00e9quipes de d\u00e9veloppement).\n\n.\" Dot\u00e9 d'une r\u00e9alisation technique impressionnante, Guilty Gear Xrd : Sign tr\u00e9buche \u00e9trangement sur l'un des points forts de la franchise : sa direction artistique. \" (Site Gameblog - Keem tam) Coupl\u00e9 au fait que le roster soit assez limit\u00e9 et que les personnages ne soient pas tous r\u00e9ussis au niveau de la prise en main, on est en droit de se montrer un brin d\u00e9\u00e7u.

Visually, BlazBlue is a 2D fighter delivered with traditional 2D sprites, but for the new Guilty Gear games they have gone about things very differently. The visuals here are delivered via Unreal Engine 3. Everything on screen is delivered in 3D, whilst retaining not only the 2D gameplay, but also the appearance of being 2D overall, bar extreme camera shifting moments when you realise it's not 2D at all.\n\nIt's a fascinating way of delivering anime-like cartoon visuals rendered in 3D, and the end result is just awesome. Games have strived to deliver this kind of cartoon-like visual presentation for years, but I've never seen it done better than it is here. It's also worth mentioning that in typical anime fashion, the whole game is glittered with excellent moments of comedy. The writing is on point and often funny af.

Though it was nice for them to release a PC version of this game, this is not the most recent version of Guilty Gear. Guilty Gear Xrd -Revelator- is the most recent version and it's available on PS3 and PS4. Though, if you do get this game, anything you learn in it will transfer over to the newest version.\n\nGuilty Gear Xrd is an awesome fighting game. It has a ton of style, and is VERY fun to play but ONLY if you are very experienced in the fighting game genre. I would not get Xrd as one of your first fighting games. Although the tutorials are VERY informative, you will probably get destroyed by someone with fighting game experience very quickly and have NO idea what even happened. \n\nIt's probably one of the greatest looking fighting games of all time. It has a 2D look, but it's all actually 3D models. I wouldn't really recommend Guilty Gear Xrd -Sign- unless you're a very experienced fighting game enthusiast, but the game does come with a semi-interesting 8 hour story mode, and arcade modes with their own cutscenes and content.\n\nOne of my favorite fighting games that I've played so far. Very stylish, the music kicks ass, the characters are all badass or hilarious. I've had tons of fun hours playing this with my friends locally and getting together with groups of people online and playing it.

The game's art style uses 3D models, but deliberately makes everything look 2D in order to channel the feel of the older Guilty Gear games, even going as far as to make several of the attack animations intentionally choppy. Strangely enough, that choppiness actually makes this game look better. I don't understand it either.\n\nOf course, by the time this game came out on PC, people were already clamoring for the second Xrd game, -REVELATOR-, and by the time [i]that[/i] game releases on Steam we'll probably already have a third game in the works. This is still a very fun game, though. If there's one criticism I do have, it's that Arc System Works' games tend to not have the greatest netcode out there. The game's online functions well enough, but suffers from delay at times and doesn't seem to cooperate very well with streaming software, or at least it didn't for me.\n\nAlso the game has Elphelt

always feel that some chars are easier to  play than others but right now i feel the game is well balanced, nice animations and an awesome 3d effect without losing the sprite like animations this shows us that going 3d doesnt means to lose your classic animation style, i would like to see more companies trying to maintaing the classic models but adapting them to 3d modeling, the only thing that malkes me feel bad is the slow progression in the main story XD please show us more about the counsil XD in other words the ga,e is awesome the animation is cool and the music and sounds well i didnt adressed them because this game is perfect in that department and as before the music is awesome...  \nget the game asap\n\ny como soy de Mexcio ahi les va este es un juegazo las animaciones

Fun, there's nothing else to describe it. \n\nCombat system allows for real self-expression. \nCharacters have really different gameplays (coming from SF5, characters feel a lot more diversified). \nMovement is fast and has a strong air component with its air-dashing. No sitting around here like Street Fighter.\nOptimal combos are lenghty (10skills/inputs) and never fall boring.\nLots of oki chars.\nKeyframes are clear and consistent.\n[url=http://www.dustloop.com/forums/index.php?/forums/topic/12529-ggxrd-input-lag-tests-results-pc-ps4-ps3/]One of best input lag <3f[/url]\nThere are tight tiers list (Sin/Johny being top), but every character is fun to play and feel special.\nReal anti-air potential that leads to dmg (not like SF5).\n\n[url=https://skygrindah.blogspot.be/2015/07/guilty-gear-xrd-usability-chart.html?m=1]Good ressource explainng all characters technicality and focus (link)[/url]\nI can't list everything since I'm no master. What I can say however is that this system is [b]amazingly balanced. There is strong offense but there are plenty of defensive options[/b], this is really much more than footsies/neutral. Taking every aspect of it to its maximum potential is a real challenge.\n\nTo list some of them\n[url]http://www.dustloop.com/wiki/index.php/Guilty_Gear_Xrd_-REVELATOR-[/url]\n[u]Offensive[/u]\n-Roman cancels : spend meter for instant timestop allowing to extend combos or special setup\n-0f throws + airthrows for everyone\n-RISC : harassing a blocking opponent will rise his RISC level, increasing incoming damage and potentially forcing a counter hit\n-Clash : perfectly timed counter allowing for an instant combo on open component\n-Unblockables : certain moves can't be blocked, hence can be used in tricky setups/okis\n-Instant kills : more for a cool factor since they're not practical, leads into a anime sequence\n\n[u]Defensive[/u]\n-Dead angle attack : spend meter while blocking to knock-away the opponent (like V-reversal)\n-Blitz shield : spend meter while blocking to attack opponent and put him in stagger state, open for combos. This can be countered on reaction by also spending meter.\n-Instant block : timed blocking, lowers hitstun and slightly increases meter\n-Faultless defense : spend a little meter while blocking. No chip dmg and RISC, more push-back/blockstun\n-Burst : a separate type of meter that regens over time, work as a combo-breaker (can be blocked/whiffed). Starts full at R1 and carries to next rounds.\n-Throw teching\n-iframes on backstep\n\n[u]Balancing[/u]\n-GUTS : lower incoming dmg at lower HP\n-Proration : certain moves leads to lower dmg scaling combos (fast move having lower scaling)\n-Negative penalty : lose all meter if you don't move/attack. No turtling around !\n-Hellfire : if at <20% HP, your specials will do more dmg\n\nI've experienced with plenty of combat systems in all type of games be it Dark Souls, Black Desert / Tera MMORPG or the obvious fighting games.\nThis one is the best in my books, explaining why would take pages.\n\nA touch on [b]difficulty and execution[/b]. The system isn't hard to understand. Take your time to go through the tutorial (which is the best period) and wiki and you'll get clear\nexplanations of the different mechanics. Optimal combos will have 10-15 inputs with plenty of charge moves and chaining. However you can get easily 80% dmg of a optimal combo with lower execution. A typical anti-air is 8 inputs. That doesn't make this game a hell of execution but it sets the bar high so you might want to do your daily fingering routine at the lab ! \n[b]Guilty Gear relies mostly on chaining[/b] which is easier timing and more flowing, contrary to Street Fighter linking.\nAlso the matchup knowledge is absolutely crucial since characters are so different.\n\n[b]In fine : Medium difficulty to start. Very high bar on max potential. Harder to start than a Street Fighter 5 and harder to master.\nBut ! Don't swear by this system because it's hard, it is just the funniest and most satisfying to play.[/b]\n\n[h1]Art[/h1]\nTop-notch cel shading. Some would say one of the best on the market right now. 3D characters that retain the 2D feel whilst allowing for cinematics. \nCharadesign is perfect, diversified and inspired.\nSame would go for backgrounds, but none of them really struck me compared to the perfect chars.\nOne thing that may split opinions : varied framerates elements. Post-effect is 60FPS, background/cinematics 30FPS, characters 24FPS with 12 keyframes (hand corrected).\nThere are clear design reasons why Arc went this way [url]https://youtu.be/yhGjCzxJV3E?t=33m57s[/url].\nI like it except for specials cinematics (ie Elphelt Judge better half) where the 30FPS does feel off.\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\n[url=https://youtu.be/symCvnUCRwI]BGM are nothing short from perfect (Youtube link)[/url]. Mostly Metal style.\nJapanese VA are perfect.\nSome effects and mixing were sub-bar. I'm using a Asus Xonar Essence One and Sennheiser 650 so this might be a compatibility issue due to port.\nI couldn't find those issues in Revelator so hopefully it will be fixed.\n\n[h1]Netplay[/h1]\nClear frame lag display \nAverage 120 players at a set time are on PC Sign compared to 1200 on SF5 PC(which has crossplay).\nThere is no crossplay.\nGood netcode (better than SF5)\nRandom matching will be pretty inexistent, I'd recommend getting on the dedicated Guilty Gear Steam Groups and Discord to make some pals !\nStart here [url]https://www.reddit.com/r/Guiltygear/[/url]\nThis being a old niche game (niche game of a niche gametype), you'll be mostly running in skilled players. So only get into this community with a good attitude as you should with every game !\n\n[h1]Story and solo content[/h1]\n4.5h of content which I did in one go and really enjoyed !\nReal lore background, topnotch jap VA, good story for a fighting game with actual characters construction !\nTechnical is average : 75% visual novel style with 3D chars, 25% 3D cinematics with average environment.\nCharacters and their VA carried it mainly for me.\nA worthy story mode compared to the insulting filler crap that Capcom came up with for SF5.\nArcade and mission mode (offers some nice variety)\nGetting ingame credits is easy with all different modes.\n\n[h1]PC port quality[/h1]\nMax resolution 1080p (more if tweaking with GeDosato)\nAll good for the rest\n\n[h1]Comparison with SF5[/h1]\nI am Karin gold on Street Fighter 5 350h. SF is mainly fundamentals and footsies (which isn't bad), but GG makes for a more varied intresting and fun experience with more potential.\nThe first thing I noticed is how active defense could be. Street Fighter defense is guesswork only and leads to terrible negative edge if you think of the 8f input lag taking reaction partially out of the game.\n\nContent in Guilty Gear is miles ahead.\nArc/Guilty Gear does better in every aspect and love what they do !\nArc really shows they care with their production where Capcom mainly feeds their fanbase with uninspired unfinished mediocrity at high price.", "timestamp_created": 1471471237, "timestamp_updated": 1471515763, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505562", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24962574": {"recommendationid": "24962574", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096279013", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 880, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466524646}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc559\uae30\ubaa8\ub760", "timestamp_created": 1471385799, "timestamp_updated": 1471385799, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24951047": {"recommendationid": "24951047", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126634402", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 14691, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481696679}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u5272\u3068\u6b74\u53f2\u306e\u3042\u308b\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3068\u3044\u3046\u3053\u3068\u3067\u3001\u4ee5\u524d\u304b\u3089\u540d\u524d\u3060\u3051\u306f\u77e5\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\u304c\u3001\n3000\u5186\u4ee5\u5185\u3068\u3044\u3046\u304a\u624b\u9803\u3055\u3068\u4e3b\u4eba\u516c\u306e\u30dc\u30a4\u30b9\u76ee\u5f53\u3066\u306b\u8cfc\u5165\u3002\n\n\u6577\u5c45\u306f\u304b\u306a\u308a\u9ad8\u3044\u6c17\u304c\u3057\u307e\u3059\u304c\u3001\u305d\u3053\u305d\u3053\u697d\u3057\u3081\u305f\u306e\u3067\u826f\u8a55\u4fa1\u3002\n\u4eca\u306f\u30b3\u30f3\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30de\u6a5f\u3067\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u7248\u304c\u51fa\u3066\u3044\u308b\u306e\u3067\u3001\n\u4eba\u306f\u3088\u308a\u6e1b\u3063\u305f\u306e\u304b\u306a\u3068\u3044\u3046\u5370\u8c61\u3067\u3059\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1471340918, "timestamp_updated": 1471340918, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24837202": {"recommendationid": "24837202", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043728918", "num_games_owned": 314, "num_reviews": 110, "playtime_forever": 10237, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511738560}, "language": "english", "review": "Where the FUCK is Revelator, Arcsys?\n\nI'll first day buy that shit just fucking release already.\n\nI guess since I do reviews of stuff in a serious manner I might as well make this half-serious: game is good. The tiers are really, really close and tight to the point where no tier list is agreed upon, as opposed to SFV or KOF2002 whereby the tiers are pretty much set in stone. In other words: all the characters in this game are viable and no one is truly bottom tier (other than Potemkin and Slayer). This game is incredibly well-balanced, which it should be since these characters (minus the new ones) have been getting honed and worked on for close to a decade. Which makes me wonder why the SF characters that have been there since II aren't as balanced and close in terms of tier strength and viability.\n\nThere are no clone characters. Every character is unique and your skills with that person doesn't carry over to the other, precisely because they are so unique. The point is better accentuated through contrast: Gouken, Dee Jay, Ryu, Sakura, Dan, Akuma, and Sean are all different characters (with different placement on tier lists). But in many ways they are simply different takes on the same formula: they all have roughly the same inputs for specials and their differences are just that their Dp's and Tatsus are different takes on the same move. It's variations of the same principle; they are all shotos. \n\nGG on the other hand has much more variety in characters and your skills with one won't carry over to another. Some characters have their own unique ''gimmicks'', like Sin's hunger gauge that depletes with every special used but, conversely powers up specials the fuller it is. Venom has pool balls he sets on stage he can teleport to, and all his moves launch them in different trajectories, angles hit also matter. Or Johnnys limited coins for a bout that-oh wait that's in Revelator WHERE THE FU*K IS REVELATOR ARCSYS.\n\nThe point is that because the characters are much more varied and different than SF's roster you have to dedicate yourself more to each individual character to truly master them. It took me 70 hours to get a grip on Axl and all the matchups he has; in 100 hours I mained around 8 different characters in SFIV. Granted I'm also much better at GG than SFIV so take that however you wish.\n\nBecause each character has their own unique playstyle that doesn't really carry over to any other character your matchup in GG matters more and the manner in which you approach people may drastically change. Against a Venom I know he has projectiles all over the map that hit my hurtboxes, so I rushdown and use my long range normals much more carefully and less frequently (which is REALLY FUC*ING WEIRD FOR AXL); against a KY I make use of my Rensen a lot more just as a pressure tool and don't follow up; against Sol I mind the flames on the floor and am careful with my chains since they have hurtboxes his DP can stuff. Like any fighter your general technique is the same but because there's more variety here in the roster and playstyles you'll find yourself playing much differently depending on the matchup.\n\nI'll end the SF comparison by saying this: FUCK 50/50's. There's none of that bullsh*t ''will he grab or dp on my wakeup'' that some characters in SF have, and thank GOD cause if it's a literal guessing game then eff that.\n\nWhat there IS here is an EXTREME emphasis on okizeme and mixups/rushdown. This might as well be called, ''okizeme: The Fighting Game''. For those unfamiliar: oki just means your tactics on the enemies wakeup. So after a hard knockdown, what comes next? That's when your pressure game and your mixups come into play; your oki game. This game has a larger emphasis on hard knockdowns and pressure than any other. What this means is that if you're new at this you're gonna get perfected 10 times over; if this game teaches ANYTHING it's how to EFFIN BLOCK.\n\nBut if you think turtling all game is great; it's not. Your super gauge (called tension in this game) is completed depleted if you're just holding back all the time. You're penalized for turtling by having your entire gauge erased and by taking even MORE damage from the next hit that connects and isn't blocked. \n\nSo not only does this game want you to learn how to block, but it also wants you to do as little of that as possible and to look for holes in offense and counter attack. This makes for fights as hype as MvsC3 fights, except without the touch of death combos due to perforation (reduced damage as the combo continues) and the myriad of defensive options this game has.\n\nYou can parry for 1/4'th your tension gauge. You can have your tension gauge slowly deplete if you activate Just Defense, which negates all chip damage. You have Dead Angle Attack, which is essentially a dp for half your gauge (usefulness varies by character). And you can Instant Defend, which builds up tension as you block, by blocking at the proper timing (think of it as SFIII parries, except you press back). There's also Burst, which can be used offensively or defensively. It builds slowly over a match; faster if you're taking damage, but you start with it full at each fights start. Your character jumps up negating all hit or block stun and lets our a burst, hitting your opponent. This can be used to get out of pressure or offensively to gain 100% tension. Whether you need tension more than the defensive option it provides depends on matchup and how confident you feel.\n\nFinally there's roman cancels. You have three roman cancels, which use different amounts of tension but all do the same thing: cancel what you're doing right away. It's SFIV's FADC; only more intuitive and much more central to play. You can do X and roman cancel; you can stand still and roman cancel; you can roman cancel the recovery, but it all costs tension. Depending on the matchup and your character you may need to roman cancel your approach with a projectile of some sort, or you may do a mixup and roman cancel for a continuation. Axl, for example, has a command grab that has range; you can roman cancel it on the enemie's wakeup when they jump to use your anti air chains, so you're essentially doing an unblockable if timed right. But the enemy can jump and roman cancel in the air (roman cancels slow down time slightly), and dash forward with the extra time gained.\n\nSo roman cancels are central and can lead to mind games, as well as the creation of space and some cheeky cheeky cheeky plays. In many cases your tension is better put to use with roman cancels rather than supers, although some characters have really good supers that can be used as reversals and are useful in particular matchups (ramlethal can use hers to close the gap with Axl and get up close for a hard knockdown, but she doesn't need it against, say, a Sol). \n\nit's a fantastic anime fighter with a lot of depth to it that makes it fast, hype, but also deep and tactical. It's like MvsC3 or Skullgirls but fast and with a lot of tools and complexity. The online is still alive; albeit GG is nowhere near as popular as the mainstream fighter (since there's really only one) Street Fighter. Mainly because it's much harder to get into any individual character and generally more complex in...everything. \n\nOh and it brings a 6 hour movie. GG has an assload of lore and story to it that I keep telling myself I'm gonna get into but never do. The music is also incredible, the presentation is fantastic, the designs and art are great. It's pretty much the best anime fighter and, in my opinion, 2D fighter on the market at the moment.

With full 3D animations modified with intentional frame lag to resemble sprites, the game's artistic style is god like. Combine intense visuals with the games rocking soundtrack and also access to classic songs from previous games, Xrd respects its past while adding a whole new soundtrack to the series. As a fan of the series, I was disappointed with the smaller roster, however they will be adding more characters in the Revelator expansion. This game delivers on so many levels, and respects classic fans to the series while also establishing as a more stylized and ultimately different Guilty Gear experience, but one that leaves little if anything to complain about.

My only wish would be that the story mode is less played out as an actual visual novel and more like an actual anime fully animated instead of story boarded at least what little I have seen of it, as like BlazeBlu it eventually becomes a who cares button mash just to get through the awkward dialog play outs, while it has its charm it isn't a Clannad or Stiens Gate/ Chaos Head deep type of story, and for an anime, well, thats terribad, as most anime is defined by a deep story and the way its story unfolds. Music is always amaing from Arc but to be blunt if they want the higher end sales, it doesn't mater how good the fighting on a technical scale the game is, it just needs to work properly. Arc is getting better at PC ports, but they are still in that old capcom bad PC port era, and like I said if they want the PC crowd they need to do better and whine less about sales when the games clearly have issues.", "timestamp_created": 1466741130, "timestamp_updated": 1466741130, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.398794", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23741446": {"recommendationid": "23741446", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048290852", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1989, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484942550}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Supimpa.", "timestamp_created": 1466734632, "timestamp_updated": 1466734632, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23697814": {"recommendationid": "23697814", "author": {"steamid": "76561198166885149", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 4337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474555077}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u662f\u5f88\u597d\uff0c\u4f4e\u7aef\u663e\u5361\u4f1a\u6bd4\u8f83\u5403\u529b\u3002\u4e0d\u8fc7\u5728\u60c5\u6000\u9762\u524d\u90fd\u4e0d\u662f\u4e8b\u513f\u3002\u65b0\u7248\u672c\u8981\u51fa\u4e86\uff0c\u4e0d\u518d\u63a8\u8350\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1466563803, "timestamp_updated": 1480651543, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23687760": {"recommendationid": "23687760", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999363278", "num_games_owned": 1986, "num_reviews": 224, "playtime_forever": 853, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458365555}, "language": "english", "review": "EMBRACE THE ANIME.\n\nI really hope that REVELATOR is ported to PC in a shorter time frame  than this took.", "timestamp_created": 1466524619, "timestamp_updated": 1466524619, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.745664", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23643534": {"recommendationid": "23643534", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069533181", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478134801}, "language": "english", "review": "A cool game with interesting characters.

Been a fan of the Guilty Gear series for a LONG TIME, and this one does not fail to deliver. Responds much better on PC than I hoped and actually fair enough for newcomers to pick up.

A bit too cartoony compared to the others. Other than that, if you're a fan of the series you won't be disappointed. The story is FAR more fleshed out than in previous installments and leaves you with a good understanding of events that are taking place, if you've been a dedicated follower of the franchise.

"english", "review": "Guilty Gear Xrd is essentially a huge step up from other 2D fighters that were ported to the PC. It has little to no bugs especially with arcsys working hard to fix the game often. For a game not originally made with a PC port it's got pretty good online play albeit it still needs improvements. \n\nPros:\nTo start off with what GGXrd does right is that for a game that was originally for PS3/PS4, it runs just as, if not even better on PC. No real input delay, and is even supported by a diverse amount of controllers (keyboard included). Although it should be noted that the controller needs to be plugged in before you start the game otherwise the game will only recognize the keyboard inputs. \nGraphicswise it looks and performs better than the PS3/PS4 version (as long as you have a graphics card better than the standard Intel card). However, the game can still even run around 50-60 fps on the Intel graphics if you turn down the settings. Don't expect it to look pretty though. The game itself runs on Unreal Engine 3 which was originally intended for Windows.\nAlso, the online lobby system is one of the best I've seen. It has 8 player lobbies, with 4 battle rooms for those players to interact. So it doesn't just come down to 8 players with 2 fighting while 6 spectate. You have full control of your player icon to move around the rooms and switch what battle room you want to participate in. Whether you want to play winner next in line or just spectate. There's even an AFK section for players who haven't pressed a button in awhile so people don't get stuck on empty battle rooms.\n\nThe character cast itself is really well done for a fighting game. Very diverse and stylish character designs. And the characters themselves offer playstyles suited for almost everyone. Starting from simple straightforward characters like Sol Badguy and Ky Kiske, to zoners like Axl, and for the people who like playing two characters at once there's Zato-1.\n\nCons:\nThis is not really a problem I've come across with the PS3/PS4 version. However, it's worth mentioning because people are bound to come across this issue. Like I mentioned previously, the online play itself works fine. Connecting into player lobbies is mostly consistent especially if you're playing with someone in the same region. Playing with someone far away can cause input delay, which can even reach to 10-14 frame delay which is almost unplayable. In my experience, I've tried playing with people on the other side of the world and sometimes had 4 ms delay so it can work sometimes far away. The biggest problem with GGXrd on the PC port is that there's problems connecting to people, especially with ranked mode. And also if you're playing on strict NAT you won't be able to connect to people at all. Which can be a problem for colleges specifically as most run on strict NAT.\n\nOverall rating - 7.5/10\nIt's a great fighting game, and a must buy for arcsys fans especially if you're a Blazblue player. Would rate higher if not for it's issues with the online function that I touched upon. Although, arcsys has been dishing out patches continuously to better improve the online as well as other bugs. \n\nWith the sequel \"GGXrd Revelator\" rolling around the corner in just a couple of months, this is a great opportunity for new players to give this game a shot.", "timestamp_created": 1460921962, "timestamp_updated": 1460938801, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.640449", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22484825": {"recommendationid": "22484825", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998135402", "num_games_owned": 273, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 16303, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481881661}, "language": "english", "review": "After a Dozen Years comes now the next new Installment of Guilty Gear.\n\nDeveloped with the Unreal Engine 3, the Game features now real 3D Chars (No HD Sprites) alongside some few Cinematics during Play which gives the Feel of Immersive 3D. The Game itself is still played in 2D (Arenas are tough 3D Maps with Impression giving 2D).\n\nYou can choose over 16 Characters (some New alongside some Old Ones) each with his own Challenge Course for learning BnB Combos. The Story Mode is now a Movie (estimated 4 hours) without some Interaction, so you can sit back and press only the Text Screens away during Talking between Characters.\n\nFor Singleplayer there is not much Content: M.O.M, Arcade, Story Mode, Challenges and Missions (BlazBlue in Comparison offers in that Regard more Gameplay for Singleplayer)\n\nNetwork is like in BB by opening Lobbys for People to gather. As Host you have Options kicking out unwanted Guests or announcing disclosure of Room (Useful for a better Closure while others are finishing their Matches)\n\nHere are some of my +/ o / - Points:\n\nPositive:\n- 1080p Support for gorgeous looking Fights\n- 16 Chars to choose from which isnt that few since its newly developed\n- Roman Cancel Mechanic was remade, so that FRC is possible for everyone (in GGXX FRC were limited and difficult to perform for Beginners (Hit FRC at 1/15 of a Second in a Frame!))\n- M.O.M has more Depth than in GGXX (Comparable like the Abyss Mode in BB)\n- Network Code is much better and has automatic Delay (GGXX AC+R used static Delay if i recall correctly)\n- Videos in Story Mode gives you some Anime Feeling and is good to watch (Could also turn in a full fledget Anime IMHO)\n- New Mechanics like Blitzshield for Counterattacking, etc.\n- Connection and FPS Counter for Network Mode gives you good Infos if Match is possible\n- Hellfire Mechanic (Higher Damage, etc.) gives you Motivation to continue when you reach Critical Health before loosing.\n\nNeutral:\n- Danger Time Mechanic can be annoying depending how you see it (20% more Damage if you get hit while being in Mortal Counter State with nearly no Teching!)\n- Some Old Chars have gained/losed more Moves than other (Example: Axl/Ky getting better Moves, Slayer being ripped off of some vital Moves from AC+R, etc.)\n- New Roman Cancel Mechanic and other Adjustements may be a Turn Down for Veterans from GGXX. Xrd has a more \"casual\" feeling to avoid a too high learning curve for Beginners\n\nNegative:\n- Low Content for Singleplayer\n- No Survival Mode in Xrd\n- Huge Damage Scaling. Some Combos can reduce nearly 3/4 of your Health Bar in one Combo Chain!!!\n- OP DLC Chars in my Eyes (DLC Chars (Leo, Elphelt & Sin) have (very) high damage output)\nNote: Sin/Elphelt got nerfed strongly in Revelator, which shows how unbalanced they are in Sign\n- Few Old Chars nerfed strongly in Xrd (Slayer and Potemkin from Top Tier to Low Tier in Xrd)\n- Rarely Bug: After committing to a Match, you get thrown out because Connection wasn't possible\n\nFazit:\nI can wholeheartly recommend this Game for GG Fans and Newcomers. \nSince the new Revision \"Rev2\" is also on Steam, i recommend switching over there since this Game is would be \"dead\" online", "timestamp_created": 1460920314, "timestamp_updated": 1499115853, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503626", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22483027": {"recommendationid": "22483027", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073227297", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1497, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485170599}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc120\uc785\uacac\uc774\ub098 \uc778\uc9c0\ub3c4\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc815\ub9d0 \uc88b\uc740, \uc548\ud0c0\uae4c\uc6b4 \uc218\uc791.", "timestamp_created": 1460915154, "timestamp_updated": 1460915154, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22444852": {"recommendationid": "22444852", "author": {"steamid": "76561198267136497", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 293, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482638907}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\uff27\uff27\uff12\u304c\u4e0d\u660e\u306a\u30a8\u30e9\u30fc\u3067\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3067\u304d\u306a\u304f\u3066\u3001\u30ec\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u3059\u3089\u3055\u305b\u3066\u3082\u3089\u3048\u306a\u3044\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u9593\u9055\u3044\u306a\u304f\u540d\u4f5c\u306a\u306e\u306b\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb", "timestamp_created": 1460785545, "timestamp_updated": 1460785545, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485876", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22396651": {"recommendationid": "22396651", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132323207", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1769, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495460526}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc7bc\uc7bc", "timestamp_created": 1460564039, "timestamp_updated": 1460564039, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.975124", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22374518": {"recommendationid": "22374518", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159262469", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 996, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485067447}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best anime 2D Fighting games out there .... a must buy for Arc System Work fans ... a step forward when they use Unreal Engine to make the game ... unlike other fighting games (like SF , MK , DOA and etc.) this game is more fast pace with sometimes ridiculious combos but can be forgiven once you mastered some of the combos ..... additionally i like  to add that personally i like the game even more because of its air and ground dash , makes it easier for me to push my opponent ... in the end i would recommend 9/10 ... a must buy", "timestamp_created": 1460464555, "timestamp_updated": 1460464589, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22368298": {"recommendationid": "22368298", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002747293", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 858, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470188859}, "language": "english", "review": "I haven't played another guilty gear game since guilty gear reloaded and isuka.

point)\n\n-Mechanics are easy to learn , hard to master , just the way a like it.\n\n-The characters are well-designed and have their own gameplay\n\n-Full of content , especially the singleplayer mode ( This is why I appreciate so much ASW games , they don't just focus on multiplayer , but also on a REAL story mode and other funny modes )\n\n-Kick Ass OST , besides the fact you can play old BGM from the previous games !\n\n-Runs smoothly for me , right at the 60 fps\n\nCons:\n\n-Not as many as characters as the previous games\n\n-Certain problems with netcodes.\n\n\nOverall , a really

Words like \"satisfying\" sound a little trite and hollow considering the tremendous effort that goes into a fighter that delivers what you expect from a worthy entry to the genre. Guilty Gear Xrd is, quite simply, one of the best fighters out there right now, let alone one of the best fighters available on this distribution platform. As you'd expect from this series, the visuals are gorgeous, the sound is killer, the community is decent, and the basic mechanics are easy enough for a novice to pick up and enjoy. The Tutorial and Mission modes in this game are an outstanding introduction to Xrd's new elements (For those of us who need to be broken of the bad habits we picked up in AC) as well as a great platform for newcomers to improve not only in this game, but fighting games in general. If you're one of those guys that cut your teeth on #Reload's multiplayer, you'll be at home in rather short order.\n\nThat said, it's not perfect. The character roster is disappointingly lean, and the learning curve for a considerable number of those characters available is startlingly high. The multiplayer interface is unintuitive garbage, and in general, too much of Xrd's metagame takes place in corners for my liking. I personally still prefer AC+R for these reasons, but not by a significant enough margin to abandon either game.

System Works has put out so far. I don't think I can express how greatful I am to see such an amazing & functional port of what I would consider to be the most impressive 2.5D fighting game released to date. Absolutely amazing job, 10/10 would buy again, highly recommended for realsies.\n\nIf I did have to make one very minor criticism of the game it would have to be that my waifu, Baiken, is completely missing. Since her appearance in Guilty Gear (PSX) she has steadily fell lower & lower through the ranks with each passing game & is now reduced to nothing more then a footprint in the sand, threatened to be washed out of existence by the sea of the ever changing Guilty Gear timeline. She used to be your series Akuma, harder to unlock than Justice, & now she's just gone! I just can't stand for this, you gotta bring her back.

The first Guilty Gear on the PS1 is the one that started the madness of jump blocking, clashing, dashing through the air, and instantly killing the opponent in a fun anime fashion. I got into the series recently after watching the Guilty Gear XRD Top 8 at Evo. There were many amazing moments, and some shameful upsets, (I am looking at you, Woshige), so I was instantly hooked. I had the delight of starting from the beginning with an emulator and experiencing the series' growth. I worked my way up through Guilty Gear X, XX, Accent Core, and now we are here, (I am sorry that I didn't play you, Overture). \n\n-Graphics:\nGuilty Gear XRD is the revival of the series after ages of experimenting and releasing revisions of XX, and boy, it delivers. How much? Enough for it to be my favorite fighting game of all time. Enthusiasts say that fighting games are all about gameplay, but I cannot ignore what this game does with its graphics even in my horrid CRT monitor and bad system specs. The game looks like a drawn anime, but the catch is that it's actually rendered in full 3D with cel-shading that makes it look like an anime. You can see glimpses of this everytime you perform Dust attacks (Which are basically full-screen launchers), when you perform Overdrives, when the round is over, and with Instant Kills. The Instant Kills are pretty hard to hit, so they aren't broken; they are pretty damn rewarding tho, and I always compared them to Mortal Kombat fatalities as they get easier to use when the enemy is about to lose the match. Everything in this game is gorgeous and full of personality, however, the framerate on model animations is pretty jaggy, (Apparently because they wanted to make it similar to the animation of anime).\n\nDuring the following paragraphs I will go over all the new mechanics that the game has, so if you are not interested in reading that technobabble you can skip to the content section:\n\n-Mechanics:\nXRD revamps the Roman Cancel system, as XX's was kinda unreliable with its forced roman cancels. RC's cancel attacks and slow down time significantly, giving you time to use them effectively. Now Roman Cancels are divided into three versions, Red, Yellow, and Purple. Red RC's are used when linked after an attack that hits the opponent and can extend combos, but they cost half of your Tension bar (The bar used for Overdrives), they are often better than overdrives because they are already hit confirmed and are usually friendlier for hit scaling. Yellow RC's are used after an attack that doesn't hit the opponent yet or at all; they cost 25% of the bar, so you can use them often to cancel out of punishable moves and slow down time like a vampire. You don't want to use Purple RC's, as they are just like the Yellow ones but cost 50% bar, they happen when you are late to do a YRC. There are many other new mechanics, like the Blitz Shield, which is a parry that leaves the opponent open to combos (It costs 25% of the gauge, but you usually get 12.5% back from the combo, so it's very good), and the R.I.S.C. Gauge, which punishes overly defensive play with forced counter attacks and stun.\n\nThe best thing about this game is that there isn't just multiple variables to everything, such as the above uses of RC's, the two uses for the Burst attack (One to get out of combos and the other to attack and get a full bar of tension), and the R.I.S.C gauge decreasing with hits as a secondary hit scaling, but additionally, there is an answer for everything as well, such as Bursts being thrown, Blitz Shield follow-ups being Blitz Shielded back, and the usual Block>Attack>Throw>Block. What Arc Sys has made a system deep as an ocean, but it isn't inaccessibly complex, everything that I just told you is in the in-depth tutorial which explains every single system of the game. Anything that isn't said in the tutorial, such as Jump Installs and Faultless Defense Cancels, are explained in character Challenges for those who have them. It may sound like a lot to keep in mind, but you can always revisit the tutorial, learn combos in the Challenge mode, and practice the systems and matchups in Mission Mode.\n\n-Content:\nI mentioned the Tutorial, Challenge mode, Mission mode, but there is also a Training mode; all of these are part of the Practice section and there is 600 challenges and 50 missions, more than enough to provide a great learning experience. Additionally, there is a singleplayer Arcade mode, which has cutscenes for each character (Except the three bonus characters and the arcade boss). These cutscenes serve as a prologue to the game's Story mode, a 5 hour long anime \"Movie\", or rather, an animated visual novel, which is the closest thing you will get to an actual Guilty Gear anime. The Story has no gameplay so there is no forced fights that ruin the pace of the story, which happened to me with Mortal Kombat; you can just sit back, relax, and enjoy watching the chaos unfold. The last Single Player mode is M.O.M. mode; a survival game where you can costumize your character with extra special moves, stats, and equipment. To get the items you have to fight for money and loot against opponents with many low health bars (Don't worry, you get multiple health bars as well with score level ups). When an opponent is at his or her last health bar they activate \"boss\" mode where they get anti knockback armor, attack in patterns, and basically become a Megaman boss. I don't have much experience with this mode, but I really want to play more of it; it's great for practicing Bread n' Butter combos as too!\n\nThere are 17 characters, 3 which used to be DLC and you have to unlock with in-game money. I heard unlocking them takes $200,000 for each character (The games currency), but I had them unlocked when I bought it because I got it in the first month, but be prepared to finish every arcade mode to unlock all characters. In total it's a pretty small fighter roster, but considering it's the series' first jump to 3D and the game will have 6 more characters when the new installment comes out (Johnny, Dizzy, Jam, Jack'O, Kum, and Raven), it's not such a big flaw, especially with so many unique and interesting characters. Speaking of which, Revelator is coming out soon so you may want to use this review for that game instead, but be warned, its story is going to be a continuation of -SIGN- so you may want to play this first.\n\nFinally, there is the Online mode. There are Ranked matches, where matchmaking gets you an opponent to fight, and Player matches, where you go to a virtual arcade to fight, spectate, and chat in a lobby with 4 arcade machines and 8 players. Honestly, I have virtually no experience playing on Ranked (Only 2 matches) because I want to be really good before getting a bunch of losses. Nevertheless, the Unranked format is my favorite and is done in many Arc Systems games. Some people don't dig it, but it's really fun to play King of the Hill on one arcade and land an Instant Kill with everyone commenting \"OOOOOOH NO HE DIDN'T!\". My connection experience varies depending on the location of the person I am playing with, thankfully you can see their connection bars, the host's country, and even the frame delay you are gonna get. You can also set your room to training, private, and M.O.M.\n\n-Music:\nButt rock to its finest: (Parody) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUZxR-k186I \nBut in all seriousness, as a metalhead, I couldn't be more pleased with this games' soundtrack. Every character gets his/her theme and it fits them well. There are songs from previous games too.\n\n-Overall:\n9.5/10\n+ Extremely deep gameplay.\n+ Gorgeous graphics.\n+ A lot of modes and learning tools.\n+ Fun story.\n+ Interesting and colorful characters.\n- Jaggy FPS for animations.\n- Small Roster.\n\nThis is my first review so sorry for it being badly written.

Before I bought this game I had little to no experience in fighting games other than the original Super Smash Bros. and Brawl. I've heard of the Fighting Game Community and Street Fighter peaked my interest a few times but it never really hooked me into it.\n\nSo exactly why did I decide to buy Xrd? A fighting game that really shouldn't be recommended for newcomers? Because of the MOTHER! FUCKING! SOUNDTRACK!!! The OST in this game is absolutely amazing for any rock and even metal lover. Guitar riffs are almost always original and most songs feel like they could be seperate video game themes simply from how good they sound. Diva of Destruction, Give Me A Break, Starry Story, Just Do It are all particular songs that I just can't listen to enough.\n\nBut what of the rest of the game?\nWell the designs and functionality of each character is extremely unique even within the game's universe. One character does not feel like the other and usually has their own unique playstyle. You have the Big Brooding Badass Sol Badguy who uses a sword more like a hammer and can bust out his Dragon form when shit hits the fan and then you have the (21 year-old) Japanesse Loli Pirate May who is basically the equivalent to Anime Aquaman in terms of power but is actually impactful to the story and is quite useful. From a design standpoint you have a crap ton of variety of characters so you're almost gaurenteed to find someone you like.\n\nThe gameplay itself is as solid as I've ever seen. Almost anything can be answered with anything else. The mechanics of Roman Cancel, Faultless Guard, Jump Cancel, Burst and much more intricate mechanics make sure that literally no match is decided by character selection it's all skill and the community as far as I've seen backing this game will do everything in their power to make sure you git gud.\n\nWould I recommend this to someone interested in the fighting genre? Yes. Absolutely yes. Even if you don't take the game seriously enough to be competetive the characters and art style of the game is unique of itself and deserves to at least be tried. I believe anyone who's in the FGC and hasn't at least played a few matches of this game is sorely missing out.\n\nWould I reommend this to just any casual video game player though? No. As I said before there is a lot of stuff to take in when you first pick up this game and it can easily get overwhelming. I studied this game and it's mechanics months before it came out on Steam and the tutorial still overwhelmed me because of how much I needed to consider in a match. It's ultimately fair but at the same time it can be grueling and even cruel at times to newbies.\n\nIf you're thinking of buying this game though then go for it. You won't be disappointed I promise. The soundtrack is amazing, characters are great, artstyle and graphics mesh really well together with the combat and ultimately this all comes together to make both the game itself and it's individual battles between players fun to watch and fun to play.\n\nCurrently, I'm waiting for SFV to be released so I can get into another fighting game and then after that I'm going to be waiting for BlazBlue ChornoPhantasm Extend (another game I've been hyping myself up to since it's from the same developers that makes GGXrd.) I can wholeheartedly say that this game is the game that got me into the Fighting Games Community and for that I couldn't thank GGXrd, Daisuke Ishiwatari and Arcsys enough.\n\nA word of advice to the newbies from a fellow newbie though. YOU WILL GET YOUR ASS KICKED IN! But do not fret. In fact embrace the ass kicking. Learn from the ass kicking. The only way you're going to ultimately get better is to find a character you like with a playstyle to match your mindset and then just go online and fight. At first you might be discouraged but do not quit. You ARE getting better and you will eventually see your struggle come to fruition when you land your first dust-to-knock down combo in a match, then when you land a perfect Roman Cancel and then finally you'll score your first few wins. And the best part about all that is that you know you did it yourself with no handholding.\n\nWell that was a much longer review than I'd hope.", "timestamp_created": 1455564350, "timestamp_updated": 1455759752, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.644809", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21232108": {"recommendationid": "21232108", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271890784", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 492, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500496830}, "language": "english", "review": "follow me on twitter\n", "timestamp_created": 1455550025, "timestamp_updated": 1455550025, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495704", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21229565": {"recommendationid": "21229565", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028235569", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 21230, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499685002}, "language": "english", "review": "It's pretty.\nIt's fluid.\nIt's complex yet intuitive.\nIt will make you hate women with long blonde hair.\nIt has an awesome soundtrack.\nAnd most importantly ...\nIt's fun.\n\nGreat game with a pretty good netcode (just make sure you're playing on a 2-3 bar connection) and with tons of features, such as excellent trials (unlike other fighting games, Xrd actually teaches VIABLE combos and conversions), great tutorial and even matchup specific tutorials which explain you how various characters work and what to watch out for.\n\nThe game is pretty niche though, which has a small drawback that almost everyone you'll meet online is already pretty good - but no worries, even though the game seems very complex, it's actually really intuitive and easy to learn.", "timestamp_created": 1455541527, "timestamp_updated": 1455541527, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.676312", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21227155": {"recommendationid": "21227155", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974209427", "num_games_owned": 226, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 502, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456121812}, "language": "english", "review": "The animation?

games. That doesn't really matter with Guilty Gear Xrd Sign, though, because this game is deceptive. Steam, user reviews, and promotional material may lead you to believe that you are putting down money for a fighting game, not an unreasonable assumption at first. As you pick up the game, in fact, the deception continues. You will swear you are playing a fighting game. It's interactive, fast-paced, sidescrolling. There are quarter circles. Potemkin is there. Don't be fooled, however. What you are really paying for is around 12 episodes of an anime set in the Guilty Gear universe. And it is awesome.\n\nOK, I'm being facetious as usual, but the above paragraph is quite accurate. Arcade mode begins the story, and then there are a solid [b]6+ hours[/b] of cutscene. They split it into its own menu option. Not being a Guilty Gear veteran, said \"story mode\" didn't make a ton of sense to me overall, but I had a blast nevertheless. The characters are decently developed and play off of each other quite well. There's plenty of over-the-top action and I watched the whole thing in one sitting, eager for more. As for the gameplay, it's pretty much standard for fighting games. There are five distinct attack buttons, you hit the opponent until they fall down twice, some moves flow into each other, you know the drill. Despite my ineptitude, I can tell that this game is solid. The controls are very responsive, and the sound design is top-notch. I would recommend this game to anyone who's even remotely interested, because even if the gameplay turns out to not be your thing the story mode is substantial enough to justify the purchase on its own. And that is not a claim I make lightly.", "timestamp_created": 1454397023, "timestamp_updated": 1454397023, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.742778",

The gameplay itself is also fast paced with a good cast of mostly balanced characters. The best part is that this is one of the few fighting games that are immediately getting patches coming in for any issues.\n\nOverall, If you are into fighting games, Its not hard to recommend this game as Its pretty competitive and gives you a wide array of in-match options without much overhead (IE picking styles/grooves/Assists before fights). Its just a straight 2-D fighter.\n\nI cannot comment on the DLC policy as I am an early adopter. Story mode is pretty decent but It does follow some Anime-likeness (as expected, it is a 2-D Fighter from JP), but dont go into it expecting a large fighting tourny. seriously, you probably could youtube the Story and get the same experience. \n\nComplaints for the game include ranked play being kind of a lost cause compared to player matches. This is mostly blamed on the messed up starting of ranked games when the game came out causing it to lose traction. There is some issues related to connecting to players for a select few, but this is fixable by port forwarding or just trying again to connect. Last issue the lack of windowed full screen.

thats it... i enjoyed those 48 min, but playing game wich is ported badly on pc and cant even run on it isnt fun.... even MKX or SF4 was ported better and with those games no problems what so

Now, ArcSys returns to the franchise that helped establish it in the fighting game arena.  It's hard to judge this title on its own merits; if it were in a vacuum this undoubtably be an easy reccomendation as a great fighting game.  \n\nHowever, Guilty Gear XX was so different at the time mostly due to it's wide variety of character types in its roster (many of which had mechanics that were unseen in other fighting games).  While the characters we're given are very unique it's hard to not think about the miriad of memorable roster cuts from the last instalment of the series.  Also, the spiritual successor of Guilty Gear, BlazBlue, has come and shown us that some of the more eccentric quirks of that made many Guilty Gear characters stand out can be distilled into more focused characters that keep their flavor while being much more intuitive.\n\nSo, Guilty Gear Xrd is a little hard to wholeheartedly recommend.  It's a fantastic nostalgia trip for those who remember the older games and a solid fighter for sure.  The innovative take on animating a cel-shaded 2.5d fighter is also almost worth the price of admission alone.  However, I don't think ArcSys' latest is its greatest as BlazBlue really did take what Guilty Gear started and push the envelope into fighting game rocket science.  Even if we avoid comparisons to BlazBlue it's hard to tell if this is even a more complete game than the last Guilty Gear that came out over a decade ago.\n\nSo this is a very tenative recommendation.  It's a good fighting game and Guilty Gear deserved a re-visit.  However, this installment isn't enough to make me feel this is the definitive Guilty Gear over the last installment and ArcSys has already gone on to do better things.", "timestamp_created": 1452418412, "timestamp_updated": 1452418412, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20442829": {"recommendationid": "20442829", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008253375", "num_games_owned": 360, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1892, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464994087}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent port of Guilty Gear Xrd -Sign-!\nEverything works perfectly!", "timestamp_created": 1452418400, "timestamp_updated": 1452418400, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508271", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20441717": {"recommendationid": "20441717", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053464992", "num_games_owned": 757, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 1578, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486791995}, "language": "english", "review": "RIDE THE VALENTINES!

Good luck finding Ranked matches, however. Most play will be in the Player Lobbies. Fortunately, as of the first month, there's usually a good number of lobbies and players with a range in skill, so it's easy to have fun getting your ass kicked and watching others follow your example. If you've got friends to play with, or want to engage in a great fighter online, then this a pretty gold example in a world where Netherealm servers are still a thing.\n\nThe tutorial and challenge modes are some of the best in the genre, easing in new players and vets alike to the system mechanics and basic fundementals before you ever have to tackle a real match. You can spend hours in training without even realizing it. The combat is streamlined compared to past entries, but for the better in most cases (YRCs never needed to be as stupid tight to pull off for how integral they are to Guilty Gear's combat).\n\nSingle player is a mixed bag outside of learning. Story is eh, but like the gameplay, does a good job of explaining everything to newcomers to the series, wraps up quickly enough and offers plenty to those willing to sink their teeth into it. Arcade is your simple 8 AI fights wrapping up with a rival and final boss. M.O.M mode is an incredible grind with RPG elements attached to the fighter experience, and that's really all that's left. \n\nThese modes might be more enjoyable if the AI were any bit competant but unfortunately they're pushovers. Even on the hardest difficulty setting they rarely play like any decent player, lacking any pressure or severe combos to punish players, and they give no indication as to how the respective character is meant to be played. This is crucial, because now a player not only needs to play against real players to test how valid their practice is, but to also learn matchups outside of the tiny bit the challenge modes cover. The AI is very bland by comparison to the great example SFV has set in place (Even if that is a much simpler game).\n\nAlso, as is usual of Aksys, this version of the game will soon be outdated in a few months thanks to their God awful PC Release schedules, and the same will be said of Blazblue CPE once that releases 2 years after the first iteration came to consoles.\nIf you own a PS3/4, wait for Revelator.

Los modelados de los personajes estan bien trabajados asi como los escenarios, algunos son dignos de admirarse por su belleza.\n60fps estables como rocas en mi R9 270x. Excelente port se marco Arcsys.\n\nSonido/Musica: Las voces tanto en ingles como en japones brillan por su calidad de doblaje. En cuanto a la musica cumple sobradamente pero me parece inferior a su anterior entrega. (Escuchad el tema de Millia de AC+R y compararlo con este, ambos muy buenos pero el primero esta a otro nivel)\n\nGameplay: Lo mas importante para este tipo de juegos, no soy un experto en juegos de pelea 2d pero el juego cumple perfectamente en contenido para personas no han jugado ni GG ni un otro juego de pelea.\nTenemos Tutorial, Challenges, Misiones, y modo training. Lo necesario para empezar a jugar decentemente. \nEn cuanto al balance, no he mirado ningun personaje OP o sobresaliente del resto. \n\nLo que mas me gusta de las mecanicas de combate es que es amigable con jugadores inexpertos, ya que si bien un experto puede ejecutar combos largos, estos son dificiles de hacer y no recompensan en da\u00f1o al oponente, pues conforme el combo aumenta los golpes reducen su da\u00f1o. Ademas del burst para romper su combo.

I am very sorry but you cannot play online, the game has some major issues when it comes to online. For starters, sometimes you cannot even connect to a lobby. You search like 5-7 times and nothing. You exit the game, enter again and suddenly it works; MAGIC IS REAL!. Another issue I had is that the game crashes in online. It crashed one time when i entered a lobby and right after this it crashed again during a fight. My last concern is the community, which is kind of small....I mean i couldn`t find any ranked match and even the normal matches were scarced. I am very sorry, I love this game, I played Guilty Gear X2 like a maniac and I still do, I was very happy when this came to PC but dispite the fact that I love the game, I cannot give it a positive review due to the online bugs, issues, etc. and I intentionally bought this game for online purposes. If you like waiting like 5-10 minutes untill you find a match and then finally enter a match and get disconnected or have a laggy play then suit yourself, I`ll stick to the old Guilty Gear or the Single Player of this one.

Attualmente, nel periodo di scrittura di questa recensione [h1] [31/12/2015] [/h1] \u00e8 in lavorazione la versione -REVELATOR- Che conterr\u00e0 molte aggiunte, tra cui come personaggi i gi\u00e0 visti negli altri Guilty Gear, ovvero Jam, Johnny e Dizzy. I personaggi vengono scelti con varie votazioni da parte dell'ArcSystem ogni anno.\n\nTolta questa breve parentesi, il gioco in s\u00e8 \u00e8 definibile come un [h1] ''Easy to play, Hard to master'' [/h1] Nel senso che i vari personaggi hanno varie combo semplici ripetibili, che di solito sono Punch, Slash e Heavy Slash, e varie Overdrive (Praticamente delle mosse speciali) eseguibili eseguendo particolari pattern di movimento, seppur queste siano diverse per ogni personaggio (Per esempio eseguire con l'analogico di movimento una mezzaluna e poi un movimento diagonale verso il basso per poi cliccare Heavy Slash) che a prima vista risultano molto complesse, ma basta allenarsi un p\u00f2 e ci si pu\u00f2 prendere la mano abbastanza in fretta. Inoltre ogni personaggio ha uno stile particolare, per esempio ci sono Millia e Chipp che scarseggiano con difesa ma hanno un danno molto elevato, o personaggi come Sin, estremamente potenti ma che richiedono di eseguire una combinazioni per ''ricaricare'' le loro abilit\u00e0. (Per esempio Sin deve mangiare per acquisire forza, in quanto moltissime sue mosse li riducono l'indicatore fame) Insomma, la curva d'apprendimento c'\u00e8, e si sente molto, richiedendo abbastanza tempo e impegno.\n\nLa storia \u00e8 molto bella, e se vorreste vederla (\u00e8 un lunghissimo filmato, praticamente) dovreste prima completare l'arcade di tutti i personaggi per capirne qualcosa nelle battute iniziali. Inoltre se questo \u00e8 il primo capitolo di GG che giocate, non preoccupatevi: Durante i dialoghi le parole chiavi saranno sottolineate in Giallo, permettendovi di mettere in pausa la scena per leggere un breve approfondimento su di questa. E' anche possibile accedere ad una cronologia di tutti gli eventi accaduti nei giochi e nella lore in generale. Evito spoiler di ogni tipo su di questa, sappiate che \u00e8 molto complessa, di classica fattura Giapponese, ai livelli di un Dark Souls, nel senso che \u00e8 ben nascosta e con vari buchi che l'utente ha libera scelta di interpretare.\n\nOltre a questo, Guilty Gear Xrd -SIGN- Ha anche una modalit\u00e0 Versus, anche locale, la modalit\u00e0 M.O.M, praticamente un RPG a livelli dentro un picchiaduro, uno shop dove comprare con valuta di gioco molti bonus, una replay mode per vedere i propri scontri locali o online, una training mode con le apposite challenge e un tutorial molto ben fatto. Inoltre nelle opzioni ci sono varie scelte per i settaggi grafici, anche se il gioco \u00e8 in se molto leggero. E' anche possibile scegliere la voce del sistema nel men\u00f9 e nei match tra tutti i personaggi del gioco, con tanto di commento a seconda di chi scegliamo.\n\nGraficamente e anche sul sonoro il gioco \u00e8 fenomenale: Il gioco \u00e8 praticamente un Anime in 3D, con un uso fantastico di cel-shading ed effetti di falso 2D, che rende il tutto davvero incredibile. Inoltre Elogio vivamente la Colonna sonora, Fantastica e con brani che restano in testa.\n\nL'unica pecca del gioco \u00e8 purtroppo il match-making e il netcode, davvero fatti male, con molti problemi anche per connettersi tra amici dello stesso paese o in lobby di altri player. Spero vivamente che nel periodo dopo la scrittura di questa recensione, il problema sia risolto del tutto.\n\nIn conclusione, GGXrd Merita tantissimo, in quanto mostra come i picchiaduro siano giocabili su PC e come questi possano rinnovarsi stando al passo coi tempi sia con il gameplay che con la grafica. \nUltima nota: Il gioco \u00e8 giocabile ottimamente sia con Controller, Fight Stick o Tastiera.

I've had in a long time. Highly recomended if you want to get into a 2D fighter. It has a great totourial to get you going, and comboes are not nearly as hard as they are in some other fighting games. Loads of single player content if you wanna take the time to do it.\n\nThe online is very good, I have not experienced many bad connections during the time I've played, so you don't have to rage at connections alot :)\n\nA minus to the game might be the non interactive story, but I found myself enjoying it alot, as it built up the world of GG for me. For the best enjoyment of it, just sit down and watch like it's a free movie you got with the game. Preferably you start with the arcade first, as it provides some backstory to why characthers are where they are!", "timestamp_created": 1451511878, "timestamp_updated": 1451511878, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544394", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20127438": {"recommendationid": "20127438", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963105770", "num_games_owned": 691, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 3041, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465961850}, "language": "english", "review": "Let me level with you. Guilty Gear is an amazing game, arcsys makes the best 2D air dashing fighting games in the world. XRD is a fresh reboot, which throws out a lot of the complexity from the older games while maintaining the classic feel of some of the most iconic characters around.\n\nThe systems are great with some draw-backs here and there, and the visual style of xrd is second to none.\n\nXRD is a game that plays fast and aggressive while looking amazing.\n\nHowever the PC port is extremely garbage. If you look around Dustloop, SRK, and the steam community you'll find lots of complains about frame rate issues.\n\nI've got an amd cpu and an nvidia gpu, my friend has the same gpu and one model worse on the amd cpu. His game runs fine, mine doesn't.\n\nNow, what happens is after a number of matches (about 10 or so) the framerate goes from a solid stable 60, down to 30 and the game becomes unplayable.\n\nAs I've mentioned, I looked into this a lot before refunding the game, this happens to all combinations of amd and intel cpus and also nvidia and amd gpus. Online, offline, it doesn't matter. For many people the game is just unplayable.\n\nXRD is a fantastic game and I've loved it since the NA release on ps3, I'm just upset that I can't play with my pc friends.\n\nFor the sake of clarity I've tried a couple of fixes that were suggested online, both on forums and the steam community. I tried various configurations with nvidia control panel, in game settings, resets, game cache validation, re-installing the game, and nothing fixed the problem. Time and time again, after a number of matches the frame rate would halve rendering the game unplayable.", "timestamp_created": 1451509206, "timestamp_updated": 1451527237, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485995", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20125848": {"recommendationid": "20125848", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052178944", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 9234, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491677575}, "language": "english", "review": "What a fascinating story mode for a fighting game.\n\nThe cel-shading tech is phenominal in this game and the port is done quite well.

Despite my inexperience with the genre, I can say that [u]Guilty Gear Xrd -SIGN-[/u] has salvaged my interest.\n\n[b]CHARACTERS:[/b]\n\nThe characters in Guilty Gear are, well, ridiculous. From a sleeping boy who wields a weaponized bed to a British time traveler, the cast covers all the bases. Each fighter has a unique playstyle and, in many cases, a more peculiar fashion sense. Whether you want to fight with swords, sickles, anchors, flowers, billiard balls, or your own hair, Guilty Gear has it all. Another nice aesthetic are the palette options (skins) for each character-- all of them look great!\n\n[b]GAMEPLAY:[/b]\n\nAlthough my arcade-fighter backlog isn't extensive by any means, I know that GGXrd plays great. The controls are simple, combos easy to pick up, and the fighting overall feels tight and responsive. Fights against NPCs seem fair with an appropriate amount of challenge. This means I can actually play Arcade and other AI game modes without the fights becoming too tedious or underwhelming.\n\n[b]SOUND/VISUAL:[/b]\n\nSomething that anyone, novice or veteran to fighting games, will notice immediately is the polish [i] all over [/i] GGXrd. While the character models are 3D rendered, they still manage to appear beautifully 2D. This effect really brings the game to life and allows for over-the-top battle intros and special attack cinematics. \n\nThe voice acting in this game is impressive, too. Having no original preference, I tried out both the English and Japanese vocals and ended up loving both. Each character's tone seems to fit so well, their voices emotive and packed with energy. \n\nXrd's soundtrack is also worth mentioning.

along with Saturday Morning Scrublords which covers the other side of the spectrum), and thought: -Well damn, that looks pretty awesome, I just might get that!\nWhile googling around I found a fascinating video from GDC (Game Developer Conference), where a developer (whose name I can't remember of the top of my head, sorry) talked about and showed the creation process behind the graphical style, which was the game's main selling point.\nThe graphical style being anime with 3D models, which as far as I know is the first time it has been done in a game like this. Note that they even reduced the frames in the animations so it would look more like \"regular anime\".\n(I also found a price tag somewhere:59.99, whoa!)\n\nWell then, as for the game itself. I'm just going to throw this out there, I have never played a Guilty Gear game before, and I've proven myself time and time again to be horrible at fighting games, so I am not really the best person to give this game a fair review.\n\nWhat can I say, the game is fun, looks awesome, it's colorful, the soundtrack is pretty good and I guess it kinda' helps building the style of the game.\nThe characters look awesome and the voice actors fit (admittedly, I have only played with the japanese voices 'cause I was recommended to do so, my inner weeaboo approves)\n\nLike I said, awful at fighting games, so the first thing I go to is the tutorial, which just covers the basics, then goes WAY deep with the Roman cancels (which I forgot about, until I got the achievment by accident).\n\nTo conclude, as a game, neat.

First, Multi pathed story mode is removed (from what I've seen so far) and for a better understanding of the story, you have to complete arcade mode with all of the characters first and then move on to the story mode. Second, Unlike the previous games (or BlazBlue series), Xrd has 2.5D visuals. Third, Because of changes in story mode system, arcade mode is changed too and you don't have to face Ramlethal (A.K.A. The boss character) for every character. I mean, with some characters (like Slayer), you never get to fight her.\nNow for the story... From what I read, the story begins after the events of Guilty Gear 2: Overture (which I never played :( ) and tells the events of.... Well, I better not spoil it here. Also, Xrd has very great surprises for you if you have played GGXXAC+R on Steam. like: [spoiler] Chipp is now a president! [/spoiler] and you can unlock several musics from AC+R for matches. (like The Midnight Carnival)\nGameplay is still the same: Fast and hard to master. And everything is still in place: Instant kills, Roman cancels, Dust move, Burst, etc...\n\nOverall, It's a very great game and this port had a way better launch on PC than Lag Kombat X. Sure, It has some problems (that I know will be fixed) but it's playable. Also, some of those problems are fixed now (like the ugly looking HUD) after the 3GB update (large size, don't you agree?).\nOkay, let's finish this. You want to have a very good fighting game? Then buy this game AND GET READY TO ROCK!\nOh, and by the way.... Thank you Arc System Works for bringing this great fighting game to PC platform.

There's also a tutorial mode which is great for newbies to anime fighters or just fighters in general, so if you're new and are considering picking this up, go for it. \n\nCouple other things to note are:\n- Graphics are amazing, really good compared to most fighters this gen.\n- Soundtrack is great.\n- Mobility is pretty big in this game, so if you're a smash player or just like to move around a lot it'll probably be more enjoyable compared to something like Street Fighter. \n- Combos are easier than most fighters, too. \n- Netcode is extremely good. I've been able to play with American players with virtually no lag at all.\n\nAll I want out of this game now is for them to release revelator asap.", "timestamp_created": 1451106618, "timestamp_updated": 1451106852, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505264", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19949688": {"recommendationid": "19949688", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012609262", "num_games_owned": 256, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2507, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482349125}, "language": "english", "review": "its 3d", "timestamp_created": 1451102442, "timestamp_updated": 1451102442, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19942864": {"recommendationid": "19942864", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083100143", "num_games_owned": 1595, "num_reviews": 233, "playtime_forever": 4223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470841768}, "language": "italian", "review": "Un vero MUST alla pari di Ultra Street Fighter 4 per chi ama i picchiaduro qua su steam, il gioco \u00e8 bello e si sa, ma se poi aggiungiamo un'ottima ottimizzazione e un buon netcode non potete davvero farne a meno.

I'm a little disappointed that some of the classic old fighters are upcoming in the next game (Jam and Johnny, also some classics like Testament and Dizzy are missing), but otherwise it's just what you'd want from a next-generation Guilty Gear.\nAwesome graphics coupled with perfect OST made by Daisuke Ishiwatari. And of course, the best gameplay mechanics of fighter games. I'd recommend this game to anyone who's searching for a new hyper-fighter game and to any fan of Guilty Gear games. It's not the best possible game for a total beginner in fighter genre, but the tutorial mode tries its best to help newer players.\nAside from the lack of classic characters, the only other major downside of Xrd Sign is that PC has a lack of players in multiplayer, at least in Europe servers.

otros. No puedo escoger el aspect ratio. Todavia no se puede modificar la resolucion en fullscreen.\n2- Ranked match estga broken, o se pega al principio de la pelea o no puedes entrar del todo.\n3- El juego trata de decidir por mi. No puedo cambiar el modo ventana si el juego cree que no tengo un monitor con X resolucion, por favor ASW, esto es PC, dejen al usuario decidir como jugar.\n4- No se puede apagar el antialias, a menos de que lo fuerzes por medio del panel de control de tu tarjeta de video. Super necesario para correrlo en computadoras por debajo de lo recomendado.\n\nLo Bueno\n1- Muy buenos graficos, funciona muy bien en mi PC de escritorio en 1920x1080 en downsampling a  1366x768.\n2- El netcode es buenisimo, jugando con gente de los Estados Unidos desde Costa Rica, gente con 1-2 de barras, 4-5F de delay los encuentros son muy buenos, me han pegado air dash combos y una millia me revent\u00f3 con unos combos larguisimos.\n3- Mas optimizado de lo que ASW esperaba, corriendo en una Lenovo G50-45, AMD A8, 6GB de ram y una R5 a 60 fps solidos en 850 x 480p, se ve del ojete pero puta es aceptable sabiendo que llevo la laptop a los torneos y que las especificaciones de mi latop estan muy por debajo de lo minimo que pide el juego. En mi arcade machine, Athlon X3, 3GB de Ram  y una GT 630(no GTX, GT normal, baratona) corre en 854x480 con todos los detalles al maximo, 60 FPS solidos, bien podria correr en 1024x768p pero como antes mencione el juego todavia no tiene esa resolucion como opcion.\n4- UE3 engine, bastante configurable, si no tienes miedo de entrarle a modificar un .ini, cosa que se resuelve teniendo siempre un backUp.\n5- Precio: $29.99 con todos los DLCs durante el primer mes, comprenlo ya.\n6- Soporte de controles: Logitech F310, perfecto. Dos sticks genericos de PS3 usando SCP driver, perfecto.

Don't forget that!\n\nAnyways, Guilty Gear Xrd... We've all been waiting for it. Now it's here. \n\n\nPros:\n\n++ The new characters are great additions\n\n+ Is visually amazing to look at\n\n+ Solid new mechanics\n\n+ A very good story (no playing in story mode, just reading and watching as if you are watching a show)\n\n++ A supurb array of tutorials and challenges\n\n+++++++ Leo Whitefang\n\n+ The new M.O.M. is interesting to play \n\n==============================\n\nCons:\n\n-- Some might experience low fps in this title (some stages I get 37-45 fps, others I get 50-55 fps)\n\n-- Strange graphical issues popping up on the screen. For me mostly happens with I-no (most of her moves), Zato (shadow gallery), or Millia (several moves as well as just moving around) while throwing out moves. Also heavily present in the Story mode for me. This also happens during Sol's intro and Zato's win cinematic (when he materializes his coat).\n\n- Lack of a local rank leaderboard for arcade, m.o.m., and local versus. Not sure why it isn't in this time around. Unless I'm just not looking in the right place. This might not be an issue of some, but to me it boggles my mind. After all, with no local leaderboard, why should I even bother caring about my score in Arcade mode?\n\n- No Testament\n\n- No Baiken\n\n- No Testament\n\n- No Testament\n\n================================\n\nI do not have an opinion for online as I've been avoiding it until I get a better ISP (My signal drops constatly). Only thing left to say is I can't wait for Revelator (Johnny!!!!). Hey Arc, you know what would be amazing? If you could give us pc gamers Revelator the same time console gamers get it?

This game is not for you. There are hardly any worth while features aside from whatever M.O.M mode is. The story is, IMHO, junk while the mode itself has a ton of eye popping cutscenes but nothing else suprising. While playing you'll earn GG money for unlockables like titles, icons and art work. In this day and age, considering art work an unlockable is just embarrasing. You have your typical arcade mode and other modes you've seen for years in fighting games. While it does have a good tutorial, nothing will prepare you on the beating you will get from the CPU and the merciless barrage of attacks and combos from other players. This fighting is extremely technical to say the least. However, if you're up to it, it can be one of the most fun fighting games to date as well as one of the most prettiest. If you're willing to get over that hump, you'll be rewarded with a very fun fighting game. One of my biggest nitpicks are the bad network/match making, questionable characters eg. \"Bedman\", and lack of new modes. Other than that, SF players looking for an alternative should definitely pick up GG XRD.

get on Steam.\nAt first, all of the gameplay's mechanics may seem intimidating but once you get a grasp of it, it's not that hard to learn (still harder than Street Fighter 4).\nDon't worry as the tutorial part of the game is very well done.\nIt's a very rewarding game if mastered (not my case) and might be the [u][b]best version[/b][/u] to get between PS3/4 and PC because of [u][b]free online

All are read by the game. There are some people that play with controllers unsopported but considering that a lot of PC games are totally fine with just 360 pad support and nothing else, I wanna say controller support for this game is actually pretty good.\n\nIf your controller is usopported for this game but works fine with your pc for other games, just get xpadder or something, map the controllers buttons to keyboard keys.\n\nNetplay\nThe connections at 1 bar are not as bad as I thought, I have no problem playing most 1 bar opponents, I can deal with a little delay, its fine for me. Sometimes it stutters, and sometimes it feels like fighting in a fishtank filled with pudding, but that's just how it is when you try to play 1 bar players, it's not suppesed to be good. 2 bar usualy has pretty negligible delay for me so I welcome 2 bar players to fight me.

Just like watching an anime.\n- COOL instant kill animation!\nCons:\n- Not so many playable characters.\n- Yup, that's all, it's really that good. ^_^\nIf you love fast paced/chaotic 2D fighting with crazy weird story and great character design plus awesome soundtrack, this is a game for you. Totally recommended.\n(9/10)", "timestamp_created": 1450279163, "timestamp_updated": 1450279163, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19730772": {"recommendationid": "19730772", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027072328", "num_games_owned": 190, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 564, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453501201}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u5bb6\u5ead\u7528\u3067\u3059\u3067\u306b\u767a\u58f2\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u30ae\u30eb\u30c6\u30a3\u30ae\u30a2\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u306e\u6b63\u7d71\u5f8c\u7d99\u4f5c\u3002\u30ae\u30eb\u30c6\u30a3\u30ae\u30a2\uff12\u304b\u30891\u5e74\u5f8c\u306e\u821e\u53f0\u3067\u65b0\u65e7\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u304c\u52e2\u63c3\u3044\u3002\n\nPS3\u30fb\uff14\u7248\u3068\u306e\u9055\u3044\u306fPS\u7248\u3067\u306fDLC\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u304c\u6709\u6599\u3082\u3057\u304f\u306f\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u5185\u30de\u30cd\u30fc\u3067\u958b\u653e\u3057\u306a\u3051\u308c\u3070\u3044\u3051\u306a\u3044\u306e\u306b\u5bfe\u3057\u3066\u3059\u3067\u306b\u958b\u653e\u6e08\u307f\uff08\u767a\u58f2\u304b\u3089\u4e00\u30f6\u6708\u9650\u5b9a\u306e\u3088\u3046\u3067\u3059\uff09\n\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u30dc\u30a4\u30b9\u3082\u6700\u521d\u304b\u3089\u5168\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u9078\u3079\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u304cPS4\u57fa\u6e96\u3067\u7d30\u90e8\u307e\u3067\u307c\u3084\u3051\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306a\u304f\u307f\u308c\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\u3055\u3089\u306b\u671f\u9593\u9650\u5b9a\u3067\u306f\u3042\u308b\u3082\u306e\u306eGUILTY GEAR VOCAL COLLECTION Soundtrack\u304c\u3064\u3044\u3066\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\n\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u5bfe\u6226\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306f\u3044\u307e\u306e\u3068\u3053\u308d\u82e5\u5e72\u4e0d\u5177\u5408\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3088\u3046\u3067\u3059\u304c\u5148\u306b\u51fa\u305f\u30ae\u30eb\u30c6\u30a3\u30ae\u30a2XX\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30f3\u30c8\u30b3\u30a2+\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u3059\u3050\u30d1\u30c3\u30c1\u3092\u5f53\u3066\u3066\u304f\u308c\u308b\u3068\u601d\u308f\u308c\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\u6765\u5e74\u767a\u58f2\u306e\u30ec\u30d9\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u304c\u3042\u308b\u306e\u3067\u3059\u3067\u306b\u5bb6\u5ead\u7528\u3092\u6301\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u5834\u5408\u306f\u5fc5\u8981\u306a\u3044\u304b\u3068\u304a\u3082\u3044\u307e\u3059\u304c\u3001\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9\u3060\u3051\u3067\u3082\u304a\u52e7\u3081\u3067\u304d\u308b\u307b\u3069\u30af\u30aa\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u304c\u9ad8\u3044\u3067\u3059\u3002\n\n\u79c1\u306f\u73fe\u5728XBOX360\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u3067\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u304c\u7279\u306b\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u306e\u66f4\u65b0\u306a\u3069\u305b\u305a\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3067\u304d\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u4e00\u90e8\u30a2\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c9\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u306b\u3046\u307e\u304f\u52d5\u4f5c\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u4e0d\u5177\u5408\u304c\u3042\u308b\u306e\u3067\u30a2\u30b1\u30b3\u30f3\u3067\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3057\u305f\u3044\u65b9\u306f\u30d1\u30c3\u30c1\u304c\u304f\u308b\u307e\u3067\u307e\u3063\u3066\u3082\u3044\u3044\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\u3002\n\n\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3092\u8e0f\u307e\u3048\u3066\u30822500\u5186\u307b\u3069\u3067\u3053\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u306e\u306f\u975e\u5e38\u306b\u304a\u8cb7\u3044\u5f97\u304b\u3068\u3002\u3067\u305f\u3070\u304b\u308a\u306a\u306e\u3067\u5e74\u672b\u30bb\u30fc\u30eb\u306e\u5bfe\u8c61\u306b\u306a\u308b\u304b\u306f\u308f\u304b\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\u304c\u30bb\u30fc\u30eb\u6642\u306a\u3089\u306a\u304a\u3055\u3089\u304a\u52e7\u3081\u3067\u3059\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1450278973, "timestamp_updated": 1450279215, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19730759": {"recommendationid": "19730759", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996158812", "num_games_owned": 203, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 803, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505481580}, "language": "english", "review": "EDITED FOR NEW PATCH!!\n\n+The HUD IS NOW HD!\n+Better Networking for versus\n+No more Disconect room BUG!!\n\nIn just this week i play 8 hours of guilty gear Xrd.\nAnd thats say a lot considering i have little time to play video game.\n\nThis is not just fighting game, Its Easy to play, but incredibly complicated to master.\nbut to became great at GG you dont need all the multi million dollar combo, you just need timing\nwell executed attack and quick judgment on any situation.\n\nIt is really recomended to just finish the training, got character play style you like? at least learn the basic combo.\nAnd thats it you set to go!\n\nThe Music..

Also tested on another computer with an Asus R7 250X 1GB which performs exactly like the HD 7770 recommended at the store page & it does run like butter on it. Also seems to perform fine on a HD 6850, but there appears to be problems still with some systems, especially laptops for some reason.\n\nTo continue, I now get a smooth 60fps across all circumstances in an extended hours of play & the fight pacing is so fast it's like a different game at all. But of course, that's the GG we all knew & love. Thank you Arksys. With this, I wholeheartedly turn the direction of my thumb for this game.\n\nWhere to start, okay. Graphics. I'm never for one to care much about it but this game is glorious. 3D which are made to imitate handdrawn drawings can usually still appear 3D, but this game is a game changer in that field. For most of the time you'll be playing this, I bet your ass your mind would think you're playing a 2D fighting game though that's not the case. It doesn't only look like one, but is animated like one too! The devs sure knows how 2D animation techniques works & implemented it flawlessly with the 3D models (suffice to say, that's a damn hard feat).\n\nNext comes the rule book. Basically, the tutorial. Older GG fans know the stuff, but even then this is the first time that there's an actual tutorial explaining what are stuffs like Roman Cancel, Gattling Combination & Dead Angle, their mechanicsm & how to pull them off & in what situation. There is also a challenge mode which is basically where you learn combos & what probable combo chains you can create with them. This also gives newcomers an opportunity to edge up to veteran GG players quicker.\n\nThe fighting in GG is also known to be very fast, as in this one & perhaps the fastest in the genre of fighting games, yet it can also get very technical & requires precise input if you're really thinking of beating people. As hardcore as it is, GG is also surprisingly easy to get into. Any beginner can pick it up & could play it pretty well after sometime. Yet it's of those kind which is hard to master. Real mean gattling combos can get very tricky to pull off but the payoff is tremendous as you could juggle or pin down your opponent given they're clueless on how to get out of your mean pushes, but of course- if your opponent knows what he's doing, he can also save himself in many different way, so no unfair edge there.\n\nCharacters are also very diversified in terms of gameplay. Characters range from melee to ranged attackers to other weird shenanigans & none plays the same. The only downside to this however it'd take a really long time if you want to master them all as GG is the kind of game where it pays to main a character of your own choosing & play using him/her almost all the time. So take your pick & train hard. And if you play with too many too much, others will surpass you in any given character.\n\nI'd rant longer. But I need to go to sleep but including this & what everyone's saying, it's a great game, simply put.

KOF was my child hood but i always wanted to be good at gg series. \nPrevious gg series was really hard to get in to by myself. There were no training mechanism that teach you cancels and etc.\nThis version XRD Does have that. Developer really put a lot of effort to make this game easy for the beginners. \nI shit you not, you can learn almost everything in training mode :O:O:O:O:U\n\n\n----------PROS----------\n-Great character design, graphic and art\n-Very well planned mechanics and unique character fighting style\n-good OPT? (thats what i heard but ... I really don't know tbh I have 1500.00 worth custom computer ;) <3)\n-Great soundtrack ( I prefer gg acent core music better but still good)\n-Great money worth\n-Great internet connection? ( i havnt got disconnected once... but i have 280 dollar router... and expensive plan...)\n-Great gameplay (people playing this series for more then 10 years)\n-Learn something everyday\n-Great soundtrack, yes I was fan of gg series not because of gamemechanics but music it self. listening to gg music for 10 years but never really played much.\n-Very well made story mode\n-Its not BB (shots fired)\n\n----------CONS(what you really want to see)-----------\n-hard to find ranking opponent\n-Not all characters from gg series are backed in this version.\n\n\n----------FUTURE---------------\n-revelator and more?\n\n\n----------Epilogue--------------\nYes, this game is amazing I highly recommend it to every fighting game nuts to at least try this game. In my humble opinion this game is more challenging then tekken, street fighter, and mortal kombat. About equal difficulty with kof. If you are not in to fighting game but you love anime and stuff try out this game as well. This game is only 33 bucks... I was willing to pay up to 100 dollar for this game hehehe sucker.

The characters and stages just look absolutely stunning and are beatifully designed and go along well with the astounding Butt-Rock soundtrack.\n\nWhile Blazblue usually goes for a story mode for each character with multiple endings, Xrd features the sort of arcade mode you have come to expect from most fighting games and an actual watch/readable story of approximately 3 hours length.\nThere also is the so called M.O.M. mode where you have charcater progression with leveling and items and fight enemies with special stat-modifiers that includes items that you can actually use in combats, such as bombs and potions.\n\nThe diverse cast consits of seventeen characters that are all unique and play completely different, and thus I never really found yourself longing for more characters as I was already helplessly overwhelmed by the sheer diversety of each character.\n\nAs a disgrace to the human race in general and the gaming community in particular, I found solace in the fact that this game features some of the most helpful tutorials I've ever seen.\nThe game teaches you everything from how to execute special moves to spacing, punishing, wake up pressure, lenghty combos (which are thought in the \"Mission\" gamemode), blocking mixups and utilizing other various defensive options. It even teaches you how to handle abusable moves of the entire cast.\nYou want it, the Xrd tutorial got it.\n\nThere isn't a lot to say about the netplay other than \"it's fantastic\", and the lobby system where up to 8 people can play at once (in 1v1s of course, pls don't paraphrase me) is quite nice.\n\nSo in conclusion, this is an amazing looking game with an amazing soundtrack. It's amazingly deep from a gameplay standpoint yet amazingly beginnerfriendly due to the amazing tutorial (and the ArcSys combo system in general). \nTo top it of, the online is also amazing.\n\nIf you have any interest in fighting games in general you owe it to yourself to own this game.\nIf you haven't, you should really aquire some interest in fighting games or else you propably won't expierence this game.\nAnd that would be a shame.", "timestamp_created": 1450142449, "timestamp_updated": 1450142744, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518072", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19703630": {"recommendationid": "19703630", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989907516", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1046, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450209625}, "language": "english", "review": "Hey!

Also a personal one, I couldn't find an option to hide the keyboard controls, so the commands in challenges will always blink changing keyboard and controller inputs making it really annoying. Technically speaking, it has few graphic options, but it runs great, also you have to tweak the config files to max out resolutions or decrease graphics and so, but overall is a really good port except from small things that I found annoying like some sprites on the menus are pixelated (I don't know if its the games fault or my resolution). I don't know if the PS4 online is better, but if so, I can only recommend this to people that don't have a PS4 or just wanna play it for the story or locally with friends.\n\nEDIT: matchmaking is still down, game needs more patches\nEDIT (22/2/2016): Recently I got the PS4 version and I can say the online is a little more active there, here on Steam has been \"officialy dead\" for weeks now (100~ players), connectivity is now patched, lobbies work fine, still haven't played ranked due to the lack of players, but you can find players on the steam group or in the reddit community, so if you don't mind struggling to find players, get this game (also the DLC is cheaper).", "timestamp_created": 1450124723, "timestamp_updated": 1456190843, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19699737": {"recommendationid": "19699737", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011552262", "num_games_owned": 426, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 7141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499468052}, "language": "english", "review": "Sorry if this hurts.\nJust buy it.", "timestamp_created": 1450123216, "timestamp_updated": 1450123216, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.418937", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19699403": {"recommendationid": "19699403", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995745856", "num_games_owned": 166, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 3523, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496251545}, "language": "english", "review": "[list]\n[*]Amazing artstyle and graphics\n[*]Fast-paced gameplay\n[*]Tons of great, deep mechanics\n[*]17 truly unique characters\n[*]Great online community\n[*]Variety of game modes\n[*]Good tutorial and challenges to help beginners\n[*]Worthy continuation of the Guilty Gear series\n[*]Deepest lore\n[/list]\n\nThese are [b]NOT[/b] reasons why I bought this game\nI bought it for [b][i]Elphelt[/i][/b] , the best girl ever and mai waifu", "timestamp_created": 1450121957, "timestamp_updated": 1450122060, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 65, "votes_funny": 45, "weighted_vote_score": "0.735966", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19699385": {"recommendationid": "19699385", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084302545", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 476, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450756443}, "language": "english", "review": "I was really looking forward to this.

It's a top of the line, triple A quality fighting game. The PC port is not perfect at the time of writing (14.12.2015), but it's of satisfying quality. \n\n*The Good:\n- Gorgeous graphics. \n- Very deep fighting system\n- Diverse characters, no two play alike\n- All DLCs are free\n- Robust selection of learning modes: in depth tutorial, challenges showcasing each character and basic concepts of fighting games, missions consisting of 30 combo challenges available for all characters\n- Solid single player content: arcade mode, story (made to look like 5 hour anime movie), M.O.M. mode (you can develop and customize your character, a serious time sink)\n- Perfect netcode (as low as 1 frame of delay between players. I've experienced 2F lag while playing someone a 1000km away from me).\n- Port is optimized to achieve stable 60 fps on my grandma's pearl necklace tied to a toaster\n\nThe Bad:\n- Most graphics options are present in the .ini file only\n- Button customization on keyboard is limited\n- Memory leak may be experienced \n- Users reported issues hampering online Ranked play (open player lobbies are still 100% functional)\n\n\nOverall this is the best fighting game available on Steam. While the port isn't perfect, developer has already promised patches for the few issues that do occur.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1450108049, "timestamp_updated": 1450108049, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19695384": {"recommendationid": "19695384", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043666802", "num_games_owned": 202, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 13747, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501271553}, "language": "english", "review": "I was only nine years old.\nI loved Guilty Gear so much, I had all the games, soundtracks and merchandising.\nI pray to Daisuke every night before bed, thanking him for the life I've been given.\n\"Daisuke is love\", I say, \"Daisuke is life\"\nMy dad hears me and calls me a weaboo.\nI knew he was just jealous of my devoation for airdash anime fighters.\nI called him a casual.\nHe slaps me and sends me to go to sleep.\nI'm crying now, and my face hurts.\nI lay in bed and it's really cold.\nA warmth is moving towards me.\nI feel something touch me.\nIt's Daisuke.\nI am so happy.\n\"He whispers in my ear \"Heaven or hell?

I'm in China and I have managed to play people in Asia with 1-4 frame delay and I'm using WIFI!!\n\nRoster is interesting. I will admit I was sad to see all of my favourite characters gone (Zappa, Jam, Johnny), but the new characters are unique, I especially love Ramlethal and Elphelt, and the returning characters are true to their previous incarnations.\n\nGraphics are amazing. This is the new standard for cell shading. The animation is slick and maintains the style from the sprite based games and the stages look good.\n\nThe game system is the \"usual\" ArcSys fare; double jumps, air dashes, Roman Cancels, instant blocking, etc. \nThe mechanics are slightly toned down compared to Accent Core, but it's still a solid system. Remember Accent Core was evolved over many itterations to get as complicated as it was and this is effectively a \"new\" chapter for Guilty Gear.\n\nProblems, there are a few. Ranked matches often don't connect, Lobbies sometimes cannot be joined. There is a memory leak. Some of the keyboard keys apparently cannot be bound (I use stick so I don't know details). Some problems with using certain resolutions (there are work arounds).

I've been looking forward to this port for awhile.\n\nPROS- \n-Stylish look. Keeps the anime artstyle that made the series true, but also uses 3D models. It's actually insane how crazy good these models look and how they apparently aren't 2d sprites. \n-Fairly similar to other Guilty gear titles. It's slightly slower in terms of speed and it's not as technical, but these mechnical charges are extremely small. \n-This is a port, and the port (for the most part) is great. \n- Netcode is FAN-FUCKING-TASTIC. It's seriously real good. I played over 40 matches today and none of them had noticable lag. Of course, I'm sure this could change with distance between players, but this is definitely one of the best PC fighting games in terms of its netcode. \n- Challenging difficulty that makes the game rewarding to learn. Not incredibly easy to pick up and definitely hard to master. \n-Pretty decent sized roster\n-The rock and metal themes in this game are iconic and amazing to fight to. Makes fights even more entertaining\n\nCons- \n-The only real issue I have with this port is a possible memory leak issue. Many people have reported issues with fps slowly dropping over time when playing the game. It seems to be related to dxinput controllers. I simply unplugged my fightstick while playing the game, and plugged it back in and got a stable 60 fps again. But this is still an unacceptable issue for a game that shouldn't be very demanding. \n-The level of entry in this game is very steep. If you never played a fighting game, this one isn't bad to start with, but you'll be losing a lot (as you would with most fighting games anyway if you're a noob). \n-The story is odd and non-traditional. It can be a bit offputting to others. \n- No real options to go past 1080p from what I've read. Could be wrong. \n- This version will be outdated soon, as GGxrd Revelator is coming out soon. I'm glad Arcsys Jp decided to finally get a company to port this game for us, but if they really want these games to do well, they need to make sure to keep them updated at a timely fashion just like with the console versions. \n- Online is not cross play with ps4/ps3. Steam users only, which will eventually twindle, since fighting games aren't big on PC. \n\nOverall, I think this is a great game. Amazing fighting game and I'm having fun learning it. I hope Revelator comes out on pc around the same time as the console versions. However, there are some port issues that hopefully get ironed out by the next patch for the game. Regardless, I still recommend this game, but please be wary of your purchase, since you might run into some issues due to shoddy porting.

Not utilizing 17% of my GPU.  Speaking of Story Mode, there are such bad sync issues that it's nearly like you hear voices and no lips movement for 5 seconds after the voices are done.  Other than that, the game is a PS3 port with AA.  What that means is expect at most DirectX9, 720p assets and cutscenes, and if you are playing on high resolution, then forget about seeing anything but pixelation like it's an old bootleg VHS of anime during those scenes.  The game could really benefit from the DirectX11 1080p cutscenes, renders, and assets to possibly make my GPU use 25%. It's a ram hog.  Says that it's utilizing 12Gb of my system memory when it's running.  Also, using my x-arcade or my quanba Q2 LED, yields the same results of controls being B to select and A to back out.  I had to change my controls before playing.  Seems the same way on my Xbox One controller as well.   Please holding out hope that they will release a high resolution texture and prerender pack or even dlc to get it to look better during the non play moments, and fix the almost 26 seconds of audio to mouthflap lag that goes on in  between fights(If you're reading Arksystem  Works or H2 Publishing or whoever did this, please give this to us.

Este jogo \u00e9 a mais nova vers\u00e3o do jogo que agora est\u00e1 em 3D mas sem comprometer seu visual que emula muito bem os cl\u00e1ssicos sprites da s\u00e9rie, este \u00e9 Guilty Gear XRD.\n\nAnteriormente houve 3 lan\u00e7amentos na Steam da s\u00e9rie: XX # Reloaded, Isuka e Accent Core + R, finalmente a vers\u00e3o posterior a AC+R est\u00e1 na Steam. Infelizmente por ter todo o trabalho de refazer os personagens do 0 houve cortes de certos personagens como Bridget, A.B.A, Order Sol, Baiken, Anji...alguns destes como Jam e Johhny retornam no update do jogo \"Revelator\" que por hora \u00e9 exclusivo para os arcades do Jap\u00e3o. \n\nConteudo:\n\nO jogo conta com 17 personagens, 5 desses novatos (por\u00e9m 3 desses precisam ser habilitados no modo galeria caso tenha comprado ap\u00f3s o lan\u00e7amento), eles s\u00e3o:\n\nBedman - Um jovem rapaz que luta preso a uma cama, ele \u00e9 um importante antagonista na hist\u00f3ria dando bastante trabalho. Seu gameplay consiste em golpes que depois de feitos deixam uma marca que usando um comando uma \"repeti\u00e7\u00e3o em sombra\" \u00e9 feita.\nRamlethal Valentine - A \"chefona\" da vers\u00e3o arcade do jogo, ela que d\u00e1 o ponta p\u00e9 inicial no enredo de XRD declarando guerra ao mundo todo. O gameplay dela \u00e9 com o uso de duas espadas gigantes que podem ou servir de ataques normais melhorados ou postos perto da ultima localiza\u00e7\u00e3o do oponente, precisando um uso inteligente deles para mix-ups e combos.\nSin Kiske - O filho \"proibido\" entre Dizzy e Ky, aparecendo primeiro em Guilty Gear 2: Overture (jogo estilo RTS exclusivo para Xbox 360). Finalmente sendo um lutador jog\u00e1vel ele conta com uma mec\u00e2nica de fome que estando de barriga cheia permite varia\u00e7\u00f5es em seus golpes al\u00e9m de cancelamentos, por\u00e9m ficando com fome...\nElphelt Valentine - Linda donzela que proclama ser a irm\u00e3 de Ramlethal. Seu gameplay consiste em mec\u00e2nicas inspiradas em FPS como atirar granadas ou um golpe aonde ela mira no oponente e voc\u00ea controla um alvo.\nLeo Whitefang - Um dos reis do \"Reinos Aliados de Illyria\", tem um passado com Ky Kiske e um grande orgulho. Seu plano de jogo consite em duas stances com golpes e overdrives variados, ambas focadas em \"rushdown\".\n\nO jogo cont\u00e9m v\u00e1rios modos: Story, Arcade, M.O.M, Tutorial, Training, Mission, Online e Gallery.\n\nStory mode ao contr\u00e1rio de Accent Core + R e XX # Reloaded \u00e9 praticamente hist\u00f3ria pura do inicio ao fim. Voc\u00ea vai assistindo o resto da hist\u00f3ria ap\u00f3s os acontecimentos no \"Arcade Mode\" de Guilty Gear XRD come\u00e7ando com a captura de uma certa personagem e a apresenta\u00e7\u00e3o de novas caras.\n\nFinalmente Guilty Gear tem um modo que explica como joga-lo, \"Tutorial Mode\" explica de uma forma divertida (apesar de tradicional) com Sin \"ensinando\" Sol Badguy o b\u00e1sico do jogo, surprende que at\u00e9 mesmo o jogo ensina uma forma de \"Option Select\" (um \"exploit\" em fighting games que atrav\u00e9s de um comando voc\u00ea acaba ficando numa situa\u00e7\u00e3o melhor). Poderiam ter feito de uma forma mais \"org\u00e2nica\" mas mostra que ASW est\u00e1 come\u00e7ando a se preocupar com novos f\u00e3s da franquia. \n\nO modo \"M.O.M\" retorna mas com diferen\u00e7as, \u00e9 poss\u00edvel equipar diferentes equipamentos al\u00e9m de ataques que podem ser usados pelo bot\u00e3o Respect, voc\u00ea tamb\u00e9m pode escolher seu proximo oponente atrav\u00e9s de um mapa.\n\nMission \u00e9 quase como os dos jogos anteriores, por\u00e9m \u00e9 preciso repetir 6 vezes, dependendo de quantas vezes conseguir seguir a miss\u00e3o \u00e9 dado um Rank. Felizmente n\u00e3o sei algum conteudo relevante que esteja \"bloqueado\" neste modo ao contr\u00e1rio dos jogos anteriores...\n\nModo online felizmente \u00e9 muito superior ao antigo Accent Core + R. Primeiro que FINALMENTE em um Guilty Gear h\u00e1 salas que suportam de 2 a 8 jogadores com um sistema melhorado comparado ao de Skullgirls: Dentro da sala h\u00e1 quatro \"maquinas\" cada uma com 2 \"cadeiras\" e espa\u00e7os de espera, simplesmente 2 jogadores \"sentam\" nelas e come\u00e7am a partida, outros jogadores podem ficar nos espa\u00e7os de espera e escolher entre ter sua vez ou simplesmente ficarem assistindo as partidas naquela \"maquina\".\n\nOutra coisa legal do modo online \u00e9 que pessoas assistindo podem escrever coment\u00e1rios que passam \"voando\" em cima da luta (que felizmente n\u00e3o aparece para quem esteja jogando, s\u00f3 para os outros que estejam assistindo tamb\u00e9m), felizmente \u00e9 possivel desligar ou mudar a velocidade e tamanho da fonte para quem esteja insatisfeito com algo. Por\u00e9m houve a perda de um outro tipo de online em que havia \"icones\", uma forma mais \"gr\u00e1fica\" do modo online mas que gerava confus\u00e3o nas vers\u00f5es consoles e basicamente era redundante.\n\nO netcode \u00e9 bom nas partidas que testei, o delay \u00e9 mudado de partida em partida e h\u00e1 notifica\u00e7\u00f5es de pessoas saindo ou entrando na sala, olhando as partidas, etc.\n\nSobre conteudos extra na vers\u00e3o Steam simplesmente s\u00e3o os personagens DLC serem incorporados no jogo como conteudos desbloque\u00e1veis, cores e sistemas de voz fora do lan\u00e7amento precisam serem comprados separadamente mas cada um por um pacote de 2 dolares, um pre\u00e7o bem mais acessivel que nos consoles.\n\nControle:\n\nFinalmente h\u00e1 um suporte decente para controles direct input, start \u00e9 no start, select \u00e9 no select, etc...por\u00e9m alguns bot\u00f5es s\u00e3o trocados mas nada que reconfigurar n\u00e3o d\u00ea errado, n\u00e3o \u00e9 preciso o uso de xboxce.\n\nA configura\u00e7\u00e3o de teclado \u00e9 competente...exceto pelo rebind das dire\u00e7\u00f5es que \u00e9 travado para setas no player 2 e \"wasd\" para o player 1, os desenvolvedores j\u00e1 viram o problema e prometem resolver isso em um proximo patch, atualizarei o review quando ocorrer.\n\nControles X-Input funcionam normalmente como sempre foram.\n\nPalavras Finais:\n\nVale a pena?

Problems however arise as the netcode is a bit shoddy at the time of this review (It's like a chore to find a functioning match to play, Player matches also have some issues) but other than that the game is fine. For those who have toasters, your in luck as this runs reletively well on said PCs. You can find more information about that in the Steam discussion forums somewhere. \nThis game was even one of the many reasons I bought a PS4 (and damn was it worth the purchase) but now you can skip the buying a PS4 part and instead grab it on your trusty computer.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is worth your money especially if you love fighting games. Even if the newest version REVELATOR comes almost 3 months or so from now, it won't be a big problem as balance changes from SIGN to that are minimal. Go ahead and pick it up. DLC is also free for this month so consider that. \n \nIf you ever need someone to fight in Xrd, I'm all for the challenge.

For this reason, I must say that the learning curve is pretty darn steep. This game is NOT for players with short attention spans (e.g. immature CoD/CSGO players, casual players in general). The controls will feel wonky and unintuitive if you're also coming from Smash Bros. because the mindset you have to adopt is COMPLETELY different. It still feels that way, but given the gameplay videos I've seen on YouTube, I really think that the effort will pay off in the end.\n\nOptimization/Graphics:\n\nThe game runs at a locked 60fps (because button timings need to be very precise with only a few frames). It seems to run well for most people, but for those on lower-end systems (like me with Intel HD graphics), you're going to need some tweaking in the files because the graphics settings in-game are more of a hindrance than they are helpful. Once the tweaking is done, the game should run very smoothly. In my opinion, the tweaks don't take too much away from the overall look because of the brilliant art style and cel-shaded graphics.\n\nMusic:\n\nIt's good and makes sense for this game, but as a rather completely new player, I don't want to hear the same song over and over again when I'm struggling my way through the 50-step tutorial. Allowing custom music would be nice (I imagine it wouldn't be too hard to implement). In any case, I would probably just mute the in-game music entirely and hand-pick power metal songs on YouTube.\n\nStory:\n\nDon't know much, but there is character development in the tutorial (and the Steam Trading cards give backstory!), which is good. I will get to it when I'm fully comfortable with the controls.\n\n----\nOVERALL:\n\nThe difficulty of this game is daunting, but the art style and amount of thought put into this game convince me to keep trying.\n\n??/10 indecisive.", "timestamp_created": 1449948210, "timestamp_updated": 1449948210, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19658519": {"recommendationid": "19658519", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013927840", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1126, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452745109}, "language": "english", "review": "Overall, amazing game.\nExtremely deep and quite well balanced fighting game.

Le style graphique en Cell Shading reproduit magnifiquement l'effet Manga des \u00e9pisodes 2D pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents, et on a l'impression de jouer \u00e0 un dessin anim\u00e9. De plus, m\u00eame sur une vieille config, le jeu tourne \u00e0 merveille. \n- La bande son est purement g\u00e9niale, pour peu qu'on aime tout ce qui est \u00e0 base de guitare \u00e9lectrique. Les voix sont dispo en anglais et en japonais, ce qui est toujours un plus. \n- La maniabilit\u00e9 en elle m\u00eame est au poil - si on fait abstration des probl\u00e8mes de config (voir les points n\u00e9gatifs)\n- La dur\u00e9e de vie est sympa : Outre les modes sc\u00e9nario/arcade, et versus en local, le jeu propose aussi un mode en ligne avec un syst\u00e8me de ranking.  Et les modes MOM et mission ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fusionn\u00e9s, donnant un mode de plus de 150 challenges ou l'on doit gagner des combats sous divers conditions, malus et bonus. \n\nPour les points n\u00e9gatifs: \n- Le portage est pas exceptionel niveau interface, et la configuration s'en ressent terriblement. Jouer au clavier est un v\u00e9ritable calvaire, l'interface du jeu restant en ZQSD m\u00eame apr\u00e8s reconfiguration des touches, obligeant \u00e0 naviguer dans les menus \u00e0 l'aide des boutons w, z et u... C'est assez crispant. Heureusement, les manettes fonctionnent bien (m\u00eame si apparement, certains touches playstations sont invers\u00e9es, si j'ai bien compris).\n- Seulement 17 personnages si je compte bien, \u00e7a ne fait pas \u00e9norme face \u00e0 la concurrence (\u00e0 cot\u00e9 d'un Tekken TT2 et ses 59 personnages, \u00e7a fait p\u00e2le figure). La qualit\u00e9 vaut mieux que la quantit\u00e9 bien sur, et fut un temps ou les 12 personnages d'un Street Fighter II turbo nous suffisaient, mais \u00e7a fait bizarre quand m\u00eame de voir autant de personnages de GGXX absents... \n- Quelques probl\u00e8mes d'instabillit\u00e9s sur les combats en ligne apparement, m\u00eame si je n''en ait pas vraiment eu pour ma part pour l'instant. \n- GGXrd Revelator est en route avec 4 nouveaux persos, reste \u00e0 savoir comment s'il arrivera sur Steam, et comment (Nouvelle version? DLC? )\n\nBref, pas que du bon, mais sans aucun doute mon coup de coeur baston pour un bon moment!", "timestamp_created": 1449946124, "timestamp_updated": 1449946124, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0,

the game that was simple enough to get me in and enjoy it from the start, but at the same time deep enough so I can put some effort in a particular character and not having to switch to another one in case of bad matchups.\nThis game totally delivers that and much more.\nThe presentation is mind-blowing, over the top animations, great music that fits perfectly with the action, plenty of content such as arcade mode, versus mode (online or local) with replays so you can learn from it, story mode for those who want to learn more about the characters' background which is basically a long anime (with no gameplay), M.O.M. mode that adds an RPG feel to the game with progression per character (I heard you'll need 20+ hours to finish one) with customization with new skills that work with a cooldown system, tons of unlockables through in-game money you earn by just playing the game.\nSo, if you're looking for a very solid, complete fighting game, though very demanding if you're into competitve online (which, by the way, I heard has a great netcode that feels almost like local multiplayer),  still totally enjoyable for single player or local multiplayer with friends on the couch, I'd say run for it, by far the best fighting game I've seen on PC.\nGreat job and thank you Arc System Works for this amazing port.", "timestamp_created": 1449946059, "timestamp_updated": 1449946059,

Character balance is decent, no big complaints here either. However, there are not many characters even though we have three newcomers.\n\nStory is engaging but lacks the proper gameplay, so you could say it's more of a Visual Novel, not everybody's gonna be happy with that.\n\nI kinda didn't like that they didn't include usual Survival Mode and instead merged it with revamped M.O.M. mode, but I guess I can give it a pass.\n\nWhen I tryed the netplay I didn't get any delay, but there were so disconnections, I hope they will fix that.\n\nOverall, the game desieves 9/10, because while some graphics scaling and network issues are present, the gameplay proves to be just as much as it was in previous games.\n\nP.S.

This game is pretty crazy. And by \"crazy\", I mean really good. I've only touched the training mode so far, but from what I've played, I am very impressed.\nTo elaborate on why it's so good, let's take a look:\n-Character diversity is rich\n-Simple yet deep gameplay\n-The new characters fit in seamlessly with the veterans\n-Speaking of which, the veterans are still great, as always (Millia loks great, Potemkin looks much better, Sol is still a badass)\n-Quite a few colors (not as much as Skullgirls, but still a lot)\n-Lots of things to do in single-player alone\n-Online seems alright, from what I've heard (the frame delay display is a genius idea)\n-Faust. Just Faust.\nHowever, there are a few problems (not that the game's bad):\n-Roster size is a little small compared to other fighters (Revelator will fix that a bit)\n-English voices are waaaay inferior to the Japanese voicetrack (a bit petty, I know)\n-I'm waaay too scared to even touch online (a more personal, \"scrubby\" issue)\nStill, I'd recommend it, especially if you want to scratch that fighting game itch with something different than Stret Fighter. Oh, and one more thing: YOU CANNOT CONVINCE ME THAT THIS GAME USES MODELS. THEY LOOK SO MUCH LIKE SPRITES.

Guilty Gear Xrd mechanics are probably \"weaker\" than Guilty Gear XX^core+R but still on a top tier level, they gave more freedom on Roman Cancels use and found a good way to make them netplay-viable, most old mechanics like Faultless Defence, Gatling Combos and Instant Kills are still there just like they were on previous titles and overall they feel extremely solid.\n\nGame artwork/graphic is amazing. You play full-fledged 3D models and you almost can't tell they actually are 3D models instead of hand-drawn sprites until the camera pans/zooms for special events... amazing.\nAs always character design is flawless, animations are good (anime-styled deformations and such included) and generally speaking, the tech/workflow behind such an amazing result is most likely going to be used as example in the future by developers.\n\nMusic is good, yep. Ishiwatari Daisuke strikes again.\n\nNow, about game modes. You think you're buying a fighting game, but you actually buy a fighting game, an in-game graphic animated visual novel/anime and a nice fighting RPG (M.O.M. mode), not to mention the Bonus Soundtrack (which is not Guilty Gear Xrd Soundtrack, it's a Bonus Sountrack for real).\n\nFinally, netcode. I can't say the netcode has no issues, but I was able to play smooth matches with friends I know I ping good against. For fighting games netcodes are almost always \"the hard test\", mostly because it's the one thing you can't beta test enough and that tends to change a lot moving from different consoles or PC.\nSo, well, it's not that bad, not that good either, definitely playable on a good level if both players have a good ping.\n\nRecommended?

As far as I can tell, the game runs flawlessly: No tearing, Good response (at least locally), even when V-sync is turned on. Graphics are eye candy for what I'm used to a GG game having, new mechanics are great (albeit a bit cruel at times to execute :/, but I expected as much...). I also love how much more useful roman cancels are, adding even more depth to the already expansive combat of the series. Honestly, the best part is, the game has yet to crash once on me (though Arc has a good rep when porting over their fighting games from console to PC compared to other publishers)...\n\nThe only gripes I have with the game is the fullscreen resolution is currently one level lower than my monitor's ratio, so it has black bars at the edges of the screen which really bug me, and I am unable to fix atm (though from what I read, this issue is being addressed...), and that the Final Arcade boss, although challenging, is the weakest Guilty Gear Arcade Final Boss I have faced by far, examples from the previous games I played on normal:\n-Guilty Gear X Dizzy made me continue like 30 times before I beat her.\n-Guilty Gear X2 I-No was a bloody nightmare, which took me a whopping 50 tries before I got her strategy down, I can still only 1CC her with specific chars.\n-Guilty Gear Xrd Ramlethal Valentine... Continued only once... Tad dissapointing but, still a fun boss...\n\nOverall I HIGHLY recommend you buy this game, especially now while all the DLC is free for the 1st month...\n\n-9001/10, would buy again (and I probably will with Revelator around the corner, lol...)\n\n*EDIT*  12/13/2015\nSo after playing arcade with a few more chars, I discovered that apparently, the final Arcade Mode boss changes based on who you are using. Needless to say, this seems to make the final boss fights (least in arcade) even weaker than in previous installations due to them feeing far easier (since I already know what to expect, and that's honestly the only reason Ramlethal managed to beat me the first time around...). So if you want a challenge in arcade mode, then crank up the difficulty and use a char you suck with, cause that will at least make the arcade mode enjoyable...\n\nOne more thing, unlike in other Arc system fighting games in the past (at least when GG and BB are concerned), the story mode in this game is more of a Visual Novel than anything else, you literally will not fight in it's entirety, but rather be a spectator... so if you are going in expecting anything more, you will be dissapointed. Sadly, this game also has the 2nd smallest roster (including unlockable characters, only making it fall behind Guilty Gear PSX by 1), and while the amount of content included is short and sweet, and the online component may give it a few more bits of longevity, just know that compared to the last installment released, Guilty Gear XX Accent Core + R (which is also available in steam) you are getting far FAR less for your money. Just be wary of that before you do decide to buy into it (in all honesty, due to this game being pretty much a ground up project with a new engine, I can somewhat forgive the lack of characters and content compared to older titles. This, along with the sequel being released very soon may also explain why they reduced the game's price on launch...)", "timestamp_created": 1449849996, "timestamp_updated": 1482552817, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.449309", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19633106": {"recommendationid": "19633106", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982011454", "num_games_owned": 447, "num_reviews": 104, "playtime_forever": 1118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486566642}, "language": "english", "review": "Last night I was sitting on Mumble with mah bois, when a friend brought up Xrd's graphical style. I went \"yeah, it's great, it looks like sprites but it's 3D- it's on Unreal Engine, you know...too bad it's only on PS4 or whatever\". Imagine my surprise when he corrected me and told me that not only is it coming to Steam, but it's [i]already on there[/i]. I didn't believe him at first and hectically checked the store page...there it was, just casually sitting in the new releases category as if it wasn't [b]a big fucking deal[/b] to have an ArcSys game released on Steam, and especially before it has drifted off into complete obscurity. As a European in particular, this is as if Christmas had come not mere 3 weeks, but 3 years early.\n\nSo far I've played through and enjoyed the first ~25 challenges of all characters and played the advanced tutorial, which is pretty great and I'd say comparable to the advanced (and widely praised) tutorials in Skullgirls. They really teach you how to get around stuff that newbies often have trouble with, like zoning, ground to air anti-airing with normals, and so on- probably my favourite feature of the game. There is a mode called M.O.M. that seems very similar, if not identical, to Abyss mode in BlazBlue games; I'm not sure how close they are, I don't bother with that stuff, but it's there.\n\nThe game has some teething issues, like titles all still being in Japanese and the HUD resolution only scaling to 720p (which is getting fixed), but it runs quite smoothly (alt-tabbing is super fast, as well, which is a real blessing), it obviously looks great, and from what little I remember of the older Guilty Gears, it's pretty close to its heritage with some innovation. My Hori Fighting Edge (PS3) was recognised immediately and with no further work required (take note SFV). My favourite \"meta\"-improvements over other recent ArcSys titles are the ability to automatically save all replays and being able to unlock BGMs from older GG games in the gallery. If I had to pick one thing I really disliked, it would be the Story-mode. In BlazBlue at least there were some battles in between the (usually humorous) story, but in this it's just animu, not a fan.\n\nI haven't played online yet but if the netcode is as good as everyone says, DENOUTTADEN.", "timestamp_created": 1449849814, "timestamp_updated": 1449955853, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549443", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19633066": {"recommendationid": "19633066", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998671290", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 17317, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485025287}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is awesome, every character is a piece of art itself, the engine is the best to my liking, easy to take up and hard to master, online works great . 10/10 no doubt", "timestamp_created": 1449849664, "timestamp_updated": 1456345765, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483215", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19632902": {"recommendationid": "19632902", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084366747", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1686, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480447856}, "language": "english", "review": "Love it!", "timestamp_created": 1449849140, "timestamp_updated": 1449849140, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483215", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19632809": {"recommendationid": "19632809", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019154487", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 768, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483176834}, "language": "english", "review": "The game has arcade mode.

It did not look or feel as good. I never thought it would come to PC, at least this soon of course. I'm glad it came out sooner than expected. It has slightly more content as well. Very happy to be playing it on my powerful rig. \nI just don't play on consoles anymore. I rather be on PC. Hopefully they release things on PC day 1.\n\nAnyhow what people want to know: As usual GG always has solid fighting mechanics. The controls are sleek and responsive. You never feel totally cheated or walled in like other fighting games. Beautifully animated and use of cell shade, and engine. Most of all story mode... Its true men can cry. Perfect music score characters. The voicing is very good as well, not great but does the job. All I cared about was Sol's voice since he is my fav character. \nI wish they would have added more characters. Oh and another thing I love about this game. You know how some games you do double quit not here they were actually smart enough to use one when you go to title screen and press select to go back to desktop. Finally a game genious enough to do this.   \n\nI advise any hardcore fighter play this game.", "timestamp_created": 1449818097, "timestamp_updated": 1449818097, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1,

It is just THAT good game. And what a delight to see, that the port is very well done (look WB, this is how you do it!) Honestly, well worth the wait, when the porting job is done properly. Can't really say much more than this: GET IT! Let's build a huge GG Xrd community on Steam, like... NOW! :)\n\nThe game is gorgeous, like seriously so damn pretty. But it does not end there: it also plays damn well. The characters offer great variance and there is a huge amount of depth. It is also one of my favourite fighting games to just watch someone else playing. Somehow Arc has just nailed down that part also.\n\nOnly real critique is the way the game handles online VS. But that's a bit of a subjective matter I guess.\n\nPS. next if they'd port P4 Arena Ultimax and Blazblue: CPE (oh, edit: IT IS COMING!!!) for the PC, my mind would be blown into million pieces. ;) But man, this is HUGE!

Xrd -Sign sports a roster of 17 character, 12 which are returning veterans. The 5 new characters are all somewhat more gimicky than the veterans but are a nice addition and fit in well regardless.\n\nGame modes include standard affairs like arcade, versus, and training modes, as well as a challenge mode that has specific trials for each character that help you learn them ala Street Fighter 4 or Blazblue. It contains a story mode, which is about a 5 hour long anime more than anything else, as you don't fight in it. MOM mode also makes a comeback but has been heavily revamped. Instead of being a straight survival mode where you collect medals and healing items, its more of a conquest type thing  where taking on one hexagonal challenge opens up more and it keeps branching out as you colelct medals to buy items and upgrades for your character. Mission Mode also makes a comeback, but instead of just being a fight with certain conditions attached to it like \"Only the 5th hit in a combo and above deal damage\" it just puts you in a situation and asks a task of you that you have to succeed at more times than you fail.\n\nOf course there is the online aspect of the game. I haven't been able to get into any ranked matches unfortunately but player matches have worked wonderfully. The lobbies try to replice an arcade environment, having up to 4 boths where players can fight and spectate at. Ther weird thing i syou have to pick your character before you confirm the fight with the other person, which is weird, but not too bad. Ive only noticed a bit of latency and lag when a lot of people are coming and going from the lobby at once, otherwise its been a very steady experience, especially with friends.\n\n\n\nThe Port:\n\nGame runs absolutely great and looks gorgeous. Haven't had much trouble online with the randoms I played, a little bit of latency here and there as people came and left the lobby but nothing bad. When playing with a few friends in a single lobby, it was perfectly fine with no hiccups.\n\nPoints taken off I guess for some of the UI being a lowres, not that I reall care about that. Also some people report the FPS taking a nosedive after a long session due to memory leaks, most notably on AMD products. I myself use a 6850 and fx-6130 and have had no issues regarding that. I played about 3 hours straight online with friends while recording the game at 60fps and still had no issues. And the final thing to note is that trying to configure the keyboard controls are a pain in the butt. I use a stick but my friend uses keyboard and he has trouble configuring the arrow keys for movement instead of wasd.\n\nThere is an ongoing argument about whether this is a  PS3 port or a PS4 port, but I honestly don't think it matters. it has all the same content and really only a few UI elements are noticeably different upon being pointen out, though ASW and Shini on twitter did say patches are to come. Otherwise the game itself, characters, stages, effects, etc, look completley on par with PS4 and in some situations better in comparison screenshots, and thats before any sort of downsampling or any sort of texture filtering through Gedosato.\n\nConsidering how well optimized it is and having all the content of the PS3 and PS4 version, save one superfluous overworld lobby system everyone hates, I think it definitely gets a solid 8, even in the face of the previously mentioned issues. Its an above average port and way better than I had anticipated from ASW.\n\n\n\nOverall:\n\nThe game itself is amazing and marked the return of Guilty Gear as a major player in the Fighting Game Community and the port itself is very solid.

Good input buffering for combos. No touch of death bullshit like MvC. Combos aren't boringly long like in Skullgirls/MvC. Less awful input correction than SF4.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nBug: game client starts getting frame lag and sound stuttering after about half an hour of multiplayer. Doesn't affect everyone, though. May want to wait for this to get fixed.\nUI Oversight: Using 720p assets for the in-game menus, instead of 1080.

"english", "review": "Note : This review is post the 3.2 GB patch for the game \n\nFirst lets talk about the graphics in this game, they are 3D with an anime style similar to the popular series Abunai sisters, but the design in Guilty Gear Xrd puts their own twist on this by making it not a pile of shit to look at, I love the look of this game and I can't help but when a KO in this game happens but put a screen shot of the lovely camera angles that show. \n\nI heard that the only reason that they changed the graphics to 3d was to have a alway availible goto model now to save on the budget on sprite development and never have to worry about them showing age for a long time, but if them making great looking anime styled models with lovely backgrounds is them trying to save the budget I want to see what they can do when they're spending it all. \n\nMakes me wish there was a mod to move the camera in battle behind you, I wouldn't even care how much harder it would make the game I just want to see it and take more screen shots of this gorgeous game. \n\nIn my opionion the game is really fun, cast is very varied in what every character is capible of and what they use to get the job done and it can also be said that fighting no 2 players is the same since everyone seems to find something else great about the character to use, just when you think you've got that characters play style down. \n\nFrom the Roman canceling, rejects, faultless blocking and even more it seems like there is way to much content to get used to at the start but online there are always beginner servers to get a hand in with playing others who are not yet themselves that good at the game.\n\nFor a first fighter this could seem a bit like too much but it's really not a bad choise because it means if you're into learning a game inside and out it would be a like being a kid in a candy shop\n\nNow to get to some of the negitives of this game.\n\nThe story mode really is just talking the whole time with not a ounce of game play in it and the animation for such lovely 3d modles doesn't due much justice, it's like seeing static VN portraits in 3D and this really shows as an issue when you see fights in story mode look like they're played through micro soft power point.\n\nNext is the online in this game, it's functional if that is a thing to call it but you'll constantly be kicked from rooms that claim good connection and then somehow get into that 0 connection room you clicked by mistake, also the online matches after the patch in this game have lead to a few times the game just crashes.\n\nThe patch claims to have fixed the ranked mode in this game but it turned into the same click their name until the game gives up and lets you play that it was before, combined that with the crashing now online and I don't even want to play ranked from fear of being called a rage quitter. \n\nThen we get to the main issue that I've have had with the game and how well it runs, going by having task manager in the side while running the game to check on it I seen that the specs post patch from pre patch are a good 150% higher and it didn't fix the issue where as the game is running the specs of the game slowly but constantly go up leading to eventual lag on the menu of all things, but here just opening and closing the game seems to reset it.\n\nthis is something I really want arksys to get into fixing because the game seems like otherwise it would be able to run really well on much weaker machines.  \n\nIt may look like I dragged way much longer on the negitives then the possitives here but when you get past the problems that come mainly in the online and the story mode of the game what you will find is a great fighting game that if you are a fan of the genre you will not want to miss by miles.\n\nOver all the possitives of having a great and closer to the current version of the game come out on PC overlap the negitives but in the future I hope they at least figure how tofix the current online.", "timestamp_created": 1449774043, "timestamp_updated": 1458888026, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count":

It got the basics, 4 different kind of attacks, a Dust attack where you basically swing people up into the air for aerial combos. \n\nSure you can go deeper into the mechanics and do some crazy combos into a instant kill move, but those require a lot of time and practice.\n\nI started playing this game with some friends when it was released for PS4 and i was in love instantly and i was sitting at my computer, looking at steam and wondering why it wasn't released here since X2 and Accent Core is released here, but finally it's here and it's better then ever.\n\nTake everything that have been released for the console version like DLC characters and colors.... And you have that here. \n\nMy god i can't even begin to talk about why this game is so amazing.\n\nThis far i can list up a couple of things.\n\n-Easy to get into\n-You can find easy BnB combos quite easily\n-The Port is freaking amazing, it runs at a steadily 60 fps without any problems.\n-Lesser graphics means that basically a stone can run this game WHICH IS GOOD\n-Since it's on PC it's easy to just plug in your favourite controller and beat people up.\n-Really good rooster, altough i'm a bit sad that older characters like Baiken and Bridget isn't in this one.\n-Really good netcode, played a couple of games against different people and it runs amazingly good. \n\nWhy are you still reading this?

The lack of in-depth options is dissapointing, and the game has quite a few minor issues that hurt this port. That being said, this port has fantastic netcode! I had 2F delay to somebody in Seattle! That's insane if you consider the before this I've only ever had 2F to a person living near me. For that reason alone, this PC port is a big step up for Arc System Works. It's not rollback, but it's pretty damn good. I recommend this game to anybody interested in fighting games (so long as you don't gush over Elphelt :^) )\n\nI'll now list the issues I've discovered.\n\n[list]\n    [*]You can not change your resolution in full screen mode. Full screen is a seperate resolution option.\n    [*]The games UI is from the PS3 port. The in game graphics are not, and neither is the hud. Unfortunately, this makes the menus look awful when upscaled to 1080p. They don't look very good at 720p either.\n    [*]Anti-aliasing seems to have no effect. I can clearly see jaggy lines no matter which option I set my AA to.\n    [*]There are no (obviously) usable configs within the games files. I can not change the settings to optimize it's performance on my system. (This is somewhat alleviated now thanks to a community guide showing me how to downsample from 4K resolution. Game looks pretty great and runs well.)\n    [*]The game seems to be having memory issues for me. If I play the game for quite a while, the framerate will slow down between 30-50 and run extremely poorly. \n    [*]The music may be of slightly lower quality than the music in the PS4 version. As well as this, the character attack sounds are kind of bad. Especially on Axl, I hear awful audio crackle. It's very obnoxious.\n    [*]Player matches are very buggy at the moment, if a lot is going in in public lobbies there seem to be many issues causing players to vanish, be fighting no opponent, or just get kicked out of the lobby. It's a little tricky to play online right now. Ranked matches aren't fairing too well either, I can't play ranked right now due to a bug.

The strong universal defensive system mechanics along with the way the tension/super meter works creates an exhilerating, fast paced game with a strong focus on offense and momentum. \n\nThe PC port runs perfectly fine, with some anti aliasing and the \"standard\" resolution options including widescreen. The options menu is kinda sparse, but because it's an unreal game you can do a lot of ini editting to really lower the graphics if needed.\n\nThe netplay is delay based, and having the PS3 version of the game, the PC version is as good if not slightly better. (This might be because 99% of PCs are on wired internet, as opposed to PS3s) Ranked Mode suffers more lag then the player match rooms. Although unfortunate they didn't fix it, this was an issue on the consoles as well.\n\nWhile I don't have the most controller options, it instantly detected my Qanba Q4 and my xbox one controller, as well as having more then enough keyboard support. If you don't plug it in before you start the game, there might be trouble though.\n\nThe worst thing I can say about GG is that it has a steep learning curve, even by fighting game standards. However, with the tutorial, challenge, and mission modes, it makes jumping in blind not as daunting, the only fighting game that does the tutorialization better would be Skullgirls, and even then this is very close if not equal. That being said, this game is good enough that I urge you to look at some gameplay of it, and try to dive right in.\n\nAlso, for the first month all of the DLC is free, including the colors that were exclusive to PS+ on console. Even after the first month; as opposed to the console version where just Sin was avaliable with your ingame fight money, all 3 of the DLC characters are obtainable with it. (Sin, Elphelt, and Leo)\n\nTheres a reason why this game is only half-jokingly referred to as God's Gift.\n\nPraise be.\n\nP.S.

Game looks fantastic and plays great online.\n\nOne thing that I'm amazed at is how awesome the training mode is for this game. They really teach you the VERY basics of how to go about playing this game. It's something that will ease beginning players in without having them feel overwhelmed by everything right from the get go. From there you've got a mode that teaches you combos and another mode that puts you in typical situations that you'll find yourself in from time to time while playing against opponents. Along with the is a very fleshed out freestyle training mode that they been offering us since 1998.\n\nOnline play seems pretty smooth right off the bat, although there are some who seem to be having issues with lobbies at the moment. Aside from that, playing in game is smooth. If there was lag then I'm oblivious to it. The few matches that I had so far felt great... Aside from me getting stomped into oblivion. \n\nWhile some people will scoff at the number of characters in this game, I see nothing wrong with it as you can see ASW seems to have gone with quality before quantity. Every character has been animated in a way to replicate the animation frames from the older games. It's a joy just to sit back and just watch the characters, attacks, specials, instant kills, and intros/outros. \n\nI haven't had the chance to try out Story, Arcade, or any other of the modes so far due to trying to learn Ramlethal at the moment, But as soon as I do, I'll make sure to update this review.

This is a huge disappointment and in a sense, truly mindless. I don't know what the publishers have learned from all the complaints they received when Acana Heart 3 was just released on steam. THIS HAS TO BE FIXED. Also, I do not know whether it is a bug or not, but when I re-bind the keys, I cannot use the same keys for in-game and menu. For instance, when I bind the direction keys to 'I, J, K, L', I can move my character in the game, but have to use 'WASD' again in the menu. The menu screen simply forces me to used the keys that have been binded by the game.\n\nMenu UI and Character select screen shows that it is not native 1080p. Although this is not something that directly influences the gameplay, it still is a disappointment nonetheless. But this can be overlooked because it is relatively small matter compared to key-binding/functioning problem.\n\nAs much as I love this series, I'm depressed at the current state of this game.

Guilty Gear Xrd -SIGN- is on Steam!\n\nGame looks great. One of the most beatiful looking not only fighting but all games in my opinion. And it runs 50-60 fps on my almost 4 year old laptop. Sure it will run smoothly on most PCs \nAudio is great, you can switch between Japanese and English. BGMs all just as always perfect (you also can unlock BGMs from Guilty Gear XX-2!) if you ever played Guilty Gear or BlazBlue you won't be disappointed.\nGameplay wise it is one of the best fighting games today. It's harder to master than Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter, but in-game tutorial is decent and you have various challenges apart arcade mode to train your skills.\nFor now i didn't touch online so i can't say anything about it. But considering it's a Guilty Gear on PC and the price is nice i certainly recommend this game to anyone who love fighting games and want to support this genre on PC.\n\nWell, there is nothing more to add.

I am a huge fan of fighting games and didn't want this to be a horrific port. ArcSys dashed out ALL doubts I had. While I can't yet speak for the online portion of the game, the offline / single-player experience is as smooth as can be. \n\nFor $24 (as of this review), you get the full game (obviously), but you also recieve ALL DLC for no additional charge (at least that's how it was for me :p). This includes 3 additional characters, all costume colors, and all system voices to change the announcer voice to that of your favorite character! The game also has MAGNIFICENT art style (in my honest opinion of course). The game's music is also fantastic (and as a side note, the creator of the game is also the composer for all the music. How cool is that?!). \n\nThe only \"con\" I have is that when you play the tutorial or challenge mode, the onscreen inputs change from the keyboard's keys to the Xbox buttons every couple of seconds (if you're using a controller / fightstick). But this is a simple fix as the game has an option to switch the input display from the Xbox / keyboard buttons to the abbrieviations of the attacks as they are called in the game.\n\nSo even though this review isn't really an in-depth one, I can honestly say I recommend this game to anyone looking for an anime game, (or in my case) a new fighting game to play. 10/10\n\n****EDIT****\nAfter looking up information about the PC release, I have now found out why I have access to all of the DLC.

If it was a 1:1 copy of the ps3 I would already say this is a steal. \n\nGameplay:I feel that the game might not be as refined as streetfighter but amongst the anime figther sub-genre GGxrd should be the mold used from now on. The controls are fluid, the action is fast and the specials have that cinematic punch which makes them feel amazing when well executed. Even for a casual player like me the gameplay is challenging yet enjoyable. Unlockables aren't content blocks yet rather minor avatar cosmetics or sounds (aside from the unlockable characters which are already unlocked as of now).\n\nGraphics: Old sprite based games look like poop when upscaled to 1440p and above. Even modern 2d sprite based fighters aspire for the 720p-1080p range. This game looks great at any resolution and it runs SMOOTH on older hardware (60 fps easily). Somehow they got the game to almost always have that distinct anime look without the jaring animation transitions which many cartoon graphics games have. \n\nPrice: The game just came out on PC even though its been out for over a year on console. Many publishers would market their game at $60 because its new to the platform regardless of when it originally came out. The $30 price tag is extremely fair for getting the game and all the DLC content that consoles have. \n\nConclusion: Arc System Works is starting to become one of my favorite game developers. Now that they publish their own games on PC we are getting high quality releases with full content at reasonable prices while the game is still relevant. I'm hoping they look to further break the trend of price gouging on fighters by releasing the next installment, -Revalator-, for a discounted price for owners of GGXrd -Sign-.", "timestamp_created": 1449719821, "timestamp_updated": 1449719821, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.579313", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19594516": {"recommendationid": "19594516", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996995234", "num_games_owned": 467, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1076, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459208163}, "language": "english", "review": "Works flawlessly at 60 fps and looks great.\n\nCurrently having connection issues in lobbies but when i do get games the netcode is great", "timestamp_created": 1449719656, "timestamp_updated": 1449719656, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19594448": {"recommendationid": "19594448", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013681321", "num_games_owned": 251, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1432, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475132956}, "language": "english", "review": "I already have this masterful fighting game on the PS4, but seeing this on steam is something.

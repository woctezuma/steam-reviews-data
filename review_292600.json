You can improve in a great many games, if not all of them, but when you revel in the simplicity as games like duet, and tetris, and super hexagon invariably do, it's a mountainous visceral improvement.

Duet is my pick-me-up when I want to chill for 15 minutes.\n\nAmong the seas and oceans of garbage mobile ports, this game stands out as how amazing a mobile port can actually be.\n\nWith tons of

Obstacles are not only static, but they can move, rotate and split, and every misclick can be fatal (especially when you're going through the whole set without dying..).\n\nPros:\n- simple, addictive gameplay\n- great music\n- a lot of levels\n- oddly satisfying voiceover\n\n+/-\n- one could say some achievements are impossible to get; I found them challenging\n\nCons:\n- couldn't find any, at least from my perspective\n\n\nOverall rating: 9/10\nPS.

Le gameplay est d'une grande simplicit\u00e9, vous contr\u00f4les deux boules (une rouge et une bleue) coinc\u00e9es aux deux extr\u00eamit\u00e9s d'un cercle, vos commandes ? Gauche et droite, pour faire tourner le cercle dans un sens ou dans l'autre. Des obstacles tombent du haut vers le bas, et vous \u00eates sur leur chemin, il faut donc faire tourner le cercle afin de faire tourner vos \"boules\" autour des obstacles (le cercle lui-m\u00eame les traversant sans encombre), en cas d'\u00e9chec, votre petite boule explosera sur l'obstacle blanc immacul\u00e9 et y laissera une trace de peinture vous signifiant votre \u00e9chec pour les prochains runs.\n\nGraphiquement c'est tr\u00e8s sobre et mono-couleur, on est principalement face \u00e0 des formes g\u00e9om\u00e9triques simples. La musique est relativement entrainante, et peut vous aider \u00e0 trouver en vous le bon rythme pour tourner comme il faut autour des obstacles \u00e0 venir. Le gameplay \u00e9tant assez simple, le d\u00e9but du jeu est extr\u00eamement simple, et on traverse les niveaux, mais assez rapidement les choses se corsent au fur et \u00e0 mesure que de nouveaux types d'obstacles mobiles sont ajout\u00e9s, et la courbe de difficult\u00e9 monte en fl\u00eache, pour \u00e9ventuellement atteindre des niveaux bonus dans lesquels on sent clairement que les devs cherchaient vraiment trop fort \"qu'est-ce qu'on pourrait bien ajouter maintenant\". C'est le probl\u00e8me des gameplays simples, le nombre de possibilit\u00e9s de nouveaut\u00e9s est assez faible, et \u00e0 trop vouloir ajouter de contenu, on finit par se voir contraint d'ajouter de mauvaises id\u00e9es au jeu.\nC'est ce qui arrive ici, les derniers niveaux ayant carr\u00e9ment des obstacles invisibles, qui apparaissent pour une demi seconde en haut de l'\u00e9cran, et disparaissent imm\u00e9diatement, vous demandant d'anticiper leurs mouvements \u00e0 travers leur d\u00e9placement dans l'\u00e9cran, ce qui repose enti\u00e8rement sur de la m\u00e9morisation musculaire des timers, et est plus chiant qu'autre chose.\n\nAutre point regrettable, le \"sc\u00e9nario\". S'il n'y a pas vraiment d'histoire (ni besoin d'histoire), une voix off un peu triste vous annonce des poncifs philosophiques sur le sens de la vie, de la joie, de la col\u00e8re, de la douleur & co \u00e0 travers les niveaux, avec des stages aux noms aussi \u00e9vocateurs que \"depression\", \"anxiety\", \"intimacy\", \"denial\" & co. A titre personnel je regrette vraiment un choix du th\u00e8me de la d\u00e9pression pour illustrer des petits jeux ind\u00e9s sans pr\u00e9tention, ce qui arrive relativement r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement et ne contribue pas vraiment \u00e0 mettre de la bonne ambiance !", "timestamp_created": 1478763173, "timestamp_updated": 1478763173, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26512762": {"recommendationid": "26512762", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108274130", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 49, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478747825}, "language": "english", "review": "Believe me, YOU ARE GOING TO NEED A NEW KEYBOARD because sometimes you will be so mad that you are going to break down LEFT and RIGHT keys.

It hits the right balance between challenging and relaxing. Visually simple it's still very pleasing to the eye and does give you just enough context beyond the bare gameplay mechanics to keep you engaged. The gameplay keeps evolving from chapter to chapter so you don't get complacent and the soothing soundtrack is almost mesmerizing.\n\nDuet might not be for everyone but I enjoyed it immensely. It made me think about other abstract games in recent years like lovely planet, thomas was alone or older games like Rez or Vib Ribbon that sometimes border on pretentious but are at least attempts at creating a gaming world filled with more than angry football players bouncing around with rocket launchers or angry wrestlers swinging axes at other angry wrestlers with green skin. I think diversity adds spice to entertainment and the odd little indie title wouldn't fly as well without the braindead arm chair general masturbation fantasy, but i would love to conduct an experiment (if I can go off-topic in this review which no one will ever read): ban graphically violent games for two years, not because media violence is harmful to the youth but because it's become so [b]boring[/b], and force developers to find new ways to entertain us.

At first I thought that maybe it will get better once I get a better hold of controls, but it only made me more frustrated the longer I played. It feels like it rushes so much you won't be able to do it correctly so I panicked. Then I got angry. I finished the story mode and epilogue, but I don't think I can play more. I just wanted it to end. Hey, you know what would make it a lot better? Control of movement up, or at least the speed.\n\nThe graphics are.. well. They're not bad. But not too good either. There's that contantly moving background and the effects that make the blocks look blurry when they move. I felt like my eyeballs are gonna fall out. Turning the effects off doesn't seem to help. After a while I think I got used to it? But I think that people who get motion sick easily shouldn't play this game.\n\nAnd let's talk about music for a second. I'm not an expert of the electronic music genre, but I appreciate good tracks. At first - it was fine. Didn't find anything particularly interesting, but some beats were better than the other. The biggest problem for me is that the music develops sooo sloowly. It's like the same beat for 2 minutes, then you get the other, and the other, etc. I guess some may enjoy this kind of music? After an hour of this it just didn't feel like music anymore, it just blended into one constant noise. In the end I got a headache out of that. I know you can turn it off, but I wanted to give it a chance, hoping I might find something I'd like more.\n\nThe main \"story\" is the only thing that kept me going to be honest. I didn't get much, but at least there was something. The ending dissapointed me though. I mean. There was pretty much no ending so what I'm talking about. The epilogue though... The lines felt so random that in the middle I started wondering what the hell I'm playing.\n\nI didn't want this to be so long I'm sorry. To be clear; I don't -hate- this game.

Now that I've picked it back up on PC, I can say that I enjoy the additions. As for the game as a whole, it was impressive back then, and it's still impressive now.\n\nIn this game you pilot two circles that travel around a ring avoiding boxes that fly down at them. It's kinda hard to describe how it handles, but it's still easy to wrap your head around. The \"story mode\", if you want to call it that, is based around the stages of grief, starting with Ignorance and working your way to Acceptance, with a new challenge thrown in at every stage. The story itself is told only through the level titles (named after the stages of grief) and a narration that follows you through each stage. It can elicit some feels when it all comes together at the end, but the story isn't that important. What really makes or breaks this game is the gameplay, and after beating the story, the epilogue, and the encore, I can say it's very solid.\n\nIf you've played Duet before, you'll probably get back in the saddle pretty quickly. What's new to me is the achievements and the encore stages. My only gripe is the achievements that require you to do the daily challenges a lot. I'm okay with the \"not dying\" achievements, even if they're a lot harder. It's just one of those challenges to hone your skills and push yourself, which is really the best use of achievements aside from suggesting alternate ways to play.\n\nAlso, the soundtrack is like audio syrup. If a difficult game (like this one) has a sweet soundtrack, that soundtrack can be the thing that keeps you from rage-quitting. Luckily, it's free on Bandcamp, so go get it, even if you don't want this game. You'll thank me later.\n\nI recommend trying the demo first. Using that to wrap your head around the movement mechanics will help you decide whether to buy it or not. The ultimate factors deciding whether you'll like the full game are whether you can figure out the mechanics and how easily you can give up in the face of a difficult challenge, both of which you'll figure out by the end of the demo. It's not Super Meat Boy difficult, but it does have teeth. Patience, hand-eye coordination, and a little determination are all you need to have fun with this game.", "timestamp_created": 1464564159, "timestamp_updated": 1464564159, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23271324": {"recommendationid": "23271324", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976870307", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 837, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508606308}, "language": "english", "review": "Duet is very difficult but always feels fair.

The entirety of gameplay involves controlling 2 dots, one red and one blue, that spin in a circle while blocks fall from the top of the circle of the screen and you have to dodge them. As the game progresses, the block behavior changes; some come spinning at you, some shake violently side to side and you won't know what position they will be in until it's too late to change your trajectory, and some even go invisible a second after being on screen so it tests your ability to memorize patterns on the fly. After the main story is complete, there are two alternate \"stories\" to be played, one that has blocks falling at a wonky angle (it's really hard to describe, you just have to see it for yourself) and one that places you at the center of the screen with blocks coming from above and below.\n\nThe \"story\" moved me more than i expected. The different chapters follow the stages of grief, and the narrator is like a psychologist or best friend trying to let you know that everything will be okay. As somebody who has formerly suffered from a rather debilitating depression, this was unexpectedly moving, and quite a welcome idea in this pure of a form.\n\nAltogether I would greatly recommend this game. I got it through a humble bundle that I purchased for other games, and this was a very nice gravy addition that is well worth the full price ($2.39 is an absolute steal!)

Duet is a highly simplistic indie game that combines challenging puzzles with an amazing art style. Indie games never cease to break through the boundaries of game innovation and this gem will be sure to give you one hell of a ride.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nDuet is a game where you have to control two blobs of colour, red and blue. Imagine if you will, an invisible ring and each blob is put on the ring at a position opposite to the other. You now have control of this 'invisible ring' which you rotate in order to keep each blob from touching any obstacles in the way. Obstacles come down towards you (or if you like to look at it the other way, you are moving towards the obstacles) and your job is to rotate the circle at the right moments, in the right directions to keep your blobs safe. I used an xbox one controller to play this game, however I'm sure a keyboard could work as well.\n\nPlaying this game requires good timing and a bit of memory, as the stages don't keep changing. Failure is highlighted by paint splashes on the objects you hit, and reminds you of areas you may have messed up on. I especially loved the fact that the game didn't go to some lengthy cutscene each time you died, instead, it pretty much \"rewinded the track\", and put you at the beginning. \n\nEarly levels were of course simple, and mostly forgiving. The story mode gradually teaches you how to adapt to varies types of obstacles, not by some intrusive tutorial or walkthrough, but by letting the player try over and over until they make it through that particular obstacle. And it is so satisfying, to finally beat a level that required intricate movements and an unbelievable amount of concentration. You'll soon discover that your skills grow rapidly as the levels become longer and harder [spoiler]:^)[/spoiler]...and there may be times you're actually too mentally fatigued to continue. But we both know you'll be back real soon, trying to get that timing just right.\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\nDuet is a beautiful game. The simplistic art style of the foreground objects is complemented so well by the 'dancing background' elements that keep the stage feeling alive and active. In fact, if there was a motion-less background, the game would feel a lot worse to play, but that may be an issue of preference. \n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\nCombined with amazing visuals, the music in Duet is really impressive. It has an indescribable melody which varies per level and can go from calming to upbeat in seconds. Regular sounds are well done as well, and fit the style of this game perfectly. At no point was I disappointed by anything I heard, which is quite impressive for such a simple game.\n\n[h1]Summary & Conclusion[/h1]\nDuet is an awesome game wrapped in a simplistic package. It can go from relaxing to mind-numbingly frustrating in just a few levels and it always keep things fresh. After playing highly competitive or mechanically demanding games, sometimes you just want to find something simple to ease your mind. Duet manages to find the perfect middle ground between these.\n\n10/10 - [spoiler]One of the best indie games out there[/spoiler]\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

But until we're done, these things are still a part of that system and that makes them our enemy. You have to understand, most of these levels are not ready to be finished.

They are guarding all the doors. they are holding all the keys which means that sooner or later someone is going to have to fight them.\nNeo: Someone?\nMorpheus: I won't lie to you, Neo. Every single man or woman who withstood their ground, everyone who has fought a Tile has died, but where they have failed you will succeed\nNeo: Why?\nMorpheus: I've seen a Tile punching through a concrete wall, men have emptied entire clips at them and hit nothing but air. Yet their strength and their speed are still based in a world that is built on rules. Because of that they will never be as strong or as fast as you can be.\nNeo: What are you trying to tell me?

You may think it'll be a peaceful experience with the given name but... it's hard.\n\nYou control a ring with adherent blue and red balls and you have to dodge obstacles. That may not sound hard, but you can't control the balls, all you can do is rotating ([i]of the ring[/i]). Not all obstacles are just static blocks, but they can also rotate, move, or be invisible for few seconds.\n\nThe game has a pretty good feel with the atmosphere built of minimalistic design and trance music. You just have to take a patient step towards the levels full of possible anger. Anyway, it's good to mention the developers, with the difficulty in mind, made levels shorter. Expect levels usually shorter than 30 seconds, so losing near the finish line is not so much stressful (not like in [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/recommended/322170]Geometry Dash[/url]).\n\nDuet, with consider for the lower price, is a nice game with overall polished design that's worth recommending to anybody who want a challenge.

I have absolutely no trouble with head-bob or camera-roll in FPS's like [i]Mirror's Edge,[/i] but with all the visual effects turned on, [I]Duet's[/i] later levels are about as nausea-inducing for me as reading a book in a car traveling on the highway: both make me a little queasy after about an hour. Obviously, YMMV, but if you're a hardcore binge-gamer that has to take dramamine to sit in the passenger seat of a car, this probably isn't your game.\n\nFor everyone else, however, [i]Duet[/i] is a remarkably well-crafted game. In particular, the first collection of stages (called \"story\") is a masterpiece of minimalistic game design. The difficulty-scaling is probably the smoothest of any game I've ever played, and the length of each stage is almost perfect: just long enough so that when things go right, you can get into a groove and stay in it long enough to enjoy it, but not so long that you start to loathe returning to the beginning when you make a mistake.\n\nThat's not to say that it's never frustrating, because it certainly can be. As block arrangements become more complex, you'll sometimes find you have to rely on memorization instead of reflexes and wit, so the process of passing a stage sometimes bears a strong (and [i]a propos)[/i] resemblance to the process of learning to play a piece of music. I sometimes wondered why I was putting up with it only to remember after watching the last red-and-blue-spattered block of the stage fall from view.\n\nAgain, however, YMMV.\n\nPersonally, though, even if I [i]didn't[/i] find the game entertaining, it would still be worth the price. I've spent twice as much albums half as good as the OST, and the game's craftsmanship is fine enough that it can be admired even if it can't be enjoyed.\n\n[i]EDIT: I should add that the replay value of the game is quite high. Daily/nightly challenges offer a good 15-30min of completely new material each day, and there's \"endless\" and \"speed run\" modes, as well.[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1458079465, "timestamp_updated": 1458755316, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21840783": {"recommendationid": "21840783", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014650993", "num_games_owned": 502, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 284, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457986378}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Lo poco que jugado, esta bien, pero, puff estos juegos me da\u00f1a la vista, que mareo!!\n\n\u00bfRecomiendas este juego?\n\nSi tienes huevos, si.", "timestamp_created": 1457986490, "timestamp_updated": 1457986490, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21838283": {"recommendationid": "21838283", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060277415", "num_games_owned": 2208, "num_reviews": 630, "playtime_forever": 254, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458062934}, "language": "english", "review": "Duet is a game that I recommend because:\n- is a method to banish boredom\n- is indie & casual\n- it has action\n- it is difficult\n- it is colorful\n- it has a great soundtrack\n- it has trading cards\n\nEnjoy!", "timestamp_created": 1457977876, "timestamp_updated": 1457977876, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.263080", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21833519": {"recommendationid": "21833519", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021959875", "num_games_owned": 6671, "num_reviews": 250, "playtime_forever": 491, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458585756}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\n\u64cd\u4f5c\u9700\u5713\u8f49\u5982\u610f\uff0c\u5982\u74b0\u7121\u7aef\uff0c\u9032\u9000\u9593\u4f46\u6c42\u7dbf\u5ef6\u4e0d\u7d55\u3002\n\n\u73a9\u5230\u5f8c\u9762\u51fa\u73fe\u96b1\u5f62\u65b9\u584a\uff0c\u8981\u6211\u9589\u773c\u7528\u5fc3\u53bb\u73a9\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u54ea\u62db\u554a\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1457959162, "timestamp_updated": 1457959162, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552421", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21831403": {"recommendationid": "21831403", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043691565", "num_games_owned": 1360, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1390, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492967260}, "language": "english", "review": "Failed 100 times on a single level.\n10/10 will fail again. \n\nIts awesome for time pass but be prepared to rip your hair out.\nIt might look like its a really easy and simple game but make no mistake as the difficulty rises you'll be hard pressed for perfect timing.

It's hard to imagine, as simplistic as the design seems and is both visually and gameplaywise, but this was one of the most immersive video games I've played in a long time. I'm not really sure how long I played it, but for the time that I did, my mind would not allow me to focus on any other task. All I could do was continue to make my way through the flying rectangle gauntlet. Paradoxically, it was an introspective experience. While I focused on defeating the courses, I thought about myself and my life. My goals, my ambitions, my successes and failures, my ideas about what kind of person I want to be. I feel like a new man. I've emerged from some kind of deep meditation. My thoughts about all of my petty problems and short term issues fell away as I made my way down to the center of myself. I feel so serene and so happy with who I am right now. All this because of a simple game of rectangles and dots.\n\nOthers may not have the same experience with this game. Many respond to the kind of adversity this game presents with anger and frustration, and they end up feeling stressed and powerless. Of course, this is actually something that many people actually enjoy, because once victory is achieved, it's that much sweeter. I love Super Meat Boy for that very reason, but I feel as though this game isn't meant to be experienced in a similar way to Super Meat Boy. If you want to come out of this game feeling the way I do right now, and also come out with quite possibly a life-changing perspective on who you are and what you want to be, consider trying these things:\n\n1: Don't imagine the game as you normally would with a game like this. Don't think about it as a series of challenges, and as if you have to get to the next level by beating the one you're currently on. Think of it as one continuous experience. Don't focus on reaching the end, just focus on each task as you're faced with it. \n\n2: On a particularly hard level, if you begin to feel frustrated because you keep dying in the same place or something along those lines, just try to relax. Tensing up will not help you. Sit up, relax your shoulders, try to find any other muscles in your body that seem tensed up, and just let them go. Breathe deeply. Let the game guide you. Listen to the music. Let it consume you. If you think too hard, you will never progress.\n\n3: Don't think about your short term issues or focus on life's problems while playing this game. Take this time to get to know yourself and ask deep and meaningful questions.\n\nIf you do these things, I swear to god you will feel amazing afterward.

You must manipulate the rotations to avoid walls and blocks coming towards you, and the game introduces increasingly complicated mechanics as it goes on. \n\nFirst off, this game is magnificently BRUTAL. And it feel absolutely fantastic when you finally \"perfect\" that level; finally beat your high score, etc. But at the same time, this game has the ability to put me into a relaxing trance and build a crazy amount of muscle memory, to the point that I don't have a fucking clue how I beat half the Transcendence levels. As far as content is concerned, the main campain consists of 49 levels, with an additional 78 levels in the \"encore\" and \"epilogue\" chapters. In addition to this already meaty amount of content, there are three types of \"endless\" modes, and additional 15 challenge levels (that are hard as fuck btw), and daily and nightly challenges every fucking day.\n\nGood god, this game is underpriced.\n\n[b][u]CONCLUSION:[/u][/b] An absolute must-buy for anyone intrigued by the gameplay videos, and comfortable with reflex-heavy games.

And it is.\n\nIt isn\u2019t easy though; in fact, the difficulty rather quickly ramps up, and by the end, you\u2019re dodging vanishing, moving walls and navigating through narrow gaps almost automatically. And still dying a lot.\n\nThe game is very much about flow \u2013 that is to say, the sensation of getting drawn up into the action of the game to the point where the game feels like an extension of you, and everything becomes focused on the game.\n\nAnd the game is very good at invoking this sensation.\n\nAfter beating the main set of stages, the game offers a variety of optional modes \u2013 including a daily challenge, as well as an infinite arcade mode and a number of additional sets of levels to further challenge the player\u2019s ability.\n\nThe main set of levels takes maybe four hours to beat, but you can spend much longer with this game if you choose to complete all the unlockable levels as well.\n\nAll in all, the game is quite good at what it is, but it isn\u2019t the most ambitious thing in the world; it is a very simple game, though somewhat more complex than games like Super Hexagon. Still, it does what it is trying to do.\n\nEDIT: Note that some of the optional levels are kind of a drag.

Playing it boosts your reflexes greatly. Narration and music, along with changing background, create unique atmosphere.\nPlayed it a lot on the mobile and now tried Steam version. And it came out that the game is very easy for me, probably because of previous \"mobile training\" and knowing what to expect.\nHowever, no-wallhitting achievements and perfect completions (green triangles) are taking even more effort of hands and mind: they are making you tired and require quite a lot of thinking and sometimes improvisation. \nChallenges are special levels here. Unlike story levels which get randomised only when you restart the game, these ones are randomised every time you restart a level. So going for \"challenge perfect\" achievement require a lot of improvisation. I think I spent about 2 hours yesterday completing trancendence II and III and thought that going for trancendence perfect was totally impossible. However, just now I began it and did it in about 20 tries, it happened to be not that hard after all. And I was rewarded not only with achievement, but also with Trancendence-IV extra hard level (a hybrid of Quickening-VI and Trancendence-III), which was totally awesome (maybe it appears when you complete Trancendence for a second time, not with perfect run).\nAlso there are time and score challenges, but I'm not really into them, so I can't say much.\nThank you Kumobius for that great game!", "timestamp_created": 1455763616, "timestamp_updated": 1455763616, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21201181": {"recommendationid": "21201181", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128916879", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 709, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513268341}, "language": "schinese", "review": "Duet\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6211\u5728\u5b89\u5353\u4e0a\u73a9\u8fc7\u5feb\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u6f14\u4e86\uff0c\u52a0\u4e0a\u6b63\u5728\u6253\u6298\uff08\u6bd4\u5b89\u5353\u8fd8\u4fbf\u5b9c\uff09\u6240\u4ee5\u6211\u60f3\u90fd\u6ca1\u60f3\u5c31\u5165\u4e86\u3002\n\u539f\u58f0\u97f3\u4e50\u662f\u5fc5\u987b\u7ed9\u597d\u8bc4\u7684\uff0c\u5176\u6b21\u662f\u73a9\u6cd5\uff0c\u624b\u6b8b\u8fd8\u6709\u6bc5\u529b\u5c31\u662f\u8fd9\u6837\u7ec3\u6210\u7684\ud83d\ude02\u3002\n\u81f3\u4e8e\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u6211\u73b0\u5728\u8fd8\u662f\u7528\u7684\u5e73\u677f\uff0c\u89e6\u5c4f\u64cd\u4f5c\u8fd8\u662f\u6ca1\u53d8\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u770b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e0b\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u952e\u76d8\u64cd\u4f5c\u8fd8\u662f\u6ca1\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u3002\n\n\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u662f\uff0c\u6bcf\u65e5\u6311\u6218\u5bf9\u65b0\u624b\u6765\u8bf4\u6709\u65f6\u5019\u3002\u3002\u3002\u3002\u3002\u9690\u8eab\u7684\u65b9\u5757\u628a\u6211\u90fd\u5413\u5230\u4e86\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u6ca1\u4ec0\u4e48\u5f71\u54cd\u5566!\n\u603b\u4e4b\u5c31\u662f\u63a8\u8350\u5566\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u73b0\u5728\u90fd\u8fd8\u5728\u9002\u914d\u5176\u4ed6\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\uff0c\u52a0\u6cb9\u554a\uff01\n\n\u53e6\u5916\u53e6\u5916\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u662f\u90a3\u79cd\u770b\u7740\u7b80\u5355\u73a9\u7740\u96be\u7684\u90a3\u79cd\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5728\u670b\u53cb\u9762\u524d\u88c5\u903c\u3001\u6253\u8138\u4ec0\u4e48\u7684\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1455441298, "timestamp_updated": 1455442190, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21148726": {"recommendationid": "21148726", "author": {"steamid": "76561198174376569", "num_games_owned": 337, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1857, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514436100}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u975e\u5e38\u68d2\u7684\u4e00\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u521b\u610f\u6781\u4f73\uff0c\u539f\u58f0\u97f3\u4e50\u5f88\u8d5e\uff0c\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u8ba9\u6211\u60f3\u8d77\u4e86\u53e6\u5916\u4e00\u53eb\u505aSuper Hexagon\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u90fd\u662f\u5dee\u4e0d\u591a\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\uff0c\u8003\u9a8c\u4eba\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5927\u8111\u534f\u8c03\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u800cDuet\u5c31\u50cf\u592a\u6781\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u73a9\u5bb6\u540c\u65f6\u5173\u6ce8\u4e24\u4e2a\u7403\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u800c\u5230\u540e\u671f\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ece\u4e0a\u9762\u4f1a\u6709\u65b9\u5757\u843d\u4e0b\u6765\uff0c\u4e0b\u9762\u4e5f\u4f1a\u6709\u7a9c\u4e0a\u53bb\u7684\u3002\n\n\u603b\u4e4b\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u6b3e\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1455275397, "timestamp_updated": 1497528694, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507117", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21087312": {"recommendationid": "21087312", "author": {"steamid": "76561198275560454", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499199660}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "J\u00e1 havia jogado Duet no meu celular, desde o momento em que o baixei pela primeira vez me identifiquei absurdamente e achei que era o jogo que definia minha vida.

It was beautiful time. Each time when I started to play Duet, I was relaxing. This game I found three days ago on a sale. Without thinking, I immediately bought it. And didn't regret. I started to play Duet for about 1 hour each day just for relaxing. Well, I can't even find the words that can describe this game. It's a splendid one. In this game you need to pay [b]special attention[/b] to music and also to the voice of woman. Everything together creates an excellent atmosphere. It is beyond words. You need to feel it for yourself. Only then you will understand me. In general, Duet made me thinking about the meaning of life and existence.

The gameplay is entirely skill, so any time you get sent back to the beginning of the level, it's on you. The difficulty ramps up a little bit slowly for my liking, but once you beat Story mode, you have the freedom to play some really tough levels. On the subject of Story mode, it may look a little short the first time you fire up the game. Make no mistake - it is, but that's not what you're here for. All of Story mode is essentially a tutorial for the Epilogue, Challenge mode, Encore mode, and speedrun mode.\n\nAs a speedrunner, I feel it necessary to comment a bit more on this game's speedrun mode. In this game, speedrun mode takes you through your choice of Story, Epilogue, or Encore, and you set the pace. You get to adjust what speed you play the game at on the fly. This means you can crank it up to 200% and blast through levels you're comfortable with, and perhaps even drop it down to 100% on levels you'd rather just get out of the way. The timer keeps going if you have to restart a level, after all. I'd like to believe this means no two speedruns will look the same, but I can't say for sure.\n\nThe art isn't flashy or mind-blowing, but it is absolutely fitting for what the game is. The music, on the other hand, is excellent in my opinion. It's definitely fitting, and while it's not crazy enough to be distracting, it's still good enough that I'd enjoy listening to it while not playing the game. In fact, getting to hear the next chapter's music felt like as much of a reward as actually getting good enough to beat each chapter.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this game, especially at a discount. As a side note, if you've played and enjoyed the game 140, I think you'd really enjoy Duet.

Back when it was on the app store, this game was praised for being both extremely challenging and incredibly therapeutic.\nDuet was, and is, a game that frustrates you, but asks and teaches you to control it.\n\nPros:\n+Optimized as hell. I actually had to cap my framerate at 120fps on a laptop that can just barely play TESO...I had to CAP Duet at 120fps. It was originally rendering at 400fps.\n+Beautiful and minimalistic, with optional visuals.\n+Every win feels like an accomplishment.\n+It will change your way of thinking in a beneficial manner.\n+There's more than Story mode. In fact, there's daily challenges (new levels).\n+Gamepad!\n\nMids:\n=VSync doesn't noticeably do triple buffer. You'll want VSync turned OFF.\n\nCons:\n-With VSync enabled, I noticed my music wouldn't play. Minor sound bug, and will probably be patched.\n-I beat my first run of Story mode in 20 minutes.

Mais en sera-t-il r\u00e9ellement capable?\n\nNous contr\u00f4lons, deux petites sph\u00e8res (une rouge et une autre bleu) qui nous permettront d\u2019avancer dans des niveaux de plus en plus labyrinthiques et sc\u00e9naris\u00e9s.\n\nPlus on avance dans les niveaux plus la tension monte.\n\nNous aurons au d\u00e9but quelques petits blocs \u00e0 esquiver, mais au fur et \u00e0 mesure que nous avancerons dans les niveaux, les obstacles commenceront \u00e0 bouger, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 dispara\u00eetre compl\u00e8tement.\nIl faudra, vraiment rester concentr\u00e9, afin de pouvoir continuer le jeu.\n\nPlusieurs modes de jeux s\u2019offrent \u00e0 nous. Le premier est le mode histoire. D\u00e8s le d\u00e9but, une voix off commencera son r\u00e9cit et continuera \u00e0 chaque d\u00e9but de niveau. Chaque niveau a son propre nom comme \u00ab Ignorance \u00bb ou encore \u00ab Col\u00e8re \u00bb.\n\nL\u2019histoire est le mode principal du jeu (\u00e9galement le plus simple) il permettra de d\u00e9bloquer diff\u00e9rents modes bonus.\nDeux autres modes \u00ab histoire \u00bb se d\u00e9bloqueront \u00e9galement par la suite et seront beaucoup plus compliqu\u00e9s que le premier. Il y aura donc le mode \u00ab \u00e9pilogue \u00bb et le mode \u00ab rappel \u00bb.\nChaque mode bonus sont plus compliqu\u00e9s les uns que les autres.\n\nLe premier, le mode \u00ab Illimit\u00e9 \u00bb, nous proposera de faire un niveau interminable. Il faudra survivre le plus longtemps possible afin de pouvoir acqu\u00e9rir le meilleur score. On aura le droit \u00e0 trois chances, une fois utilis\u00e9es, c\u2019est \u00ab game over \u00bb est le score est sauvegard\u00e9 seulement si c\u2019est votre record.\n\nL\u2019un des autres modes bonus est les \u00ab d\u00e9fis quotidiens \u00bb qui nous proposeront tous les jours trois niveaux diff\u00e9rents. Ces niveaux seront vraiment d\u2019une grande difficult\u00e9 en combinant blocs invisibles et blocs amovibles. Mais le d\u00e9fi quotidien n\u2019es rien compar\u00e9 au \u00ab d\u00e9fi nocturne \u00bb, qui lui aussi a chaque jour son propre niveau original. Compar\u00e9 aux d\u00e9fis de bases; il r\u00e9unit en m\u00eame temps concentration et rage intensive. Pour donner un avis sur la difficult\u00e9, le m\u00eame jour, le d\u00e9fi normal j\u2019ai du l\u2019effectuer en moins de 3 \u00e0 5 minutes quant au d\u00e9fi nocturne j\u2019ai bien pris une bonne quinzaine de minutes avant de voir la fin avec bien-s\u00fbr une rage qui augment\u00e9e au fur et \u00e0 mesure de mes \u00e9checs.\n\nDans chaque d\u00e9fi quotidien, il y a trois niveaux. Le premier, est en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral le plus simple (petit conseil, si vous n\u2019arrivez pas d\u00e8s le premier, abandonnez) oui parce qu\u2019au deuxi\u00e8me la difficult\u00e9 augmente, mais le troisi\u00e8me s\u2019av\u00e8re vraiment Hardcore.\n\nIl y a \u00e9galement le mode \u00ab course de vitesse \u00bb pour les plus abrupts d\u2019entre vous. Dans ce mode, les niveaux du mode histoire ou encore du mode \u00e9pilogue ou rappel d\u00e9fileront sans pause et il y aura \u00e9galement un minuteur qui se lancera d\u00e9s que le jeu commencera. \u00c0 vous d\u2019essayer de r\u00e9aliser les niveaux dans un minimum de temps.\n\nUne fois qu\u2019un niveau est r\u00e9alis\u00e9, une petite ic\u00f4ne verte se place en haut \u00e0 gauche de celui-ci. Cette ic\u00f4ne nous signale que nous pourrons effectuer le niveau \u00e0 la perfection en n\u2019effectuant qu\u2019un minimum de d\u00e9placements. Cela ne sera pas chose ais\u00e9e de pouvoir enfin avoir le \u00ab perfect \u00bb final.\n\nN\u2019abandonnez jamais \u00e0 votre premi\u00e8re mort, au contraire elles peuvent vous \u00eatre utiles pour plusieurs raisons. Gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 elles vous pourrez enfin r\u00e9ussir \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser un niveau, que vous n\u2019aviez pas r\u00e9ussi auparavant. Il ne vous suffira juste de m\u00e9moriser les diff\u00e9rents passages complexes et le tour est jou\u00e9 !\n\nVous pourrez \u00e9galement, r\u00e9ussir les niveaux entiers sans mourir une seule fois. Faire cela n\u00e9cessitera beaucoup de patience, vous allez souvent ne pas y arriver, il ne faudra pas perdre espoir.\n\nUn point important qui m\u2019avait marqu\u00e9 sur Smartphone \u00e9tait le mode invers\u00e9.

I don't dislike minimalist styles, and it's not BAD looking, but when you only have two spheres and 3 types of rectangle in your game, I would expect them to look at least a little bit interesting. Not to mention how the constant blur effect makes it surprisingly difficult to see what's going on sometimes, especially with spinning blocks. The visuals are actually detrimental to the gameplay. The pulsing background effects are cool. \n\nGameplay: Memorize sequences of left and right presses. There is some skill involved, but it's basically just remembering how long to push left or right for various combinations of blocks. It's very unrewarding. It is an interesting rotating concept, but it doesn't deliver. Every time you mess up you have to restart the level. Levels are short and the reset takes only a second so it's not a big deal, but it's not fun. That is how I would describe the gameplay here: not fun. \nIt has a minimalist narrative which is pretty cool. \n\nAudio: This game actually has a great soundtrack, I really like the background music and when it gets going it starts to tie the game together and make it almost enjoyable. The in game sounds are lackluster. The \"narration\" is a nice touch.\n\nIn short: It's not terrible, not the worst thing you can buy for sure. If you just want to pay \u00a32 to kill half an hour then it's not bad, but I wish it had been so much more. It could have been with just a little bit more time/effort/money. \n", "timestamp_created": 1439415899, "timestamp_updated": 1439415899, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.311487", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17504010": {"recommendationid": "17504010", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989784474", "num_games_owned": 876, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1440828815}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game!

And luckily the things that made it so compelling on mobile also work well when sitting at a desk.\n\nThe closest game I can compare [i]Duet[/i] to is [i]Super Hexagon[/i]. They both do everything a mobile game should do: simple controls, easy to pick up and put down quickly, and minimal graphics that still manage to be beautiful. [i]Duet[/i] does a few more things to make it worthwhile to continue playing, and because of that I believe it is a better game.\n\nIn [i]Duet[/i] you control the rotation of two spheres: holding down the right arrow key rotates them clockwise, holding down the left arrow key rotates them counterclockwise. The only task the game gives you is to avoid the white obstacles as they fall from the top of the screen. It is much easier to understand if you see it in action, so be sure to watch the trailer.\n\nUnlike [i]Super Hexagon[/i], which procedurally generates its obstacles from a set of patterns, each level level in Duet is the same each time you play it. If you hit an obstacle, the sphere that hit bursts and splatters on the obstacle. The game then rewinds to the beginning of the level, and you try again. The splatter stays there, reminding you of your past failure. Once you have completed a level there is a brief pause and the next level begins.\n\nThe levels are grouped into chapters, each with a title named after a stage of grief. The beginning of each level has a short quote pertaining to the chapter you are in, and it paints a strange story as you play. Each chapter is based around a new type of challenge. They start off simple and then start combining what you learned in past chapters with what you know now. The pace at which they introduce new elements is challenging, but reasonable. I would sometimes hit a level that seemed insurmountable, but determination and perseverance have won out in the end every time.\n\nThe game rewards you with achievements for each chapter you complete. More challenging achievements exist for things like completing a chapter without hitting a single obstacle. You can also comprehensively compare how well you have done to how well everyone else in the world (or just your friends) have done. I'm hoping that some of my friends on PC will pick up the game so I can crush them on the leaderboards.\n\nIf the story mode were all there was to the game, it would be short. But there is also an epilogue, several challenge levels, an endless mode, and a daily challenge. At time of writing, I have beaten just over half of the static levels in the game. Even after I have mastered all them the endless mode and the daily challenges will keep me coming back for a long time yet.", "timestamp_created": 1438831990, "timestamp_updated": 1438831990, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.976143", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17407601": {"recommendationid": "17407601", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006450896", "num_games_owned": 597, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 656, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451648607}, "language": "polish", "review": "[h1] \u015awietna gra zr\u0119czno\u015bciowa! <3[/h1]\n[b]Polecam dla fan\u00f3w Super Hexagon.

Duet is a very hard game that can induce rage into you but is also calming at the same time. The concept is unique and it even has a very nice story to accompany it. \n\nDuets mechanics are something of a uniqueness that is very hard to describe but I will try my best to. You take control of two balls. Your goal is to avoid the obstacles that descend onto you. The screen rises up at a continuous rate. Your only means of controlling the characters is to rotate them arround the circle. When you press left one ball goals left around the circle and the other goes right always keeping an equal distance apart from each other. It's a concept that I have never seen done before and it does it extremely well. \n\nThe whole experience is done with relatively few obstacles. You have a few different size and shaped blocks and that is it. The difference between them is the way that they are arranged. They are put in familiar patterns and you get to learn the best technique to avoid them as you go through the game. New arrangements and obstacles are introduced periodically at a consistent rate making sure you never get bored of doing the same again over and over. Beware it is very hard. It will take a lot of practice but you will feel very satisfied when you finally figure out how to avoid that one obstacle that you've been stuck on for like 20 attempts!\n\nDuets graphics style is minimalistic but it's something that I appreciate and really enjoy. The balls are red and blue and the obstacles are white. That's about it. The balls have a very nice trail that follows them when they move as well. The only other thing is the backgrounds. To make sure the screen isn't empty the game adds a nice moving background that goes along to the beat of the music. These are very varied and can sometimes create a trippy experience for you as your trying to avoid obstacles. Their put in properly so there not too distracting but are enough so you actually notice them. I absolutely love the minimalistic graphics style and I don't think theres anything they could do differently in this respect.\n\nNow the developers could have just created a rather stale experience on this small concept. But instead they decided to go all out on the project and add everything that a game should have. What is a real suprise in duet is how they implemented a story. At the end of every level you complete you get a short quote on the screen that is showed as well as read out. It's read out beautifully also! At first they seem meaningless to you, but after a while you slowly realise that they are actually piecing together a story. It seems to tell the story of a persons life through stages such as anger, depression and then hope. It is amazing and really does give you a reason to continue on and finish each level. Some quotes are even very motivational and make you want to carry on!\n\nA good soundtrack is key in games like this. And boy does it deliver. The soundtrack is a pleasure to listen to. It's very varied sometimes being rather slow tunes and other times being upbeat and fast tunes. I believe the soundtrack is varied throughout the game to represent different moments in the story. It works really well and really makes you feel for moments of the story. Therefore the soundtrack isn't repetitive and I would love to listen to it even off of the game. \n\nMost things you would want in the settings menu are present. There are fully rebindable keys with secondary inputs as well. There are a huge variety of languages to select. In the graphics section you have resolutions, fullscreen mode, Anti-aliasing and v-sync. Only a yes or no option for Anti-Aliasing though. In audio you have options to turn music, voice and sound effects off or on. The only things I think that is missing that it truly needs is seperate audio sliders for each of these. \n\nWhat is new in the PC version though? I hear you mobile veterans of the game cry! I did a comparison on this and the only thing I could find in the PC version that isn't currently in the mobile version is speed run mode. So if you already have the game, unless you really want it on PC there might not be much of a reason to upgrade. \n\nSo what actually is in the game? Will it keep me occupied long enough? Yes is the answer to the second question. There are three different campaigns, story, encore and epilogue. Each having enough levels to keep you playing for at least 5 hours probably. You then have a lot of different challenge modes to try. These include an endless mode, daily and nightly challenges and then what seems to actually be another small campaign. Finally you have speed run mode. So yes there is a lot to keep you occupied and 63 steam achievements. So it definitely doesn't lack enough content.\n\nOverall duet is a minimalistic beauty that presents a concept and builds on it as you play to make for a fun and calming, but also rather rage inducing experience. It's a mobile port so people might take that into consideration. However it isn't noticeable that it is and it translates very well to PC. It is currently on sale for \u00a33.99. An extremely reasonable price for the amount of content that is present. I would easily recommend this to anyone that is a fan of similar games.\n\n[h1]TheIronicGamers rating system[/h1]\n\n    [list][*]Don't ever buy this game.\n    [*]Maybe consider it on a sale.\n    [*]An average game.\n    [*]A good game that should definitely be considered.\n    [*][b][u]A must play![/u][/b][/list]\n\nDisclaimer: I was provided a free review key by the developer to make this review.", "timestamp_created": 1438813129, "timestamp_updated": 1438813174, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524868", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17405846": {"recommendationid": "17405846", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041620963", "num_games_owned": 314, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 1242, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500039822}, "language": "dutch", "review": "Uhh yeah, so this game is good.", "timestamp_created": 1438812529, "timestamp_updated": 1467248808, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492411", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17405093": {"recommendationid": "17405093", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073346321", "num_games_owned": 600, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 395, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467436628}, "language": "english", "review": "Full Let's Play Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rti184ftYCc\n\nPlaying Duet feels like you're torturing yourself, but you just can't stop doing it.

It feels like the phrases comes from a person in the game, who I am together with and converse with. Those half- philosophical conversations (which I\u2019m making up while playing) makes me feel like I\u2019m building up a kind of a relationship with the person \u2013 just as I would with anyone who I had such personal conversations with. After completing story mode and I began playing challenges, I actually began to think that the game became a little lonely to play without those phrases.

is a must play.

When you finally beat a level, it\u2019s not only satisfying it\u2019s actually quite beautiful.\n\n\nSimply turn, left or right. Playable with gamepad, keyboard or just mouse. Switch seamless between to whatever you prefer. (Movement is digital, meaning you turn at one constant speed). (Also includes touch controls which I can\u2019t test). I've played the Android version briefly before this, and I find that best version is on PC. Blasting the amazing soundtrack loudly, get hypnotized by the visuals on the big screen and get addicted to the challenge.

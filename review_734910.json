Both stories are quite short, yet decently satisfying while still leaving me looking forward to more. I've always been a sucker for sweet innocent romances and if you are too you will likely enjoy the story side of this well enough.\n\nAs to the other elements of the game - it has an enjoyable soundtrack and the art is decent enough. I'm not a big fan of the shading style on the characters, but their designs in general are otherwise fairly pleasing. The CGs have some slight animation to them, which is nice, though they may be a bit underwhelming otherwise.\n\nMy one complaint would be with the English voice acting. The sound quality is fine but the performances in generally are rather stiff and stilted. Honestly, I'd like it if they offered an option to switch between this and the orginal - I'm guessing Japanese based on the character names - which I would hope is a fair bit more natural than this dub.\n\nOverall I'm glad I spent a few hours going through these stories and I look forward to the full game down the line.", "timestamp_created": 1514890542, "timestamp_updated": 1514893182, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38964453": {"recommendationid": "38964453", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991875201", "num_games_owned": 295, "num_reviews": 173, "playtime_forever": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514877871}, "language": "koreana", "review": "10\ubd84\uc774\uba74 \ub3c4\uc804\uacfc\uc81c 100% \ucc0d\ub294\ub2e4. \uc544, \ubb3c\ub860 \uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\ub294 \ubaa8\ub984. \uc2a4\ud0b5\ud588\uc73c\ub2c8\uae4c...

If you only wanted to unlock the achievement without adding any changes to the ending, you must disable the h content in the game settings before you start a prequel.

Furthermore there may be grammer errors. \n\nChapter 1 (String of Fate):\n\n0. For example \"Good morning, Rin! Mind if I come in? \".\n>> The subject you can be found within the context of the sentence. \n\n1. For example \"Gone is the tiny cafe I used to frequent as a child, replaced now by a large restaurant.\"\n>> The 'that' is not used or ',' so it create an different kind of flow.\n\n2. For example:\n \"I hope I can give something back to you, for all the time you supported me\",\n>> It could be possible that they didn't use correctly the present perfect (have supported) or using mixed times such as the past verb and present verb in one sentence.\n\n3 For example: \n\"But responsible... The idea never crossed my mind.\"\n>> What does the writer mean with responsible? \"being responsible to...\" or\" having responsiblity about..\" or \"being alive\", I mean the sentence doesn't make any sense in the context.\n\n4. For example: \n\"They were on their way home the night they died.\"\n>> Maybe it should use something to connect such as \"that night\" or \"during that night\", or \"after that night\".\n\n5 For example: \n\"I forget Tokya still has ancient structures like this\"\n>> Would maybe be \"I forget that Tokya still has ancient structures like this\", by adding 'that' in the sentence.\n\n*If I am wrong just correct me please. I am not a perfect (native) English speaker and writer, however I have studied English as second language. \nIt's just that I felt that the flow of the game at the introduction falters, and the things that I mention are the things I had noticed while playing the game. ~Bloooderhood", "timestamp_created": 1513967141, "timestamp_updated": 1514243894, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38544330": {"recommendationid": "38544330", "author": {"steamid": "76561198411459954", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513882525}, "language": "english", "review": "i do not enjoy this game at all, not for me or anyone i know", "timestamp_created": 1513966670, "timestamp_updated": 1513966670, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.279851", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38533421": {"recommendationid": "38533421", "author": {"steamid": "76561198312649367", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 28, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513950318}, "language": "turkish", "review": "G\u00f6rsel roman t\u00fcr\u00fcndeki oyunlarla i\u00e7li d\u0131\u015f\u0131 de\u011filim l\u00e2kin bu oyunu sevdim.

In Strings of Fate, it features a female protagonist, Rin Fujimoto, who recently moved back to the small Japanese town of Tokya. Her main purpose in returning is to take care of her nephew, Yasu Fujimoto, after Rin's brother and sister-in-law passed away in a car accident. \n\nWhile at the orphanage to pick up Yasu, Rin is introduced to the chief volunteer at the orphanage, Megumi Shimizu. When Megumi comes to Rin's house to check on Yasu's progress, Megumi suggests going out together with Rin to shop for a cell phone and get to know each other better.\n\nIn The Lost Date, Yasu Fujimoto has grown up to become a teenager while living with his aunt Rin Fujimoto. His friends and classmates, Katashi and Tamiko, invite him to go to a cave by Kurokku Lake to partake in some alcohol illegally with Naoko and Daisuke, who are also both Climbers Club members.\n\nEach short story will take approximately 30-60 minutes. I decided to give the game a score of 8/10 based on the following factors:\n\nPlot and character backgrounds: The plot is written as a romance visual novel where depending on the responses Rin and Yasu give to Megumi and Naoko respectively, it can lead to the best ending with yuri and straight fan service. Alternatively, it may lead to a less desirable plot development and outcome where the relationship between the main characters doesn't evoke stronger feelings of love and passion for each other. The choices to reach the best endings are obvious and can easily be deduced. Some parts are censored in the Steam version, however a free uncensored patch is available at the developer's Google Drive through the Kickstarter page of its upcoming game [i]Eternal Hour[/i] as well as at Sekai Project's Denpasoft website. \n\nThis is a short free to play game intended as a prequel to the longer game, [i]Eternal Hour[/i], which is currently still in development. The short length and simplistic character backgrounds, game play and story line, together with one plot hook on the supernatural sightings and occurences inside the cave make this visual novel good for those looking for a short experience to spend a couple of hours on. From that point, one can decide whether the story line and plot is interesting enough to commit to the longer visual novel [i]Eternal Hour[/i] when it is released in future.\n\nArtwork: The artwork is colourful and attractive with an interactive menu interface where the featured characters will be enlarged when a short story is chosen. There are also animated CGs in the form of blinking eyes, waving hair, floating cherry blossom petals, passing fireflies and dust particles. I would have preferred to see more animated CGs for this game especially since the game description on Steam store page claims to feature animated CGs. There are actually 3 animated CGs, 2 animated H-CGs(not shown without uncensored patch) and 2 CGs with no animation. Hope to see more attractive animated CGs in [i]Eternal Hour[/i].\n\nVoice acting and background music: The voice acting in English may seem out of place considering the game is featuring Japanese characters in a modern Japanese setting. Yet, for those who don't mind this, the voice acting is generally conveyed well with appropriate tones to match the different emotional moments in the game. Background music is also pleasant and appropriate to match the different moments in the game. My favourite BGM are Hearts Uniting at the title screen, Rin and Megumi getting intimate with each other(not shown without uncensored patch) and Yasu and Naoko being alone together in Yasu's room. Sakura Petals when Rin and Megumi start to have feelings for each other to indicate the beginning of their new relationship and Timeless when Rin wakes up to find herself elsewhere after passing out and Yasu and Naoko are alone together in the cave are also highlight tracks for me.\n\nOverall, the game is recommended as a free-to-play visual novel for those who like a short romance tale with fan service and supernatural elements or for those who like a short game to finish and get all achievements in a few hours.\n\n[h1]Review with accompanying full gameplay video[/h1]\nhttps://www.sinicalanimenetwork.com/single-post/2018/01/19/Eternal-Hour-Golden-Hour-Review\n\n[h1]Game info page on Sinical Anime Network[/h1]\nhttps://www.sinicalanimenetwork.com/forum/visual-novel-jrpg-anime/eternal-hour-golden-hour\n\n[h1]Visual novel, JRPG, Anime Steam group[/h1]\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/vnislife", "timestamp_created": 1513140104, "timestamp_updated": 1516438155, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 58, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.854315", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38272285": {"recommendationid": "38272285", "author": {"steamid": "76561198199847150", "num_games_owned": 506, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513138135}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e8c\u5408\u4e00\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u767e\u5408\u5267\u60c5\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u5267\u60c5\u6709\u70b9\u4e00\u822c \u3002\n[spoiler] \u4e24\u4e2a\u5267\u60c5\u90fd\u662f\u8ddf\u5c71\u6d1e\u8fc7\u4e0d\u53bb\uff1f[/spoiler]\n\u503c\u5f97\u4e00\u73a9\uff0c\u5267\u60c5\u7684\u82f1\u6587\u8fd8\u662f\u6bd4\u8f83\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u57fa\u672c\u80fd\u61c2\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1513138809, "timestamp_updated": 1513138809, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38254376": {"recommendationid": "38254376", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110598762", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513076634}, "language": "french", "review": "Jeu avec de tr\u00e8s beaux graphismes et un tr\u00e8s beau chara-design, soign\u00e9 et travaill\u00e9.\nLes routes et les fins propos\u00e9es sont sympa et vari\u00e9es.\nPas de bug remarqu\u00e9 et possibilit\u00e9 d'avoir du contenu -18, que demander de plus ?

So after the crushing experience I had with DDLC I decided to play another VN with even more cheerful cover page to release the burden off my mind. \n\nGuess what. The first scene of the first story involve a deep story of a girl who lost her loved ones in a car accident. Took a deep sigh I pressed on. This game was able to actually turn my mood around quite effectively with two short 1.5 hour normal reading speed VN into quite happy ending for both. \n\nSemi mediocre story Scripts, Lovable character models, relaxing sound, beautiful scenery pages, fully voiced conversation with decent voice acting joined together into enjoyable prequel VN that\u2019s perfect for a quick mood swing. \n\nThere is a nude patch on internet that require google drive to download. (If you from china use VPN) It will add just 2 extra scene to the story with just a little fan service teaser.) \n\nFor Achievements it\u2019s all pretty straight forward. I followed my heart and got both good ending with semi obvious story choice route. Last achievement require you to get that nude patch to unlock.  \n\n8/10 and that\u2019s 3 hours of enjoyable VN reading experience. Big thumbs up for being free and good luck completing the main game.

I know this is only a prequel, but it felt pretty awkward to lay out the heavy emotions after simply something along the lines of \"we hung out every day for a month\".

Even someone who's lived near Birmingham his whole life can't. It does make me want to punch him in the face more, so it works I guess.\n[*] Tamiko is good.\n[*] Naoko sounds to me like she's pinching her nose all the time. Guess I have different tastes.\n[*] I think Daisuke needs a windscreen, but otherwise fine.

pleasant bonus)\nThe story is enjoyable for what it is and creates a level of intrigue.\n\nHowever, it only lasts an hour or so.\nAlso the choices have no major impact, unless you are one for achievements.\nI don't know how vital this will be to the story of Eternal Hour since it foreshadowed some time manipulating shenanigans, introduced a character that wasn't in the demo, and showed some rather short H-scenes.(Hit up 7th hearts twitter to get the patch)\n\nDespite all this, I'd give this a thumbs up. \nFor a kickstarter game, this was a nice bonus to have, and while a little underwhelming, it was a nice trip through.\nIt feels like a lot was missing and things happened really quickly, but that's to be expected in what is essentially Chapter 0/0.5 or prologue of Eternal Hour.\nThis along with the demo(which you can find on their kickstarter) should not be mistaken as the main dish, but they're worth a playthrough to find out if you'll enjoy Eternal Hour or to build up some hype.\n\ntl;dr score\n(Scoring based on MAL's standards, which are applicable to VNs oddly enough)\n \nStory: 7/10 Some intriguing events and character development, but lacks detail in plot relevant areas\n\nArt: 8/10 Good for a OEVLN, characters look appealing, backgrounds are okay and  the UI is neat\n\nSound: 7/10 Good atmospheric songs, none I'd add to my playlist, but gets the job done\n\nCharacter: 8/10 Quality waifus, enough said\n\nEnjoyment: 8/10 Short for my taste, good setup, didn't realize I'd enjoy a yuri story as much as I did and Naoko/Megumi are the GOAT.\n\nOverall

Leider muss ich das \"Spielen\" auf Morgen verschieben, da es nun schon etwas sp\u00e4ter ist, aber ich habe nun ein wenig mir das Spiel angeschaut. Und hier kann ich auch bevor ich es durch habe schon bewerten. Wie bei allen VN\u00b4s werde ich nichts zur Story sagen, aber hier gibt man keinen Cent aus, also sollte man es sich selber anschauen.\n\nViele Dinge haben mich schon ab den ersten paar Minuten schon \u00fcberzeugt ein Review zu schreiben. Bei kostenlosen Games schreibe ich sowieso normalerweise nichts negatives (bzw bewerte es nicht negativ). Kommen wir zu den Punkten die \u00fcberzeugen oder st\u00f6ren k\u00f6nnten.\n\n[b]Pro:[/b]\n+ Erfolge\n+ tolle Animationen und \"Grafik\"\n+ Sound ist sehr gut\n+ Sehr gut gedubbed\n+ englischer Dub (alle Personen)\n+ Story ist recht fesselnd\n+ uncut Patch\n+ free Game (+kostenlose Erweiterung au\u00dferhalb von Steam)\n\n[b]Contra:[/b]\n- Musik wirkt etwas fehl am Platz\n- beim Auto Modus sollte man nicht auf vollen Anschlag stellen, da es dann wie Skippen ist (ich habe es dort auf 3/4 da ich relativ schnell lese)\n\n\n[b]Fazit:[/b]\nZwar bin ich noch nicht weit, aber ich denke ich habe alles bis jetzt gesehen, um das Spiel bewerten zu k\u00f6nnen. Ich finde kostenlose Spiele sehr oft nicht interessant, aber Eternal Hour: Golden Hour hat mich sehr angesprochen. Nicht nur das es gut aussieht und das man merkt, dass hier jemand viel Liebe und Herzblut investiert hat, sondern auch eine recht packende Story. Zwar sind VN\u00b4s keine richtigen Spiele, aber auch keine B\u00fccher oder Filme sondern etwas von allem, was man hier auch merkt. Durch Animationen sind bewegte Bilder sehr sch\u00f6n anzusehen und der Dub l\u00e4sst einen auch zuh\u00f6ren und nicht nur lesen, wie bei vielen anderen VN\u00b4s.\nHier bereue ich es auf jeden Fall nicht, es mir angeschaut zu haben und es mir wahrscheinlich morgen, weiter zu \"spielen\". Ich kann nur jedem es empfehlen, wenn man auf dieses Genre steht.

Thus, on my second playthrough I made sure to pick the right dialogues to get the 'Best Ending' Achievement.\n\nI was very happy with Strings of Fate. The story was engaging and felt real. Getting to know how Rin feels about things made her feel like a real person could relate to her. It's a sweet love story between 2 young friends. Also the story sheds light on Yasu's character in a strong way, and it works very well in conveying emotion.\n\nOverall I very much recommend this game to anyone that enjoys Visual Novels, as well as touching, heartfelt stories.\n\nVisuals were very, stunning and beautiful.\nThe Soundtrack is calm, smooth and poetic in a way.\nThe Game was short-ish, but it's a prequel (and free) so there's no need to complain.\nYasu's Dialogue did seem a bit 'strange' if that makes sense, but it works; he's a nervous, young kid thrown into a whole new world.\nThe Rin's and Megumi's Dialogues were done well, and I enjoyed listening to them talk.\n\nIn the end, Eternal Hour: Strings of Fate gets a 9/10 from me.\n\nThank you for your hard work Seventh Heart Studios! And Congrats on making your project a reality!\n\n____________________________________________________________\n\nOk, now for my review of Eternal Hour: The Lost Date. Same as SoF, I did 2 playthroughs. First one to get the ending, and the second to get the 'Best Ending' (thus giving me all 6 Achievements, thanks to the H-Patch)\n\nAnyways, The Lost Date was very mysterious. The overall tone and atmosphere nailed it perfectly. The soundtrack helped drive the narrative home too. All of the characters were believable and I can relate to them personally. I can't say for sure if the game was shorter or longer than Strings, but the length felt good, it didn't drag, and I could not wait to see what was going to happen next!\n\nIt was very cute to see Yasu and Naoko and how they interacted and bonded, as friends. And how their relationship is strong and what it means to them. As well as how the understand their feelings for each other\n\nI'm really looking forward to the the final release of the game. I'm going to play the demo again a few more times after having now experienced the backstory for all of the main characters. I'm also going to come back to Eternal Hour: Golden Hour for a few more playthroughs as well. (maybe without the H-Patch)\n\nFinally the actual review from me is as follows\n\nVisuals again, very stunning and beautiful (especially the characters)\nThe soundtrack kept me feeling intrigued and mystified\nShort-ish length, but not a bad thing by any means\nAll the dialogues were very well done, (naoko being my favorite :p)\n\nI give Eternal Hour: The Lost Date 9.5/10\n\nAgain, Seventh Heart Studios, Thank you!

I'm a huge fan of Clannad Series but I barely know english and all the VN that I've played I can understand it cause they allow read till you decide to skip that dialogues, but not for this one\".\n\nRealmente soy un gran admirador de la serie animada Clannad que me encant\u00f3 pero soy algo nuevo en los juegos de VN. He estado jugando ultimamente este g\u00e9nero ya que me parece una genial idea que sigan haciendo juegos interactivos en el que puedas meterte en el papel del personaje y ver que es lo que deparar\u00e1 en la historia. Hace un a\u00f1o que sali\u00f3 este juego y pensaba revivir lo que esa serie me hizo sentir adquiriendo el producto mientras estaba en una gran oferta. El juego del que naci\u00f3 esta gran historia y aunque tambi\u00e9n me parecio mejor la serie de Side Stories y por ser m\u00e1s econ\u00f3mico que que la precuela decid\u00ed adquirir este juego, estaba mucho m\u00e1s barato que el original. Pero este producto no es lo que realmente dice ser. \n\nUn juego tipo novela visual que no fue hecho con el gran trabajo que se vio en la serie. S\u00e9 que son cosas totalmente diferentes pero \u00bfC\u00f3mo es posible que el producto original que tanto \u00e9xito tuvo no est\u00e9 a la par de su adapataci\u00f3n? Un juego que ni siquiera permite que el texto sea skipeado por nuestra propia cuenta? S\u00f3lo lo hace un poco incomodo y como hay que leer detalladamente por el idioma en ingl\u00e9s para entender bien y que se salte el texto autom\u00e1ticamente lo hace indisfrutable, no hay bot\u00f3n de atr\u00e1s para regresar el texto que no pudiste leer. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 se skipea autom\u00e1ticamente el texto? Aparte las imagenes recolocadas y al momento de que alguien est\u00e1 hablando debes reconocer de quien era esa voz si es que no las conoces por el anime, porque no hay un indicador que te diga de quien es el est\u00e1 hablando y hace que te despistes. Otra cosa... \u00a1Ni siquiera hay puntos de guardado! Solo puedes cambiar entre cap\u00edtulos pero no en la parte exacta donde lo dejaste. Pienso que toda VN deber\u00eda tener por obligaci\u00f3n estas opciones, ya que la mayor\u00eda est\u00e1n adaptadas de esta manera. M\u00ednimo si este juego tuviera cromos o logros como el Clannad original valdr\u00eda la pena la compra pero ni eso, lo compr\u00e9 en las ofertas pero me arrepiento de hacerlo, no he probado Clannad normal por lo que no s\u00e9 si tenga los mismos  detalles que este. He visto en la p\u00e1gina de la tienda que al menos aparecen los nombres y puedes leer a gusto el texto hasta que se te antoje, pero como no tengo el juego solo supongo. Estuve a punto de comprarlo pero si tuviera este mismo problema creo que saldr\u00eda arrepentido de igual manera. Solo esos defectos me permiten decir que a menos que arreglen ese problema lo comprar\u00eda sin dudarlo, pero si sigue as\u00ed prefiero gastar mi dinero en otras cosas, por m\u00e1s fan que seas y tengas ganas de revivir los recuerdos que alguna vez nos hizo sentir esta maravillosa historia, pero jugando esto no es la manera adecuada para hacerlo :'(.", "timestamp_created": 1515563580, "timestamp_updated": 1515564126, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38961870": {"recommendationid": "38961870", "author": {"steamid": "76561198578274097", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512793275}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u65e5\u8bed\u542c\u529b\u7ec3\u4e60\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u662f\u975e\u5e38\u597d\u7684\u756a\u5916\u5c0f\u8bf4\n\u4f46\u8fd8\u662f\u5e0c\u671b\u6709\u4e2d\u6587\uff0c\u65e5\u8bed\u4e5f\u597d\u3002\n\u4f60\u4eec\u5168\u662f\u82f1\u8bed\uff0c\u53eb\u65e5\u8bed\u751f\u548b\u6d3b\uff1f", "timestamp_created": 1514869750, "timestamp_updated": 1514869750, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38945060": {"recommendationid": "38945060", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103244168", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514829958}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4fe1\u4ef0\u4ee5\u5145\u503c\uff01\n-------------------\n\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u4e2d\u6587\nWe need Chinese\n\u4e2d\u56fd\u8a9e\u306f\u5fc5\u8981", "timestamp_created": 1514830086, "timestamp_updated": 1514830086, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38881730": {"recommendationid": "38881730", "author": {"steamid": "76561198185045182", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 554, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514751637}, "language": "english", "review": "The worst thing about this CLANNAD Visual novel is that it goes through the stories at it's own pace, you can't click through each section of text once you've read it.

down my favourite visual novel of all time, as I explained in my review of it, and after experiencing Clannad Side Stories, I can tell you that while it's not essential, it's a nice addition to the franchise.\n\nSide Stories is just that - little bonus stories that give you extra insights to the characters and main story.  Unlike regular visual novels, there are no choices or interactions to make.  It is like a kinetic novel set to auto mode, or even like watching a DVD - while all text is displayed, all characters are fully voiced and the story and speech advances by itself without you having to click through it, so literally no effort is required to enjoy this game.  You simply choose which story you want to watch, sit back and relax.  Each story is roughly around 20 minutes long, I'd say.\n\nThe stories are not totally groundbreaking in that they don't reveal any further big plot developments relating to the main story of Clannad, but they are enjoyable for several reasons.  Each one focuses on a different character, with some nice inclusions that aren't as widely covered in Clannad, such as Kappei Hiiragi and Toshio Koumura.  Some stories show exact events that happened in Clannad but told from another person's perspective other than Tomoya's, revealing previously unrealised feelings, and some show events that happened from before and after the Clannad main story that shed new light upon certain characters.  There's a particularly good pre-Clannad story for Akio Furukawa that shows a part of his personality we don't often see in Clannad.  Also, despite the fact that the Nagisa route is the main story in Clannad, some of these Side Stories embellish on other girls' routes, providing an alternative.  Girls such as Kotomi, the Fujibayashi sisters, Yukine and Tomoyo get a main feature and you can see new details and moments within each girl's relationship with Tomoya.  For comic relief, there's also a story exclusively told from the perspective of Kyou's pet, Botan!  It's hilariously adorable but also insightful and sweet.  And...  for Clannad fans who played all the way to the true end, I won't spoil, but...  there is a story pertaining to the post-game future of a certain very young person that is lovely to see... if you played the Clannad After Story, you'll probably know who I'm referring to.  The game is also heart-warming because of the return of visuals and scenes Clannad players know so well; the visuals are a little updated, with some really pretty character drawings, and the soundtrack, while also having a few updated versions of some songs, is the same, as well as the voice actors for everyone remaining the same, so there's a real air of nostalgia and familiarity to it.  Another detail I like is that in Clannad, as is the way with visual novels, Tomoya falls victim to the 'silent protagonist' curse, but in Side Stories, he is fully voiced, giving him an extra dimension.  His banter with Sunohara never fails to amuse.\n\nI can only fault the game's interface and functions in the way that the menus are a little lacking.  There is no save function, so if you leave a story in the middle, rather than saving the exact point you were up to, you must reload from the main menu and choose a chapter from that story to go from, so you have to kinda guess where you were up to.  However, despite this, since the stories are short enough, you probably won't need to stop in the middle.  The only other downside is that there is no option to exit the game from any menu...  alt+F4 it instead.\n\nAll in all, Side Stories is a nice experience, and while not essential, is a welcome expansion to the world of Clannad for big fans like me.  If you're new to the Clannad world, I wouldn't recommend playing Side Stories until you've played Clannad, as some of it won't make sense and the rest will spoil routes for you.", "timestamp_created": 1510968249, "timestamp_updated": 1510968249, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36496851": {"recommendationid": "36496851", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024423322", "num_games_owned": 549, "num_reviews": 95, "playtime_forever": 427, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510595707}, "language": "english", "review": "More of CLANNAD!

I was very excited to see that the side stories had finally been released in english because I've always been curious about them, there's so much content to expand upon from the original VN. I went into this right after my thid read of Clannad so that the story and characters would be fresh in my mind.\nI hated this. I only got through the first seven stories, but from what I've read the whole thing smells like a cash cow. There's no reason for any of these stories to exist, they don't add any depth to anything from Clannad and they aren't strong plotlines in their own right.

Stories in this collection are so short that even chapters are pretty much irrelevant as well.\nAlso, there are no CGs, so no music collection or anything like that.\nYou have to remember who is talking from voices, since there are no characters shown when someone is speaking.\n\nNow for the stories.\nThere are some funny stories. These are good for good laughs. But then there are serious stories... That are very harmed by their short length, because before you can get immersed in them, it's over. And then there are also some mediocre stories.\nThe last thing that hurts the story are inconsistencies between the main Clannad and the side stories. I have found a couple of inconsistencies that seriously harmed the rest from the pleasure I have had reading the stories.\nAlso, a new and unexpected feature, dubbed stories. Even though I don't hate dubbing, the way it has been implemented here is absolutely dreadful!\nI am very disappointed with the slow and zombie-like narration. It's absolutely annoying. Then there was this difference between Okazaki in Anime and Okazaki in this thing... I mean voice-wise. Pretty disturbing as well.\n\nAnd last but not least, the price. Clannad itself  is pretty expensive. But it's very valuable at the same time and it's worth even the full price. But this? For the price of 20\u20ac it's a total rip-off. I bought this on sale for 8\u20ac, but I got something I can pretty much throw into a trash bin after I read it, since the stories have no replay value.\n\nWould I recommend it? From 80% sale onwards only.", "timestamp_created": 1487358190, "timestamp_updated": 1487358190, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.399833", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29912943": {"recommendationid": "29912943", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067711932", "num_games_owned": 2156, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 19040, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502202053}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u56e3\u5b50 \u56e3\u5b50 \u56e3\u5b50 \u56e3\u5b50 \u56e3\u5b50\u5927\u5bb6\u65cf~\n\u30af\u30e9\u30ca\u30c9\u304c\u5927\u597d\u304d~", "timestamp_created": 1487039615, "timestamp_updated": 1487039615, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586441", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28910877": {"recommendationid": "28910877", "author": {"steamid": "76561198331894631", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 294, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492173444}, "language": "english", "review": "very good stories", "timestamp_created": 1483293428, "timestamp_updated": 1483293428, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.450281", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28882446": {"recommendationid": "28882446", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061338170", "num_games_owned": 142, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 774, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501036031}, "language": "english", "review": "+ Great OST (most of it is from the original so of course it's great)\n+ Short stories provide a unique experience that puts you in the shoes of the original Clannad cast (not just Tomoya, there are \"Side Stories\" for everyone, even Botan)\n+ Characters were mostly written very well, each one encompassing what made them great in the original story despite the game being written by various authors \n+ The use of sound effects was improved from the original game, very well timed and hilarious\n+ The stories have a wide range of emotions, the most prominent emotion being heartwarming\n+ Each story is 20 minutes, so it's very easy to play them sporadically since most of them aren't connected (besides the Baseball and Hot Springs story)\n+ They elaborate upon some of the \"mysteries\" of the original Clannad and provide answers to those mysteries in very subtle ways, evident in some of the routes if you pay very CLOSE attention to some of the character\u2019s surroundings\n- This wouldn't be as good of an experience if you didn't play the original prior, Kappei is a VN exclusive character and some plot points very largely unexplored in the original anime (sadly)\n- The lack of a Kyou After route really leaves a sour taste in my mouth, I would have also LOVED a route that involved Misae and Katsuki together in some form (preferably in the style of the Botan Side Story)\n- No SAVE function, you must play this game for 20 minutes no matter what and if you should leave, you must let the game REMAIN on if you don't want to lose progress\n- No CG gallery\n- The game is on Auto all the time, you don't click to progress, the game does it on its own, this is a bad thing if you want to rush a route          \n\nHonestly I'd give this game a 6/10 with only knowledge of the anime while an 7/10 with knowledge of the visual novel, I feel most of the routes despite being good aren't for everyone because they don't provide the same emotional heartbreak that the original provided. The technical flaws are also very noticeable as well as the lack of content (specifically the CG gallery) and the lack of more \"strong\" Side Stories feels like a big hit to what could have been a phenomenal love letter to all Clannad fans. This game is recommended if you played the original but if you're anime only, please play the original and come back to this, it's a worthwhile experience and elaborates upon a bunch of things that the anime didn't. I feel the Ushio route in this game is one of the best things to come out of the series, expertly well written and providing emotions that are extremely unique, putting you further into the mindset of a parent through Tomoya as he has to decide on whether or not he wants Ushio to \"leave\".

There's multiple discrepancies that don't line up with either of the canonical Clannad world, but if you're looking for a few more stories that you can consider optional endings (this is full of epilogues and prequels of stories you've made in the Visual Novel, [i]INCLUDING AFTER STORY[/i]. (you can see the names of each of the stories and their narrators in the game preview)\nSecond, it requires you to have already played the Clannad Visual Novel as it's designed for it, or at least have watched the anime, otherwise you won't have any background for the stories. (highly recommending the Visual Novel btw)\nNote that the first story is almost an exact duplicate of an OVA episode for the anime.\n\nIf you liked the Visual Novel, loved the series, and are looking for a bit more to fill your heart or the spaces for the stories, I recommend this. \nJust make sure to keep an open mind, [i]especially[/i] for Ushio's story.", "timestamp_created": 1478950247, "timestamp_updated": 1488115377, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26354132": {"recommendationid": "26354132", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065447079", "num_games_owned": 1957, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 351, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477909191}, "language": "english", "review": "CLANNAD Side Stories features 16 short episodic chapters on most of CLANNAD's diverse character cast. The stories are largely standalone, so while you don't necessarily need to have played CLANNAD to understand what's going on, personally I would still recommend playing CLANNAD first for maximum enjoyment.\n\nOn loading the game I immediately noticed a tremendous improvement in art quality. The CGs look absolutely stunning! If I'm not mistaken this had a different illustrator from the original CLANNAD game, but I must salute him/her for preserving the uniquely recognisable character designs of the game's heroines.\n\nIt is important to note that CLANNAD Side Stories has no save feature or skip function. Instead, you have to play through any one of the 16 episodes in a single sitting, hence I recommend only playing when you know you can have 20-30 minutes of uninterrupted gametime (each episode is about as long as your standard anime). \n\nA feature which I felt this game badly needed was a CG gallery, with all the brand new beautiful pictures of the CLANNAD girls.

game doesnt have achievements, but for anyone who has finished the main game or watched the show its realy entertaining. The voices are easy to tell appart and notice right away for anyone who liked the show at least, the art is simple but gives room for the player to still have some imagination influance over the game as if it was an actual book and the chapters can all be accessed in or out of \"order\" from the moment you download the game. Boton even has his own chapter which is ADORABLE btw. If you are a fan or the show Id for sure get it and if you played the game and liked it it'll be a nice continuation to the story looking back on the charactors through the start of the story.

Personally, it feels nostalgic to see Akio-san running with Sanae-san's bread, bullied Sunohara, and so on. Botan's side story is so puhi puhi~\n\nFor the background music, there is no new soundtrack introduced in this one. Nevertheless, it's Clannad-ish so you can expect the power of feels from listening to it.\n\nThe only drawback is you cannot control the game flow. Once the start button is pressed, you can only pause the game (by using right-click). It's kind of annoying that the subtitle is sometimes stuck because of long texts and you need to click on the screen to continue the subtitle while the narrative keeps playing in the background.\n\nIn short, \"Clannad Hikari Mimamoru Sakamichi de\" is one of the best collection of side stories out there. If you haven't checked the main Clannad VN, it's obviously suggested to read it before buying this one.

Sakamichi de (Clannad Side Stories) on the store page, and after a brief moment of incomparable excitement and a small amount of time to recompose myself I bought the game, now if you have seen my original review of [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/ALlEN_KlNG/recommended/324160/] Clannad [/url] you will most likely know I have a great deal of passion for this subject matter.....\n\nso I guess I'll preface this review the same way I did with the original Clannad VN, and this is by saying I maybe a tad bit bias in this as I absolutely love Clannad, I have the Manga, the Blurays, the 10th anniversary art book, so yeah just keep that in mind while reading this review, and try to forgive me ;)\n\nWell to start out I must say that Clannad Hikari Mimamoru Sakamichi de is very different from Clannad as unlike Clannad this is not an arc-choice based Visual Novel rather it is a collection of 16 short stories based around the characters both main and side from Clannad.\n\nThe game is not so much a side story serving more as a series of prequel / after stories; for Nagisa-chan, Fu-chan, Kyou-chan, Ryou-chan, Tomoyo-chan, Mei-chan, Botan and Akio-san just to name a few. \n\nAnyway let\u2019s talk about the game system: it\u2019s very distant from what Im used to when it comes to visual novels. It has a forced auto reader with no real way that Ive found to configure the speed which is rather bothersome.\n\nI have also not found a way to advance the story faster, or to go back to parts I might have missed; you can however jump between chapters which is very useful for going back to parts that you like and love rereading over and over *cough* Kyou-chan *cough* \n\n(>_>) \n(<_<)\n\n\u2026.....anyway there is also an option to check out all the CG's, which I believe is a must have in any visual novel, however the only downside I must say is that Clannad Hikari Mimamoru Sakamichi de does not have as many CG's as I would have like but this is mearly me nit picking as it is a easily overlooked thing.\n\nLength wise each story isnt very long clocking in at aproximatly 25 - 30 min give or take so yes they are not terribly long however you can not hold this against it because-\n\nA. they don't need to be any longer; they tell their story well in the period of time needed, any longer and the feel would be completely off, as if to make it worse by drawing it out.\n\nB. Clannad Hikari Mimamoru Sakamichi de was originally a PSP release so they could only do so much.\n\nAnd finally C. there are 16 beautifully written stories so the fact that each story is only around 25 - 30 min is quickly forgotten.\n\nNow onto the stories themselves, as I have said previously in my honest opinion I belive that each and ever story is beautifully written, unlike other VN short story collections, Clannad Hikari Mimamoru Sakamichi de is not just a collection of entertaining but ultimatly irrelevant stories.\n\nThe stories in Clannad Hikari Mimamoru Sakamichi de are definite additions to the character backgrounds and the history of Clannad itself, this helps build on the already well established origin stories of the characters that I had come to love.\n\nThe stories are at times fun, but also there are times that are touching, moving and sad, they shed light on intruiging aspects of the past and future of the various characters: how Kyou-chan and Ryou-chan fell for Tomoya-kun, how Akio-san and Sanae-san met, etc...etc... \n\nClannad Hikari Mimamoru Sakamichi de doesnt have to much CG as I said before but that is made up for with it being fully narrated and I mean every character, even Tomoya-kun....however much to my annoyance Tomoya-kun doesnt seem to be voiced by the same voice actor as the anime (while the original Clannad VN was fully narrated Tomoya-kun was not voiced)\n\nMusic wise Clannad Hikari Mimamoru Sakamichi de is the same as the original Clannad, so it\u2019s pretty good; actually now I think about it Clannad Hikari Mimamoru Sakamichi de reused a lot of assests from the original VN.\n\nIm not saying there isnt any original content but a lot of the scenes and music are from the original but that is to be exspected really if you take into consideration that they where making this for the PSP and they had the assests avalible to them so why not use them.\n\nOverall Id have to say that Clannad Hikari Mimamoru Sakamichi de is truly a worthwhile addition to the Clannad world; and my recommendation is to check it out, as someone who has completed the Clannad NV more times than Id care to say this was something that gave me a  more indepth look at the characterrs I love so much.\n\nI hope that this review has helped you in your decision in getting this VN and I hope you will enjoy the whole experience as much as I have, Clannad is my favorite subject and I could go on for hours about it; the Clannad anime is my favorite anime of all time, if you are so inclined I'd recommend you go check that out too.\n\nHappy reading :3\n\n(Like all my reviews I do not put a score as it is my belief that games like all forms of art are subjective and therefore it is impossible to afix a number to them)", "timestamp_created": 1465201030, "timestamp_updated": 1466207719, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 44, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.811100", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23409184": {"recommendationid": "23409184", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154545285", "num_games_owned": 314, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 851, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465051083}, "language": "english", "review": "CLANNAD Side Stories Official English Release, Published onto steam by Sekai Project and Developed by Key, who has also developed visual novels like Kanon, Air and Little Busters just to name a few. CLANNAD Side Stories is known as \uff23\uff2c\uff21\uff2e\uff2e\uff21\uff24 -\u30af\u30e9\u30ca\u30c9- \u5149\u898b\u5b88\u308b\u5742\u9053\u3067 in Japanese. It is originally released on PlayStation\u00aePortable in 2010, it combined the text of the respective novel published in 2005 and audio from the drama CD\u2019s published in 2007. Each story centers around a specific character from CLANNAD, from Nagisa to Yoshino, even including Kyou\u2019s pet, Botan. [Botan is pretty cute but not my favorite of the bunch] Each short story adds rewarding depth to the world of CLANNAD and its cast. A small note before I proceed this review will be slightly different from the other reviews as there will not be any score given. Relavent links can be found at the bottom of this review.\n\nDelve further into the world of CLANNAD and experience the stories beyond the original visual novel, there is a total of 16 side stories each lasting around 30 minutes that allows you to explore and experience new sides and twists to your favorite characters the whole game takes around 8 \u2013 10 hours for full completion. I will be honest here, I did like that it\u2019s a sound novel and the player cannot control the speed of the text and is forced to listen to the whole voice lines till the end. I read at an average speed but still I managed to finish reading the lines way before the voice lines stopped so that is just a small downside to it. But still an enjoyable experience as you can get to see more of CLANNAD characters from different perspective and situations.\n\nFrom 16 stories that it has to offer. My favorite of the bunch is provably story 15 \u201cTogether in a public bath\u201d. This story in particular has humor and sad moments, though the sad moments are fake because of a misunderstanding which was very funny because of the build up which leads to a series of events. Like Youhei Sunohara washing Akio Furukawa back at the public bath because he thought he was going to die and wants to spend his final moments with them. [Well that is what they thought] I could only imagine Youhei Sunohara embarrassment after he realize he looked like a total complete idiot.\n\n[h1]To Sum Up[/h1]\nWill I recommend CLANNAD Side Stories? Simple answer is yes. But I would highly suggest you to read through CLANNAD first so that you would get the rough idea of each character and you will get to know what are their connections they have with each other. Overall an enjoyable experience not to mention it is enhanced with beautiful illustrations by GotoP.\n\n[url=https://azusantiara.com/2016/06/06/clannad-side-stories-review/]Click here for review with

watched CLANNAD, so this is possibly a very unusual opinion which you should feel free to ignore if it doesn't seem to apply to you!)\n\nCLANNAD Side Stories, as the name might indicate, is very much targeted at people who have already read CLANNAD, and presents sixteen stories, each about 20 minutes long, which further expand on things not seen in the original novel, including getting to see things from the viewpoint of some of the main characters' parents. And, uh, a tiny pig.\n\nHowever, despite it being targeted at people who aren't me, I still found it was well-written, and there's a few stories that particularly jump out at me even now, several months later:\n\n05 (Tomoyo Sakagami - Me in those days): This involves a lot more heroic combat than I thought CLANNAD was about.\n07 (Botan - Various smells): This story, told from the perspective of an adopted pet pig, is incredibly adorable. The fact that I didn't know the characters did not detract from this at all, because small adorable animals are universal.\n08 (Akio Furukawa - A special night): One of the two stories that I really enjoyed, despite not knowing the characters going into this. It's about Nagisa's dad going out of his way to take care of a lost child on Christmas Eve.\n12 (Misae Sagara - The memory between the two of us): The other story that I really enjoyed. It's about Misae and Yusuke in high school. Yusuke kind of reminded me of Nekki Basara from Macross 7, which may have been why I enjoyed this one so much.\n\nThe only real problem I had with it is that the controls are terrible. Normally this would be an odd thing to bring up with a visual novel, but CLANNAD Side Stories is an adaptation of two drama CDs, so there's no ability to speed up or slow down the playback, only pause and skipping to one of five \"chapters\" for each of the sixteen stories. This is an understandable choice in that they were, as I understand it, designed to fit audio that was recorded three years before the original version of the game was created, including both background music and sounds, but it still makes it awkward if you read particularly quickly (as I do) or slowly, especially as opening the pause menu also removes the text from the screen.\n\nSo yeah, while I can't really speak to the experiences of a CLANNAD fan, seeing as I know almost nothing about the series, I still found parts of this an enjoyable read and think it would be significantly more enjoyable to someone who was already into the series. If you aren't a CLANNAD fan, I would not recommend this as your first entry into the series, however. I definitely had to look the characters up on Wikipedia a few times to understand some of the stories.", "timestamp_created": 1464896344, "timestamp_updated": 1464896470, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 38, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.657220", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23348576": {"recommendationid": "23348576", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012080668", "num_games_owned": 1566, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 495, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482245333}, "language": "english", "review": "Puhi Puhi~\n\nI finally have my own story, best expansion pack ever ^o^", "timestamp_created": 1464891757, "timestamp_updated": 1464892984, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 88, "votes_funny": 150, "weighted_vote_score": "0.622571", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23347890": {"recommendationid": "23347890", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030722073", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 302, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488568617}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u30b7\u30ca\u30ea\u30aa\u9078\u629e\u753b\u9762\u306e\u5f8c\u306b\u771f\u306e\u30bf\u30a4\u30c8\u30eb\u753b\u9762\u304c\u3042\u3063\u305f\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1464889108, "timestamp_updated": 1464889108, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515892", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23347355": {"recommendationid": "23347355", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995140839", "num_games_owned": 328, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 692, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465558784}, "language": "english", "review": "CLANNAD Side Stories, aka Hikari Mimamoru Sakamichi de, provides a refreshing new look at the characters of CLANNAD through a diverse range of perspectives not seen in the original story.

I've had to completely redo boss fights which can be pretty annoying since they are sometimes kind of long.  Best advice, save as often as possible.  I also got a black screen during certain cutscenes.  The scene still advanced and went back to the gameplay after it was done, but unfortunately I missed out on what I was supposed to be seeing.  Reloading seemed to fix this, and it didn't happen all that often.\n\nI like the story, but some of the characters kind of annoy me once in awhile.  Elena namely.  \n\nCombat is kind of cool, even by todays standards.  Turn based with a little bit of a twist.  You have your character perform an action, then he runs up to the enemy to make the attack (enemies do the same to you).  This adds a layer of strategy because if you perform your action at the right time, you can counter attack for extra damage, or even block at the last second if you won't be able to make it for the counter attack window.  You can also interrupt enemy actions as well.\n\nSpells come in the form of \"stones\"  kind of like materia in FF7.  Equip the stone you want to cast the spells you want that character to have.  These spells can also be upgraded as well as each characters skills.\n\nIt took me about 40 hours to complete which was normal for rpgs back then.  I didn't run into any side quests or end game content, so 35-40 hours is probably pretty normal.  So it's up to you to decide if the $20 price tag is worth it.  It's definitely not a lot, but you might still want to wait for a sale.\n\nI'd probably give this an 8 out of 10 because the story picks up in the last quarter of the game.", "timestamp_created": 1515701975, "timestamp_updated": 1515821452, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39254330": {"recommendationid": "39254330", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990928894", "num_games_owned": 428, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 456, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449345801}, "language": "english", "review": "played this shit on Dreamcast and Ps2 and it's a great JRPG.

Zudem ist es kaum n\u00f6tig, Stunden mit dem Leveln der Charaktere zu verbringen.

It has various technical improvements with keyboard & gamepad/controller support. I had a few crash issues and enemy actions not registering, but that was a rare occurrence throughout the game.

It was first released on the Dreamcast. The more accessible PS2 port was abysmal, known for crashing, and the PC port just wasn't well-received by PC gamers at the time. I was lucky enough to play the Dreamcast version, and I loved it. It was one of the first RPGs I ever completed (along with the similarly fantastic and overlooked Skies of Arcadia).\n\nHow does this hold up 17 years later? Surprisingly well!\n\nI'll start with my main criticisms.\n\nThe first thing it throws you into is an awful, dizzying camera that moves too fast when turned and zooms weirdly whenever you stop moving. The first short area of the game is the worst about this. Make it out of the first village, and you can take off your anti-seasickness wristbands.\n\nFor some reason, even in this shiny cleaned-up version of the game, where glitched spells have been fixed, nobody bothered to fix the mis-translated spell descriptions, so for your convenience, here is THE TRUTH: Freeze! Does not drop Action, it drops Movement. Cold does not drop Movement, it drops Action. Stram only negatively affects attack, not defense. \n\nThe writing quality is all over the place. I feel like the beginning of the game is really solid, and it sort of starts to come apart at the seams as it goes along. NPC dialogue didn't really get a dust-up, so sometimes NPCs will mention plot points you haven't even gotten to in the main story yet. Ryudo can go from casual speech to some sort of weird formal tone at the drop of a hat. The voice acting is impressive, especially for its time, but can get pretty corny. That said, I turned on the Japanese VA for the first half of the game, and it's cool to hear it, but I ended up really missing the voices I was familiar with, so I switched back. \n\nI love this game's story and characters, as goofy and melodramatic as they can be. I don't want to spoil too much for you, but expect a lot of talk about THE HEART and FRIENDSHIP and LOVE, to the point that it sounds like a parody of bad JRPG dialogue. Regardless, it is the earnest, loveable kind of cheesiness. \n\nThe BEST part of Grandia II is its battle system. It's not a traditional turn-based system; it's more of a modified ATB. When one of your characters reaches Command on the gauge, time freezes so you can choose what you want them to do. This gives you a lot of freedom. You could block or evade incoming attacks. Critical strikes (which you can do at any time) and certain super moves allow you to cancel enemy moves and send their icons flying back to the end of the queue. Some spells can affect how quickly you reach your turns. Distance and position are also factored into battle. AOE and line attacks are a staple. The more you upgrade your Mana Eggs and your super moves, the faster your characters will execute them in battle.\n\nI'll never understand why we didn't see more RPGs with battle systems in this vein-- it's infinitely more engaging than just taking turns, and it gives you a lot of strategic opportunities. Battles feel good to play. Unfortunately, at the time, it was stylish for RPGs to have really, really long animations for attacks and spells. Though the unnessecary length of spell/move animations can get a little old, for the most part, fights are punchy and exciting. If you want to challenge yourself a bit (since this game is pretty cheesable if you know what you're doing), see how many fights you can end without getting any of your party members hit.\n\nIf you're craving something with a really classic RPG feel, give this one a shot. It is flawed, but I think it's definitely worth the experience. It's too bad they never made any more Grandia games.\n\nNope. Shhh.

Ryudo, o protagonista mestre na arte da espada \u00e9 um mercen\u00e1rio que ganhava a vida com escoltas e contrata\u00e7\u00f5es de servi\u00e7os, at\u00e9 que conheceu Elena, uma \"irm\u00e3\" que foi criada em uma Igreja de certa divindade no mundo de Grandia. No in\u00edcio, a miss\u00e3o de Ryudo era escoltar Elena para que esta chegasse em outro vilarejo para dar maiores instru\u00e7\u00f5es a este povo sobre a amea\u00e7a do dem\u00f4nio Valmar que estaria sendo ressuscitado aos poucos e que a renascen\u00e7a dele traria o caos no planeta.\n\nBom, como em qualquer JRPG, a est\u00f3ria vai se desenrolando durante a jogatina, sendo que o jogador deve ir a diversos mapas e aumentando o n\u00edvel de seus personagens quando h\u00e1 v\u00e1rias cenas de luta, aliando tamb\u00e9m a aquisi\u00e7\u00f5es de novas armas, vestimentas, acess\u00f3rios e magias, aumentando os n\u00edveis de HP (life), MP (magia) e SP (especiais). Este \u00faltimo \u00e9 para os golpes especiais de cada personagem (equivale ao \"limit break\" de Final Fantasy VII). O jogo em si n\u00e3o \u00e9 dif\u00edcil de pegar as manhas e \u00e9 relativamente f\u00e1cil enfrentar os bosses, mas precisa ter um certo conhecimento e treinamento para aprender a utilizar corretamente cada tipo de magia, especiais e armamentos para n\u00e3o ser surpreendido. Al\u00e9m das magias, o jogador adquire itens que podem substituir os poderes das magias quando estas est\u00e3o indispon\u00edveis, como todo JRPG deve ser.\n\nGraficamente, Grandia II foi remasterizado, mas de forma bem sutil a ponto de ainda ter gr\u00e1ficos de PS2, por isso, n\u00e3o \u00e9 o destaque do jogo, apesar de v\u00e1rias cutscenes em CG. Personagens em formato \"chibi\" \u00e9 o tradicional desse tipo de game, portanto, nada de novidade. No som tamb\u00e9m n\u00e3o h\u00e1 melhorias significativas, mas a trilha sonora continua \u00f3tima, junto de cenas onde h\u00e1 falas em \u00e1udio (em ingl\u00eas ou japon\u00eas, cabe o jogador escolher no menu). Nem preciso dizer que as falas em japon\u00eas d\u00e3o um banho em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00c0s falas em ingl\u00eas, por isso, desde sempre jogue com \u00e1udio em japon\u00eas com letreiros em ingl\u00eas (em praticamente 100% dos casos quando h\u00e1 esse tipo de escolha em games)! O desfio de Grandia II n\u00e3o \u00e9 dos mais dif\u00edceis e o jogador consegue terminar sem precisar usar a grande maioria dos itens de das magias, mas conseguir\u00e1 terminar mais facilmente se souber as fraquezas dos inimigos usando as magias e os itens corretos (n\u00e3o apenas ficar em \"heal\" quando o HP do personagem est\u00e1 baixo ou usando um \"esuna\" para curar toda hora status negativo). O grande destaque \u00e9 a est\u00f3ria, mesmo ela sendo meio clich\u00ea. Os personagens s\u00e3o carism\u00e1ticos e envolventes.  Agora se voc\u00ea me perguntar, qual foi melhor: Grandia ou Grandia 2? Na minha opini\u00e3o, o antecessor ainda \u00e9 melhor, pois mesmo tendo gr\u00e1ficos de gra\u00e7\u00e3o anterior a do Grandia II, os personagens de Grandia I achei ainda mais carism\u00e1ticos que os de Grandia II. Mas nem por isso, seu sucessor n\u00e3o \u00e9 ruim, pelo contr\u00e1rio, continua bom.\n\nGrandia II foi um grande sucesso para sua \u00e9poca e seu relan\u00e7amento para Steam pode matar as saudades de um estilo tradicional de RPG que era gostoso de se jogar da \u00e9poca. Recomendado para os que curtem RPGS de v\u00e1rios tipos.\n\nochogeek.blogspot.com.br", "timestamp_created": 1500860525, "timestamp_updated": 1500860525, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33753929": {"recommendationid": "33753929", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063348341", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 24, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456679898}, "language": "english", "review": "fond dreamcast memories the music and gameplay is top notch one of the very best jrpg games i have ever played", "timestamp_created": 1500847518, "timestamp_updated": 1500847518, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33676626": {"recommendationid": "33676626", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128634660", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1993, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 184, "last_played": 1516215156}, "language": "english", "review": "My favorite game of all-time!\nI have so many fond memories playing this game while I was younger, and this edition does not disappoint.

I have played Grandia way back when, and although the sequel does not share any of the characters or the world, the art style and vibrant characters and environment do seem familiar - in a good way! \n\nSo, what is it about this game that makes it so that months after putting it down, it is a game I look back on with misty eyes and a headful of fun memories and wish there were more out there like it? \n\n[h1]Let's see now...[/h1] \n\nYou play as Ryudo, a bounty-hunter of a sell sword who will lend his blade for some coin (or free food, at times!). Now this guy, for me, he single-handedly raised the game from a pleasant experience to a hilarious one! Unlike your typical helpful hero, Ryudo always had a sarcastic remark waiting to be sprung and was more than happy to tell you what was on his mind! Whilst, this could have created a rather annoyingly obnoxious character, it did the opposite. I appreciated the honesty in his amusing quips, he did not care if you were the Pope or the princess, he was going to tell you exactly what he thought of you! He seemed to have little patience for children too, but let's be honest, who does? I'll come to some quotes from him a little later, it is best seen for yourself! \n\nA few other things worth mentioning: \n\n[h1]The visuals[/h1]\n\nIt was easy on the eyes. Unlike some games I have played, whereby the blandness and greyscale worlds are literally seeping out my soul, Grandia 2 was vibrant, it was alive, it had locations where I was happy to prance about and look for things to kill. Granted, I always spent a little too long in the towns looking for people to annoy/houses to loot! So many pots to overturn!\n\n[h1]The cast[/h1]\n\nThe characters were interesting, well written and brought to life with some great voice acting. The ever- changing expressions on their dialogue reels were a nice touch too, Ryudo could go from looking very annoyed, to being dumbfounded, with the expressive imagery. A nice little touch taken from the original game.\n\n[h1]The combat[/h1]\n\nThe combat, in my opinion is what most players will remember the game for. It does away with the random monster encounters, with the enemies visible in the world around you, giving you the option to sneak behind them for a surprise attack or... sneak by them entirely if you were not feeling the need to bloody your sword! When you are wanting to battle, you will have the ability to move your characters around the battlefield, set up attacks and abilities in such a way that you are able to interrupt or counter-attack foes \u2013 this is incredibly satisfying! To control the combat in such a way, meant you were almost always able to render some enemies useless! There is also no end of abilities, magic and special moves that you can unlock through experience gain.\n\n[h1]Summarisations![/h1]\n\nIn short, I cannot recommend Grandia 2 highly enough. It has everything I love in a game and then some. The combat system and memorable cast of characters alone is a good enough reason for me to buy you all a copy! But I can't! Because, money and stuff! So, if you need any further reason to buy the game, I'll leave you with some quotes from the delightful Ryudo: \n\n[b]His thoughts on lard-butts:[/b]  \n\n[i]Ryudo: And I don't quite get this \"blessing\" stuff. That one  lard-butt looked pretty damn blessed to me. About two hundred pounds more blessed than anyone else around here.[/i] \n\n[b]His idea of fun:[/b] \n\n[i]Ryudo: If your idea of fun is wading through rivers of blood, gobbets of flesh and gut fresh upon your lips, then yes, it will be fun.[/i] \n\n[b]His thoughts on kids joining the party:[/b] \n\n[i]Ryudo: For now. But, if you slow us down or just piss me off, your butt will be skipping down Lollipop Lane on its own.[/i] \n\n[b]When dealing with NPCS:[/b] \n\n[i]Ryudo: Cheerful folk. But, if I listened to every piece of good advice I heard, I'd have killed all of you already and run off with your gold.[/i] \n\n[b]His stranger danger warning:[/b] \n\n[i]Ryudo: Elena, don't talk to strangers. Besides, they could be diseased.[/i] \n\n[b]His use of the word 'gumshoe':[/b] \n\n[i]Ryudo: Whoa there, gumshoe! I don't recall \"hunting down reawakening God of Evil\" as being part of my job description.[/i] \n\n[b]And he just loves kids:[/b] \n\n[i]Ryudo: Kid, there's going to be ONE wandering spirit here real soon if you don't learn how to keep your mouth shut.[/i] \n\n[b]When being referred to as 'his kind':[/b] \n\n[i]Ryudo: \"My kind.\" Right. I'll just sit over here and think filthy, unclean thoughts, then.[/i] \n\n[b]No bake sales? Aww!:[/b] \n\n[i]Ryudo: Hey! HEY! Princess!

Often times there are 6 or more enemies to face in a single fight, and the starting \"turn\" order is randomized, which means that the same fight can play out in many different ways. While you're not really threatened with death outside of a boss battle, the distance between save points can be kind of long. This means you don't want enemy damage to add up, so you'll want to end fights as quickly and safely as possible. This means you'll make interesting decisions between canceling the opponents turn or spending MP or SP to use more powerful attacks. When you time your cancel after the opponent has chosen their next attack, but before the attack comes out, you cancel the entire attack completely, which is increadibly satisfying. \n\n\n[h1] The Story  [/h1] (spoilers, obviously)\nSome people might find the plot to be sort of generic for a JRPG, but the characters are memorable and feel grounded and realistic. Without spoiling much, it has a similar vibe to Super Mario RPG, as a \"roadtrip plot\" where you meet interesting characters and learn about the world along the way to a distant destination. The best part, in my opinion, is when your characters sit around a dinner table and somewhat-organically discuss their thoughts on recent events. This gives the characters a chance to \"respond\" to the plot in a way so many Japanese games/anime lack (outside of mid-battle sermons and internal monologues) and it builds a believable friendship among the cast.\n\n[h1] The Port  [/h1]\nWorks good. Some UI elements like the Save menu that's been adapted for PC look a bit simple, but function perfectly. The textures are clear, and despite it's age, the stylized and colorful art design has aged gracefully, for the most part. The addition of a \"hard mode\" is greatly appreciated, though it's still not very challenging outside of boss battles. I haven't done any A/B comparisons to see what's changed in the Hard Mode, if anyone knows, please let me know.

It was originally released for the Dreamcast and then ported to the Playstation 2. The DC version was better, as the PS2 had some really bad slow down. But none the less, it is a great JRPG.\n\nThe sequel to the original Grandia, this time the story follows Ryudo, a Geohound (Mercenary). Ryudo is hired to escort a young priestess, Elena, to the holy capitol, however, adventure ensues. The story is pretty good, with plenty of interesting characters as well as character development over its 50+ hour game length.\n\nThis being an RPG and all, the battle system is quite unique. Enemies are seen on the field before being encountered, and thus can be avoided. Once a battle starts we're treated to the action bar. The action bar, in the bottom right corner of the screen, shows the player characters as well as the enemies. When the head icon gets to \"Act\" that character or enemy can.....act. The player is given the choice of combo, critical, items, magic or special attacks. Each character is given unique special attacks and can equip an item called a \"mana egg\" to use magic. Special attacks and magic can be used in different ways, they can hit a line in front of the charcter, a circle around them or an enemy, all or one enemy. The most interesting aspect of the combat is the ability to \"cancel\" an enemies move. Using the critical option or a special move with the \"cancel\" effect, the player can stop an enemy from using a special attack or magic. This causes battles to be more strategic, if you see an enemy beginning a powerful spell, cancel it!\n\nThe player has levels, as is typical of an RPG, but gets special and magic coins. These coins can be used to increase and unlock special attacks and magic as well as power them up. The player may also equip special books onto the party, increases certain statistics (IE Strength, Intelligence etc.) These may also be powered up with special coins.\n\nThe story is pretty good, with fully voiced cutscenes and humorous dialogue to boot. The characters grow plenty during the story, and its impressive to watch. There are also a few twists that I will not reveal. However, the game is rather linear, with very little in the way of sidequests or additional content. Still, that shouldn't stop anyone from playing this game.\n\nA classic sort of JRPG, and from a forgotten series, Grandia 2 has some faults. The graphics have not aged well, even though its been updated, it still doesn't look great. However, a lot of the magic abilites use anime-style animations, so they still look great. The lack of exploration and the linearity reduce it's overall replay value. While there are interesting characters, the party only ever consists of 4 at a time, you never get to select your party members.\n\nAnyone whose anyone can probably remember Grandia, the lost little RPG. This series has been lost for a while, and it's great to see that Square placed it onto Steam for more people to actually play it. Hopefully this means we can get some more Grandia games. Grandia was a great series, the battle system is unique and interesting, and the character development overall the series is spectacular.

Normally I would detail each and every aspect of the gameplay that I liked, however I would give all aspects: gameplay, battle system, characters, storyboard,audio- a solid A. I did experience some faults in the text log where there was a lag between what was being said and the time taken for it to be written, but that was just a minor for me and it did not hinder my gameplay.\n\nMy last comment is simply this: Humanity's strength lies within our innate altrusim and resilience to hardships and the cruelty that we often time experience as we go through this journey called life. The search for a deeper meaning for our lives and purpose often leads us to search for the 'other', but the message in this game does reinforce something we often forget....no man is an island, no man stands alone...we are powerful in numbers.\n\nHappy playing", "timestamp_created": 1493518791, "timestamp_updated": 1494135421, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528886", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31410938": {"recommendationid": "31410938", "author": {"steamid": "76561198349919604", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5949, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1515995581}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u7ecf\u5178\uff0c\u7ae5\u5e74\u56de\u5fc6\uff0c\u5feb\u70b9\u51fa\u4e2d\u6587\u7248\u672c\u3002\u6ca1\u4e2d\u6587\u597d\u96be\u53d7\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1493366222, "timestamp_updated": 1493366222, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.627329", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31377058": {"recommendationid": "31377058", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025022076", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3513, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482113153}, "language": "english", "review": "A classic from the under-appreciated Dreamcast.

In a way, this game is a bit similar to Final Fantasy 5: the battles and gameplay mechanics are the star of the show while the story more or less takes a backseat (though Grandia 2's story isn't as painfully generic as FF5's).\n\nThis game takes real-time combat based on a single time bar everyone shares, and makes it turn-based. Attacks and spells (mostly) have a charging time, and you can cancel any enemy's attack with a critical hit at the right time. Other attacks and spells will stagger the enemy's time bar/animation, so battles have a nice interactive dynamic where you can affect what the enemies are able to do, and they don't just churn out spells all the time regardless of what you do.\n\nI can't say anything else other than the gameplay is really satisfying. More JRPGs should do this, as it's a great marriage of turn-based combat on a real-time field, that doesn't compromise by forcing you to play only one character while the AI controls the rest of your party, or other things I've come to despise in \"modern\" JRPGs.\n\nThere are some downsides like not being able to skip spell animations and reliance on AOE damage later on, but overall, Grandia 2 is the most fun I've had with a JRPG in quite a while.

I thought that playing this version would be like playing it the way it was intended on its original platform, but this is not quite the case. The game will either crash to desktop randomnly, or hang when trying to enter different locations in the game even with the latest 1,07 patch, and all the possible updates, including my graphics card. I have contacted GungHo technical support twice about this issue with no answer. This is unacceptable. I paid good money for this game, and considering that not only do I have a very powerful PC with all the required updates, this should run just fine, but it does not. I might as well juist play my PS2 copy of the game, or track down a Sega Dreamcast and pay a fortune to play the game the way its intended to be played. This is the worst port I have ever came across on PC. If you want to play this game, do yourself a favor and play this on the PS2, or if you really feel adventureous, track down a Sega Dreamcast with a copy of this game. Whatever you do, don't waste your money on this poor excuse of a port. \n\nUPDATE: I understand that many of you will disagree with my review, but be aware that I have tried everything under the sun from running as administrator to tweaking with my graphic cards settings as I have been suggested by support, and it will still crash. I have forwarded my Dxdiag to GungHo, and even they said that there is not a problem with my system. So, if the problem is not with the system it is obviously the port. I even re-installed it multiple times to no avail. I really wanted to enjoy the port, and the upgrades it had to offer from an increased frame rate without even checking the 60 FPS box to the amazing addition of Japanese audio. Even with these features added, a broken game is a broken game. I tried hard to like it, but the crashes every 5-10 minutes or even 2 hours if I'm lucky destroys the experience for me. I'm saddened it has come down to this. If you still disagree with me, that is fine, you are all entitled to your opinions. I just wish I would have been able to enjoy an enhanced edition of the game without all of these game-breaking problems.

V\u00e9ritable ode \u00e0 l'aventure, le jeu proposait de suivre des personnages attachants dans leurs aventures, avec un esprit enthousiaste et optimiste que l'on retrouve encore aujourd'hui dans pas mal de mangas (comme One piece par exemple). Les 90's dans toute leur saveur.\n\nGrandia II sorti en 2000 sur Dreamcast puis PS2, propose une intrigue plus grave et m\u00e9lancolique. L'histoire se d\u00e9roule dans un monde sauv\u00e9 mais meurtri par la victoire Granas, dieu de la lumi\u00e8re sur Valmar, son pendant obscur. De profondes cicatrices entaillent ainsi les continents et les oc\u00e9ans. Malgr\u00e9 ces divisions ses habitants m\u00e8nent leurs existences avec plus ou moins de facilit\u00e9, se tournant pour la plupart vers le culte de Granas.\n\nRyudo, mercenaire chasseur de monstres, n'a que faire des bondieuseries et va de ville en ville pour gagner sa vie, jusqu'\u00e0 ce que son chemin croise celui d'Elena, une cantatrice de Granas, dont le caract\u00e8re est diam\u00e9tralement oppos\u00e9 au sien.\n\nVous l'aurez compris le th\u00e8me central du jeu est la croyance et son impact sur le libre arbitre. Pendant leurs p\u00e9rip\u00e9ties les personnages seront r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement confront\u00e9s au doute ou \u00e0 des personnages ayant succomb\u00e9 \u00e0 leurs d\u00e9mons (litt\u00e9ralement). Malgr\u00e9 le pitch apparemment simple (un combat entre la lumi\u00e8re et les t\u00e9n\u00e8bres, on a fait plus original), l'histoire s'en tire assez bien et fait progresser tous ses personnages. Mention sp\u00e9ciale pour le duo Ryudo / Elena, que l'adversit\u00e9 va finir par rapprocher. Grandia II est un des Jrpg qui selon moi propose un des meilleurs d\u00e9veloppement de ses personnages.\n\nAussi cette empathie se d\u00e9veloppe gr\u00e2ce aux tr\u00e8s, tr\u00e8s nombreux dialogues pr\u00e9sents dans le jeu. Leur \u00e9criture est excellente, mais leur quantit\u00e9 d\u00e9couragera le joueur peu patient. La ran\u00e7on d'une implication \u00e9motionnelle peu commune dans un jeu. Le jeu n'\u00e9tant pas traduit en fran\u00e7ais actuellement, un bon niveau d'anglais est recommand\u00e9. Personnellement en 2000 j'y jouais avec le Hachette - Oxford sur les genoux. =)\n\nJrpg oblige, il me faut aborder le syst\u00e8me de combat et de progression des personnages. Les Grandia sont souvent reconnus par les amateurs de Jrpg comme un des, sinon LE meilleur(s) syst\u00e8me(s) de combat du genre. Et c'est d'autant plus frustrant de voir ce style si peu repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 dans le genre actuellement.\n\nLes combats se d\u00e9roulent dans des \"ar\u00e8nes\" o\u00f9 les personnages peuvent se d\u00e9placer (pas comme un FF \u00e0 l'ancienne en sorte). L'ordre des actions des alli\u00e9s ou des ennemis est donn\u00e9 par une jauge de temps commune. Arriv\u00e9 en temps de commande vous pourrez :\n- Attaquer ou tenter un Cancel (annuler l'attaque d'un adversaire avec un bon timing).\n- Changer de position pour \u00e9chapper \u00e0 un ennemi ou adopter une posture d\u00e9fensive.\n- Caster un des nombreux sorts du jeu ou des mouvements sp\u00e9ciaux uniques au personnage.\n- Utiliser un des nombreux objets offensifs ou d\u00e9fensifs, ou encore changer d'\u00e9quipement.\n\nLe panel des possibilit\u00e9s donn\u00e9es au joueur est donc tr\u00e8s large, et si vous vous en emparez, en g\u00e9rant m\u00e9ticuleusement votre timing et votre placement, vous aurez une bonne ma\u00eetrise du champs de bataille. [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxM9S0ZK2bs]>> UN EXEMPLE DE COMBAT ICI <<[/url]\n\nAssociez \u00e0 cela la possibilit\u00e9 de faire progresser de fa\u00e7on tr\u00e8s permissive les personnages et de pouvoir remanier leurs caract\u00e9ristiques assez facilement, d\u00e9multipliant les possibilit\u00e9s de build. Vous pourrez ainsi cr\u00e9er un Ryudo courant \u00e0 200 \u00e0 l'heure capable de voler au secours de ses alli\u00e9s ou d'annuler en urgence une attaque d\u00e9vastatrice, un Mareg encaissant une quantit\u00e9 incroyable de d\u00e9g\u00e2ts, ou un Roan castant des sorts d\u00e9vastateurs se t\u00e9l\u00e9portant en cas d'urgence.\n\nSi les combats sont globalement dynamiques, on peut regretter, un peu \u00e0 l'instar des tr\u00e8s longues phases de dialogue, qu'ils soient hach\u00e9s par les cin\u00e9matiques assez longues des sorts alli\u00e9s comme ennemis. On se retrouvera souvent \u00e0 vouloir \u00e0 tout prix cancel un sort ennemi non pas pour en \u00e9viter les d\u00e9g\u00e2ts, mais pour s'\u00e9pargner une poign\u00e9e de secondes de combat ! Certains aimeront cette mise en sc\u00e8ne, mais pour moi c'\u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 en 2000 une source de frustration.\n\nLes phases d'exploration sont quant \u00e0 elles un des points faibles du jeu, les \u00e9nigmes propos\u00e9es manquant soit d'originalit\u00e9 soit de clart\u00e9. Heureusement vous serez guid\u00e9s par une boussole pour vous orienter. L'int\u00e9r\u00eat de Grandia II de ce c\u00f4t\u00e9 est regrettablement limit\u00e9 selon moi. Certains joueurs pourront \u00e0 juste titre se plaindre de la lin\u00e9arit\u00e9 de l'histoire (effectivement il n'y a aucune qu\u00eate secondaire pour gonfler la dur\u00e9e de vie), mais je consid\u00e8re que les RPG n'ont pas tous besoin d'en proposer.\n\nTechniquement le jeu est toujours assez beau. Le style de la direction artistique a beau avoir vieilli, cette \u00e9dition \"anniversaire\" permet d'afficher le jeu en haute d\u00e9finition et surtout en 60 images par seconde, rendant les combats particuli\u00e8rement agr\u00e9ables \u00e0 l'\u0153il. Le jeu est globalement stable (quelques tr\u00e8s rares ralentissements et  un retour windows sur 34h de jeu environ) et respecte le format 4:3 d'origine. Elle vaut clairement son prix.\n\nDernier point, et non des moindres, la bande - son du jeu est m\u00e9-mo-rable et se paye le luxe de donner dans une grande diversit\u00e9 de styles :\n-  Des compositions au synth\u00e9 / percu / guitare \u00e9lectrique dans un style \"tr\u00e8s anime 90's\".\n[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDcE2RvD5gg]>> ICI <<[/url]\n- Des cantiques \u00e0 une ou plusieurs voix accompagn\u00e9s d'instruments \u00e0 corde ou \u00e0 vent.\n[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYIDqzTt0w4]>> ICI <<[/url]\n- Des duos au piano et au violon pour les moments plus graves.\n[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h8-oNY3fe0]>> ICI <<[/url]\n- Des morceaux joyeux et rythm\u00e9s par une fl\u00fbte de pan, un violon, et des percussions entre autres.\n[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaVvNERzNXA]>> ICI <<[/url]\nDu bonheur pour les oreilles et le cerveau =)\n\nGrandia II est donc d\u00e9finitivement un grand RPG, qui m\u00e9rite qu'on s'y arr\u00eate, mais qui pr\u00e9sente malheureusement quelques aspects pouvant rebuter le joueur s'y confrontant la premi\u00e8re fois. Il sera grandement appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 par les fans de JRPG et gardera \u00e0 coup s\u00fbr chez eux une place de choix dans leur m\u00e9moire. Ayant rencontr\u00e9 un certain succ\u00e8s d'estime aupr\u00e8s de la presse et des joueurs, l'absence de traduction fran\u00e7aise et sa rigidit\u00e9 l'auront malheureusement condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 une renomm\u00e9e amoindrie.

Warum habe ich es so oft gehabt? Das lag daran, dass ich es auf keinem System bisher durchgespielt habe. Entweder ging die 2 CD verloren, oder die Dreamcast wurde eingetauscht (Ja, ich wei\u00df, Schande \u00fcber mich).\n\nNun ist es aber geschafft und war es den Kauf wert? Jein.\n\n\nSpielmechanik\n Hier gl\u00e4nzt das Spiel und hier beginnt mein Vergleich mit FF XIII. Beide haben eher ein schlauchartige Levelstruktur, aber Grandia II hat mehr Explorationsm\u00f6glichkeiten ohne das Spiel unn\u00f6tig in die L\u00e4nge zu ziehen. Es sind kleine Weggabelungen, nur leicht versteckte Extrar\u00e4ume, die aber alle in ein kurzen Zeit auffindbar sind, wenn man sich nur ein Hauch daf\u00fcr interessiert. Jemand der Open-World- Spiele satt ist, kann hier Erholung finden.\n\nDas Kampfsystem ist rundenbasiert, hat aber einen guten Kniff, man kann gegnerische Angriffe unterbrechen, Gegner in der Vorbereitungsphase zur\u00fcckwerfen, gegnerischen Angriffen ausweichen und hat noch weitere M\u00f6glichkeiten auf die Gegner zu reagieren. F\u00fcr ein rundenbasiertes Spiel hat man damit eine viel h\u00f6here Reaktionsbandbreite als bei andere Genrevertretern. Dennoch hat man volle Kontrolle \u00fcber alle Charaktere, nicht so wie in FF XII. Da gibt es nur \"Phasenverschiebung\". \n\nZufallsk\u00e4mpfe? Kein Problem, die Gegner sind alle sichtbar und umgehbar (au\u00dfer Bosse). Wenn man sie von hinten \u00fcberrascht, ist man im Vorteil. Dies gibt es auch bei FF XIII, aber die Areale sind in Grandia II gr\u00f6\u00dfer, man kann sich hinter einer S\u00e4ule \"verstecken\" (besonders in der Special Stage n\u00fctzlich) und den Gegner an einen vorbeiziehen lassen. \n\nF\u00e4higkeitensystem\n\nWer FF VII mochte, der wird auch bei Grandia II einen guten Zugang finden. Anstatt, dass jeder Charakter eine spezifische Klasse besitzt, kann man sie mit einem gewissen \"Zauberei\" (ja die hei\u00dfen so, also \"Eier\") ausr\u00fcsten. Unterst\u00fctzereier, Schadenseier, Wald,- Wiesen,- Feuer,- Eis-Eier. \nZu den Eiern gesellen sich dann sogenante \"Skils\". Diese sind passiv, wie mehr HP, MP, Ausweichchance, die M\u00f6glichkeit mit magischen Angriffen Mana zur\u00fcckerstattet zu bekommen, bessere Beute finden etc. Skillung mit Substanz (Jeder, der das versteht, darf sich auf die Schulter klopfen).\n\nDie Charaktere steigen nat\u00fcrlich auch Stufen und es lohnt sich nat\u00fcrlich die F\u00e4higkeiten je nach Charakterst\u00e4rke zu verteilen.\nEs gibt auch Spezialattacken. Jeder Charakter lernt nach einiger Zeit ein, oder mehrere dazu. Dies h\u00e4ngt aber nicht vom Level ab, sondern vom Fortschritt in der Geschichte.\n\nGrafik/Sound\n\nGrafisch ist Grandia II zwar stimmig, aber l\u00e4ngst kein Augenschmaus mehr. Die Zauber sind zwar teilweise nett animiert, aber man merkt hier die mangelnde Nachbearbeitung. Manche k\u00f6nnten es sogar abschreckend finden, dass sich Zauberanimation und Welt vom Grafikstil teilweise stark unterscheiden.\n\nDer Sound ist nicht besonders. Die Sprache geht in Ordnung. Millenia ist gut vertont, Roan ist nicht die nervige Variante von Hope. Nur Elena h\u00e4tte hier und da noch ein bisschen mehr Stimmung vertragen k\u00f6nnen, aber naja FF XIII hat Vanille. \n\nGeschichte\n\nHier harkt es. Ich meine, hier \u00e4hneln sich FF XIII und Grandia II sehr, auch FF X hat Ans\u00e4tze davon. Was ich pers\u00f6nlich davon halte, sage ich am Ende.\nPositiv, sogar sehr positiv, finde ich die kleinen Geschichten, die sich zwischen den Charakteren widerspiegeln, bzw. wenn man sich Zeit nimmt, mit all den Bewohner der Welt von Grandia II. Es lohnt sich, mehr als einmal mit den Bewohner zu reden, in jeder Stadt mal ein Abendessen im Gasthof zu genie\u00dfen und zuzusehen, wie sich Rydou und Sky gegenseitig necken und die arme Elena mit ins Boot ziehen. Teilweise liebenswerte Nebencharaktere wie die Chaos-Schauspieltruppe rund um Gonzola (Hie\u00df der so?)\n\nSo, nun zur Hauptgeschichte, Vorsicht Spoiler\n\nSPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER\nSPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER\nSPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER\n\nWie in FF XIII und gef\u00fchlt in vielen anderen japanischen Rollenspielen (und Animes) wird hier wieder die Kirche als \"B\u00f6sewicht\" herangezogen (sie Nazis in fast jedem zweiten Shooter). Nun das ist ok, weil Japaner ihre Ideologie in ihren eigenen Spielen gerne implizieren k\u00f6nnen (Siehe Maregs Lehren. Diese wurde entgegen aller anderen Meinungen nicht in Frage gestellt, sowie dass das \"letzte\" Lied, dass dem Stamm Maregs entstammt). \nUnd ja es ist popul\u00e4r, schon seit Jahren, die \"Folge deinem Herzen\" - Melodie zu spielen. Gott gibt es nicht, der Mensch ist sein eigener Herr. Und doch ist es ja gerade jene Ideologie, die ihrer eigenen Lehre (Der Mensch soll sich nicht zu einem Gott erheben etc.) widerspricht. Denn der Mensch macht sich selbst zu Gott, weil er sich selbst \u00fcber alles andere stellt und ehrt sich mit jeder Besch\u00e4ftigung, die seinem Herzenswunsch entspricht (\"Ich tu das f\u00fcr mich\" Rydou). Also verehrt der Mensch keinen Gott, aber sich selbst. \nHier w\u00e4re eine Differenzierung angebrachter. Man mag an Gott glauben, oder nicht. Das muss jeder selbst f\u00fcr sich gut argumentieren k\u00f6nnen, doch muss sich dieses Spiel die Kritik gefallen lassen, dass es sich hier widerspricht. \nEinerseits sagt es: Wir bauchen keine G\u00f6tter und der Mensch soll sich nicht zu Gott erheben. Anderseits macht jeder Mensch sich mit der \"Ich-mich-meiner-mir\"-Ideologie des \"Herzens\" selbst zu (s)einem Gott.

If I miss something/some correction about the later game (If my hours are <30 and I have not said anything about a common lategame error or something, assume I haven't reached it) then my background/statement was in regards to the Dreamcast version. \nBUT, playing it now as an adult most of the same feelings are the same so not really much of a nostalgia warning/nostalgia goggles view.\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nWell aged JRPG, still fun. Still has great music, characters, combat system, and story. (Results may vary [hueheuhue])\n\nIf you can tolerate this era of JRPG story that lays the religion on thick then by all means play it.\nThe gameplay is the thing that still stands out the most. Certain characters may take a while to shine/become likeable. But character development happens in huge chunks at a time. There's no slow methodical thought process analysis or anything. It's a fast game anyway; It's extremely linear with no optional bosses, post game, or much reason to grind. You'll blow through it in about 30-40 hours with no grinding. (For an RPG that's basically the minimum amount of hours).\n\nIt has SUB AND DUB FOR ALL TASTES. (English and Japanese VOs).\n\nThe game's not very difficult so long as you know the mechanics/to actually level up your skills/stats(Skill book buffs if what I mean)/eggs. I remember there being two difficulty barriers: Eye and horns. But the eye didn't give me issues on this run (at all), HOWEVER that's probably because I know how to actually fight it.\nSo if you get stuck on either, don't expect the game to be bone breaking on any other occasion.\nI'm not going to spoil any \"strats\" or anything (ofc).\n\nThe story doesn't really pick up til later but it's more of a good plot as I recall. Really though, don't expect a thrilling, brain wracking story. It doesn't have a deep lore, deep characters, or really that strong of a story. BUT. As I said, that's not where it shines. It's funny, no character is really unlikeable (to me). Millenia will be a joy every time she's there. Tio is adorable. SO IS MAREG. Ryudo's jokes are 75% of the time funny. Pot shots at Elena are (always) great.\nThe combat's fun. Learning the game is fun. The music is a joy to hear. (Unless it's the usual dungeon song, which I'm almost sick of [It changes sometimes, it's the \"cave\" one that sucks. IDK it sounds like cave music to me]). Chaining cancels and abusing the ATE/turn progress bar is fun. \nBoosting character's MOV to where they fly around the screen is fun.\nIt's just a nice 30~ hour RPG.\n\nFor 20 bucks it's still better than many modern (J)RPGs. \n\nStill one of my faves :^]\n\nAND NOW FOR THE BAD NEWS:\n\n---BE SURE, BE VERY SURE---\nPeople have said they get CTDs (Do I really have to explain? Crash to desktop) after ~5 hours of play.\nPersonally I've only gotten about two crashes and people say \"DON'T ALT TAB\"\nSo the solutions I know and have worked best for me are:\nTURN OFF 60 FPS BATTLES\nTURN OFF SHADOWS\nDO NOT ALT TAB\n\nWill mention it if I keep getting CTDs but so far only 2~ tops.\n\n===Basic info/Mild Caution===\nThis is a report/rerelease of an old PC/PS2/Dreamcast game that in all other releases than DC had bugs.\nI was lucky and had the virtually bugless DC port. Apparently some bugs have carried over. I haven't really experienced them, yet.\nMost I've noticed is the screen on the bottom isnt cropped properly so you can see under the map. But whatever LOL.\n\nSo far it's as I remember, very functional. And has THE SAME OLD GOOD MEMORABLE (CHEESY AT TIMES) VOICE ACTING.\nYes it's good. Even by today's standard.\n\nBOUGHT AT FULL PRICE\nNO REGURTS.\n\n((If I seem to repeat myself anywhere throughout this review, my apologies. I'm editing after the initial post because this reviews isn't/wasn't as verbose as I'd like.))\nMy way of saying: I'm not going back to edit this. You're (probably) an adult and can filter information for yourself.\n\n-----\nAssuming you read this far, I'll say a little more about my background as a small reward/PUNISHMENT:\nI've played this game over probably 4-7 times with varying progress. (I only finished it once [DC version] as of writing this). And generally all those runs ended at the eye. YES, I COULDNT GET PAST IT FOR THE LONGEST TIME AS A KID. \nIf you want to know the super secret special strat: Eat spaghetti and dont get macaroni--- My sincerest apologies.\nThe real strat is: Reusing the joke where I say I'm going to say something but then don't.\nOkay for real the strat is: just kill the little eyes, cancel when theyre going to use delta whatever, once you kill all the smaller eyes you should be in the clear but, furthermore/follow up: general rule of thumb: kill all parts of the valmar piece before the main unit itself.\nOKAY THE REAL-REAL STRAT: set the game on fire and destroy whatever you're playing it on\n\nAs is tradition: Waifu of the game: THIS.

One of the first JRPGs I've ever played... and I played this game a LOT when I had it on my crappy old PC and on PS2 much later. Now with this Anniversary edition, I FINALLY got to hear the japanese voice acting too, which is a huge plus for me. Nostalgia threads were pulled hard while playing this game... Buuut... without further ado, let's go with pros and cons...\n\nPros:\n\n- Unique battle system. Though turn based, it relies on how fast your characters are, how quickly they can act on the battle field, and if you master the usage of the battle meter... as I call it, haha, you can easily win battles without taking any damage at all, even during boss fights. \n\n- Music. I love Noriyuki Iwadare's OST for this game. It's uplifting, exciting, full of suspence, sad, beautiful... you name it! Battle music always gets me pumped (even after hearing it for the 3000th time). \n\n- Some of the characters. I love Ryudo's attitude. At first he's pretty much an a-hole, but you can see him mature to a young man with a more open mind. Millenia and Tio are probably the most lovable women in this game. Oh... and Melfice... that Melfice... *fangirls* I love him! Because he's such a hot baddie <3\n\n- English voice cast has done a very good job at bringing the characters alive. \n\nCons:\n\n- Story: Even though I like it, it's still pretty predictable. This game has that little something that has left its mark in my heart, but the story is your every JRPG ever, with cliched plot twists and characters. Good versus Evil, save the world, blah blah... \n\n- Sound effects are very loud, and the voiced parts sometimes get interrupted when the scene goes on. \n\n- Graphics are sort of old-fashioned, but I don't mind, because graphics are never everything - you can make a very pretty and realistic looking videogame, but if everything else sucks, people won't come back to it. And hey, at least there are no longer dark round shadows underneath the characters anymore! :D\n\nMiddle-ground (Neither good or bad)\n\n- Japanese voice cast. Maybe it's because I was so used to hear the english voice cast, the japanese one fell flat.

Een mensenleven geleden zat ik bij een vriendje thuis in een anime-magazine te bladeren en ik was verkikkerd op de enthousiaste woorden over deze titel. Het zou een moddervette game zijn met een scheldende hoofdpersoon (wooow!) en personages gingen gruwelijk dood. Ook de game mechanics zouden een verfijnde uitwerking zijn van de battles in de vorige Grandia (1997), met meer keuzemogelijkheden en vechttactieken. De recensent in kwestie was jubelend over de vele CGI-effecten die tussen de gevechten in zijn geplaatst. En toch ebde mijn interesse weg, want de game was natuurlijk niet te krijgen in Nederland en ik wist nog niet hoe je met illegale kopie\u00ebn Japanse games in je huiskamer kon halen. Tot mijn grote verbazing dook Grandia 2  op in een geremasterde PC-versie op een Steam Summer Sale, nog behoorlijk prijzig ook (10 euro in de sale, 30 euro 'normaal'.) In een opwelling heb ik hem toch aangeschaft om te kijken of de recensie destijds het bij het goede eind had.\n\nOm het eerste grote kritiekpunt te benoemen: de PC-port is schandalig slecht. Het heeft irritante bugs en veel lag (?) dat je niet verwacht bij een deugdelijke port, waarbij recht wordt gedaan aan het medium waarop je de game speelt. Bij een van de eerste 'boss battles' (tegen Millenia) bleek er dus zelfs een bug in te zitten waardoor je niet verder kan spelen en de game vastloopt. (Je verzint het niet: als je de battle tutorial doet voordat je de boss battle ingaat, loopt de game automatisch vast. Kun je niks anders aan doen dan opnieuw beginnen...) Behalve dat ik moest wennen aan de gedateerde graphics en het langzamere speeltempo t.o.v. moderne games, was het dus een extra hobbel dat ik de slordige oneffenheden erbij op de koop toe moest nemen.Gelukkig bleek 'Grandia II' (2000) als  klassieker op zichzelf staand krachtig genoeg om door te bijten en mee te gaan in de epische vertelling. \n\nMeer nog dan in het vorige deel heeft het een beklijvende verhaallijn vol met religieuze verwijzingen naar een klassieke oerstrijd tussen goed en kwaad. Ryuodo is een sympathieke protagonist als de archetypische rebelse jongere die God noch gebod kent. Hij vloekt en daagt God (uit deze wereld) meermalen uit om te bewijzen dat Hij bestaat. Vrouwen worden ronduit seksistisch bejegend. Als dertiger vind ik hem iets minder stoer dan ik hem als tiener had gevonden, maar ergens is het ook de charme van dit soort games dat je zo bekend bent met de gelijksoortige personages en voorspelbare verhaallijnen. Ook 'love interest' en maagdelijk nonnetje Elena is leuk, zeker als het plot een absurde wending neemt en ze onverwacht een duistere kant krijgt. De andere personages laat ik even in het midden om spoilers te voorkomen. \n\nMaar een game staat of valt met de gameplay, en die is gelukkig meer dan ok\u00e9. Het begint wat traag als je nog met \u00e9\u00e9n of twee karakters op stap bent, maar hoe meer karakters, speciale vaardigheden en magische spreuken in de groep komen, hoe hectischer en sneller het wordt. Uiteindelijk is het gewoon turn based, maar door de snelheid van de gevechten voelt het als realtime. En elke aanval levert vermakelijke CGI-sequenties op die de gevechtssituaties wat sjeu geven. Het upgrade-systeem werkt wat omslachtig met verschillende punten voor 'moves' en 'magic', maar na verloop van tijd is het makkelijk te volgen en levert het verschillende mogelijkheden op om de teamtactiek zelf mee vorm te geven. Toch is het jammer dat - zoals bij wel meer JRPG's- het veranderen van statistieken weinig uitmaakt, want de game is makkelijk genoeg als je de battles niet overslaat en enigszins het juiste level hebt voor de betreffende boss. Het speelt door de toegankelijke moeilijkheidsgraad wel lekker vlot weg, met weinig momenten dat je moet grinden of belemmerd wordt omdat je eerder essenti\u00eble fouten hebt gemaakt.", "timestamp_created": 1483801355, "timestamp_updated": 1483801893, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29054561": {"recommendationid": "29054561", "author": {"steamid": "76561198250419398", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2809, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512343129}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is probably my favorite of all time; I first played it on PS2, and the story captivated me.

You can see the changes in their demeanor and attitudes as the game goes on.  The amount of customization available for each character is incredible: anyone can be a spell slinger, anyone can be a brawler (although some are more suited to it than others).

Basically, the battles will always take place on a map that your characters can move around on which can be used tacitcally to avoid taking damage from attacks. It works very well, but the camera is not manipulatable during fight sequences, which can sometimes be bothersome as you cannot quite see the range of an attack hitting all the enemies.\n\nThe story is quite basic. Compared to Grindia 1, I'd even call it a little dull, and the voice acting is averge. But this is all made up for by interesting characters and situations your characters are put into.\n\nProgression into the game isn't all that grindy which is VERY nice, especially when confronted with a boss that you might not be able to beat. The grinding would never be more than 10 extra battles. That being said, the levels are designed quite linearly and you can fight every enemy without wondering off the path, and find all the loot, too.\n\nI'd like to see the other Grandia titles come to PC! But having this is a very nice treat. Battles can be in 60fps, but gameplay in overworld is 30fps. HD textures are just... basic. This game came out for the dreamcast, so I understand.\n\nOverall, I'd give it a 8/10.

Like the [i]Final Fantasy[/i] series games of old, the [i]Grandia[/i] series features a semi-turn-based battle system, where characters can only attack once they are ready to act. The [i]Grandia[/i] series raises the stakes beyond [i]Final Fantasy[/i]'s ATB System as each character and enemy has their own speeds that they traverse the IP Gauge in order to reach the Command Entry point, subsequent actions have associated time costs to them, those actions can be countered and cancelled by choosing specific actions of your own (and enemies can do it to you as well), and characters are required to traverse the battlefield to reach their target (depending on what action is chosen), making battles require a little bit more thinking to them.\n\nOf the three main games and the lone side game that were localized, [i]Grandia II[/i], to me, fits cleanly in the center of the bunch. [i]Grandia[/i] is often cited as having the best storyline in the series, [i]Grandia Xtreme[/i] is a game purely focused on the combat system (and it's the best of the series in that regard) but suffers from a barebones plot that is simply there just to advance the game, and [i]Grandia III[/i] is visually the prettiest of the series, but its plot and characters (well, the ones that stick around anyway) are nothing to write home about and the combat is a hair under [i]Xtreme[/i]'s.\n\n[i]Grandia II[/i] fits snugly in between all of the rest - it's story is solid yet not to the degree of the original and its combat is more refined than the original's but not as much as its successors'. You'll find yourself sticking around for the script writing (or, at least, how it was localized) and the characters/characterizations more than the overall plot, which is basically nothing more than \"Mercenary becomes bodyguard for (holy) Priestess, Evil arises, Mercenary-turned-hero must take his party to unravel evil plot and save everyone.\" If you love the top video game voice acting talent of the early 2000s, a fair number of them can be found here (Cam Clarke, Jennifer Hale, and Paul Eiding, just to name three) - heck, even the voice of Ariel from [i]Disney's The Little Mermaid[/i] has a prominent role that will completely make you question your childhood if you've ever watched the movie.\n\n[h1]The Anniversary Edition itself[/h1]\n\n[i]Grandia II Anniversary Edition[/i] is the third port of the original [i]Grandia II[/i] release (made back in 2000 for the Sega Dreamcast). Prior to its release, neither the PlayStation 2 port nor the original PC port were completely perfect replications of the original release, each with their own issues that marred the releases. The Anniversary Edition's code is based on the original Dreamcast release, though this comes with its own issues.\n\nThe original game's code on the Dreamcast must have been so completely unique to the hardware, because every single port, including the Anniversary Edition, features bugs, glitches, or issues not present in the original version. Notably, the Anniversary Edition has: Camera clipping issues, graphical issues (mostly related to casting spells), audio issues (sound balance issues (some effects too low, others far too loud and overpowering), sound clips not playing at all when they should, sound effects not sounding correctly, odd looping, etc.), and a \"hacky\" solution that sometimes causes text/audio desync in longer cinematic sequences or auto-advancing text segments that are voiced. Perhaps it is my system's specs, but I also frequently encountered issues where, out of the blue, the game would stutter in framerate for ~30 seconds and then go completely back to normal.\n\n[i]Grandia II Anniversary Edition[/i] does have plenty of options for the end user to toggle through, including 60 FPS battles, but this feature was not found in the original Dreamcast version and is not necessary to your enjoyment - it was fine in 30 FPS back in the 2000s. The screen size options (note: this game is natively 4:3, as that's how the game and its assets were originally developed), anti-aliasing, and such are welcome additions. Apparently, Gung Ho and Skybox Labs determined that a new engine for shadows was needed, which in part contributes to some of the spellcasting issues, but the shadows do look much better graphically than they originally did. (The new shadows do cause a lighting issue in the final dungeon, however.)\n\nGung Ho, despite opening up a survey long before announcing the project (which culminated in this port being made) where they listened to the responses and developed the Anniversary Edition off of the original, superior Dreamcast version, chose to enlist Skybox Labs to develop the port... a decision which ultimately ended up producing a flawed game that, to this day, is still not up to the standards of the original Dreamcast release. Gung Ho saw fit to cut their support for fixing the release after a time had passed, without fixing all of the game's issues. The game is still beatable, but you will definitely notice flaws that are apparent. Gung Ho should have made a better choice in developer or bothered to release the game in a finished, unflawed state - I don't know whether Skybox was given an unrealistic deadline for the game by Gung Ho and were only permitted a certain window of post-launch support or if Skybox was not the best developer for the job, but the result is what you have here.\n\n[h1]To Buy or Not to Buy?[/h1]\n\nPersonally, I feel as though the [i]Grandia[/i] series has one of the premiere combat systems found in Japanese RPGs and I strongly recommend that people experience this game in particular. Should you get [i]Grandia II Anniversary Edition[/i] though? Well, that depends on your situation/scenario/preferred gaming style.\n\n[list]\n[*] Do you have a Sega Dreamcast?\nIf yes, I recommend skipping [i]Grandia II Anniversary Edition[/i] and, instead, tracking down a copy of the Dreamcast version. To this day, over ten years later, it's still the most superior version on all fronts.\n[*] If the answer to the previous question was no, then my next recommendation would be to purchase one (it was a great, albeit short-lived system and it does have a pretty good library of titles that were only found on it and haven't been ported since) along with the Dreamcast version of [i]Grandia II[/i].\n[*] If the above option is not feasible, then you have two further options. If you prefer gaming on the PC, have a laptop and can take your gaming on the go, or like other bonuses found in this release, then go ahead and pick up [i]Grandia II Anniversary Edition[/i] (Hard Mode will make the game more challenging if you haven't already played the game if the base difficulty is too low, but veterans will have no issue beating the game on Hard Mode and getting all 36 Achievements). If you have a PlayStation 2, the port of [i]Grandia II[/i] for that would also be an option, though I would probably recommend the Anniversary Edition more than it, unless you have an older computer that can't handle running this version adequately (because the game was rebuilt, it is not simply an emulator running the original Dreamcast version, hence the higher system requirements!).\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Final Verdict:[/h1]\nShould you play [i]Grandia II Anniversary Edition[/i]? Well, you should play [i]Grandia II[/i] in some way, shape, or form, but I honestly don't think [i]Grandia II Anniversary Edition[/i] is the best, most-preferred method of doing so.", "timestamp_created": 1483163765, "timestamp_updated": 1483163928, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509434", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28831777": {"recommendationid": "28831777", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057305013", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 33, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1440589550}, "language": "japanese", "review": "DC\u7248\u304c\u767a\u58f2\u3055\u308c\u305f\u5f53\u521d\u306f\u7121\u6211\u5922\u4e2d\u3067\u904a\u3093\u3060\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u3001\u61d0\u304b\u3057\u3055\u304b\u3089\u8cfc\u5165\u3057\u305f\u308f\u3051\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001\u306a\u305c\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u306e\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30b9\u30fb\u5b57\u5e55\u306b\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3057\u306a\u3044\u306e\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\u304b\u3002\n\u30a2\u30fc\u30ab\u30a4\u30d6\u30b9\u304cPS\uff13\uff1f\u3067\u3067\u304d\u308b\u304b\u3089\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\u304b\uff1f\n\u3082\u306f\u3084PS\uff13\u306a\u3093\u3066\u96fb\u6e90\u3092\u5165\u308c\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u306a\u3044\u306e\u3067\u3001\u3067\u304d\u308c\u3070PC\u7248\u3067\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u3067\u904a\u3073\u305f\u3044\u3082\u306e\u3067\u3059\u3002\n\n\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u81ea\u4f53\u306e\u611f\u60f3\u306b\u95a2\u3057\u3066\u306f\u3001\u4eca\u66f4\u65b0\u898f\u3067\u8cfc\u5165\u3059\u308b\u4eba\u3082\u305d\u3046\u305d\u3046\u3044\u306a\u3044\u3068\u601d\u3046\u306e\u3067\u5272\u611b\u3057\u3066\u3082\u3044\u3044\u304b\u306a\u3002\n\u6700\u521d\u306e\u9803\u306f\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u30b7\u30fc\u30f3\u304c\u30d5\u30eb\u30dc\u30a4\u30b9\u306a\u306e\u306b\u3001\u5f8c\u534a\u306b\u9023\u308c\u3066\uff08\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc\u304c\u76db\u308a\u4e0a\u304c\u3063\u3066\u3044\u304f\u306b\u3082\u304b\u304b\u308f\u3089\u305a\uff09\u30dc\u30a4\u30b9\u304c\u306a\u304f\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3044\u304f\u306e\u304c\u5f53\u6642\u7591\u554f\u3060\u3063\u305f\u306e\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001\u8272\u3005\u306a\u5927\u4eba\u306e\u4e8b\u60c5\u304c\u3042\u3063\u305f\u306e\u3060\u3068\u601d\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\u30a8\u30ec\u30ca\u597d\u304d\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3093\u3060\u3051\u3069\u306a\u3042\u3002\u4eca\u3084\u3063\u305f\u3089\u611f\u60f3\u304c\u5909\u308f\u3063\u3066\u304d\u305f\u308a\u3059\u308b\u306e\u304b\u306a\u3042\u3002\n\n\u305c\u3072\u3001\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3057\u3066\u307b\u3057\u3044\u306a\u30fc\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1483111382, "timestamp_updated": 1483111382, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.715593", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28808972": {"recommendationid": "28808972", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960843546", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 311, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442198749}, "language": "english", "review": "Such a  classic game !.", "timestamp_created": 1483054357, "timestamp_updated": 1483054357, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.415715", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28767296": {"recommendationid": "28767296", "author": {"steamid": "76561198341893422", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512164147}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Grandia II \u00e9 o melhor JRPG 3D que j\u00e1 joguei!

The game is fairly linear, There is an annoying blond kid who speaks through his nose that I hate, the enemies (outside of boss fights) are often palett swaps of earlier bad guys and pretty uninspired. \n\nAlso I want to take a quick minute and talk about those beautiful little movies that play each time you use an ability or casst a spell in the game. Boy do those look great, they are a pleasure to sit through. The first time. Unfortunatly you have so sit through them everytime you or an enemy use a special ability or cast a spell. As a general rule the more powerful the ability the longer the little cut scene, so that gets old fast.\n\nDespite all this Grandia II is a fun game I enjoyed it back then on the dreamcast and still enjoy it today.

Developers are being retro for the sake of being retro, so I feel like I'm playing Final Fantasy I's and II's again in another creator's eye, and that's not very exciting to me.\n\nI judge the fun factor of a RPG based on almost every detail, but the big 4 are:  Gameplay, Story, Characters, and Music\n\nGameplay:  Grandia II attempts to do what Chrono Trigger attempted(and succeeded) to do with RPG's- and that is to spice up the formula.  I really like the unique turn meter and combat system.  Countering, dodging, attacking, and buff/debuff magic all receive their fair due attention instead of having one core strategy and using it to annihilate all enemies.  Sure, magic is OP and you get enough MP refreshments via save points to spam your most powerful magic attack, but many enemies' resistances are so strong it is faster to know who to hit with and who to cast magic and what type instead of spamming one spell over and over.  \n\nThis was my first play through and a I chose Hard- there were spots that were genuinely difficult where others seemed to breeze by, only one occurance did I grind to force the boss to be easier.  The other time, I COULDN'T grind as the save point was in a 'point-of-no-return' area, and it took a lot of trial and error to realize one character's special move affects a lot more than the description lets on, so the translation or at least the descriptions could have done with more symbols showing exactly what it can cause the enemy to inhibit or at least better wording.\n\nStory:  I won't give much away here, but it is an enthralling adventure with a distinctive world with huge landmarks and many dangers that kept me interested in what was around the next corner for the protagonist.\n\nCharacters:  Oh, did I say protagonist?  Within the first 20 minutes of the game you'll see how much of a 'hero' this guy is.  I had never played a JRPG before this one that followed such a realistic(or at least non-stereotypical), outspoken, and 'I'm done with your ****' type of 'hero.'  It was definitely refreshing, and at times cringe-worthy to see how badly he insults a party member early on just because of their differences.  The interactions between the characters were made better with Grandia's signature 'camp and chat' feature where certain parts of the story have you selecting different characters and reading their banter on water-cooler topics that don't necessarily effect the main story.\n\nMusic:  It's actually ok, nothing great or forgettable.  If anything, it isn't repetitive, or at least it never rubbed me the wrong way unlike many other JRPG's.  I can't recall any outstanding pieces, but it serves its purpose.\n\nMy only complaint is there is no way to fast forward or skip the long magic cutscene animations.  Of all JRPG's I've played I've never had a reason to use the fast forward feature that many are receiving with these anniversary and HD editions- but Grandia II sorely needed it.\n\nI had a lot of fun with this one and look forward to coming back to it later on!", "timestamp_created": 1480399659, "timestamp_updated": 1480399659, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28003835": {"recommendationid": "28003835", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035549020", "num_games_owned": 255, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488068133}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my oldest treasures.

Story is fairly generic and predictable, but the environments and dungeons are pretty diverse, character interactions and development is respectable to good, and the dialogue, while cringe at times, reminds me of a time when anime dubs were enjoyable for sounding cartoony and campy.\n\n The biggest draw to this game, however, is the combat, which is a unique mix of turnbased and real time battle.  Character movement before or after an attack can lead to an attack  missing, and there are ways of coordinating your party's attacks to do extra damage through combos or to delay an enemy's use of a powerful skill or spell.  Boss battles are satisfying in difficulty, and you can gain extra items by killing parts of them before killing the main body (you should anyway, because many times these parts are buffing the boss or throwing extra attacks and debuffs/ailments on your party, so taking those parts out quickly helps you out).\n\nFor those who enjoy waifus, Millenia is bae.  Ryudo is also husbando material for you ladies out there.  And Mareg is a bro.\n\nThe anniversary edition has enhanced visual and audio (essentially, it's cleaned up), but don't expect a remaster like the FFX Collection.  But if you can look past the dated graphics and the occasionally cringe dialogue/voice acting, and you're looking for a JRPG fix in between FF15 and Personal 5, give this a try.  It's a flawed gem, but a gem nonetheless.", "timestamp_created": 1479936923, "timestamp_updated": 1479936923, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26882555": {"recommendationid": "26882555", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124512246", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2393, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512304161}, "language": "italian", "review": "Ottimo gioco con un sistema di combattimento fantastico", "timestamp_created": 1479935086, "timestamp_updated": 1479935086, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26856369": {"recommendationid": "26856369", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091877875", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463691705}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Um dos melhores RPG que ja joguei", "timestamp_created": 1479932494, "timestamp_updated": 1479932494, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26808461": {"recommendationid": "26808461", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973535951", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1737, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456618870}, "language": "spanish", "review": "RPG de corte cl\u00e1sico que todo fan debe jugar.

I went into this PC version with high expectations based on that and I was pretty underwhelmed.\n\nFirst the good parts:\n- The translation is pretty decent\n- The PC port seems alright\n- Being a Grandia game, the battles can at times be engaging\n- Being a Grandia game, there's lots of dialogue and character interaction if you want it.\n\nBut now for the bad parts...\n- The story is mostly generic and stupid in a very JRPG way.  It's typical of JRPGs of its era.  It's the sort of plot that I might have thought was good when I was a 12-year-old, but most adults would be embarrassed by it. The characters are mostly annoying most of the time.  Their behavior is juvenile and tedious, which makes it hard to care about them.  The dialog is good when the characters are just chatting, but awful when they're talking about anything related to the plot, especially towards the end.  I've heard enough JRPG monologues about how the power of the heart will overcome any obstacle, thanks.\n- The battle system had potential, but throws away nearly all of that potential by 1) making battles take too long by using any strategy except unleashing powerful AOE attacks over and over, and 2) making all the AOE attacks consist of 20-second-long low-budget CGI animations.  Because there are save points where you can heal all over the place, the most rational course of action is to just use Sky Dragon Slash or \"Zap All\" or whatever every single battle.  This means you spend 80% of the time in battles watching the same crappy 320x240 animations over and over again. There's no option to skip these animations. Not fun. This is not a game that respects the value of its players' time.\n\nTo be honest, I'm a little confused by other reviews seeming to praise the story.  Maybe I'm just getting to old to enjoy this sort of thing.\n\nThey should have taken their CGI budget and spent it on writing instead.", "timestamp_created": 1476755115, "timestamp_updated": 1476755250, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.341903", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26091159": {"recommendationid": "26091159", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006937811", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 5244, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476684433}, "language": "english", "review": "The port was kind of bad, between glitchy graphics and a few very very rare crashes.\nNostalgia more or less drove the playthrough i forgot how horribly long move animations were if I could have cut them short I would likely have enjoyed my playthrough more.

Grandia 2 is by far one of the best JRPGs on steam - why?\n\n1. The story is great. And by great I mean \"I friggin cried a bit (just a bit) when SPOILER happened\" great.\n\n2. The combat system is insanely good. The encounters might be a bit easy if youre a grindy-RPG-player, BUT there is a hard difficulty in the steam version which increases the enemies max-hp (pretty cool for a second playthrough)\n\n4. Tons and tons of grindables. All characters have upgradable special abilities. The way you get spells in this game is by collecting and leveling spellbooks. The spells in the spellbook can be upgraded with XP from battles. Same with combat enhancements in \"battlebooks\" (or whatever they're called lul). This bonus grinding system makes leveling more exciting and you pretty much always have something to do till the end of the game.\n\n3. This is a really good port of the game. Close to no bugs/glitches, resolution support for every monitor, japanese voices (not as good as english imo), and a really good overall performance (60 FPS COMBAT Kreygasm).\n\nThe first time I've played Grandia 2 was way back on the Dreamcast (and PS2) and this steam-rerelease made me really happy to playthrough again.

It suffers from some of the problems of early 3d RPGs with long unskippable battle animations, cheesy voice acting, and field animations and cutscenes that play way longer than it should. One example that comes to mind is during a sewer level you have to wait for some gears to slowly turn to extend some bridges. It plays out as if the devs want to show off these \"new amazing 3d animations\" that end up being overly long and tedious now.\n\nDespite its flaws, this game is extremely solid. It easily has one of the best battle systems in any RPG, new or old. It basically is Grandia 1's battle system but on steroids. You get a ridiculous amount of flexability and options on how you want to build your characters. \n\nThe story on the other hand is extremely standard.

I had only played grandia 3 back on the PS2 years ago, and I never beat it and barely remember it. one thing I I liked about this games features was the ability to use certain abilities or select \"critical attack command\" to set the enemy back on its turn,  best used right at the last moment when they are about to attack as you could set them back very far in the turn order and potentially save a party members life. your version of magic in this game comes from \"Mana Eggs\" you get several throughout the game and you level them up by using 'Magic coins\" you get from monsters. You start out with few spells and some are greyed out but as you spend more coins upgrading the spells you have to max other spells become available. In order to upgrade combat skills you use \"skill coins\" Its the same as magic except each character has there own special unique skills that can be upgraded. The game is somewhat linear in the department of finding items, I've read people say there are no secret items but there are a few hidden behind roots in caves etc.. You can miss weapons and some armor if running straight through certain areas but for the most part you can back track though unlike Final Fantasy there's no airship so be prepared to hoof it. Overall most things you miss you wont really need. By the end of the game I really only needed to use my items near the last area bosses. I would say I only died 3 times overall, for me the difficulty was kind of random on bosses, some harder than others while some only hitting me one time before Ii locked them in and never let them attack and killed them. As far as replay there is a more difficult mode to play and Japanese voices if you prefer.

Gameplay is good with some playerskill involved and story is alright. The port is great and adds hard mode for extra challenge. \n\nThe main protagonist is Ryudo who is a geohound (slays monsters for money) and as the game progresses the player will get more party members up to 4. There are 6 playable characters who join and leave the party as the story progresses. The player can dispatch monsters with regular attacks, moves, spells and items. The game has seeds (items) which can permanently boost stats to tweak characters to your liking. For a quick hint; Ryudo will always stay in the party and has a good attack animation so he's a good source for  damage.\n\nThis game has some flaws such as being a bit too easy on normal and areas designed as tunnels.

I love classic RPGs, and I actually owned a Dreamcast as a kid.  I was excited to get to play Grandia II for the first time after all these years since I missed out on it when it was first released.  I wanted very badly to enjoy the game and then be able to recommend it to others, but I didn't enjoy it and I can't recommend it.\n\nLet's start with what Grandia II does well.  It has that classic early 2000s feel to it.  The character and environment designs gave me a Skies of Arcadia vibe.  The music is also excellent, and when it doesn't crash, the game runs buttery smooth on a modern PC.  Despite the low poly count, the visuals are excellent and very crisp.\n\nSo what's wrong with it?  The game is a complete chore to play.  While I will give the game props for trying something new with a turned-based battle system, it feels incredibly slow and each battle actually eats up a fair amount of real time.    Spell and special attack animations are also extremely lengthy.  I've played a ton of RPGs, and I've never had my patience tested this badly.  While the visuals are great, the locations you visit are all extremely small.  To make up for this, you are thrust into lengthy battle after lengthy battle as you traverse the small, uninteresting environments.  In addition to the environments being bland, there is no minimap and the horrendous camera makes navigating a real pain.\n\nWhat about the story or the characters?  Can either of those redeem the game?  No.  The story is literally Light vs. Darkness, with some bit of Darkness being contained in seemingly every town you visit.  Everything just feels so bland.  In a certain sense, to the point at which I stopped playing, it felt like Final Fantasy I level storytelling.  The characters don't change or grow in any way during the first half of the game, and their interactions feel extremely forced.\n\nI should also say a word about instability.  The game apparently crashes frequently and without warning for a number of people; others occasionally experience serious slowdown.  I experienced a grand total of one very surprising crash and fairly frequent (but brief slowdown).  If you plan on buying this, make sure it runs well for you during the two hour refund window.  Battles take ages, and losing progress between save points over and over again would become maddening.\n\nEven if you don't mind slow games and love classic JRPGs, I'd still say pass on this one unless you've played it before and know you are going to like it.  If you want a slow-paced game that is a lot of fun and features well-written characters and dialog, give Legend of Heroes a try instead.", "timestamp_created": 1467189102, "timestamp_updated": 1467189102, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.438998", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23917180": {"recommendationid": "23917180", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970515314", "num_games_owned": 243, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 2690, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456981469}, "language": "english", "review": "Great fun game.  the Rpg action holds up well over time.  if you're looking for a good classic Jrpg look no further than this classic battle bettwen light and dark", "timestamp_created": 1467184594, "timestamp_updated": 1467184594, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.468966", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23908029": {"recommendationid": "23908029", "author": {"steamid": "76561198160071070", "num_games_owned": 224, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 294, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452018029}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0417\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0447\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f JRPG!", "timestamp_created": 1467153683, "timestamp_updated": 1467153683, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23893738": {"recommendationid": "23893738", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976396190", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 51, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466942627}, "language": "english", "review": "Loved it on the DC and love the added customization and hard mode !

Not very optimally ported for PC. Only keyboard and no mouse support.\n2. Camera control is a nightmare. It gets better with time, but some maps (beginning map even), drive me crazy.\n3. Lots of random crashes with limited save points, which means you lose progress for unsaved portion of the game if your game crashes.\n4. Long cut scenes and plenty of cinematics, with no option to skip. This can be viewed as both great and nay. Great for those who like a good storyline, which I am fine with it. Nay when your game crashes, and you have to go through the same cinematics again! (cut scenes usually vary from 2-8 minutes).\n5. Combat can be slow, especially for magic castings, as they have short cinematic in the execution.\n\nMy recommendation is, buy this if you have patience (a great deal of it, especially with crashes), or if there is a good buy on steam", "timestamp_created": 1467036598, "timestamp_updated": 1467040213, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.427146", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23839956": {"recommendationid": "23839956", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041446891", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 407, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485493699}, "language": "english", "review": "This was my favorite game growing up and my original dreamcast cd of it is kept in a safe place, guarded jealously.

The battle system is OK, but once you figure it out, the game is too easy. The story is actually really good, but the characters are unrelatable and borderline unlikable. The voice acting is low quality anime at best, and near the end, you can tell the game was rushed to finish because the cutscenes drop significantly in quality. At one point, its just a grainy picture of the villian with audio played over. The music for this game is also very good, but the volume is very inconsistent. Battles are insanely loud and the rest of the game is rather quiet. \nThe video files are very grainy, but that is too be expected from an older game, but as an aniversary edition, I expected them to touch it up a bit. My biggest complaint was that the game would not end. I thought I was at the final battle at least 5 times before it surprised me with more drawn out story and long dungeons. The last boss was also significantly weaker then the previous 5 or so. He wasn't impressive looking and he only landed one hit on me before I beat the game. \nMy final conplaint was, after beating the game, the ending was actually even more game play. Instead of battles you are sent back to several towns to talk to villagers and find your friends. By that point I didn't care and just wanted to see the credits already. \n\nI suppose this is more of a rant.\nIf you have a lot of patience I suppose the game is worth it.", "timestamp_created": 1466144957, "timestamp_updated": 1466144957, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.331071", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23542027": {"recommendationid": "23542027", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033785539", "num_games_owned": 2595, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 6322, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465928822}, "language": "english", "review": "A golden oldie for old school RPG fans.

My main gripe is places in the game with automatic text progression where they give you 5 seconds to read 20 words which happens a lot at the game's ending, I probably only read half of the dialogue. Sounds like bad localization to me. Doesn't happen often during the game.\n\nThis is a fantastic RPG from the last days you could experience a lot of group turn-based RPG's without it being classified as an Action RPG. There is a lot of heart in the music and characters which is incredibly refreshing considering this type of game seems to be a dying breed. Voice acting has rocky beginnings IMO but it seemed to get better as the game progressed. Played on lowest difficulty and I was extremely overpowered the entire game so if you're up for a bit of challenge it may be smart to chose the more difficult mode. Finished the game right at 50 hours and only about 5 of those hours were spent sleeping. Again a fantastic game and very satisfied that I made time to purchase and revisit this classic.\n\nNOTE TO ASPIRING DEVELOPERS :  Build it and we will come.", "timestamp_created": 1464264324, "timestamp_updated": 1464265222, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23202318": {"recommendationid": "23202318", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969418873", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 28, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463952556}, "language": "english", "review": "Grandia II was hands down an amazing game.  A real gem from the dream cast era, that had a cool, innovative for the time combat system, great animation, and excellent writing.  And without question, the best moment of this new anniversary edition is when you - in tears of frustration from on reinstalling drivers, dealing with broken controls, and constant game crashes - give up, dig your old PS2 out of storage, plug it in, and play Grandia II.  Because at that moment, you'll be playing the game, AND know full well that steam will be there to give you a refund for this miserable, broken, unplayable excuse for a port.\n\nSeriously:\n* XBox one controllers cause the camera to rotate constantly, only stoppable by unplugging the controller.\n* Thankfully I didn't have sound issues, but lots of other people did.\n* Entering the combat screen for me immediately reset the game to the title screen without saving.\n* I never even got that far, but if you talk to the combat tutorial guy in the first town, then the first boss becomes bugged and you have to restart the game.  \n\nSome day they might fix these, and I guess it would be a great buy if that happened, but it's already had like 4 patches since release and it's still completely broken.

Great gameplay and revitalized graphics make this one a must play IF you can manage to eliminate crashing!\n\n* Below is the original NEGATIVE review *\n\n(Review based on Windows 10 experience)\n\nLet me preface by saying I was very excited to pick this up on Steam as I hadn't had the opportunity to play it previously. \n\nThe first 2 times I loaded the game and played I had zero issues and found it very enjoyable. The 3rd time, and every subsequent time after the game just crashes, in a wide variety of ways.  Sometimes I'll enter a battle and the game will just go back to the start screen instead of the battle, other times I'll finish the battle and then the game will just completely crash and want to send an error report. \n\nThese crashes happen so frequently that I refuse to waste my time repeating the same game segments over and over only for the game to crap its pants before I have the chance to save, or live in constant fear that I'm going to lose a ton of progress. This, of course, has to start happening after I've played long enough that I can no longer refund it. Judging by other reviews, I'm not the only person having these issues.

If I were to play this game back in the day, I would have probably enjoyed it. \n\nBut you have to keep the retro aspect in mind at all times. JRPG games were different back then, and this game is very average in many areas. I thought the story was way too generic, and combat is absurdly easy once you figure out what to do. I even put the game on its Hard difficulty, yet I barely felt challenged throughout 99 percent of the adventure. \n\nQuite frankly, the most aggravating thing about combat itself was not the difficulty but the fact that some of the animations for attacks/spells took too long. Yes, it's a small nitpick, but I found myself trying to finish fights as fast as possible so I wouldn't have to subject myself to long animations being played over and over. On top of that, the game developers were lazy and literally recycled animations, even going as far as using different names for the same animations to think the player could be fooled, somehow. \n\nAgain, the game is very average. It won't wow you or anything like that. I wouldn't even call this a gem. It's just very middle-of-the-road, even for its time. If I had to complain about something else, I think this port is really bugged in stupid areas. For instance, there was apparently more  (mediocre-at-best) voice acting, but there were parts where the audio was either absent or decided to work half of the time instead of every instance where it was supposed to occur. Very lame if you ask me.\n\nRegardless, if you want to play a retro JRPG for some reason like I felt like doing when I bought this game randomly a few weeks back, this game will give you your fix.

There is no God.\" [/h1]\n\nOh, Grandia II! One of the best games from my childhood that were fortunately ported by GungHo America to Steam. Originally a Dreamcast title released in 2001, ported later to the PS2 in 2002 and later to Steam as the Anniversary Edition in 2015, this classic JRPG still holds well even after 15 years of it's initial release, mostly for it's memorable story and innovative combat system! \n\nThe story in Grandia II revolves around Ryudo, a Geohound (a sort of bounty hunter in the Grandia universe), moved around from place to place, taking requests the normal folks would generally despise. One day, he received a letter of invitation, or a job request, to escort a band of Sisters of Granas for their usual prayer ritual from the nearby village. Things unfortunately went south and from a basic escort job, Ryudo is now stuck in a potential catastrophic event that may decimate the world. \n\nBefore moving on to the pros and cons, I would just like to mention that I may be bias in recommending this as this game is held dearly by me as one of my favorite titles ever but I'll try to point out all the positive and negative aspects of this port.\n\n[h1]PROS[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] As I've mentioned earlier, this game has an absolute [b]BRILLIANT[/b] story! The plot itself is captivating with a mind bending plot twist occurring at the second half of the game. I've played a lot of RPGs and I can firmly say that Grandia II has definitely one of the best ones!\n[*] Every playable characters are surprisingly lovable! From the sarcastic and no-bullshit Ryudo to the calm and wise Mareg, every character stands out on their own and their lines perfectly matched with their attitude that Game Arts portrayed them to be.\n[*] One more thing about the characters are their lines. Seriously, read them all if you can! You can find tidbits of Ryudo and Helena's love-hate relationship, Mareg's pearls of wisdom, Millenia's flirty-but-chaotic tone. Even talking with NPCs will net you awesome dialogues between the characters! ([b]PRO TIP[/b]: Make sure to talk to everyone at least TWICE. There's always 2 or 3 different conversations you can have each time you talk to anyone) \n[*] Innovative and dynamic combat system! I think this one is what separate Grandia II with the other RPGs at the time. What I mean by dynamic is that everyone moves freely in the battlefield during their turn. Instead of the usual turn-based battles (a la ATB from the Final Fantasy series), once the character's turn is reached, they will run forward to their enemy to land the blows. This makes it interesting since the character, implied to both friendlies and foes, can miss or evade just by moving a bit. Also, another interesting mechanic in combat is the Cancel system. Every character have the basic Combo or Critical attack to use each turn. The Critical is weaker from the pair, since it only hit once, but when used when an opponent's turn, it will cancel the said turn, shoving the said opponent queue lower and allows for tactical comeback.\n[*] Great character's customization via skills and magic equip. In Grandia, magic comes from an equip Mana Egg you'll find across the game. Each have different spells, whether offensive or defensive, and can be equip by anyone, in AND out of battles! So basically, any character can be a healer or damager, with the limiting factors comes only with the mana pool and the character's stats. Same goes with skills, where upon finding and leveling up skill books, you can equip skills to boost the character's ability on what build you decide to use on him/her.\n[*] Basically an all around decent port with a few minor quirks (I'll list them down in the Cons). During the whole 40 hours of my playtime, the game never crashed on me once. There's also an option to turn on VSync and Anti-aliasing via an external launcher.\n[*] The game supports both Japanese and English voice over. I used the Japanese voices most of the time since I forgot how cringey the English voice actors sound in the game (still good compared to the other JRPGs at the time though). I switch to English only when there's a plot heavy cut scene comes up because they don't have subs for it. The option is available via the said external launcher.\n[*] Full controller support (I used the standard XBOX 360 controller) with customizable buttons.\n[*] An option to play in Hard Mode right off the bat. I suggest going for this since the game is quite easy once you got the hang of the mechanics.\n[*] A perfect 100% game is moderately easy to achieve in one play. I took a little bit over the 40 hours mark in Hard Mode to complete the game with all the achievements unlocked. Surprisingly, it only took me a a little grind to get the 2000 enemies killed. Of course, you have to look in very nook and cranny for hidden treasures to ensure you didn't missed any specific ones, namely the \"Bling\" and \"Put A Notch in it\" achievements.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]NEUTRAL[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] In combat, the HP bar for ALL enemies is shown clearly to you, even bosses! Bosses with > 9999 HP will be shown as ????/???? but with the bars shown, you can estimate when he's going to die. It's useful but I think it dissolve the suspense that the usual RPG boss fights have. \n[/list]\n\n[h1]CONS[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] The biggest pet peeve I have with this game is that it doesn't support a native widescreen support. Sure, you can change the resolution and toggle the widescreen option but what it does is just stretch the aging 4:3 camera, making the game unbearably ugly. If the widescreen toggle is turned off, you'll have to settle playing with a letterbox resolution to the end.\n[*] The Japanese voice over is not sync with the English dialogue. The voice get cuts over prematurely if the text advances way faster than the actual voices. It doesn't happen when you're using the English voice though.\n[*] Camera controls in the fields and dungeons are frustrating and dizzying at times. Since the developers tend to hid items behind walls, you have to rotate the camera nonstop to spot it and it's annoying. Also, the camera zooms in on Ryudo when you stopped moving even for a second.\n[*] Some text glitched out passed the text box. \n[*] 30 FPS-locked. Yeap, it's still there. It's nothing major really but the characters does seems floaty at time during walking. Good thing is that battles runs in fully glorious 60 FPS! That's why it feels fast and frantic at times.\n[*] Although the game runs smoothly at 30 and 60 FPS, there's a few area (namely the snowy mountains) where the FPS drops a bit. Not really important but I supposed I should mention it.\n[*] Opening the save and loading screens took ages! \n[*] The field interactions are unnecessarily and painfully [b]SLOW[/b]! For example, when you're climbing a ladder, everyone will take turns to slowly navigate the ladder and you CAN'T move until everyone's done. Missed something up there? You might as well go and order takeouts in the meantime.\n[*] Textures sometimes glitched out and you can see through walls (whoa)\n[*] In combat, the game shows exactly what your opponents will do, even when it's not their turn yet. Even though it does make things simpler, I think it just ruins the difficulty. (Oh, the boss is using his ultimate move after this? Let's Cancel it!)\n[/list]\n\n[h1]To conclude, even with the minor technical quirks and aging game engine, I give Grandia II Anniversary Edition a nostalgic and epic [b]5/5[/b]! Truly a masterpiece of a JRPG! [/h1]\n\nTo the fan of the series and also JRPG fans, I can assure you that the money spent is well worth it!

There are only 3 issues I encountered while playing that I wish could be fixed:\n1) Quite a few typos throughout the game.\n2) De-syncing of the audio and text dialogue gets really jarring at the halfway point of the game and beyond (this was using Japanese audio not English).\n3) No translation whatsoever for the animated CG cutscenes, which is a shame.\n\n[Story - average]: The story is pretty linear, simple and cliche. But that doesn't stop it from being engaging and pretty solid with how it's told. Even with the cinematics not having translations, I was able to figure out what was going on based on what was being shown which isn't always easy to do. The pace is kind of like a rollercoaster, once it takes off, there's no stopping it until it ends.\n\n[Characters - excellent]: The most entertaining part of the game was probably the responses Ryudo had in the early parts of the game. The game also has an unusual feature allowing your party to have dinner scenes at inns where they talk about fellow party members or story related things. Sometimes for hilarious results and other times gives chances for developing the characters because the main story pretty much starts off at max speed and stops for nothing. All of your party members are likeable (although Elena got grating at several points for me).\n\n[Graphics - average]: By today's standards it's obviously dated, but I would've been impressed to see graphics like this back when the game came out. The detail is surprisingly high on the characters themselves, the towns are somewhat large and many of the buildings can be entered. Most spells and attacks have their own cinematics/animations to make them different from the previous level which is nice. The bosses were also well done and geniunely nightmare fuel.\n\n[Sound - good]: The music is very 90s which I don't hate. The hymns were sung beautifully and conveyed sadness or hope prefectly. I don't know who did the vocals for them but props to whoever it was. The sound affects fit for the most part but the sounds for everyone's footsteps seemed really odd. I won't comment on the English voice acting since I switched it to Japanese immediately but everyone's voices fit well. Not every conversation had the voice audio, it was mostly saved for cinematics and important cutscenes which worked well... other than the considerable de-syncing haflway through the game.\n\n[Difficulty - bad]: This game was easy, given that I played on normal, but even on hard I've heard it doesn't go up by much. There are a few fights that are somewhat hard but once you've figured out the strategy they fall over pretty easily. One of the hardest fights isn't even a boss fight. It's enemies called Devils that can 1-shot your party if you let them cast a certain spell and you get to fight 3 at a time. The other hard parts of the game weren't fights at all, they were mini-games(especially the arm wrestling one). Although really, no oldschool JRPG is complete without ridiculous mini-games to get some nice items. At least they aren't game-breakingly powerful items that you absolutely must get to complete the game.\n\n[Combat - excellent]: This is where Grandia II shines brightest. It may be turn-based but the way they've designed it makes it feel very fast paced. It's also simple to learn (you can skip the tutorials completely) but takes some planning to master. There's a lot of different kinds of equipment and the spells in this game come from Eggs which you have to equip. The best part about this is that as you gain more Eggs you can then swap them in the middle of battle should you need more offensive or defensive spells. Along with equipment and Eggs you also get skill books that grant various bonuses to help offense, defense or magic stat setups. You have a turn order bar which is crucial to watch so you can decide what action you should take. You have a lot of options to choose from when it comes to your turn: \nChoose to hold your ground and defend which will lessen the time to reach your next turn.\nMove your character's position to evade incoming attacks.\nUse critical melee attacks to cancel the enemy's attacks.\nCombo melee attacks to counter the enemy mid-attack to do bonus damage.\nCast magic for elemental damage bonuses, healing, support, attack cancelling or debuffing.\nUse special skills to do tons of damage, cancel attacks, buffing or healing your allies.\nUse items or swap equipment/Eggs mid-fight.\nMost battles will have you and the enemies running around constantly which you should try to exploit as much as possible.\n\n[Length - good]: It honestly didn't feel very long but even taking away idle time and optional grinding, it still comes in at about 50 hours which is pretty good for the pacing.\n\n[Replayability - average]: There isn't a whole lot of incentive to play it over again since you see pretty much everything the game has to offer the first time through. Even the achievements aren't that difficult to get and are probably very doable in just one run. The charm and combat makes the game worth playing multiple times though.\n\n[Bugs - average]: There was a bug that was caused by using the tutorials at the start of the game but as I played, that one was mentioned as being fixed. There also seems to be issues with using controllers with the game sometimes and the sensitivity of the controller can hinder you during the mini-games. I had one crash during my playthrough but I couldn't reproduce it so who knows if it's a problem with the game or something else. I also noticed that the dialogue would stutter to a snail's pace or zip by sometimes, making it hard to read.

The writing is excellent and each character is interesting (except Roan, I really don't like Roan that much). The music is great. The battle system is superb. Enemies can be tough, but I played on hard. If you like JRPGs, then this game is a must have for your collection. \n\nPro -\nExcellent Story\nGreat Writing\nCatchy Music\nEngaging Battle System\nWell-Paced \n$20 USD - Cheap for a game I've

A cast of very good characters throughout just makes the story even better. It also doesn't hurt that the game is absolutely beautiful and runs at 60fps (though, sadly only in battle). A high-quality inventory and item management system both with plenty of depth. Best of all is Grandia II's battle system (WHICH IS TO DIE FOR). Also, can't forget the neat music.\n\nSome drawbacks: Audio can be a bit messy sometimes, the camera in the field is too close up, voice acting is a bit hit or miss.

Seriously, if you never played this game and wonder why many people fall in love with J-RPG in the old times, pick it now!\n\nThe Pros:\n\n+ Gameplay. I really love the semi-turn based style. In a world of video game today where everyone wants their turn right away, It gives me time to think as much as I want (just like other jRPG, when you choose attack/skill/items, the world freeze), yet it still gives me the random factor like counter-attack and positioning. The boss battle basically you and your party tries to 'cancel' boss turn as much as you can before it shoots something dangerous.\n\n+ Graphic. While it's obviously not Mass Effect level, this edition gives nice retouch and crispier 3D. They even have anti-aliasing and 60 fps battle.\n\n+ Character. Your main hero is Ryudo, a geohound (or mercs). Beside his skilled swordmanship, he also has some good sarcastic remarks on people. He's like your Fallout 4 character but pressing the sarcastic option almost all the time. Millenia is a hot-headed, bitchy, and flirty. Imagine the banter between the two. Also, like many j-RPG tropes, your party are a misfits of people of many races with different personalities.\n\n+ Story is pretty epic and quite wild, although at sometimes, you'll say \"yep, just like I guess, he's the bad guy\". Well, it's not j-RPG if it doesn't have some classic j-rpg tropes.\n\n+ Sound. It's clean and clear. The soundtrack won't winning award anytime soon, but it's not bad either. I quite like the soundtrack battle when our party were ambushed and some peaceful moments we had.\n\nThe cons:\n\n- AI. Okay, honestly it's okay. The enemies will also think like what you thinking in this game. They also will try to circling you, making your characters gather up in one place, then dropped some AoE damaging spells or pick the weakest member like your priest/healer/magician. Buuut, after you have a skill book that makes one character became the center of attention, the AI will become stupid and an easy picking because they will attack the person who held that skill book 100% of the time. Just buff him with def/hp/vit stats and he will be your impenetrable tank. Even bosses.\n\n- Controls. Get a freaking controller. The keyboard control scheme is just bad. Not the dev fault though, this game was released on console first. Seriously, use a controller. Also the camera is the hardest enemy to kill here.\n\n- Animation.  After some time, you'll wish you can skip the animation and straight to the numbers. Also, they didn't update the FMV parts. Man, seriously? Widescreen 1080p monitor and you got 800x600 2D animation sequence stretched to 1920x1080 resolution? You can imagine how blurry it is.\n\n- Replayability. Well, it's a J-RPG, you can only replay it with hard mode (although you can start with hard mode right away from new game). But maybe worth it if you missed a thing or two in your first playthrough. Otherwise, like many old j-rpg, you played once, you already know everything. No branching storyline, no morally questioning choices, it's like reading a story book.\n\nDo you recommend this game? Oh yes, despite the flaws brought from original and overall the design flaws in old J-RPG, I very much recommended this game. And Oh, If any game designer wants to learn a thing or two about j-rpg history, this is one of the gem you should look.\n\n\nI gave it an 8/10.", "timestamp_created": 1455395376, "timestamp_updated": 1455651455, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21151169": {"recommendationid": "21151169", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034646691", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1074, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481835897}, "language": "german", "review": "Da werden Kindheitserinnerungen wach.

Amazing game and the sharpening up of the graphics was very impressive.\n\n....\n\nHOWEVER.\n\nWhat I am NOT impressed with, was that literally after the first mission of the game (Bringing Elena to the tower and back) I encountered a MAJOR glitch that prevents me from progressing through the rest of the game at all. When fighting Millenia (the wings of Valmar) for the first time outside of the church, the battle freezes.\n\nThe battle starts as normal, Millenia runs through about 2 different attack patterns before casting the skill \"Zap!\". After casting \"Zap!\" right around the time the animation does damage- the entire battle stops progressing. The battle bar (whatever its called) stops moving forward. Ryudo freezes in the animation position of him being attacked. Millenia also stops moving in a similar manner. However, oddly the music continues and the game seems to respond to me pressing only one button (the one that changes the \"partys\" attack behavior even though its only Ryudo at this point.) However, everything else remains frozen.\n\nI've restarted the game at my previous save before the cutscene//battle multiple times now. Nothing changes. So I spent $20 to play not even what I would call the first hour of the game. \n\n-Side Note- 1/22/2016\nI've currently sent a notice to the customer support, i'm hoping to hear back from them ASAP- as I would really like to enjoy this game and not refund it because its unplayable.\n\nI'm not sure if anyone else has encountered this problem, but judging from the comments below I may be the first. (I cry everytime).\n\nYes, I would recommend this game just based on how great it is storywise.

So two gods have a fight and only the love of humanity can save the world *groan!* There are pretty good features to the game, like the turn-based fighting style was done in a unique way (for when it came out in 2000) and the character diversity is interesting. However, there are some glitches that need to be worked on, there are holes in the plot that are never revisited, and there are parts that are so outrageously annoying, that I actually turned off the sound to my game.\nThe bosses are a lot of fun to fight. They provide a decent challenge but ultimately nothing you can't handle and every dungeon map is unique. Also, there is no need for grinding and that's kind of a double-edge sword. It eliminates circling around a map looking for monsters to kill, but it takes away any motivation to strengthen my characters because it's done for me. So this game might as well be a game about fighting bosses.\nAs far as graphics are concerned, it's fine for when it released on Dreamcast in 2000, but it's embarassing for August 2015.\n\"So, Chiropraptor, is it a buy?\"\nI would say, put it on your wishlist,buy it on sale, and save your money. \nUltimately, I'm going to recommend it, but I'll give it a 5/10", "timestamp_created": 1452851662, "timestamp_updated": 1452851662, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20515366": {"recommendationid": "20515366", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074660405", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2028, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452734176}, "language": "spanish", "review": "No puedo decir otra cosa m\u00e1s que es una obra maestra.\n\n\u00bfPara qu\u00e9 hacer un an\u00e1lisis largo?

So how does this game stand up over the tests of time?\n\nThe graphics are nothing special. I don't really use it as a negative on the game is it would be very unfair to compare graphics from 15 years ago to graphics today. The airwork for the characters, however, is pretty good. It gives a better idea of the character's feelings during the various events in the game.\n\nAs for voice acting, The English voiceacting isn't horrible, especially considering that many games at the time's voice acting was cringe worthy. It is rather odd that some scenes that you would expect there to be voice acting there isn't while other scenes that you would think no voice acting is needed it is present.\n\nAs for the mechanics. The combat system in this game is wonderful. If you simply go by the screenshots you may think it is more or less just turn based combat, which I know many people don't care for these days. However, there is a twist to this. The games action bar adds to some tactics where you, or your enemy, can prevent certain attacks from ever going off.If an enemy is attacking you, unless its magic, they often have to line up your character before the attack goes off. If it is magic, you can use move canceling abilities to cancel the attack and move them close to the beginning of the action timer. I myself have managed to use this in such a way that a boss was never able to get a single attack off on me.\n\nThe leveling system initially is exactly what you would expect. Characters level and their stats go up. You then level their personal skills with what the game calls skill coins, which first unlocks the ability, and then strenghens and speeds up the ability. However, in addition to this you have mana eggs and skill books. Mana eggs are how you give each character their spells and you level the eggs much in the same way as the characters skills, only with magic coins. The same deal works with spells, you first unlock them, then level them increasing power and speed.\n\nLastly there are skill books. These are how you really power up your characters. Ranging from HP/MP to spell strength of certain types to how fast your character can make another move means you can really customize your team.\n\nFor the story, it is more or less your standard JRPG of save the world. It has a few twists and overall it is a enjoyable experience. The characters are likeable and only at times do I find them annoying. The game lasted me roughly 33 hours, which was right around how long it needed to last.\n\nThe game has a few minor bugs here and there but it has a few bigger ones. A bigger one being some mini games, such as the arm wrestling one, worked differently on the Dreamcast controls as far as I'm aware and at first seemed impossible to beat. It isn't game breaking and can still be won if you look up guides steam. A bigger one is random crashes. Now this only happened twice my entire playthrough but if you get this game it would be wise to save when you can. I lost about half an hour of work because of one of these crashes, but while frustrating, it isn't game breaking.\n\nOverall the game is an enjoyable playthrough of older JRPGs.

One of my very few JRPG experiences growing up. Obviously when the news of it being re-released for the PC on Steam, I was very, very happy. It took me awhile to actually get to playing and finishing the game though and I still love the game so much. Full review ahead, with a summary right at the bottom.\n\nCOMBAT\n---------\nPersonally to me, Grandia II is made by its battle system. It's active turn-based, I believe the term is called. The most fun in the game is just playing around with the moves/spells and at times, think on your feet to avoid taking damage or a certain death. Cancelling action is very fun and satisfying when you manage to really just end a battle without expending too much MP or SP nor taking any damage. The combat definitely makes the game, and I played it on Hard, certain boss fights would warrant a different approach of battling rather than the conventional full-offensive style I liked, which brings freshness to the battles and makes the bosses feel very different. if not annoying. Almost every spell available are very useful and some more situational than others. For example, certain monsters has a higher resistance towards an element, so you'll have to figure out what works best in those situations. I'll say that I really do enjoy the combat.\n---------\nRating : 5/5\n\nCharacters\n-----------\nGrandia II has a good variety of different characters and each of them has a story to tell. Character development is a focus in the game, I would say. Ryudo, Elena, Millenia, Roan, Mareg and Tio are all very nicely written characters, each with their own plot development and the way they're used in battle is also different in certain aspects, that they feel unique, if not irreplaceable.\n---------\nRating : 4.5/5\n\nStoryline\n---------\nThe game might have a very cliche \"Battle between Good and Evil\" general overview, but what makes it special is the fragment stories told within the game. Some of the stories over the course of the game can be heart-breaking, while some can be very...lovely. The story ultimately teaches not to follow a faith blindly, and not to be bound by the threads of fate, and be your own master, living the life you want to live. Which I find to be a very good lesson in life. That's not to say that Grandia II doesn't suffer some problems. I, for one, felt that the ending was very strange. For the most parts, the story is good, if not a tad bit predictable, at this day and age, but that doesn't make it bad. The way they wrote some of the stories are very human and relatable.\n---------\nRating : 4/5\n\nSummary\n----------\nI will say that throughout these many years since the game's release, Grandia II still stands as a very entertaining JRPG, if only for the combat system. The story adds to the experience even more and I believe that Grandia II is a game that has aged very well over the years.\n---------\nFinal Rating : 4.5/5", "timestamp_created": 1452479843, "timestamp_updated": 1452479843, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20445275": {"recommendationid": "20445275", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042513136", "num_games_owned": 287, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2762, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475901505}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "S\u00f3, perfeito.

The original Grandia recieved high praise for introducing the ATB battle system - an RPG battle system where a meter is displayed at the bottom of your screen , leading characters up to their \"ACT\" points , and then allowing you to command them . -  to a genre that - at the time - lacked instinct and time management . Not only that , but the game also introduced the concept of movement and placement to its battle system - characters moved based on the actions you command them to do , including having an option to simply \"move\" as an alternate to defending , this would allow players to have characters get out of range when anticipating enemy attacks , get into better position to use their own attack , or to just run really ... whatever . Point is , it added space and active time to turn based battles , making players feel MUCH more involved in their battles and making every move count . Players could also select enemies during battle and see their stats by default ( mind you these default stat menu's look really nice ... I mean not even just for it's time , I love em . ) , and also at times their upcoming moves allowing players to anticipate whats to come , and more importantly - in how much time . \n\nThis installment does a lot of things right , though the story SLIGHTLY generic ( Good vs, Evil , yada yada ) , the gameplay is fast with no random encounters ( as enemies are displayed on the field , allowing you to opt to fight them or not . ) , a simple and to the point level up system ( cause honestly , I hate it when developers try to be too creative . ) , a pretty generic but fun loving cast of characters , and SUPER , COOL , BOSSES . \n\nIn this game 'Valmar' is the dark antagonist of the game and essentially the literal god of Evil . Now while that's cool and all , the spawn of Valmar look like stuff straight out of your nightmares ( ever fought the organs of the F***ing devil ? It gets real pretty quick . )  , and fighting the bosses through the game as a kid led to countless \" Ohhhhh S*** \" moments , something ESSENTIAL for all RPGs . On the other hand , the party of Ryudo and friends ( your party ) , from their character design , and plot , come off as slightly generic . This ISN'T totally a bad thing though , I mean , they're lovable , as each of their characters fit into the story well , compliment each other in dialogue , and are all unique in terms of battle .  \n\nAn RPG I like to play when I want to get away from RPGs , it is extremely simple in formula , but still different and unique in play . A game I personally feel has been overlooked over the years and am glad is available on steam , allowing gamers who missed this experience to get a hold of it , and for many like me to relive a fond classic .", "timestamp_created": 1452144240, "timestamp_updated": 1452144296, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20362385": {"recommendationid": "20362385", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068318488", "num_games_owned": 288, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 164, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455582815}, "language": "english", "review": "B.I.B.L.E. = Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth\n\nthis game blows btw", "timestamp_created": 1452120787, "timestamp_updated": 1458610788, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.353172", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20355470": {"recommendationid": "20355470", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056818479", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1617, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452041051}, "language": "french", "review": "G\u00e9nial, Super, encore !!\n\nJ'y ai jou\u00e9 il y a bien 10-15 ans et le jeu n'a pas pris une ride, c'est que du bonheur de pouvoir y rejouer =D", "timestamp_created": 1452101636, "timestamp_updated": 1452101636, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20347767": {"recommendationid": "20347767", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139628475", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 819, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461583294}, "language": "english", "review": "-Surfing through the steam store-\n\"Oh look, Final Fantasy!\"\n\"Oh look, Skyrim!\"\n\"Oh look, Just Cause!\"\n\"Oh look, Grandia!\"\n\nProceeds to buy Grandia.\n\nOh yes.", "timestamp_created": 1452080003, "timestamp_updated": 1452080003, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20339016": {"recommendationid": "20339016", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023466927", "num_games_owned": 133, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2591, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458966211}, "language": "english", "review": "I am reliving my teenage years playing this game.

Ein wenig unesthetisch waren kleinere Grafikfehler und in vertonten Zwischensequenzen kam der Text mitunter nicht hinter her, wenn gesprochen wurde. Alles in allem weder super noch schlecht umgesetzt. \n\n[b]Story[/b]\nDie Handlung ist eigentlich nix besonderes und strotzt vor Klischees, was jedoch wohl dem Alter geschuldet ist.\nMit einem zugedr\u00fcckten Auge w\u00fcrde ich diese als durschnittlich bewerten.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nDeffinitiv die St\u00e4rke des Spiels. Insbesondere das KS, das einige wirklich interessante M\u00f6glichkeiten bietet und um es zu meistern bedarf es mehr als stumpfes Tastenhauen. W\u00e4hrend des Kampfes befinden sich Gegner sowie die Gruppe in einer Arena, wie man es von anderen Spielen des Genres kennt. Als m\u00f6gliche Aktionen hat man nicht nur eine sondern zwei m\u00f6gliche Standartangriffe. Einen f\u00fcr Schaden und einen, um Gegner in ihren Aktionen zu behindern. Au\u00dferdem kann man w\u00e4hrend des Kampfes Gruppenmitglieder auch \u00fcber das Feld bewegen, was je nach Situation mal mehr mal weniger notwendig ist. Auch das generische \"Blocken\" ist mit dabei. Der Knackpunkt hiter dem System ist jedoch die Zeitleiste unten rechts im Bild, die die Zugreihenfolge anzeigt, die sich st\u00e4ndig \u00e4ndert. Man kann die Reihenfolge beeinflussen, indem man Gegner mit bestimmten Skills angreift, die diese in der Leiste zur\u00fccksto\u00dfen. Die Auswirkung dieser Skills ist st\u00e4rker, wenn der Gegner kurz davor steht, eine Aktion durchzuf\u00fchren. Der Schl\u00fcssel zum Erfolg ist es nun also Gegner, die unangenehme Angriffe vorbereiten, davon abzuhalten, diese einzusetzen.\n(man sieht beim Anvisieren der Gegner, welche Akton auf welchen Kampfteilnehmer diese planen)\nEinen Schadensbonus bekommt man, wenn man Gegner mitten in der Angriffsbewegung trifft. Das KS wird ingame in Tutorials n\u00e4her erl\u00e4utert. Leider reizen auch im Hardmode nur wenige K\u00e4mpfe die M\u00f6glichkeiten des Kampfsystemes wirklich aus, was bedeutet, dass wieder die meisten Bosse einfach nur durch \"pure Force\" besiegt werden k\u00f6nnen, wenn auch dann nur mit etwas Taktik (die Basics muss man drauf haben) was sich dann aber zum Ende hin \u00e4ndert, wo bei einem Boss das \"Laufen\" im Kampf direkt lebensrettend ist und bei einem durch R\u00fccksto\u00df gleich mehrere Gegner in Schach gehalten werden wollen. \n\nZaubern klappt im Spiel durch die Ausr\u00fcstung spezieller Manaeier, die man durch im Kampf erlangte Magiem\u00fcnzen aufstufen kann, indem man neue Zauber freischaltet und diese jeweils bis auf LV5 steigern kann, was diesen eine k\u00fcrzere Zauberzeit und bessere Wirkung beschert. Die Zauber sind allerdings nur auf das Ei begrenzt und nur der Charakter, der es tr\u00e4gt, ist in der Lage, sie zu nutzen. Das Equipment kann jedoch im Kampf ge\u00e4ndert werden.\nFernher besitzt jeder Charakter eigene Spezialangriffe, die man ebenfalls freischalten und aufstufen kann. Das funktioniert nicht \u00fcber Magiem\u00fcnzen sondern Spezialm\u00fcnzen, die es ebenfalls nach K\u00e4mpfen gibt.\nDurch die verschiedenen Ressourcen, die man bekommt und die Vielzahl an M\u00f6glichkeiten, diese zu investieren, kam meiner Meinung nach wirklich Motivation nach K\u00e4mpfen auf, welche durch das Kampfsystem noch gest\u00e4rkt wurde.\nAllgemein ist der Spielfluss in Grandia2 wirklich angenehm und man muss eigentlich nicht gro\u00dfartig grinden, wenn man sowieso immer alles nach Items absucht und einfach alles, was im Weg steht umhaut. \n\nSo gut das auch klingt, gibt es in Grandia2 leider keinerlei optionalen Content bis auf ein \"Zusatzgebiet\" das man nur \u00fcber einem gewissen Zeitrauf aufsuchen kann und wo einige besonders starke Monster rumlaufen, die einge besondere Items bewachen. Das war es dann aber schon an optionalem Content. Desweiteren bietet das Spiel keinerlei Wiederspielwert, was ich pers\u00f6nlich schade finde. Alles in allem finde ich das Gameplay allerdings gro\u00dfartig.\n\n[b]Soundtrack[/b]\nDurchweg gelungen.\n\n\n[u][b]Zusammenfassung[/b][/u]\n[b]Pro[/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Guter Spielfluss\n    [*]Toller Soundtrack\n    [*]filmreife Animationen diverser Skills und Zauber\n    [*]Japanische Sprachausgabe f\u00fcr J-RPG Feeling <3\n    [*]optionaler Hardmode\n[/list]\n\n[b]Contra[/b]\n[list]\n    [*]vereinzelt Grafikfehler\n    [*]klischeebeladene Story\n    [*]kein Wiederspielwert\n    [*]kaum optionaler Content\n[/list]\n\nAlles in allem \u00fcberwiegen in meinen Augen die Vorteile deutlich. F\u00fcrs ein Mal durchzocken ist es auf jeden Fall gut genug und die Grafikfehler schrecken einen echten oldshoolgamer ja wohl nicht ab xD Wer die guten alten J-RPGs liebt, der hat an Grandia2 auf jeden Fall seinen Spa\u00df.\n\nIch hoffe, dass auch der erste und die in Europ nie erschienenen Teile einen Steamport erhalten.

Back during the Dreamcast and Playstaion 1 days there were a number of groundbreaking RPG's and each one brought their own evolution to the genre. They are all very different animals. Grandia 2 is definitely one of those games that were ground breaking for its time and surprisingly not many followed up on its formula. Due to this Grandia 2 is unique even today.\n\nThe first aspect i will review is combat. Combat is solid in this game and fun. It is in semi real time like much of its counterparts of its day. Where it is different is that it is semi 3d and position in battle is important. Sometimes you may even want to reposition or as they call it in this game \"evade\". You just don't spam attack like in most rpgs, you will actually need to defend in some situations. That is because of the IP bar (i Think that's its name). Basically during combat there are icons on the bar that slide down it indicating when their command and action phase are coming up. There are two basic attacks, which is also different from most rpgs of that day. One does more damage the combo because it does two hits, each hit is slightly less damage so that there is some thought required. However the critical hit when used when the target is in its action phase will put them way back down the IP bar interupting their turn. That said the same can happen to you. There is magic also, some AoE, some single target, buffs healing and CC last of which was missing from many games of its time. Unlike some rpgs of that day the CC could be very useful in some situations and give you a major advantage. It's not like every boss is immune to everything either. On a boss that had some serious magic power I manage to silence him. Problem was there were four of him each having different magic and i could not silence them all. This attention to the design in combat sets apart Grandia 2 from many rpgs even today. Combat is not only really fun but downright addictive.\n\nI will review the storyline now without any spoliers whatsoever. The story is unique for a jrpg of its time. Dealing with the concept of evil and good in a unique way for its time. Yeah there are the inevitable Japanese Cliches but they are tastefully done. In comparison many american games have cliches of their own yet just like many japanese games are not thought out to how they will affect the main storyline. In the case of Grandia 2 these were thought out. Thankfully the main Character is not the typcial mold of hero. He's grumpy surly and sometimes down right nasty. He also changes over time. He is by no means evil though. In the beginning of the game he comes off as ammoral, by the end to use a dungeons and dragons term he is more chaotic good. Some of the villains in the game really have the best of intentions, in some cases it is misguided in others purely circumstatantial why it is evil. This attention to detail is what i like about the story in this game.\n\nOn to graphics. I really wish they would've updated the graphics to this game because even today this game would've been the rare 10/10. Yet they didn't. It is the exact same grahics from the dreamcast. The characters aren't as blocky as Final Fantasy Seven but unlike FF7 they have no mouth on the battle screen. In FF7 the combat graphics are ok even for today, Grandia 2 bleh. If not for the combat system and rpg power up and level up elements this game by today's standards would be too ugly to play. \n\nIn terms of role playing aspects. It does that a little differently too. The only game i could compare it too is Blackguards 1. It does not have a perk system except in perhaps the form of skill books. You can't even cast magic without a magic egg so that's different too. What makes these games even slightly similar is they have something akin to AP but even that's different than Blackguards. There are two type of points that can be distributed. Skill points and magic points. These can correspondingly upgrade skills, and the magic eggs that fuel magic. They can also upgrade skill and magic books which of course give stats to skills physical attributes and magic.  Over all a very well thought out and fun system.\n\nIn summary the only point that even today is not a 10/10 is the grapics which is about a 3/10 but only in the combat screen and main map, the cut scenes are nice and the text pictures are nice to both a 6.5/10. Over all an 8/10. Even if you do not like jrpgs if you like any rpgs you will like this game. It also comes with the option for english or japanese vocals.", "timestamp_created": 1451256234, "timestamp_updated": 1451256234, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20012540": {"recommendationid": "20012540", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115406816", "num_games_owned": 249, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 3027, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497919858}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "ja zerei no dreamcast, ps2 e agora no pc. jogo 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1451254573, "timestamp_updated": 1451254573, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19994890": {"recommendationid": "19994890", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004440651", "num_games_owned": 200, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474899837}, "language": "english", "review": "Do what you want because Ryudo is free~ You are Ryudo~\n\nOne hell of a gem from the Sega Deadcast.

Originally an exclusive to the ill-fated Dreamcast, then reappearing as a an unoptimized port on PS2 and PC. It's good to finally see Grandia II come back to PC and look better than ever. I spent many hours over the years playing this game and this is definitely the best way to play it. Shame it doesn't come with the sweet soundtrack the Dreamcast version did. So how does it stack up?\n\nGrandia II is standard JRPG fare. Just done exceptionally well. You get attached to the characters, the dialog is fantastic, serious when it needs to be, heartfelt at times, and hilarious more often than you would think. You'll follow Ryudo, a Geohound (bounty hunter), on his quest to protect a nagging princess for money. What starts off as a simple job becomes you and your newfound friends in a war against God and the Devil. \n\nLet's talk a bit about the gameplay. Which is one of my favorite aspects of this. It works by having a bar in the righthand side of the screen, Your party and the enemy party share this bar, your party and the enemy will wait 3/4 of the way through it and then you can select an action. From here you can select a combo attack (standard attack), critical attack (a single hit that has a Cancel effect), spells, and special moves. Once you've selected your choice, your character will take action. Immediately if a Combo or Critical is selected, or if a Spell or Special is selected, you will need to charge it up. During this time is where the Critical attack comes in handy with it's cancel effect. If enemies are charging up a devestating special, land a Critical, and stop them in their tracks. The enemy will be forced to stop and have to wait to start charging their attack again. This comes in handy and rewards you for having good timing by locking your enemies down. \n\nYou'll also find a standard levelling system with EXP gained at the end of each battle. However, in addition to money you also get Special and Magic coins. These you can spend to level up individual skills and spells for your party. Each character has a set of specials that can be levelled up five times. At the max level, the specials become much quicker to cast, lowering your chance of them being cancelled during battle. Your spells are used by equipping an Egg to a character. These eggs can be swapped between any character and will contain an assortment of different spells. Each spell can also be levelled up to 5 for quicker cast times. This gives you the freedom to prioritize how you want your characters to play out. In addition to specials and spells, you will obtain Skill books in the game. These books, allow you to level up buffs that you can equip to your party members. The Skill books will also use your Special and Magic coins so make sure you use them wisely\n\nThis being a remastered version, you would think the graphics would be a bit more touched up than they are. Textures remain largely the same, characters still don't have mouths, it still looks like an older game. I'm currently playing this on a Surface Book with i7/dGPU. Even well over 1080p, the game does run very well, 30fps locked overworld, 60fps battles. Shadows have been overhauled for this release and are considerably more accurate than the Dreamcast/PS2 versions. Up to 8x AntiAliasing is available as well. All things considered, it looks good for what it is. \n\nOn the technical side, there have been some issues. The game sometimes doesn't like controllers. Personally had issues getting an Xbox One controller to work on it originally. I ended up having to reinstall the drivers for the controller and it now works as it should. There have been times where I've had the audio glitch out for a brief moment. In my 16 hours so far, maybe only a couple times. Gung-Ho has been good about getting the game patched up and I don't expect many issues to linger.\n\nAll in all. If you like JRPG's, you really can't go wrong with Grandia II. It's not the longest game ever. My original playtime on Dreamcast when I was 13 was clocked in around 25-30 hours. Regardless of length, you're getting a great story, a fun battle system with quite a bit of customization, in a great presentation.

Having just played the intro to the game, pretty much anything that is supposed to be timed with music is dead wrong. The intro sequence itself cuts to different parts of music jarringly rather than being perfectly choreographed to the music.\nI linked to this video before https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ugIIqI5Zp0 showing how it should be timed on the DC.\nSpecifically, Elena singing in the church as an example. Look at how the animation is timed with her singing and she stops before she speaks.\nNow here is how it plays out in this version.\nhttps://copy.com/unZTg7pU6EjGrUP9 (Link will be dead by May)\nIt's to me a big problem that puts a strike against what is becoming the best version of the game.\n\nFor what it's worth, ONLY the DC game correctly syncs 100% of everything. Even the old PC version doesn't correctly sync everything.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaolOuJ8sT0\n(You can also see it had the same Audio cutting out/off problems this version had initially)\n\nAccording to a member of GungHo I spoke to, the Source Code they recieved was Hard Coded to 25FPS. Which is baffling. I don't understand it.\nEmulators report the PAL version running in PAL480i50 at 25FPS.; Running in 480p VGA, it runs PAL60 and reports 30FPS and looks a lot smoother than at 25FPS (It is a very visible difference).\n\n Playing the NTSC PS2 version on a 60hzCRT, very clearly when it isn't stuttering while loading data off the disc or slowing down massively. It's running at 30FPS.\nRotating the camera at full speed, there is the normal 30hz on 60hz double image and no stuttering or judder as there would be if it's running at 25FPS (Since there would be a timing mis match. 25 doesn't divide into 60 evenly)\nMaybe the game was coded at 25FPS for performance reasons and then sped up to run at 30FPS somehow? I don't know, it's all very bizarre. \n\n\n[*][b] 4:3 resolution support doesn't seem to work[/b] - Selecting 1024x768, gives me 1365x767 in game. And no matter what manner of trickery I try to do, no 4:3 resolutions work as intended. Or just switch to full screen resolutions. Unselecting \"Keep Aspect Ratio\" makes it funkier!\nUsing 800x600 with and without KAR looks like this.\nhttp://screenshotcomparison.com/comparison/143060\n\n[*] Sound mixing can be hit and miss. And is far too loud by default.\nI don't recall what it was like with the older versions of the game. But the Stereo Panning here just isn't very good. And what is a carry over from older versions is the sound balance. Even with the adjustments in the launcher. It's not quite as good as it could be. But it is of it's time in this department. At least we can make the absurdly loud SFX quieter.\n\n[*]Audio Bit Rates for this port are much much lower than the first PC port.\navg Bit Rate in Anniversary Edition are around 90kbs in 22.05Khz .Ogg Stereo.\n\nWhere as, in the OG PC port, it uses constant Bit Rates of ~353 Kbps 22.05Khz PCM Mono.\n\n[*][b]Game has issues with non perfect 16:9 ARs [/b]- It doesn't like un-perfect 16:9 1.7777777777777777777777777777778 resolutions. 1366x768 is 1.7786458333333333333333333333333, so the game automatically uses 1365x767 (Rounded down from 1365x767.8125) which is a perfect 16:9 instead causing the picture to be soft and ugly.\n\n[*]FMVs for Spell overlays and CG movies are all still super low res and low bitrate. It's not something that could be helped unfortunately unless they were to recreate them from scratch or were able to find the original render data and make use of it. And given the number of copies sold of the game. This might not have been a worthwhile effort.\n\nCG cutscenes (.MKV container)are variable in resolution, but almost always sub 480p in the range of 320xW in MPEG-4/AVC\n\nSpells are in ye-old MPEG-1 format.\n\n[/list]\n\n\nMy only two wishes at this point are that they fix the Event Timing issues and 60FPS outside of battle can be achieved!

You just basically follow the linear storyline with VERY RESTRICTED EXPLORATION. \n- Maybe this is just my opinion, but even in its HD version, the visual still looks pretty ugly to me.\n- Some skills have annoying, ugly, unskippable animation that hurt my eyes. It's understandable because this game is basically a remastered version of an old game. It still uses the same animation from ages ago. \n- This game doesn't support wide screen, but it's understandable. \n\nOverall, Grandia 2 Anniversary Edition is a good JRPG. This game might be considered as one of the best on its era. What about now? It has aged well. But even so, it's still a good game with more improvements. The developer themselves have shown their care about the fans by fixing early glitches and bugs. It runs very well now. \n\nI'll give this game an 8/10. A good addition for JRPG fans library.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1450602458, "timestamp_updated": 1450602458, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506984", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19780955": {"recommendationid": "19780955", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102811123", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 73, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488635378}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "What an iconic game of SEGA Dreamcast console.

One day they get the mission to escort a girl, Elena, to a tower so she can renew the seal on some ancient evil. The sealing ceremony fails and Elena gets posessed by the Wings of Valmar. Ryudo gets another job - to escort Elena to the Pope so he can destroy the Wings. \n\nYou progress linear through the world. There are cities with NPCs to talk to (their lines change according to the progress of the story), houses to visit and to restock your supplies. Between two cities you'll have a forest or mountain path with monsters and items. In the cities there are dungeons with bosses. Those dungeons often feature some small puzzles. Once you leave a city, there won't be a reason to return however (I guess it makes sense in the context of the story, an ancient evil doesn't want to wait for you to finish catching goldfishes). \n\nThe battle system is absolutely great imo. There is an action time bar that includes your characters as well as the monsters. Once a character hits the COM/ACT separator, you'll have to select his move. You can choose from a normal and a critical attack (the critical attack will throw an enemy back in the ATB which can be handy when you see that they're ready to cast a spell/make a strong attack), a special attack (uses SP and is unique to a character), a magic spell (uses MP and a Mana Egg*) or an item. You can also skip a move and defend or change your character's position on the battlefield. *Mana Eggs contain a set of magic spells and can be equipped, so it's up to you to decide who is to use what kinds of spells. \n\nThe graphics look dated even in the special edition and the game doesn't support 16:9 ratio, so keep that in mind if that's important to you. This port also has a few small visual glitches. By now they probably patched away any bigger ones (another good thing about this port, they actually worked on some improvements after releasing it. Unlike... other companies.).\n\nThe music is absolutely great and creates atmosphere. \n\nIn summary, if you enjoy RPGs and aren't a graphics snob, give Grandia II a shot. It's a great game!\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1449777830, "timestamp_updated": 1449777830, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.996004", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19581308": {"recommendationid": "19581308", "author": {"steamid": "76561198239605122", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449455599}, "language": "english", "review": "Few cons:\n\n-There are moments in the game where the lack of bgm is painfully obvious and it was just dead silence as you punch the X button away (I played using my dualshock controller).

The meaning behind the what was intended is still somewhat similar.\n-The script/game sometimes paused for a moment and you go, omg it's going to die on me but it only happen once to me.\n\nPros:\n-Quirky script\n-Beautiful landscape and buildings\n-Love how the developer from then incorporated CG art and minor 3D style.\n-Simple to pick up battle system\n-Characters that you may come to like or hate (I like Milennia)\n-Few implemented mini game\n-Classic JRPG that you just can't put down once you started if you are a big fan of such games\n\nThere are bugs in the game but did that stop me from fully enjoying the game? No. I still enjoyed it, I love the battle system and I love the weird/epic storyline. Just remember to turn off the 60fps as it really just make the entire game lag.", "timestamp_created": 1449663580, "timestamp_updated": 1449663749, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19533029": {"recommendationid": "19533029", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010407553", "num_games_owned": 649, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1923, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449428811}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u0438\u0437 \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0438\u0445 jRPG \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0445 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d!

It's been a while since I played Grandia and playing the second game has been fun. The buttons without a controller is slightly confusing but once you get the hang of it. It's really not too bad.

The major issue, a desync of background music in cutscenes that only is really bothering in one or two of them, however will most likely not be fixed.\n\nGrandia II was a Dreamcast RPG, featuring the Geohound - hand for hire - Ryudo in his quest to save the Songstress Elena when she visits a ceremony. Of course, the ceremony goes wrong and it soon is apparent that the whole world might be in danger.\n\nGraphics: The graphics are for their time nicely done 3D maps with animated videos for spells. They fit in nicely into the battles, but have to be watched every single time, which can be around 20 seconds, depending on the spell. From today's perspective, the graphics don't hold up anymore, but a lot is done with mimics in speech boxes, which works very fine until today. However, in the 3D world the characters are without a proper face, it very much looks dated nowadays. Everything looks flat with some objects put on top of that, very unreal and in some cases even the textures can clearly be seen repeating.\n\nMusic and Sound: The sound still holds up, the music is excellent, but the voice acting only happens at certain points and then also partially inconsistent - not in quality which is very high, but in which scenes are acted and which are without voice. All in all, there could have been more, but what is there is very well done. The voice actors know how to express emotions.\n\nGameplay: Well, the gameplay is simple. You walk around, fight, etc. - standard RPG gameplay. The world is very linear, backtracking is quasi nil as every few levels or so the previous ones can't be accessed anymore. Still the levels are worth exploring because almost everywhere is another item to be found. Some of the puzzles are interesting, but usually they are just \"press button X to open door Y\". There are a two minigames but they exhaust themselves fast - you can do an arm wrestling and a nut catching which is both fun for a bit, but especially in the nut catching case gets boring fast. One can say the gameplay is mainly based on the story, and that is one that is well written, holds a few surprises, but may be predictable for people who know their RPG tropes. There are saving points where one can completely recover himself, and they are never too rare. At the least it has a lot of character development, and the characters grow to your heart - and each others...\n\nBattle System: So the battle system is where the game will fall or stand. All battles are done on a 2D plane with a maximum of 4 vs. 6 characters (one boss has more than 6, but that is an exception). Every character, monster or player, advances on an IP scale in the UI that determines when he can attack. The clou is that you have a certain distance between command and attack, so if you time it right, you can attack while the enemy is in that distance. This slows the enemy for a moment or if you do certain attacks costs him quite some space there, canceling his attack as well. You find books and eggs during the game that give additional attributes to your character or magic. Good: Every character can equip every egg, skills in the books can be individually equipped. So do you want rather the egg with few attacks but a lot of healing to be used by Ryudo or Elena? And what egg should the other characters use?\nRPG typically there are some status effects and bonuses you can apply during the battle or granted by what you wear. For example, if you sleep or are paralyzed your character moves to the very back of the IP gauge and can't do anything until healed. A special status only for enemies is being spellbound. It is applied by only one special attack and it has pretty much only one use in the game - but that one is needed if you play on hard.\nWhat also must be noted is that characters that stand close together or in a line can be hit by spells with that range, others target the whole party or just a single character, so it has another tactical component there as well. In many cases you will just use the magic or move that kills all enemies at once, however, and it flattens to choosing the spell based on if it is the special range (read: circle around the enemy) or all enemies.\n\nThe hard mode is a new addition to the game, not seen in the original. It makes enemies tougher, adjusts their stats, etc. With this, the game becomes challenging at times, before it was just a breeze to go through and now it is mostly a breeze to go through, but gets tricky towards the end. Better don't waste your good irreplacable items, especially those that fill up your points for the special attacks, or you will find yourself in need of them eventually! Yes, this is pretty much one of the very few games where I had to use items in a battle to win.\n\nSo what do I think about the game? It is marvellous, a masterpiece, despite its flaws. When it comes to the actual gameplay, the story is paced good enough to keep one going, and only gets annoying when there is an overly long sequence without a saving point. The battle system is well done and motivating, the possibility to level up what you want to use instead of just being it granted by level or item does the game very good. All in all I can only recommend this game. I paid 15 Euro for it and I feel that it was worth the price, even though I had played it long long ago in the earlier PC release.\n\nSince this is the only version with the hard mode, this version is the way to go. Alternatively you can try the earlier version and find a mod that makes it challenging, or just play through it as it originally was and don't expect a challenge.\n\nRecommended? Yes! The game is around 30 hours long (hard mode), then you have all achievements and no replayability, but those 30 hours are great.", "timestamp_created": 1447624010, "timestamp_updated": 1447624404, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 43, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.718356", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19096623": {"recommendationid": "19096623", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998129955", "num_games_owned": 336, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2199, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1447548528}, "language": "english", "review": "Great music, sick combat system, actually relatable and credible character cast, nice aesthetics...\n\nThe only downsides are rare crashes (3 in 25+ hours), and the nice but very long spell animations that can be tiring after a while.\nIf you want to discover a great J-RPG, this is a very solid choice.", "timestamp_created": 1447602447, "timestamp_updated": 1447602447, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19091573": {"recommendationid": "19091573", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044953546", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453031088}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, solid story line, lovable in depth characters that will make you not want to stop playing", "timestamp_created": 1447585807, "timestamp_updated": 1479967837, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19063961": {"recommendationid": "19063961", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048125912", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3235, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457496942}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely one of the greats!

It\u2019s the BEST jRPG, by FAR.\n\nThis is a re-port of what you might have played before on the Dreamcast, and it\u2019s supposed to bring you the legit Dreamcast version experience. It does that pretty well with some tolerable flaws.\nI\u2019ll break my review down in two sections, if you\u2019ve played the original Dreamcast version, go right along, otherwise if you\u2019re wondering why I said this is the best jRPG and stuff, skip to the bottom section.\n\n[h1](Review as a Port)\nREAD THIS IF YOU\u2019VE PLAYED THE ORIGINAL DREAMCAST VERSION:[/h1]\n\nThis was written based off the [u]1.06 update[/u].\nThis version has some worse aspects and better ones, and I personally concluded that it retains about 95% of the original DC experience (IMO the PS2 version has about 75% and the old PC port about 80% in comparison).\n\n-THE BAD-\nIn comparison to the DC version (mostly bad aspects):\n\n-\tBATTLES\nRuns flawlessly smooth at 60 fps, normal attack voices are present (otherwise I wouldn\u2019t even have finished this version). Some very very few effects are missing and there are small sound cuts on spells, however it only applies to spell sounds and never to character voices.\n-\tDUNGEON/TOWN EXPLORING\nWhen roaming around on some dungeons and inside houses, it has some fps drops of about 5~10 fps (so to about 20~25 fps since outside battles the game always runs at 30 fps). It\u2019s not a big deal and it doesn\u2019t affect the gameplay at all.\n-\tCUTSCENES\n[strike]Cutscenes have a slight desynch and the longer they last (as a single cutscene), the worse it gets. This is not a big deal, most cutscenes are fine and personally I was only bothered with 5~7 cutscenes total in the entire game, in which I recommend rewatching them on youtube later.[/strike]\nEDIT: This only applies to when playing the game with japanese voices, it's totally in sync with english voices.\n\n-THE GOOD-\nSo what\u2019s BETTER in this version?\nCleaner and better-defined textures, very nice shadow effects, FullHD resolution, individual volume adjusters (including for the steps that used to be loud in the DC version), dual language, and Hard mode. Widescreen can\u2019t quite be mentioned as a plus as it only stretches the screen, but it looks fine enough and I find it worth using. This is the definitive/best port of the DC version with some aspects that are better, and others worse.\n\nHard mode makes normal enemies tougher and hit harder but they\u2019re still easy overall, Hard mode is most noticeable on bosses and makes the game quite better overall. You will most likely get a game over on endgame bosses unless you\u2019re properly prepared. Buffs/debuffs gain a lot more value in here as well as the ability to switch equips/eggs during battle. Although I do find that some bosses have too much HP in Hard mode, overall it makes this (otherwise very easy) game even better overall.\n\nSo, IF you wanna replay this ridiculously good game and still own a Dreamcast and have a handy 4:3 SDTV near you, you might wanna ponder on which one to play, depending if you can tolerate the imperfections of this awesome-but-not-perfect PC port.\nIf you don\u2019t have a DC anymore, don\u2019t bother buying one, buy this version!\n\n[h1](Review as a Game)\nREAD THIS IF YOU DIDN\u2019T PLAY THE ORIGINAL DREAMCAST VERSION:[/h1]\n\nSo like I said before, it\u2019s one of the best jRPGs ever made. It\u2019s on par with the huge titles that are Star Ocean 3 and 4, Grandia 3 and a couple of other few games.\nFirst of all, this game, along with the rest of the Grandia franchise, features the best battle system ever made in a JRPG, called Ultimate Action Battle System. It\u2019s best to describe it as a mixture of Final Fantasy/Chrono Trigger/Lunar with Star Ocean/Tales of. It mixes the solid (and yet stiff) turn-based elements with the fast, dynamic and fun action elements. It accomplishes the battle system perfection that Final Fantasy games wish they EVER had (FFXIII surely tried and failed miserably at it), and what Chrono Trigger and Lunar (Lunar franchise is also from GAME ARTS) did try to achieve and partially did.\n\nThat said, the Grandia franchise despite not having relevant sale figures to boast about, it eats the \u201cmost successful jRPG franchise\u201d Final Fantasy for breakfast.\nComparing games that came out at similar dates/generations: Grandia 1 > Final Fantasy 7, Grandia 2 > Final Fantasy X (and I love FFX), and Grandia 3 > Final Fantasy XII.\n\nI only mentioned the battle system so far, and although being a very core aspect of a jRPG, the good points don\u2019t stop there.\nBesides the battle system, here\u2019s what Grandia games (excluding Xtreme) share among them:\n\n-\tFun and interesting interaction with NPCs: in many jRPGs it\u2019s boring to check and talk to NPCs, but not here. Characters freely speak often, sometimes throw a pun, etc.\n-\tBig interaction among core characters and big character development, also meal moments where you can learn a lot about them.\n-\tAmazing soundtracks by composer Noriyuki Iwadare that in his own way is on par with the \u201cgiants\u201d Nobuo Uematsu (FF music) and *cough* the gaming music god Motoi Sakuraba (Star Ocean, Tales of and a BUNCH of other japanese games\u2019 music)\n-\tThere are no party reserves. Your party has a max of 4 characters that will rotate according to events in the story. Some leave and others join in. This actually makes for stronger and more plot-driven \u2018moments\u2019 in the story (as well as a bigger sense of \u2018adventure\u2019), giving more replay value to a game.\n-\tNo need for guides, just play and enjoy. Although there\u2019s no backtracking (on Grandia 1 and 2) and there are missable items, if you explore well enough you can get everything on your own. They\u2019re simple and linear but not boring at the same time. Grandia 2 has a couple of optional Mana Eggs and Skill Books, but they\u2019re not hard to find them at all. And if you\u2019re gonna use a guide, a simple quick look is all it will require.\n\nSo, back to Grandia 2, although I prefer Grandia 1 in other aspects (character development) and Grandia 3 overall (combat, customization, character design), Grandia 2 is the best in the franchise in regards to story/plot imho. The story is amazing, it\u2019s a pity though that cutscenes are desynched in audio/video for the Japanese voices and not \u201cperfect\u201d like in the original NTSC-J Dreamcast version, of which I still own an original copy.\nIt has a fun and diverse build customization along Grandia\u2019s battle system that will much more often yield rewarding results rather than bad, thanks to how balanced this game is.\nI often felt a bit lost in customization during my Hard mode run as there are so many ways to have a strong party, some of which may involve making a tanker, dodger+counter, high STR with +hitcount or MAG with high ACT stat with warp or a quick runner to make criticals cancel more smoothly. You can also level up specifically what you want at your own discression, making the game really dynamic and still enjoyable even if you\u2019re replaying it.\nI highly recommend this game to both jRPG newbies (the game is VERY user-friendly in Normal mode because it\u2019s really easy) and veterans that despite not having much of a challenge except for endgame bosses in Hard mode, they\u2019ll enjoy the hell out of this game.\n\nDid I mention that the game has some songs in Portuguese (not brazilian) and that I happen to be a Portuguese guy?

The story is a very strong point, coupled with a unique battle system and skill/moves/magic learning system that takes time and effort to master (I loved this aspect). This game will satisfy those who want unique characters with good development and carefully chosen times for social reward. The plot is dark, edgy, good, and has its very deep moments. \n\nRegarding linearity, it is not quite open world and the game makes it very clear where you should go next (which is good at times because the story is quite engaging). Sounds linear, but the game offers so much freedom with how you want to set up your character, so you don't feel as tied down overall as you would expect.\n\nThe downsides:\nNot many but it suffers from just being a port, rather than a full remake. The polished character models, buildings, and 60FPS battles are nice, but it still feels like a slight chore to have to navigate through towns and dungeons with the camera zoomed in as close to the character as it is. However, this is nitpicking and barely hinders playability. Also, like any old full 3D console JRPG, some of the special moves and spells take a while to watch and you can't skip them.\n\nVerdict: Most definitely play if you are a fan of the genre, or are looking for a great game in the genre. Should take between 30-35 hours to beat. I have played many in the genre, and I thoroughly enjoyed this title.

It's now 2015, and it still manages to be one of, if not the best, RPG battle systems the genre has to offer, perhaps only outdone by the subsequent releases in the series. Just thought I would get that out of the way. If the game had no other positive aspects, it would still at least lay claim to that lofty accolade pretty effortlessly.\n\nThe rest of the game has not aged as gracefully as the battle system, however.\n\nFirst of all, the PC port is solid. It started off rough, but GungHo has done a pretty great job of releasing quick patches and fixes to the point now that it has ALMOST become the definitive edition of the game. There are still some audio and graphical hitches here and there and at least once during my close to 40 hours playing, the game shut down after a random battle (and I'm told that this might be more common for other people than it was for me). \n\nStability aside, this port also has a hard mode that brings it closer to what the difficulty should have been to begin with, though honestly I still had very little trouble in general. Oh, and it's NOT widescreen. This doesn't bother me so much personally, as I usually play these re-releases for the nostalgia anyway. So the closer it is to the original, the better. I can't imagine it would have been too terribly hard to implement, though, so at least the option would have been nice. And don't set your expectations too high for the so-called \"improved visuals.\" All it is is a few randomly selected textures that have been cleaned up and some wonky lighting and shadows thrown in for no apparent reason (it's not as distracting as I make it sound).\n\nWhat really set me back a bit was the story itself. It gets a lot...cheesier near the end than I remember. To be fair, though, I was an angsty teen the first time I went through it. It almost feels like two different teams wrote the dialogue for the game. On the one hand, you have the casual banter with your party and townsfolk that is very well done. Ryudo in particular makes a few comments throughout the game that feel genuinely clever and play into his persona quite well.  In fact, the best characterization in general I feel is done through this casual dialogue, which makes me wonder if the localization team was given a bit more leeway with their translations when it was not necessarily story-sensitive dialogue.\n \nThen you have the...I don't know, \"main story\" dialogue in cutscenes that tends to get ridiculously cheesy and cringe worthy. Let me put it this way, if you were playing a drinking game near the end of the game for every time someone said \"heart,\" you would die of alcohol poisoning within the first cutscene you hit. Then add to that some really random \"power-of-the-heart\" jumps in logic (like, where the hell did Ryudo get that sword!?), and the total story package seems just a little less impactful for me than it did fifteen years ago. Still, it's almost always light and happy, so I can't rag on it too much. The sense of adventure is there most of the time, though it loses out to the original in that aspect when it instead attempts to philosophize about the human spirit.\n\n....I hope that didn't scare anyone away. The characters are still overall interesting and funny and entertaining, and I still wholeheartedly recommend the game. More than anything, though, it makes me wish some development team (with a great writing staff) would pick the property back up and give us a number 4.

A partir de ese punto dar\u00e1 comienzo una aventura en la que nuestros h\u00e9roes conocer\u00e1n a mas amigos, cruzaran todo el mundo e incluso llegaran al espacio con el fin de derrotar al mal que asola el planeta. Como acabo de decir un JRPG cl\u00e1sico.\n\n\nHistoria\n\nLa historia tiene que ser uno de los puntos fuertes de cualquier JRPG, el caso del Grandia II no es una excepci\u00f3n. En mi opini\u00f3n la historia cumple perfectamente con su cometido, motivarnos a seguir jugando. Tiene \u201cepicidad\u201d y momentos dram\u00e1ticos pero tambi\u00e9n tiene partes en las que los protagonistas se lo toman con un poco mas de calma.\nNo creo que sea la mejor historia que llegues a ver pero no cabe duda de que no te vas a aburrir.\n8/10\n\n\nJugabilidad\n\nEste sin duda es el punto en el que m\u00e1s sobresale el Grandia II ya cuenta con uno de los mejores sistemas de combates por turnos que he podido ver, pero vayamos paso a paso.\nEn primer lugar tenemos la Jugabilidad global ( no s\u00e9 si esto tiene un nombre, yo lo llamo as\u00ed) ,es decir, la parte del juego en la que no estamos en combate ni navegando por ning\u00fan men\u00fa. No hay mucho que decir al respecto lo \u00fanico que hay que destacar es que el sistema de control de c\u00e1mara puede resultar un poco detestable las primeras horas de juego. Por lo dema cumple con lo esperado (al pulsar \u201cX\u201d al lado de un personaje hablas con \u00e9l y esas cosas\u2026).\nPor otra parte tenemos los men\u00fas. En esta secci\u00f3n hay que destacar el sistema de obtenci\u00f3n de habilidades. Al contrario que otros juegos JRPG todos los ataques y habilidades se consiguen al matar monstruos los cuales al terminar cada combate te dar\u00e1n unos cuantos puntos especiales y m\u00e1gicos que son utilizados para mejorar tu personaje. \u00bfA quien no se le ha olvidado nunca conseguir una invocaci\u00f3n en un final fantasy? En grandia II eso es bastante dif\u00edcil que pase. Por otro lado pierde un poco el encanto que tiene el buscar invocaciones especiales por el mundo adelante.\nEn cuanto a los objetos poco que destacar. Los hay a la vista, escondidos, dropeados por monstruos y obtenibles cumpliendo determinados eventos. En este caso s\u00ed que te puedes dejar alguno. \nUn peque\u00f1o inciso que no s\u00e9 donde poner: Las magias pueden ser aprendidas por todos los personajes mediante eggs pero las skills especiales son \u00fanicas para cada uno.   \nPara terminar hablemos de la mec\u00e1nica de combates por turnos que tiene. Este sistema es basten parecido al de Child of light, es anterior a este cronol\u00f3gicamente pero a su vez esta mucho m\u00e1s desarrollado. En combate tendr\u00e1s informaci\u00f3n del HP de tu enemigo (siempre que no supere un l\u00edmite), MP, SP, estados alterados, de cuando es tu turno para atacar, sabes cu\u00e1ndo va a atacar el enemigo, a quien va a atacar, muchas veces incluso que ataque va a usar y si llega tu turno de atacar incluso podr\u00e1s hacer que retroceda d\u00e1ndole un componente t\u00e1ctico al combate.\nEn definitiva un sistema de combate m\u00e1s que sobresaliente.\n9.5/10\n\n\nGr\u00e1ficos \n\nComo es de esperar esto no es Final Fantasy XV, es un juego del a\u00f1o 2000 y los graficos son acordes a esa \u00e9poca. La referencia conocida m\u00e1s cercana podr\u00eda ser FFVIII que si no recuerdo mal es del 1999, en cuanto a cinem\u00e1ticas el FFVIII es un claro ganador debido a que las del Grandia II al estar escaladas se pixelan. Pero en cuanto al dise\u00f1o de personajes 3D me decanto m\u00e1s por la est\u00e9tica del Grandia II.\nPoner una nota a los gr\u00e1ficos de un juego del 2000 es demasiado dif\u00edcil asi que simplemente dir\u00e9 que le doy un aprobado.\n\n\nComparaci\u00f3n con la antigua versi\u00f3n de PC\n\nA menos de una semana tras salida de la versi\u00f3n de Steam a mi me parec\u00eda superior la antigua versi\u00f3n ya que hab\u00eda una cantidad de bugs en el juego que o bien eran arrastrados de la versi\u00f3n anterior o se hab\u00edan formado nuevos quiz\u00e1s por la conversi\u00f3n del juego a una resoluci\u00f3n de hasta 4K. Pero por suerte en las consecutivas semanas se fueron lanzando parches que no solo corrigieron todos los bugs que yo ten\u00eda apuntados para hacer este an\u00e1lisis sino que incluso implementaron cosas como los 60 FPS en batalla que ya estaban en las antiguas versiones pero algunos jugadores echaban de menos. \nEn resumen gana la versi\u00f3n de Steam sobre la versi\u00f3n cl\u00e1sica.\nEn lo personal este es mi juego preferido, el que marc\u00f3 mi infancia e hizo del genero JRPG mi favorito pero no quiero ser un fanboy por lo que aqu\u00ed va una lista de los factores negativos de este juego\n\n\nDesventajas\n\n1 La c\u00e1mara ( La cual ya ha sido explicada en el apartado de jugabilidad)\n2 Falta de misiones secundarias (Aunque me llevo casi 40 horas pasarme una \u00fanica vez el juego en el hard mode intentando descubrir todos los secretos)\n3 Falta de postgame (Una vez terminas el juego como mucho puedes volver a empezarlo desde 0,  aun as\u00ed creo que se desbloquea alg\u00fan item nuevo en esa partida)\n4  Carencia de bosses opcionales en el juego.\n5  No est\u00e1 traducido al espa\u00f1ol ( Aunque con 10 a\u00f1os no ten\u00eda ni idea de ingl\u00e9s y me lo pase genial jugando, hoy en d\u00eda sigo sin tener mucha idea)\n6 Las pocas cinem\u00e1ticas prerenderizadas del juego est\u00e1n pixeladas. \n\n\nPara finalizar hay que responder a esta pregunta: \u00bfVale la pena gastarse 19,99 en este juego?\nRespuesta r\u00e1pida: Mi religi\u00f3n me impide comprarme juegos que no est\u00e9n rebajados.\nRespuesta larga: No, tarde o temprano habr\u00e1 unas rebajas en las que el juego cueste 15 euros o menos en mi opini\u00f3n por ese precio s\u00ed que deber\u00eda de ser comprado (pero no me hag\u00e1is mucho caso porque soy un poco rata) \n\n\nNota objetiva del juego: 8,75 / 10\nNota subjetiva 15/10", "timestamp_created": 1444762120, "timestamp_updated": 1444762185, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530602", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18455684": {"recommendationid": "18455684", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002332203", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1000, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1444665347}, "language": "german", "review": "Endlich wieder Grania 2!!!

Grandia IMO has one of the best combat systems in RPG history. The story alone is very well done, and there is a lot of interaction between characters and NPC. Gungho has worked really hard to fix the bugs that exsisted when it first came to Steam and i have to give them so many props for that. I couldn't play the original PC version back in the day (still have my CDs) because of bad memory leaks and crashes, i am grateful to finally be able to play the PC version as it should be. With the added bonus of a Hard difficulty. \n\nTips for newbies: GRIND, GRIND, GRIND! You don't have to go nuts, but getting Ryudos Tenseikin Slash up to Max early on in game is a handy stradegy. Once you get to Baked Planes, you can also farm Defense Seeds from the enemies there if you choose to. Make sure you save your Skill Points and Magic Coins, i personally have this thing where i don't spend until i get to around 2,000 of both so i can max out a skill or magic right away - early game.\n\nAlso, check everywhere, it is really easy to miss things on the map such as armor and Poff nuts. \n\nIf you want a challenge, you can keep pressing on, but bosses can pose a major problem especially with cancel spells. \n\nAll in all, this game speaks massive nostalgia. If you love classic games and JRPGs in general, Grandia is for you. Grandia plays differently from most RPGs in a good way. \n\nThank you Gungho for continuing to patch the bugs and for keeping us updated!

Having wanted a solid JRPG to play for a while this seemed like a good chance to play an old classic I missed. The port was actually pretty bad when i started with it, but within' a week or two they fixed most of the crashing bugs and some atypical issues, and reset the audio files to a more modern grade and proper looping. In my three weeks out due to moving they even patched up some move bugs like Tio's 4th skill to work properly. Overall they went from poor launch to a solid port and keep working on it people see issues so thumbs up for that.\nNot much needed for me to say on the game, cult classic that I agree holds firmly to it's titles. The story was a bit cliche' and the characters kinda progress a little abruptly scene to scene but was enjoyable and well written none the less. The graphics were really nice and largely charming for their own visual style. The music was overall pretty good and had some stand out themes that i really took to memorizing the 'Dangerous Zone' or The town themes. The Combat was a nice backbone to the game giving it a tactical style ATB centered arround exploiting and guarding against openings duration action wind-up. The combat wasn't really hard at all but bosses and later game management left a satifying challenge and story to it and a nice variety of foes to kept it interesting through and through.\nOverall ,minus waiting out the bugs from the port which have been mostly rectified pretty promptly, this was a great game and worth while for anybody that likes JRPGs.", "timestamp_created": 1444164204, "timestamp_updated": 1444164204, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18339095": {"recommendationid": "18339095", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028114601", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1830, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514781849}, "language": "english", "review": "Anyone who doesn't have Grandia 2 under their belt is missing out.\nFantastic game, relatable and inspiring characters with a great turn based combat system and skill system to match.\n\nFor those of you with a keen ear Ryudo is voiced by Cameron Clarke, or as 90's kids would have known him Leonardo from the tmnt cartoon.

The last time is what broke me however, it didn't happen in the middle of the last boss fight nor did it happen after 2-3 hours of saveless grinding.\n\nThe last time this game crashed on me was in the middle of the ending (post 1 year after portion). \n\nI will always promote that people should really get into the Grandia games but not the steam version of Grandia 2.", "timestamp_created": 1443762819, "timestamp_updated": 1443762819, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501670", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18284904": {"recommendationid": "18284904", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091094757", "num_games_owned": 422, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1933, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476803737}, "language": "english", "review": "This is why I bought the dreamcast.\n\nThis game alone was the reason for, and validation, for purchasing an entire gaming system.

Sua hist\u00f3ria gira em torno da velha f\u00f3rmula da luta do bem contra o mal, com o jogador assumindo o papel do personagem principal Ryudo que \u00e9 um mercen\u00e1rio e aceita um trabalho que n\u00e3o sai como o esperado, o que d\u00e1 inicio \u00e0 hist\u00f3ria do jogo. A progress\u00e3o da hist\u00f3ria \u00e9 dada de forma linear, com o grupo de personagens visitando vilas e recebendo as quests, que geralmente direcionam para alguma dungeon, que direciona o grupo de personagens para outro local e assim por diante. O ciclo vila/dungeon/vila/dungeon \u00e9 uma constante durante todo o jogo mas n\u00e3o compromete o andamento do mesmo, j\u00e1 que Grandia 2 conta com um sistema de batalha excente, empolgante e inovador (para o ano que foi lan\u00e7ado. Grandia 2 \u00e9 um RPG do ano 2000) que revigora completamente o estilo, fugindo do sistema de batalha mon\u00f3tono que era regra at\u00e9 ent\u00e3o (como os sistemas de batalha dos Final Fantasies da \u00e9poca, e muitos outros).\n\nO dito sistema de batalha \u00e9 uma mistura entre um sistema de turnos e um sistema real time, com os personagens correndo e lutando pelo campo de batalha, o que lembra um pouco o sistema da s\u00e9rie Tales of. Para um melhor entendimento do sistema sugiro que assistam um video no youtube.\n\nApesar do jogo ter um ciclo repetitivo como mencionado anteriormente, a hist\u00f3ria apesar de tratar de um tema batido \u00e9 narrada de forma interessante, o que \u00e9 alcan\u00e7ado gra\u00e7as ao grupo de personagens que s\u00e3o todos carism\u00e1ticos, o que \u00e9 uma marca registrada desses JRPGs antigos. As m\u00fasicas s\u00e3o todas excelentes e marcantes, n\u00e3o sendo nenhuma surpresa se o jogador em quest\u00e3o se pegar em algum momento cantarolando ou assoviando algum dos temas.\n\nTudo o que foi escrito aqui at\u00e9 ent\u00e3o se trata de um resumo do jogo em sua forma original, mas como percebe-se o titulo carrega o famigerado \"Anniversary Edition\", e o que isso quer dizer?\n\nQuer dizer que o jogo sofreu melhorias tais como:\n\nDublagem japonesa que n\u00e3o existia at\u00e9 ent\u00e3o nas vers\u00f5es lan\u00e7adas no ocidente\n\nPossibilidade de jogar no Hard Mode, o que \u00e9 muito bem vindo, uma vez que Grandia 2 sempre foi considerado um jogo extremamente f\u00e1cil\n\nGr\u00e1ficos melhorados com novos efeitos de sombra e ilumina\u00e7\u00e3o.\n\nAumento de frames, o que faz com que o jogo rode a 60 FPS.\n\nE por ultimo possui achievements (conquistas steam) e cartas colecion\u00e1veis steam.\n\nLevando tudo isto em considera\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 facil indicar Grandia 2, que tem nesta Anniversary Edition sua melhor vers\u00e3o at\u00e9 agora. Se o jogador n\u00e3o se importar com a linearidade do jogo e com a hist\u00f3ria simples, ter\u00e1 em m\u00e3os um bom RPG que ir\u00e1 durar aproximadamente entre 20 a 40 horas de gameplay.\n\nRecomendo este jogo a todos que gostem de um bom JRPG cl\u00e1ssico, principalmente aos que procuram JRPGs considerados underground que em dado momento carecem da aten\u00e7\u00e3o dada a outras s\u00e9ries de sucesso como Final Fantasy.", "timestamp_created": 1443506081, "timestamp_updated": 1443507452, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18230224": {"recommendationid": "18230224", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098099671", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 3024, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501863299}, "language": "english", "review": "Im really glad to see this game on steam.

They are actually completely unlinked games in the style of the Final Fantasy series, I can't even recall any obvious simiralities, but it has been quite a while since I played the first Grandia.\n\nThis game is extremely linear. There are no side quests or anything. You get the main history or nothing. I do not think I missed anything because I am the kind of player that needs to speak to everyone and invade every house every time I hit a new town. Is this good or bad? You tell me, this is a matter of opinion.\n\nThe characters are quite interesting, each in their way, and the main ones have a pretty good development.\nThe history is good as well. Plenty of turns, ups and downs that makes sense and wraps up well, mysteries that keep you engaged, and a few surprises. You only get the cheesy over emotional parts with existencial speeches at the end. It mainly revolves around religion and its effects over people.\n\nFor the combat, the game uses a middle ground between real time and turn based system where you can see when each character or enemy will act, this is interesting for you to choose the action your active character will take, as the game has an assortment of moves and habilities that cause less damage but can cancel or delay an enemy action, thus, decision making in the game is actually interesting. I also need to point out that this is the only JRPG ever that I found the defend command useful.\nI found the combat system extremely satisfying, even if a bit easy. I had a character die outside of scripted battles only once near the end, but I was playing on normal and there is a hard difficulty. The way the save points work in this game also makes combat easier since you can fully restore yourself for free everytime you reach one, that just made me spam area of efect spells and habilities.\n\nYou cannot customize the character party, wich can have up to 4 members. It changes as the history demands.\n\nThere are 3 different form of XP in this game: your regular experience, Special Coins, and Magic Coins. Experience ups the characters base stats. No customization here as it is normal in JRPGs. Special Coins lets you purchase or upgrade the character specific special habilities and Magic Coins do the same for magic.\nMagic is kept in eggs. Eggs can have any assortment of spells and can be equiped in any character, who will have the egg's spells available to be cast in combat.\nThe game also has habilities books (I can't recall the actual name of them) where you can buy passive bonuses with either Special or Magic Coins. These bonuses can be individually equiped into any character.\n\nDungeons are usually simple, with exceptions later on the game. It lacks a map system, wich makes exploring said dungeons quite annoying, but it has a compass that points you to the next objective. It helps a little. I'd still prefer a map.\n\nThe stronger spells suffer from unnecessary long animations. Nothing as bad as Final Fantasy 7 but can still be annoying. But when you have a spell that sends a dragon made of electricity into your enemies I can give it some leeway.\n\nAnd heck, this review is cold. I guess the game failed to impress me. That does not mean I did not enjoy it. It just means I have seen better. Still a great game for fans of JRPGs, and a good pick for those just getting into the genre.", "timestamp_created": 1442885909, "timestamp_updated": 1442885909, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18129294": {"recommendationid": "18129294", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993944276", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1441902315}, "language": "english", "review": "Grandia 2 as great as ever!\n\nBest Combat-System of its time and still top-notch!\nLikeable characters, great story and music!\n\nJust 2 words : Buy it!\n\nOn a side note : \nIts a new Dreamcast port, so its rather natural that there were alot of bugs on release day (even though i didnt encounter any deal breaker).

For one thing this game is still an excellent JRPG. A thrilling story that lasts over 24 hours filled with many twists and turns and not much in the way of filler with characters that along the journey will make you laugh and cry. The battles are in a kind of psydo-turn based system where you wait for the characters to be able to receive commands and then do the action you requested. It's a very well implemented system although it favours speed more than anything so make sure you upgrade that. The remake brings a new hard mode, HD resolutions and has patched in 60 FPS. So if that's interesting to you, that'll be some good news.\n\nHOWEVER! ...As a remake, this remake could do better. For one thing there are many sound issues. For instance there was an FMV that supposed to have had the big bad taunting people as they initiate their plans, however what I got were the sounds of the game's great outdoors. Also there's plenty of locations for the game to crash which isn't that good. Sure the added Hard mode is nice and all but the many problems with this remake does make it hard to fully recommend. It's not as bad as the previous PC port, but that's not saying much.\n\nOverall if you can put up with a few major porting errors you will find a very enjoyable game and comes highly recommended.

You battle in a circular arena with each encounter. Your party consists of up to 4 people. The idea is that normal attacks can be performed immediately, magic and specials take a bit to charge up, and critical hits can be performed to cancel an opponent\u2019s action. Specials and magic can affect multiple targets based on where they are standing on the field in relation to you. This means that in a crowded field of 8 characters, you will be scanning over each one to see what they plan on doing for their next turn, then acting in accordance with what you predict will happen. It\u2019s very involved and more fun than any other traditional RPG I\u2019ve played. (but if you need a break, you can set the playable characters to AI.) -story took me 36 hours or so.\n\nStory:\nGrandia II has a powerful story with some good heart wrenching emotional moments. I\u2019ve heard reports of players crying over events, and  I don\u2019t dare spoil a single one of them. Through there are some less than graceful bits and I\u2019ll admit to not having strong attachments to a couple of the characters. But once you get in a ways, it really does take your heart with it. Unlike most RPG\u2019s i\u2019ve played, it actually has a very personal and interesting take on the religion of the world. But by far the most gripping part for me is the influence of the game\u2019s devil \u201cValmar\u201d on the people\u2019s lives: both widespread and on individuals.\n\n\nMusic:\nThere are 46 songs on the soundtrack. Among them are touching sombre melodies. Some powerful and sad hymn sounding tunes. And there are a handful of exciting action tracks as well, none of which grate despite how much fighting you do. However, there are a couple strange upbeat tracks that do get a bit overplayed in the overworld. All in all though, the music has a lot to offer and enhances most moments in the game very, very nicely.\n\nArt:\nThough it may not look like much today, there are vast texturing improvements over the original version. It doesn\u2019t break your suspension of disbelief, but by today\u2019s standards it isn\u2019t anything spectacular.\n\nPort:\nThis may be a port, but fear not! The developers have been actively patching flaws found in the game. My game crashed once during my playthrough, but that issue has since been patched!\n\nTips: \nThis game was released in 2000, it\u2019s really hard not to spoil yourself on story elements, so tread lightly.\n\nYour party members change as the game progresses, but do not be afraid to spend skill points on characters that might not stay with you forever. The game has a way of making up for this.\n\nYou can adjust individual audio properties by running the setup before game launch. There are some really overpowered sounds, so I encourage you to play with that.\n\n\nYou will encounter a place called The Hut of Trials in the story. Be sure to return there as soon as you can. It\u2019s a grind, but  It unlocks some amazing items as well as an achievement. You will only have access to this place for a short time.\n\nSummary:\nGrandia II May have a couple things wrong, but everything it gets right is a total bullseye.

Le sc\u00e9nario nous invite \u00e0 retrouver un gar\u00e7on pas forc\u00e9ment tr\u00e8s aim\u00e9, plut\u00f4t sarcastique et pas franchement altruiste au d\u00e9part puisque clairement attir\u00e9 par l'app\u00e2t du gain. Il n'en demeure pas moins que notre h\u00e9ros charismatique se plongera dans une vaste aventure aux c\u00f4t\u00e9s d'une princesse poss\u00e9d\u00e9e par le mal et pas forc\u00e9ment de tr\u00e8s bonne composition \u00e0 la base. En r\u00e9sulte une histoire avec des personnages attachants dans un esprit typiquement manga, avec des dialogues et des prises de bec qui semblent parfois interminables. Ryudo, notre h\u00e9ros, rencontrera \u00e9galement en chemin des personnages tr\u00e8s h\u00e9t\u00e9roclites et aux caract\u00e8res tr\u00e8s oppos\u00e9s, ce qui ne manquera pas de pimenter encore un peu plus le tout. Pour ce qui est de l'ambiance nous voil\u00e0 fix\u00e9s.\n\nGrandia 2 propose un syst\u00e8me de combats assez novateur pour la cat\u00e9gorie m\u00eame si la progression reste quant \u00e0 elle somme toute assez classique. Durant les attaques une jauge permet de voir quel personnage sera le prochain \u00e0 jouer son tour ce qui permettra d'affiner un peu la tactique au cours de ces phases de jeu. Il s'agira alors de faire des choix judicieux pour optimiser chaque charge en alternant les coups critiques, les combos ou encore les magies. Les combats se d\u00e9roulent au tour par tour mais offrent un r\u00e9el dynamisme et des enjeux strat\u00e9giques finalement tr\u00e8s appr\u00e9ciables. Pour ce qui est de la progression en elle-m\u00eame elle s'av\u00e8re donc plus classique avec des travers\u00e9es de zones plus o\u00f9 moins labyrinthiques remplies de monstres que l'on pourra cela dit \u00e9viter. A la diff\u00e9rence de certains titres de la cat\u00e9gorie vous imposant de combattre la moindre cr\u00e9ature rencontr\u00e9e, ici on peut se barrer lorsque l'on juge le combat n\u00e9gligeable et pas assez rentable en points d'exp\u00e9rience. Si la progression se veut assez lin\u00e9aire au fil de cette vaste aventure, c'est donc le sc\u00e9nario qui sous-tend admirablement le tout et aide alors \u00e0 dig\u00e9rer une action un peu r\u00e9p\u00e9titive en infligeant des dialogues particuli\u00e8rement longs et faisant progresser le sc\u00e9nario de mani\u00e8re pas forc\u00e9ment syst\u00e9matique.\n\nEn terme de maniabilit\u00e9 aucun souci m\u00eame si l'usage de la manette s'av\u00e8rera bien plus confortable que celui du clavier. Les commandes sont de toute mani\u00e8re assez peu nombreuses avec toutefois la possibilit\u00e9 d'effectuer des rotations de cam\u00e9ra, ce qui s'av\u00e8rera tr\u00e8s pratique compte tenu de la visibilit\u00e9 pas toujours adapt\u00e9e. On cherche souvent sa route, on a du mal \u00e0 voir les d\u00e9nivel\u00e9s sous certains angles, bref, tout n'est pas id\u00e9al pour rep\u00e9rer la direction \u00e0 suivre m\u00eame si une sorte de boussole permet d'avoir au moins la direction \u00e0 suivre. \n\nEn somme, Grandia 2 notamment dans cette version PC s'adresse principalement aux puristes du RPG japonais dans ce qu'il a de plus radical. Les dialogues \u00e0 n'en plus finir, des phases de jeu un peu trop lin\u00e9aires mais en revanche une trame et un syst\u00e8me de combat plac\u00e9s en revanche sous le signe de l'originalit\u00e9. La r\u00e9alisation au niveau des graphismes reste quant \u00e0 elle un peu d\u00e9cevante, ce qui finira d'achever les plus sceptiques alors que les fans passeront l'\u00e9ponge sans difficult\u00e9.

For some odd reason though, I never got around to playing Grandia 2, not when it was on the Dreamcast, and not when it was ported to the PS2. But now, thanks to GungHo, I finally get to play it (the going prices for the PS2 and DC versions are insanely high). So keep in mind, this review will be from the perspective of someone who's never played the game before, and therefore has no nostalgic attachment to it. \n\n[b]Characters:[/b] given that this is a JRPG with a fairly standard story (save the world from a giant evil, etc) it's up to the characters to make this a game worth playing. Fortunately, the game does an admirable job at this. The main character, Ryudo, is especially interesting, given that he's not just an unwilling hero, but kind of a jerk as well. Another character, Roan, manages to break out of the \"annoying, obligatory child\" category by actually being intelligent. You also get a cool lion-man (think Kimahri from FFX, except useful and talkative) and a sexy demon lady in your party, among others. Basically, the characters are pretty neat and I liked them. \n\n[b]Design:[/b] design plays a big part in these games, from character art to enemy designs. The characters themselves, as well as many of the towns and locations, have sort of a Chrono Cross vibe to them. The enemy designs range from decent to outright awesome, with the story bosses especially standing out (they look like something straight out of Parasite Eve). Unfortunately, the regular enemies suffer from the same problem that many JRPGs and MMOs have; namely, there are very few different types of enemies and the game instead relies on constant palette-swapping to make them \"different.\" Even the mini bosses suffer from this design flaw. \n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b] gameplay, ultimately, is what really makes or breaks a JRPG (any game, really), and this game's battle system passes with flying colors. At first glance, it looks like your standard turn-based system with regular attacks, magic, skills and items. But this system, I feel, is what Final Fantasy games tried for years to achieve with their \"active time battle\" system and failed to do. Honestly it's a little hard to descbribe in words, you're better off looking up a gameplay video on youtube to see how it works. I will say though, this is the first turn-based game I've seen where stats like \"agility\" and \"speed\" actually do something other than just affect your chance to dodge and hit. It's a very engaging combat system and a whole lot of fun. All your characters are able to fulfill multiple roles as well (think FFVII), so your heavy hitters can fill a support role if need be, and your white mage is actually an effective attacker (in fact, later in the game she becomes a huge damage dealer). Attacks themselves, especially the skills and magic, look great (many of them use flashy FMVs).  \n\n[b]Level Design:[/b] this is one area where the game becomes lacking, especially in the dungeons. Every dungeon is filled with monotonous, twisting corridors and [i]everything[/i] looks the same. I can overlook boring dungeons, but the camera angle in the game makes them infuriating. It sits straight overhead and you're able to see very little of what's around or ahead of you. I can't even count how many times I got lost in dungeons, simply because every room and tunnel looked the exact same as the last, and because I couldn't see enough of my surroundings to tell which way I had come from. This also makes navigating certain towns annoying, as you can't see anything more than your immediate surroundings and most of the buildings look the same. \n\n[b]Music and Sound:[/b] this too is another aspect of the game that's underwhelimg. On its own, most of the music is good, but in-game there are two major problems. The first is that a lot of times, the music just feels plain inappropriate for the current situation. The other problem is that there are relatively few music tracks, so most of them are recycled to the point where it just gets old. But maybe I've just been spoiled by composers like Nobuo Uematsu and Yasunori Mitsuda. The other main issue I have is the sound effects, specifically those of enemies. They range from decent to infuriatingly annoying, and I don't know who thought they were good enough to make it to the final game. The sound effects for your attacks and magic, on the other hand, are all really good. As for the voice actors themselves, they're...alright. Sometimes they'll be good, and other times they're cringe-worthy. They never reach the level of FFX's infamous laughing scene though, so it's tolerable. \n\n[b]The Port Itself:[/b] I rarely see a developer work this hard and this quickly on patching a game, especially not a port of a 15 year old game. Within a week of the game's release, GungHo had already released one major patch, and over the next couple weeks released even more large patches. These patches fixed not only issues that arose from porting a console game to the PC, but old issues that were never resolved. In my entire playthrough I encountered very few bugs, and the game crashed a total of two times, which is a better track record than many PC games. The devs listen to the fanbase and actively participate in the Steam forums, responding to people and updating them on their progress. These guys definitely deserve your money for how hard they've worked on this game. \n\n[b]Final Thoughts:[/b] Grandia 2 is a solid JRPG. The level design and camera work are lacking, and the music gets old pretty fast, but the interesting characters and the fantastic battle system make up for it. This, along with GungHo's dedication to making this a great port and the low price, definitely make the game worth buying.", "timestamp_created": 1442209356, "timestamp_updated": 1442235440, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.659145", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18024747": {"recommendationid": "18024747", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047132928", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 24, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443928069}, "language": "english", "review": "I dont write reviews for games any more because they were too time consuming.

TLDR Pros/Cons near the bottom-\n\nThe story is a straight forward, though perhaps a bit generic in some regards. Like a lot of J-RPGs the main character, Ryudo, is a bit of a dark hero where he's crude and blunt with people to begin with but over time grows more mature and attached to the people around him. There's some small twists in the story, but if you're paying attention and think about it a little as things go on, you'll probably see them coming. Character wise you're followers are at least mildly interesting, namely Millennia in my opinion who I think really steals the show in this game. She's fun and colorful and interacts with several individuals in interesting ways. So as far as story, don't expect too much in terms of depth but but the characters are what make it stand out against the background.\n\n The combat system has aged fairly well considering it's been 15 years since the release on dreamcast and has some decent depth to it even in this day in age for RPGs. There's some thinking and combo set ups to make certain things more effective which can be really cool. However, as you get further in levels some of these elements become less important as you outscale the enemies or can one-shot multiple enemies with some skill or magic attacks. Boss fights in this game is the real golden zone for tense combat where being tactical is a bit more important and relatively constant through the game. Hard mode which was added to this port further pushes for this and at times I found myself using stuff I didn\u2019t need to bother with before. If you're looking for some fair but difficult bosses, go ahead and play hardmode, just be warned that until you get a second party member that things might be a bit more difficult.\n\nGraphically, the game is alright. It's 15 years old so I cant say I would expect too much, BUT the textures have been very nicely improved with this release. Detail is much more notable on character design and colors are more flushed out which is very nice. There's some issues with the game's resolution as it only is in 4:3 unless you force the aspect ratio to change which will skew the character models. There's some tearing that happens occasionally which is annoying, but for the most part is fairly solid. Music in this game is a bit of a mixed bag. There\u2019s times where is rather good, others that\u2019s generic and other times leaves something to be desired even if it is old. There\u2019s just a lot of music in here that\u2019s simply not memorable at all. Game length however is pretty good. Depending on what you decide to do this game can last anywhere between 20-30 hours which for the price isn\u2019t too bad. When on sale I would say that it is very well worth the money.\n\nNow let's talk about the port. This is where I would like to give SkyLabs the credit that's due to them. At launch, this game had a laundry list of issues going on with it. Some of them just annoying, some of them that actually broke the game and made progress impossible or flat out kill you. However, these guys have been amazingly faithful to this game and has fixed tons of these problems and also added many of the things I wanted in features. Lots of resolution options even up to 4K, 60 FPS battles (which is huge), audio sliders, rebindable keys, gamepad support and audio language options (English/Japanese). 60 FPS battles is particularly what sold me on these guys in my opinion because it picks up the combat speed just a little bit so it doesn\u2019t feel as long, but also makes it run so much smoother. Currently this function doesn\u2019t seem to play well with windowed mode but this may be my own issue, fullscreen works with it just fine. One thing I would love see though is a fullscreen windowed option, but hopefully we see this in the future. On the bad side, the game still has a few crashing and audio issues that have caused me to leave it alone for a while before returning to it because I was annoyed with it.\nOverall, I\u2019m glad I\u2019ve bought this game. It\u2019s been a nice nostalgia trip, but even as a game still holds itself up well. If you\u2019re into J-RPG style games like final fantasy it\u2019s certainly worth picking up.\n\nTLDR\npros\n+Great combat system\n+Interesting characters and places\n+Decent game length for the price 20-30 hours\n+Fair and difficult boss fights on hardmode\n+VERY faithful patching\n+60 FPS combat for a formerly 30FPS game\n+Retextured into higher resolution\n\nCons\n-Fairly generic story, though charming at times\n-Music not so great at times\n-Easy non-boss enemies\n-Couple of technical issues still exist (likely to be fixed)\n-No Fullscreen Windowed\n\nIn all, Grandia II is a great addition to an RPG lineup if you\u2019re looking for something more mechanically deep than in story.

What games \"of today\" even have those?\n+ Lots of cool items will keep you wondering which one to equip, esspecially at the endgame\n+ Exploration is rewarded with items. You are rewarded for not simply running from A to B, and exploring the area\n+ Pretty good story and ending, although, a little bit cheezy\n+ Lots of great characters with totally different personalities\n+ Hard difficulty is challenging, esspecially at the endgame\n+ Unique battle/skill/magic system\n+ Modding potential?\n\n- UI could have had higher resolution. One user already released an HD mod to fix this. This should have been a developers job\n- The game uses \"movies\" to tell the story and to display some skills, but the resolution is pretty bad\n- The game is very linear and that may be a turn off to some (can't explore areas, unless you progress the story)\n- A few more scenes could have been voice-acted. It would've helped the overall feel of the game/story\n- The game doesn't actually support widescreen (you can use high resolution, though)\n- Seems to be problems with some gamepads (I didn't have any, personally, though)\n- Probably uncomfortable to play without gamepad\n- Some bugs are not yet fixed\n\n[b]Verdict of part 1[/b]:\n\nWorth buying, if you feel like taking it slow, getting to know what's going on in each town/area, exploring and looking for items/treasures. It's a classic rpg sort-of-HD remake. If you would like to play something, that's similar to psx/psone era games, then get it!\n\n[b]Part 2[/b]:\n\n+ Better graphics than prequel\n+ Improved battle system\n+ Improved leveling/exp system (in prequel, it was a pain to level up the characters)\n+ More minigames\n\n- Overall lesser experience than the prequel (less towns, npcs, areas, monsters, etc)\n- Dungeons are way too predictable and mostly uninspired\n- Uses overall gear with the same effects as in the prequel\n- Characters could've had a few more skills.

Thankfully for the first week of release the game had a 25% off sale so I couldn't complain about picking up my favourite RPG of all time for a mere \u00a311.\n\nWhen I was looking through the achievement list I was overjoyed to see that there was a hard mode incorporated into the game. Now I'm sure other seasoned veterans of the game also saw this as incentive to buy the game on it's own.\n\nSo my playthrough was on the hard difficulty.\n\nGraphically the game looks fine, however I won't say there aren't faults. There are some real glaring issues with screen tearing at points. I notably remember it was pretty bad during the development on Ceceille Reef and when you are about to fight the Claws of Valmar. Don't get me wrong, these are small issues that I'm sure will be fixed at a later patch.\n\nThe voices are good, I always loved Cam Clarke as Ryudo and especially Jennifer Hale as Elena. The acting is hammy at points but it's a cheesy story, so it's not unwelcome. The music from Noriyuki Iwadare was always one of the selling points of the game, I always had a soft spot for the final boss music. Which leads me onto the next point.\n\nThe difficulty on the hard mode, well for 90% of the game, it's quite unlikely you will notice much difference, regular enemies are still one-shottable from AoE spells if you tune your skills for them. Most bosses aren't really too much different. \nThere are exceptions however which I won't divulge here. I'd like to keep this spoiler free if possible.\n\nThe plot of the game was always one of the high-points of the game. It quite literally is good vs evil, perfectly straightforward without feeling convoluted. There is always a goal in mind which you push towards. However that leads me to a slight grievance. The game is very linear, it doesn't allow for much deviation from the story route. Not like it's a bad thing really as the plot is interesting and if it's your first time playing it I reckon it will keep you captivated the whole time anyway.\n\nThere are some gameplay issues with FMV's as some of the moves/spells incorporate that and it can cause frame delays. I think it's been fixed for the most part with the last patch but I completed the game on patch 1.01 and it hadn't yet. I remember the last boss fight being notably bad for it with 15 - 20 second delays on ending an animation and returning to the fight.\n\nThe developers seem to have a passion for the game which is a good thing as they are actively fixing bugs that are reported on the forums here on Steam. I'm enthusiastic that by the time the game goes on sale again alot of the little problems will have been dealt with. The dream is essentially having this be as good as the original Dreamcast version with the hard mode thrown in for good measure. I have faith that the devs will get this done, it will just take time. Patience while the kinks are worked out is the way to go.\n\nPros:\n+ Best battle system in any RPG. \n+ Story is really enthralling. If you have never cleared this, buy it for this reason alone\n+ Characters are great, very relatable\n+ Music and Voice acting is really good\n+ Active development team actually listens to the fans and fixes problems\n+ Achievements add a bit more to the game. (I could have thought of a good few more though lol)\n\nCons:\n- Graphical tears and other issues involving FMV's can be aggravating\n- Graphics are 15 years old so might be unappealing to some of the newer gamers\n- Heard of game crashes, I never experienced them myself but I have heard others complain about it\n- For the most part Hard isn't really any harder but when it is, the game lets you know swiftly\n- If you don't deviate at all from the story and streamline the game, it only takes about 20 hours to finish\n\nIn conclusion the game has had problems on launch but I don't expect any gamebreakers to be around for longer than a month or two. If you haven't played this game before, BUY IT. The story and characters are some of the richest in any RPG ever. If you have played it before, play it if only for the hard mode. Swag points for completing it on hard after all.\n\nThanks for reading.", "timestamp_created": 1441586469, "timestamp_updated": 1448904234, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.757283", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17919252": {"recommendationid": "17919252", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111261020", "num_games_owned": 388, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454890959}, "language": "german", "review": "Hab die PS2 Version geliebt, und auch hier hab ich kaum was auszusetzen.\nVergleich zur PS2 Version:\n\nPro: \n        -Viel bessere Texturen\n        -30FPS lock  (stark bemerkbar im Vergleich)\n\nCon:\n         - Zauber Animationen wurden teilweise kaum oder gar nicht Verbessert\n         - 4:3 Seitenverh\u00e4ltnis\n\nIch Empfehle das Game auf jedenfall Jedem, unabh\u00e4ngig davon, ob er eine der \u00e4lteren Versionen gespielt hat oder nicht.\nFinal Fantasy (1-11) Fan\u00b4s   kann ich auf jedenfall sagen das dass Kampfsystem besser ist, und die Story mindestens gleichwertig ist.\n\nLasst euch nicht Abschrecken von FSK 6 und \"Teilweise Controllerunterst\u00fctztung\" das einzige, was nicht Controllerunterst\u00fctzt ist, ist die ich nenne sie mal preconfig. da stellt man lediglich vor dem Start des Spiels die Grafik und die Sprache des Ton\u00b4s ein.

My last point might just be my perspective and can't be confirmed without playing the orginal format on PS2 but the special effects with magic and certain moves seem to have lost resolution in the transition to PC; It is very pixelated.\n\nThis edition of the game gives me a nostalgic fix but I am constantly annoyed with all the little things that are not right with it.\n\nFor new players who enjoy a story driven RPG, get it!

Este \u00e9 um review do segundo jogo que anteriormente houve vers\u00f5es para Dreamcast, PlayStation 2 e uma antiga adapta\u00e7\u00e3o para PC feita pela Ubisoft.\n\nGungHo que hoje det\u00e9m os direitos e parte da GameArts surpreendendo mostra interesse em lan\u00e7ar seus jogos cl\u00e1ssicos na plataforma Steam, com isso muitos votaram na enquete por Grandia 2 pois j\u00e1 havia sido lan\u00e7ado para Windows e novamente numa outra surpresa \u00e9 um novo port com algumas adi\u00e7\u00f5es e baseado na vers\u00e3o Dreamcast.\n\nHist\u00f3ria\n\nTudo come\u00e7a em um mundo aonde dois deus: Granas e Valmar fizeram um grande conflito que deixaram marcas no mundo como Granacliffs, ap\u00f3s o fim disto pouco se soube o que aconteceu com eles e foi criada uma religi\u00e3o louvando Granas como o salvador do mundo. O enredo ent\u00e3o acontece eras depois quando um mercen\u00e1rio \"geohound\" chamado Ryudo recebe um pedido de escolta de uma irm\u00e3 de Granas por um dos padres em Carbo, Carius, para uma cerim\u00f4nia pouca esclarecida. H\u00e1 outros personagens durante as diversas viagens de como a provocante e misteriosa Millenia, o jovem viajante Roan, o homem-fera Mareg e a Automata Tio.\n\nGameplay\n\nUm dos grandes atrativos da s\u00e9rie Grandia (at\u00e9 mesmo nos jogos menos populares entre os f\u00e3s como X-Treme e 3) \u00e9 sua jogabilidade diferenciada com os outros rpgs da \u00e9poca. Tudo baseado na barra de IP aonde h\u00e1 icones tanto dos personagens quanto oponentes, que ao chegar no inicio da parte \"COM\" voc\u00ea escolhe a a\u00e7\u00e3o que \u00e9 executada chegando no final da barra chamada \"ACT\". H\u00e1 diversas habilidades e magias com tempos diferentes para chegar do ponto COM e ACT mas \u00e9 poss\u00edvel atrav\u00e9s de recursos do jogo diminuir esse tempo e terminar mais r\u00e1pido as batalhas.\n\nO jogo oferece dois tr\u00eas tipos de ataques f\u00edsicos: \"Combo\" que s\u00e3o dois ataques seguidos de bom dano, \"Critical\" aonde \u00e9 apenas um hit \"refor\u00e7ado\" mas que permite \"cancelar\" a\u00e7\u00f5es entre a parte COM e ACT dos inimigos, terminando com as Skills que gastam SP points. As primeiras Skills de cada personagem obrigatoriamente tem  a vantagem de poder cancelar assim como os \"Critical\" por\u00e9m sem a desvantagem de esperar se locomover at\u00e9 o inimigo, sendo executado automaticamente chegando no final da barra IP. As outras skills n\u00e3o tem essa vantagem mas compensam ou com mais dano, dano em area, afinidade elemental ou serem habilidades de suporte a equipe como curas ou buffs. O tempo de execu\u00e7\u00e3o das skills \u00e9 feito atrav\u00e9s de special coins que s\u00e3o ganhas no fim da batalha.\n\nSistema de magias do jogo tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 um diferencial, o game \u00e9 regido por 4 elementos: fogo, agua, terra e vento que evoluem atrav\u00e9s do uso de magic coins (ganhas terminando as lutas) e que s\u00e3o usadas a partir de \"Mana Eggs\", h\u00e1 6 Mana Eggs obrigat\u00f3rias de se conseguir no jogo com 2 sendo opcionais, cada uma tendo seus pr\u00f3prios elementos e focos. H\u00e1 tamb\u00e9m algumas magias que s\u00e3o \"aprendidas\" evoluindo 2 elementos distintos que formam um novo, por exemplo evoluindo magias de fogo e vento em um mana egg permite conseguir magias de \"trov\u00e3o, que s\u00e3o mais fortes que elas separadas e acertam duas fraquezas distintas, os unicos elementos que n\u00e3o h\u00e1 mistura s\u00e3o agua+fogo e terra+vento.\n\nH\u00e1 tamb\u00e9m o sistema de livros, oito livros que podem ter foco em magos, guerreiros ou ambos. Tamb\u00e9m usam tanto magic e special coins para \"evoluir\" por\u00e9m eles cont\u00e9m habilidades equip\u00e1veis que permitem \"buffs pessoais\" como maior rapidez e dano em magias de certo elemento ou aumentar certos atributos de personagens entre outros.\n\nUso de itens \u00e9 algo cl\u00e1ssico, \u00e9 possivel equipar outras armas, armaduras e mana eggs no meio da batalha, como tamb\u00e9m usar certos equipamentos como \"magia\" dependendo de sua descri\u00e7\u00e3o. H\u00e1 sistema de \"evade\" e \"shield\" que permitem se mover no campo ou defender dos ataques e assim ter chance de minimizar ou escapar de ataques de inimigos, com a defesa recuperando parte do SP.\n\nGr\u00e1fico e port\n\nN\u00e3o h\u00e1 muito o que falar, \u00e9 um jogo de Dreamcast com alguns filtros minimos e infelizmente ainda fiel a sua exibi\u00e7\u00e3o em 4:3. A justificativa \u00e9 de que por certas magias serem em video \"4:3\" seria complicado adaptar elas em widescreen (e como \u00e9 sabido a forma de que os japas guardam seus assets originais...) apesar que eu n\u00e3o veria problema de bordas laterais aparecendo somente em uso de ataques com exibi\u00e7\u00e3o de FMV...O game cont\u00e9m certas melhorias pequenas como sombras din\u00e2micas do que as classicas \"bolinhas\" embaixo dos personagens mas h\u00e1 alguns glitches gr\u00e1ficos em certas cutscenes e batalhas mas que ir\u00e3o mais aborrecer os velhos jogadores, ainda sim \u00e9 algo bem melhor que o antigo port de PC baseado na vers\u00e3o \"menos-boa\" de Grandia 2 feito para PlayStation 2. A Gungho mesmo assim est\u00e1 aberta a feedback e trazendo patches numa frequ\u00eancia boa.\n\nNo lan\u00e7amento o game contava com 30 frames por segundo tanto no mapa quanto batalha mas por pedido da comunidade a GungHo conseguiu deixar os 60fps que a antiga vers\u00e3o PC da Ubisoft tinha de \"extra\", tornando cada vez mais a vers\u00e3o definitiva do jogo. Game agora tamb\u00e9m permite continuar a rodar mesmo perdendo o \"foco\" para aqueles que gostam de usar o alt+tab entre magias e cutscenes j\u00e1 vistas.\n\nSom e localiza\u00e7\u00e3o\n\nH\u00e1 muitos glitches de loop em musica e certos efeitos sonoros, havia problema na quest\u00e3o de volume nos passos dos personagens mas foi corrigido em patch. Ainda sim n\u00e3o tira muito o brilho da bela trilha sonora do jogo, com temas marcantes como as diversas vers\u00f5es da \"Can\u00e7\u00e3o do Povo\" surpreendentemente cantada em portugu\u00eas assim como o cl\u00e1ssico tema de Grandia e suas \u00f3timas trilhas de combate.\n\nSurpreendendo novamente o jogo cont\u00e9m dual audio, voc\u00ea pode jogar tanto com a dublagem americana quanto a japonesa, por\u00e9m infelizmente os dialogos ainda s\u00e3o sincronizados com o audio americano, havendo cortes e sil\u00eancios escolhendo a vers\u00e3o japonesa das vozes, sendo justo \u00e9 uma quest\u00e3o de prefer\u00eancia pendendo para a japonesa por quest\u00f5es de gosto, tanto Showtaro Morikubo (Yosuke em Persona 4) e Cam Clarke (Simba de Rei Le\u00e3o nos video-games) s\u00e3o muito competentes interpretando Ryudo e h\u00e1 escolhas not\u00e1veis tipo Jodi Benson como Millenia (a voz de Ariel da Pequena Sereia) ou Daisuke Gori como Mareg (o inesquecivel Heihachi Mishima de Tekken que infelizmente se suicidou).\n\nExtras\n\nJ\u00e1 \u00e9 um grande atrativo sendo um port bem melhor que o anterior mas \u00e9 poss\u00edvel importar e exportar seus saves para a vers\u00e3o Dreamcast, isso deve agradar alguns poucos que n\u00e3o jogam por eras Grandia 2 no Dreamcast e agora preferem jogar no PC ou n\u00e3o querem rejogar tudo e querem ver os melhores momentos quem sabe em japones? Foi feito tamb\u00e9m uma op\u00e7\u00e3o de Hard Mode com algumas mudan\u00e7as de atributos e AI de inimigos, sendo mais agressivos e fortes, mais not\u00e1vel em chefes.\n\nRecomendado?\n\nAltamente recomendado, \u00e9 um port muito satisfat\u00f3rio para uma empresa nova na Steam como Gungho e com patches frequentes, h\u00e1 glitches gr\u00e1ficos e sonoros que ir\u00e3o incomodar f\u00e3s que j\u00e1 jogaram o jogo no PlayStation 2 e Dreamcast mas mesmo assim \u00e9 muito dificil ainda n\u00e3o jogar at\u00e9 o fim de Grandia 2, esperamos novos ports da Game Arts como o primeiro Grandia ou Lunar Eternal Blue na Steam.", "timestamp_created": 1441498094, "timestamp_updated": 1441678703, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.770756", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17901170": {"recommendationid": "17901170", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057393463", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 3925, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478563634}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Mais um cl\u00e1ssico dos RPGs old school.

Grandia II was the very first JRPG I ever played (the old PC port) and I stuck with playing these types of games ever since. My opinion of the game is quite certainly heavily influenced by feelings of nostalgia...\n\nThat said, I'd still recommend playing this game, with some caveats:\n\n- The game is extremely linear. There are no sidequests to speak of and you basically play along a straight line. Backtracking is also usually not possible, so it's quite easy to miss a few things. This is common in JRPGs and I don't really mind, but other people might.\n- Character development follows the established tropes in JRPGs very closely. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but don't expect a whole lot of character depth.\n-  Same goes for the story. It isn't terribly original and not exactly ground-breaking storytelling. That doesn't mean that it is bad by any means, mind you.\n- In \"normal\" mode the game isn't too much of a challenge. On the plus side, heavy grinding really isn't necessary, the game is perfectly beatable in a straight playthrough.\n- The graphics are outdated. They do look better than ever in this port, but they nevertheless clearly show their age. 3D games from earlier eras of gaming generally don't age well and Grandia II is sadly no exception (keep in mind that this is a port, not a remake!).\n- The port does suffer from a number of bugs. I can't really comment on most of them, since I (for whatever reason) did not experience any game-breaking bugs or glitches. The developers did release some patches since the game went online, so there might still be some more fixes coming in the future.\n\nThe main attaction of Grandia II is - as many commenters already wrote - the stellar battle system. It's basically one of a kind in JRPGs and mixes elements of action and turn-based combat in an extremely engaging way. The Grandia series as a whole has still no match in this regard and - to be perfectly honest - it has been practically the sole reason for me to go ahead and re-play this game on Steam.\n\nFor those who are interested: Grandia I is available on the PlayStation Network while Grandia III, which has a much weaker story and extremely cheesy characters, but the most refined battle system of the series, has sadly only ever been released on the PlayStation 2 in the US.", "timestamp_created": 1441314557, "timestamp_updated": 1441464498, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.950617", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17865253": {"recommendationid": "17865253", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055299464", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1749, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460479499}, "language": "english", "review": "Grandia 2  is  amazing  game!

Do I recommend the game to others? Sure. The visuals have been bumped up, ever so slightly but sometimes it looks choppy as you would expect from a Dreamcast game upscaled to HD. The English acting can sometimes be cringeworthy but I enjoy it for nostalgia reasons. The gameplay is fun and unlike a lot of games today, requires a little bit of thought against tougher opponents. I am not far into the game but I did play an earlier version of the game, PS2 I believe it was. Don't buy this game with the hope of a fresh new style of gameplay.

Like that pony the Dreamcast was the system I wanted as a kid but never got. I still remember seeing the ads and thinking that it was one of the coolest things ever. It was the hip new console that appealed to the younger crowd and caused N64 kids like me to look on with amazement and wonder. But then the PlayStation 2 came along and my household along with every other kids I knew at the time picked up that instead and the Dreamcast became an nostalgic forgotten memory. \n\nBut enough reminiscing, I didn't even know this game existed but remembered hearing exceptional things about it. It was always a common contender in 'top 10 hidden gems'-esq lists that I remembered reading so when I saw it on steam I'd thought I would pick it up to relive some old memories after reading about it a little. \n\n[H1] PROS [/h1]\n\nCombat while taking a while to get the hang of is great\n\n\nThe story while cheesy at some points is still loveable in that old school RPG nostalgic way\n\n\nGreat Soundtrack\n\n\nThe Redone effects are nice from what I can tell. I never played the original Dreamcast or PC versions, but the graphics still have that early 3D disk game look that will bring back some memories. Also they give you the choices of a Japanese voice or English voice option. The Japanese voices are supposedly better acted, but the English voices are just fine if you're like me and don't mind the cheese at some points with actors hilariously overacting lines.\n\n\nAll around RPG goodness\n\n[h1] CONS [/h1]\n\nThe keyboard controls are horrid, controller definitely recommended. While it's not unplayable and you can rebind keys to make a manageable keyboard setup, it's just something to take into mind.\n\n\nRemember this was the late 1990/early 2000's where everything was HIP 2 THE XTREME and covered in flame decals while riding a skateboard. It was a different time where video game heroes tried to appeal to appeal to a younger audience by being hip and edgy. It's not really a con, but something to consider - don't go into this thinking it's like current RPGs of today.\n\n\nSome minor graphical lockups here and there.\n\n\n[h1] Ending Notes [/h1]\n\nThere's just not much bad to say about Grandia 2.

This is a plus for me.\n- The Japanese voice actors are very good. I actually switched straight to Japanese after hearing Skye talk in English for the first time. Thankfully, the original cast did not disappoint.\n\nCons:\n- The battles were too easy even on hard mode.\n- Elemental weaknesses can almost be ignored. The fire element can carry you through 80% of the game.\n- The audio levels need to be adjusted! Footsteps sound louder than almost everything else.\n- There's no secondary check for the item collector achievement. I currently have a save file with all 3 belts required for an achievement. Despite this, the game does not award the achievement properly. I am currently replaying the game to make 'checkpoints' to try and remedy this.\n- Many, many, many bugs. Check the forum. The publishers are currently trying to slowly fix them all.\n\nFinal Verdict: Wait a bit before buying this game. It remains to be seen how proactive the publishers will be in rolling out patches for this game to fix the big list of issues.

This entry in the series is possibly the best one. Bugs - both minor and some *major* - notwithstanding, this port of the original Dreamcast version is fairly decent. The Playstation 2 port released with some of these bugs as well, and the original PC port was fairly bad and very buggy. So it's nice to finally have a 'more reliable' port to play. And while it may be buggy now still, GungHo has already shown that they care about the game, and are willing to fix the bugs, so it's encouraging.\nGungHo also added a \"hard\" difficulty (which supposedly adds ~25%HP to enemies and makes them use Special and Magic attacks more and more frequently....) to make it a new and more challenging experience (I opted not to do hard mode, as I never got to finish this game due to bugs in the original PC port). They've also added the option of using Japanese Voice over english text, for those who like that. From what I've read, it's sometimes out of sync with the text, so YMMV.\nBut, all in all, this game is pretty awesome. The story is interesting, though a little typical good vs evil stuff. The camera action in this is fairly frustrating, and requires some getting used to, but once you're over the initial learning curve, it's fairly smooth. Where this game shines however is the battle and skill upgrade system.\nIt is a turn based RPG, but you see in which order attacks will occur as the little icons that represent your party members and the enemies move along an IP bar. Once the icon of a party member or enemy hit the COM section, you input your battle command. The icon is then moved further along to its final ACT destination where the command is executed. Different attacks make the icon move at different speeds. This adds an element of strategy to every fight, ergo, you don't just spam attack. Attacks can be canceled when they are being prepped (icon between COM and ACT), so fights are a lot more strategic than most other JRPGs.\nThe Skill/Magic system is also somewhat unique. While each character has its own set of special moves (which can all be upgraded using Skill Coins), you can also equip them with skills (mostly passive) that you learn through skill books. These also use Skill Coins (or Magic Coins, depending on the type of book) to be learned/upgraded. The higher the skill level, the better the boost, or the faster the spell is cast. Magic works same way, you find Mana Eggs that can be equipped (and swapped around). Each contain spells that can be learned/upgraded using Magic Coins. Once the spell is unlocked in the egg, it becomes available to the character that is equipped with the egg. The higher level the spell is (upgraded), the faster it is cast. If that makes sense.\nThe graphics are appropriate for the age of the game, though I do wish that the characters actually had mouths. It would make them look a little less doll-like when they speak. But considering it's a 20 year-old game, it's not bad at all.\nIf you've never played it, or any other Grandia game, might be that this is the release to pick up if you're into JRPGs.\nHopefully, GungHo will continue to update it, and eventually release the other entries in this series.

game so far has 2 spots where the game will crash unexpectdely, one in the mountains when walking back from part 1 to part 2, and another which was also litsted in anoter players review which i have just experianced and tested which is a consistent error crash is in the town lillium or somthing like that, its the town with the sky engineers, its and female npc with green hair directly about the story line lillium engineers house.\n\nNow for the Game , i'm loving it so far i'm very old gamer and im very suited for the old style rpgs over the new fancy pretty no substance game with dlc and shamless promos and scams and early realease stream feeds and cash grabs and so called Free....to plays of today generation, good classic title whole games with heart and soul that despite graphicaly being stunted do to the tech of there time had to make up with it for quility story and sounds and music to increase imersion in the world and characters in them, such as legend of dragoon and legaia suikoden and lunar ff7.\n\nAnd although this was on DC it would seem which i never owned it seems i missed out on what would have been a great experiance for me time i would dare rate this among my classic titles, well worth the money and seems to be a solid title in all regards, and people and their praise of the combat system were not wrong it is interesting and engaging much like a hybrid between star ocean open 3d combat but with less hack and slash and more tactic turn based choice like that of ff12, still in the heat of combat but you can still choose skills and commands in combat.\n\nSo Great title, and as all the others have said Bad port biggest so far being that there is many crashes to be at town 3 lol and i aggree that the sounds volume seems off, foot steps quite loud and over powering but nothing game breaking, although i have to admit it quite strange there just are simply no options for sound at all no sounds/music/master volume nothing.\n\nPLEASE!, patch as soon as possible, game was clearly not tested or played after port or acceptance on to steam and realeased as is with no warning or care to gamer/player in regards it being out there as a broken product, and though i can only guess and assume, i have to imagine this was not completely unoticed or unkown by the dev team, and i would venture say proubly just thrown out like an early access project under they guise with were here we will do things and patch stuff pretty soon maybe just take the money and run, just let the players figure it out through playing and annoyance and losing game time due to crash and refunded the product due to its incomplete/umplayable state ..............lol but again old gamer, and that just my opinion based on what i have seen and come to expect, but i Certainly due hope i'm just a crazy old ranter and the devolper will prove me wrong and work on and update this product to point we can be proud of the end result.\n\nTime will tell, (chug chug)

The levels for the sound clips seem to be jumping all over the place and really throws you off when you are trying to immerse yourself in the game.\n\nSo far I would only recommend this to people who are die-hard fans of the game, anybody not familiar with this title should stay away until audio fixes or a price drop. \n\nI may update this review when I pretty much complete it again.\n\nUPDATE 1.03 : This update brought the fix to the insane uneven audio levels and even let you adjust everything to your liking! It also brought something entirely new for Grandia 2 and that is 60 FPS battles! This port has just gotten a whole lot better! Recommend to any JRPG fans, this game has a great story and the combat system is a lot of fun and with these fixes it may be the best edition of the game yet!", "timestamp_created": 1440914288, "timestamp_updated": 1441456832, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17785181": {"recommendationid": "17785181", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033989993", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 403, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470362252}, "language": "english", "review": "Version 1.03 Update:\n\nGung Ho has added 60 FPS Battles, more graphical options, and more sound options. \n\nThey have not however fixed any of the audio issues and the new patch has actually created more new bugs (broken fullscreen, broken 1920 x 1080 resolution). The sound options are basically made so that instead of the development team putting all the sounds back to the way they were in the original, the player has to do it themselves. I believe that's the definition of lazy.\n\nGrandia II is a great game on the Dreamcast. On the PC, not so much. \n\nThe short version: Don't buy it until it's properly fixed, it's simply not worth it. \n\nThe long version:\n\nThe work done on the textures is great and really revitalize graphics that haven't aged all that well; assuming you can ignore pieces of the UI. The Game Compass for example has improved textures but has artifacting that cannot be removed through AA. Gung Ho remade the textures to fit the old resolution and simply scaled it up.\n\nThat aside, it unfortunately comes down to moment to moment audio issues that completely ruin the experience of the game. Music from the soundtrack doesn't fade properly and loops. Music is present where it never was before. Spell sounds are cut off or not present. Voice lines are often drowned out by sound effects as simple as a burning fire or background music. Audio in this port is a complete and utter mess and this alone is quite a strike against it. With this games star voice actors and amazing soundtrack a good chunk of the experience this game offered is ruined or completely missing.\n\nTo top it all off, there are game breaking bugs that seem to be present with some users. Some of these are old and remeniscent of the original PC port, while others are entirely new.\n\nThe developers have put out two patches so far (rather quickly) to fix 2 bugs, but the list of bugs is a mile long and there's no current indication as to how long it will take to fix; if they even plan to fix everything. With the games sales not too high it's hard to know just how committed this developer will be to fixing up the port.\n\nI have to sadly recommend that anyone interested in the game pass on this port. Until there are serious patches made that fix a majority of the issues this port is simply not worth the frustration.

The battle system in particular is still one of the best around, and hasn't been emulated until 2014's Child of Light (another great game, by the way). My only problems with this game are all technical: \n\n-The SFX volume is way too loud, and they don't play correctly (like footsteps for example). \n-There's an annoying delay that occurs after you cast a big spell (the ones that utilize FMV); at first, I thought the game had locked up because nothing was happening for several seconds after a spell had finished animating.\n-The music doesn't loop like it did in the Dreamcast version\n-The sweep animation that plays before the start of battle is gone\n-The \"Whisper to the Stars\" skill is bugged. It does nothing at the moment.\n-HUD (icons, portraits, text) is low-res.\n-Certain FMV cutscenes are dark; you only get audio.\n-Some in-game events are bugged in that they start over from the beginning just before moving on to the next one.\n\nI really wish more developers took more time to polish up their console ports so we don't have these technical issues. I would have liked more modern features, such as the ability to skip spell animations. Hard mode is nice, but it doesn't do much more than give small buffs to the enemies (devs need to make hard mode interesting for a change!). The problems I mentioned never occurred in the Dreamcast original (not sure about the PS2 version or the earlier PC version).

Now that I've completed it again, I can tell you it's not just the nostalgia speaking.\n\nPROS:\n- The game has aged surprisingly well.\n- The combat is fast paced and has light tactical elements\n- The story is phenomenal\n\nCONS:\n- The Hut of Trials mini game is beyond annoying\n- There is an issue with playing FMVs, after the fmv has completed the game will hang for about 10 seconds\n- As with most JRPGs the special attack animations wear out their welcome rather quickly\n- There are various graphical and animation glitches\n\nFurther explanation of the pros and cons follow.\nThis game has aged well, much better than other classics in the genre.  The graphics are much easier on the eyes than the release date would imply.  The combat is very fun, not until the very end of the game was I skipping fights.  The story has a decent pacing to it.  The third act does outstay its welcome though.  The game just does not seem to know when it should end.  Overall, it's an excellent experience.\n\nThe Hut of Trials mini game is the worst part of the game and it's not even remotely close.  Let me begin by saying this, I've never enjoyed mini games in JRPGs, so take what I'm about to say with a grain of salt.  The whole structure of this mini game bewilders me.  You have to talk to someone to get into the Hut, at which point you walk up some stairs and into the hut.  Once inside you're greeted by another dialogue box which then leads you into the cavern where the actual mini game is.  But it doesn't stop there, no, you have to read a stone tablet and then wait for this furry thing to go open the mini game door.  Once inside the mini game, it's a pretty run of the mill JRPG mini game, nothing special.  Once you complete the mini game you go outside and what is your reward?  You get to watch the furry thing(s) dance for ten or so seconds before it opens the exit.  Once you proceed, you must walk to the end of another cave and then be sprung out of the cavern.  You're then greeted by a manimal that gives you your actual reward.  Now, if it was just a one time thing to get all of your rewards from the mini game, that wouldn't be awful, not ideal but certainly not awful.  Nope, you have to go multiple times to get every reward from the mini game.  It's a time consuming, poorly thought out exercise in frustration.  It takes longer to enter and exit the mini game than it does to play it, meaning, you'll never get successive tries, even if you fail.  \n\nAnother frustrating issue with the game is the bug that causes the game to hang after playing FMVs.  Which only seems to occur after a bit of playtime, it's not going to happen on your first few fights.  It's a huge issue in the later game.  I would honestly say the fights last on average 10-20 seconds longer than they should.  However, the boss battles will last minutes longer than they should.  It's easily fixed by closing the game and opening it again.  The problem, however, lies in the fact that there are set save locations and exiting is not always an option.\n\nThe special moves outlive their welcome just like any other game in the genre, the problem is compounded by the brief hang after every move that has an FMV in it, which are quite a few.  Nothing surprising here, typical gripe about games in the genre that came out around the same time as this game.\n\nThe graphics for the most part are solid for the age of the game.  I did, however, notice many instances of the camera clipping through the scenery during cutscenes, animation hangs during cutscenes, and like one or two instances of z-fighting.  Honestly, pretty solid game even given the handful of times these issues occur.\n\nOverall, I fully expect the FMV hanging issue to be resolved, the Hut of Trials mini game is only mandatory once, the specials will be fixed along with the FMV bug and the graphical glitches aren't anything to get worked up over. The pros far outweigh the cons.\n\nVerdict:  Buy this game!", "timestamp_created": 1440873361, "timestamp_updated": 1440873723, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 73, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.824632", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17773900": {"recommendationid": "17773900", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040486886", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1910, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505258261}, "language": "english", "review": "It's 99% fabulous to play if you have nostalgia for the game. I played the ps2 port, emulated, and the dreamcast version. Obviously, dreamcast is the best platform to play it on. It's playing an all time favorite with sharper images (I played on a crt as even with an adapter on a panel doesn't do that much for it); I love seeing textures and patterns technology prevented me from seeing in the past. My favorite part, and the best part of the port, has been the ability to play it in japanese. To be fair; I'm a borderline weeaboo, but at the same time I don't have to hear god damn Roan's voice. I do miss Cam Clark's voice. \n\nThis IS, without a doubt, the best port I've played. It's a favorite so I collected the games and paraphernalia when I was younger. \n\nThe audio is kind of buggy, but not too bad. There are some bizarre sound effects during battle, but only occasionally and not during boss fights. The voice to sound effect volume aren't adjustable either; The voices are too low in japanese compared to the volume of the sound effects coupled with the music. Speaking of music I have a superficial issue where the tracks start and end. There is a short silence between the beginning and end. Its not too bad, but considering how short the tracks are it can sound a bit repetitive. \n\nThe only graphical issues I've encountered are during battle when single target spells are cast. The lighting isn't smooth filling the battle arena, but I haven't experienced this during boss battles. You see what shound be soft lighting fading the further from the light source as a solid rectangle on the ground, luckily it doesn't just remove the texture all together like the ps2 port.\n\nIn whole Grandia II Anniversary Edition is a game you won't regret buying if you love classic jrps.\n\nThis is my review only so far.

Why other JRPG's have not implemented something like it is baffling. \n\nThe battles in Grandia 2 allow you so much control where you do more than just soak up and dish out damage and take a potion every now and then. \n\nAs you and your foes do not take turns in a linear manner. All battles take place in a very simple but dynamic sequence of events on a 3D battlefield. One where you can minimize damage with proper defense, to being able to evade your enemy's attack with clever movement, and even being able to completey cancel an enemy's impending attack if you time and choose your attacks with some thought. \n\nAnd most of all, it is very simple but hard to master. Once you get the hang of it before you know it you'll be feeling like a master and looking forward to every battle in the game unlike in most other JRPG's. \n\nThere is no grind to speak of. It's a lot of fun.\n\nFor this reason alone, even though the Story is great and will hook you into the game very fast, no body should miss this game, whether it be a JRPG fan or even for people who usually don't like this Genre.

I know there has been some ire about re-releasing old games on Steam.  However this remaster is GOOD.  Like really good.  This game was ahead of its time on the PS2 and Dreamcast,and its graphics still hold up to this day.  I do remember some of the puzzling of this game back from when I couldnt stop playing my PS2 version.  \n\nI initially purchased the game for nostalgia value.  I have said repeatedly that Grandia and Grandia 2 are the best JRPGs in the business.  Even to this day.  I hold it in higher regard than Final Fantasy however its all up to taste.  So I am very biased in favor of this game.\n\nThe characters are memorable,they evolve and have depth.  So many games have such formulaic characters that refuse to change and fit into just one stereotype.  This one I actually care about the characters.  And that includes the background characters.  \n\nThe combat system feels like your typical turn based JRPG.  The controls for me are a little unintuitive,however after playing it does become natural.  \n\nDont let my playtime fool you, I leave the game on so I can pick it up in small parts.  If I recall correctly, I'm about 1/3 of the way through the game.  So I would consider this game, if you're a completionist and a world explorer... I would say this game would be about 20 hours of enjoyment.  This game makes me want to explore its world,   Exploration usually leads to more loot in the form of gold,usable items for combat,or even weapons/armor.  \n\nOne thing I did notice.  Very early in the game in the mountains,  I encountered a fairly annoying audio bug.  I had to take off my headset and missed some dialogue in this section.  The problem went away when I left that zone.  \n\nI like the way this game pauses if you tab out of it.  I do this frequently, and I'm returned to my game.  Just as I left it from the tab out.  Combat wont progress without your input and even on some of the denser parts, you may want to tab out of your game while the combat happens.  I would have liked to have seen a way to speed up combat, or to be able to tab out of the game during combat sequences.  I wouldnt have used it, I just would think for some it would be a nice feature.\n\nAll in all, I love this game.  I rave to anyone who would listen that I love this game.

Cela dit, \u00e7a reste quand m\u00eame joli et j'adore revoir un bon vieux \"ZAP\" ou \"BIRDSTRIKE\" m\u00eame pix\u00e9lis\u00e9 de la sorte.\n\nEnfin il y a quelques bugs, ils sont mineurs mais aga\u00e7ant...\n\n- Bug d'image de portrait qui s'incorpore dans les menus : pour faire simple, prenons l'image de statut d'elena et imaginons qu'il apparaisse dans le cadre d'une comp\u00e9tance magique au lieu du nom (et de mani\u00e9re \u00e9tir\u00e9 et \u00e9cras\u00e9 pour s'adapter au cadre), assez peu g\u00eanant, relancer une save et suffisant pour faire disparaitre la chose\n\n- Bug de son : soyons clairs les deux gros d\u00e9faut de ce portage sont la : les FX sont TROP FORTS, c'est irritant surtout sur une surface m\u00e9talique, on n'entend que \u00e7a, vous allez prier pour que vos persos ne bouge pas pendant une phase de dialogue, il faut esp\u00e9rer qu'un patch arrive vite pour corriger cela ! Le pire des cas est quand vous entrez dans un combat et que vous entendez les monstres pendant les 10 premi\u00e9res secondes et uniqment les monstres, la musique est compl\u00e9tement couverte par le bruitage et quand on a une OST excellente comme celle de Grandia II c'est \u00e9nervant.\n\nSurtout quand le second plus gros bug du jeu est sur les musiques, la on ne peux pas faire plus b\u00eate : les loops ne sont pas la, les musiques se lancent donc et recommence du d\u00e9but sans transition, frustrant \u00e9galement, ici en revanche les d\u00e9v non pas vraiment d'excuse et ont int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 r\u00e9parer cela rapidement, \u00e7a fait t\u00e2che.\nVoil\u00e0 pour les d\u00e9fauts, le reste marche bien, le portage est correcte, m\u00eame si du coup avec de tel bug je trouve que payer le prix fort pour le jeu reste chers.\n\nConcernant le gameplay, c'est juste un des meilleurs, si ce n'est LE meilleure syst\u00e8me que j'ai pu exp\u00e9rimenter \u00e0 ce jour, c'est un semi-tour par tour ou les combattants ont leurs icones qui d\u00e9filent sur une barre puis une fois arriv\u00e9 au bout, une multitude d'option s'ouvre \u00e0 vous. Vous pouvez attaquer, faire un coup critique pour contr\u00e9 et annulez l'attaque d'un ennemi, lancer des sorts, utilisez des objets, changez d'\u00e9quipement, utiliser un coup sp\u00e9cial... il y a l'embarra du choix sans que cela soit superflu ou trop vaste, \u00e9videmment les monstre aussi peuvent annuler vos actions, tout est donc assez strat\u00e9gique ! Sachant \u00e9galement que vous avez des magies qui touchent une zone bien pr\u00e9cise, vous devez anticiper le d\u00e9placement de vos ennemis pour \u00eatre s\u00fbr d'optimiser vos sorts et c'est franchement jouissif ! On d\u00e9bloque ses sorts via des artefact nomm\u00e9 oeuf (oeuf du chaos, de la gravit\u00e9, du dragon etc), vous gagnez \u00e0 chaque combat des points de MC et de SC et vous les d\u00e9pensez pour d\u00e9bloquer les sorts ou les coups sp\u00e9ciaux (et \u00e9galement les livres d'habilit\u00e9 qui rajoute des bonus de force, vitesse, magie etc). Tr\u00e8s simple \u00e0 prendre en main le syst\u00e8me se r\u00e9v\u00e8le riche et vous aurez l'oeil riv\u00e9 sur la barre d'action quand elle entre dans le rouge plus d'une fois quand un ennemi puissant chargera une magie et que vous allez esp\u00e9rer que l'un de vos personnages puisse l'annuler \u00e0 temps sous peine de lourde sanctions. \n\nVous l'avez compris le gameplay en combat c'est du m\u00e9ga lourd ! Par contre, en dehors c'est super classique, on va d'un point A a un point B et basta d'ailleurs pas de coffre \u00e0 ramasser en dehors des donjons ou de sous qu\u00eate (a moins que je ne m'en souvienne plus ?) dans ce RPG, cela aurait pus \u00eatre un malus, mais non, m\u00eame pas parce qu'il y a le reste \u00e0 commencer par la bande son.\n\nEt bon sang, quelle bande son ! C'est un r\u00e9gal, bon je ne vais pas vous mentir toutes les pistes ne sont pas \u00e0 la hauteur, mais le th\u00e8me des combats, des boss, les chansons lyriques, ce sont de superbe compositions, je regrette juste peut \u00eatre vraiment la musique de l'intro qui ne d\u00e9gage rien pour moi et la musique des donjons avec son bruit d'horloge que je n'ai jamais compris... Pour le reste : caviar.\n\nConcernant le sc\u00e9nario, il n'est pas foufou, mais tient bien en haleine et poss\u00e8de un tr\u00e8s bon rythme, je me refuse \u00e0 vous spoil les pourquoi du comment sachez seulement que tout se devine 10h avant la fin... voir plus... enfin bon quoi l'identit\u00e9 du gros m\u00e9chant je l'ai vu venir a 10-15h de jeu, zut aucun suspens, mais c'est si gros...\nDu coup pour rattraper un sc\u00e9nario cousue de fil blanc m\u00eame si sympathique nous avons les personnages, c'est le gros point fort qui permet d'oublier une qu\u00eate tr\u00e8s classique. Le h\u00e9ros et cool, la pr\u00eatresse n'est pas super chiante comme beaucoup trop de personnage dans son genre, la d\u00e9mone est juste un de mes perso pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 de JV (je vous laisse d\u00e9couvrir tout sur elle, le spoil ne passera pas par moi !), Roan est... bon je n'ai jamais aim\u00e9 Roan, mais il n'est pas chiant non plus ! L'homme singe... il est cool, diablement cool, bon sang ce que je me retiens d'en dire plus, sachez cependant qu'il est h\u00e9ro\u00efque. Enfin Tio est sympatoche, pas ouf non plus un peux comme Roan, mais quand vous d\u00e9couvrirez ce qu'elle est, c'est logique.\n\nJe ne vais rien dire sur les interactions avec les personnages, il y a des choses terriblement \u00e9videntes qui vont arriver \u00e0 certains d'entre eux, mais pour d'autre, ahahaha bien malin le moi d'il y a 12 ans si j'avais su les tenant et aboutissant de tout \u00e7a.\n\nBref avec ce bon pav\u00e9 vous l'aurez compris, je ne vous recommande pas Grandia II, je vous recommande un excellent RPG, les graphismes piques un peu les yeux, il y a encore des bugs \u00e7a et la, mais revenez lire cette critique apr\u00e8s un certain passage sur Valmar (indice il fait tout rouge dessus), vous comprendrez mieux.\n\nOh et ils ont mis les vois jap, je les ai mise et on peut les changer \u00e0 tout moment, mais je me surprends \u00e0 regretter les Anglaises, un comble non ?\n\nLe mot de la fin ?

So when i bought this edition i heard that it would contain a hard mode and so slightly better rendured models and some better looking shadows ,which it did no complains there. However i quickly started to notice how many sound bites were either cut off such as the save point recover sound or the appearence of ladder sounds/action icon sounds . When i finished my first random encounter i   am familiar with Ryudo's signature \"You better practice if u wanna beat me!\" but i couldnt hear it very well because the sound effects were muffling his speech which was very annoying and kills my excitement of winning a battle at the exp screen . I also noticed that they took out the sound u hear when you use a healing potion or \"heal\" ,when the droplets fall on your character. I made it to my first major voice acted cutscene when u first meet millenia and i was dissapointed to see that the text was having trouble catching up with the voices which bogged down the sequences of the cutscene .

Seiner Zeit eines der besten Jrpg\u00b4s. Die Geschichte die erz\u00e4hlt wird ist gro\u00dfartig und hat eine Wendung, die mich damals sehr zum nachdenken angeregt hat. \n\nMan Spielt einen Geohunter, der f\u00fcr Geld alles tut. Eines Tages soll er eine Chors\u00e4ngerin zu einer Zeremonie as Bodygard begleiten. Die geht nat\u00fcrlich schief und so nimmt das Abenteuer seinen anfang. Im laufe des Spiels trifft man nat\u00fcrlich auf neue begleiter, wird st\u00e4rker und erh\u00e4lt neue F\u00e4higkeitem. Also typisch Rollenspiel halt. Das Kampfsystem ist Rundenbasiert, mit eiigen taktischen M\u00f6glichkeiten. Die Kampfmusik w\u00fcrde ich als einer der besten, die das Genere zu bieten hat beschreiben (hat Ohrwurm Garantie).\n\nDie Anniversary Edition bietet leider wenig neues, bis auf neue Schatten,  Lichteffekte und die japanische Sprachausgabe mit englischen Untertiteln an. Die Sprachausgabe geh\u00f6rt mit unter zu den besten, die ich kenne. Die Grafik lockt in der heutigen Zeit auch keinen mehr hinter den ofen hervor. Das ist aber nicht weiter schlimm, da die Story des Spiels es alle mal wert ist, sie zu erleben. \n\nLeider tritt ein ziemlich b\u00f6ser Bug auf, der das Spielvergn\u00fcgen zerst\u00f6rt. Spricht auf keinen Fall den Typen mit den Fragezeichen Hut an (ist im Laden an zu treffen, ist hier der tutorialman). Der l\u00f6st irgend was aus, so das man in einem Kampf, der zur geschichte geh\u00f6rt und nach einiger Zeit von selbst beendet wird, nicht schafft, da der Trigger anscheinend nicht ausgel\u00f6st wird.\n\nNicht des so trotz, empfehle ich jedem Jrpg Liebhaber dieses Spiel.

Es ist der zweite Teil der gleichnamigen Reihe, die bisher leider in Europa nur sp\u00e4rlich ver\u00f6ffentlicht wurde. Ein Jahr sp\u00e4ter wurde Grandia II sowohl f\u00fcr PC, als auch die Playstation 2 ver\u00f6ffentlicht und im Jahre 2014 erhielt Grandia II einen Release f\u00fcr die Playstation 3. Nun, nach 15 Jahren des Wartens, erschien am 24 August 2015 endlich die \"15th Anniversary Edition\" dieser Rarit\u00e4t auf Steam.\n\nIn Grandia II schl\u00fcpft man in die Rolle des Geohounds Ryudo, der seinen Lebensunterhalt mit den unterschiedlichsten Auftr\u00e4gen bestreitet, die er von mehr oder weniger wohlgesinnten Kunden entgegennehmen muss. Dabei hilft ihm sein guter Freund Sky, ein sprechender Falke. Eines Tages nach einem erfolgreich gegl\u00fccktem Auftrag findet er einen Brief der Kirche von Granas vor, die um seine Dienste bittet. Unwillig nimmt Ryudo den Auftrag entgegen und eskortiert die S\u00e4ngerin Elena zu einem Siegelturm, wo sie ihren Part in einem wichtigen Ritual spielen muss. Leider geht das jedoch nicht ganz ohne Probleme von statten...\nDie Story bietet zwar seinen lustigen Charme und hat einiges an typischem Grandia-Humor, jedoch entwickelt sie sich schnell zu einer ernsthaften Geschichte mit Szenen bei denen kein Auge trocken bleibt.\n\nGrandia II ist ein typisches RPG mit einem etwas anderem Kampfsystem. Wie im Vorg\u00e4nger baut es auf einem Zeitbalken auf, der darstellt, wann einem Charakter ein Kommando gegeben werden kann und wie lange er braucht um dies auszuf\u00fchren. Dies gilt auch f\u00fcr Gegner. Das Besondere hierbei ist, dass dieses System die M\u00f6glichkeit bietet feindliche Attacken aktiv hinauszuz\u00f6gern, zu kontern oder gar vollst\u00e4ndig zu unterbrechen. Wer taktisch richtig k\u00e4mpft kann mit diesem System durch aktives ausweichen, Verhinderung des Angriffs oder anderen Mitteln so manchen Kampf bestehen, ohne dass die Charaktere auch nur einen Treffer einstecken m\u00fcssen.\nZudem besitzt Grandia II ein System f\u00fcr Magie- und Spezialattacken. Spezialattacken und passive F\u00e4higkeiten k\u00f6nnen mit Hilfe von sogenannten \"Skill-Books\" erlernt und verbessert werden, wozu man jedoch Special Coins, eine W\u00e4hrung f\u00fcr Spezialangriffe, in die Entwicklung stecken muss, die man f\u00fcr erfolgreich bestandene K\u00e4mpfe bekommt. Dabei besitzt der Charakter nur diese F\u00e4higkeiten, wenn er auch mit dem passenden Buch ausger\u00fcstet ist.\nSelbiges gilt f\u00fcr Magie, jedoch werden hierbei sogenannte \"Mana-Eggs\" ben\u00f6tigt und die passende W\u00e4hrung dazu, sogenannte \"Magic Coins\".\nAlles in Allem funktioniert der Rest wie in anderen RPGs \u00fcblich.\n\nTechnisch haut die Grafik von Grandia II heute keinen mehr vom Hocker. Dies ist aber auf Grund des Alters der Engine zu erkl\u00e4ren und der Tatsache, dass Grandia II urspr\u00fcnglich f\u00fcr die Dreamcast entwickelt und optimiert wurde. Daran derzeit auch die Anniversary Edition nicht viel. Zwar wurden einige Kompatibilit\u00e4tsprobleme behoben und es wurden Schatten und Ambiente-Ausleuchtung \u00fcberarbeitet, sowie eine Kompatibilit\u00e4t f\u00fcr h\u00f6here Aufl\u00f6sungen hergestellt, jedoch werden 19:9 und 19:10 Formate nicht ganz zu 100% unterst\u00fctzt. Dies zeigt sich ausschlie\u00dflich darin, dass das dargestellte Bild im 4:3 Format bleibt und bei h\u00f6heren Aufl\u00f6sungen einfach schwarze Balken die rechten und linken Bildschirmr\u00e4nder zieren.\nNichtsdestotrotz sind die Umgebungen und Charaktere f\u00fcr ihr Alter noch immer sch\u00f6n anzusehen, auch wenn die Bewegungsanimationen sehr stark an Playmobil-Figuren erinnern.\nEbenfalls in der Anniversary Edition verbessert sind alte, verbuggte Video-Animationen von Zauberspr\u00fcchen und Spezialattacken, die bei manchen Skills zu kurzem einfrieren des Spiels f\u00fchren konnten. Diese sind g\u00e4nzlich behoben.\n\nIm Audiobereich trumpft Grandia II besonders auf. Zum einen durch gut durchdachte Soundeffekte, die in der Anniversary Edition noch ein wenig Verbesserung erfahren haben, und zum anderen durch den hervorragenden Soundtrack der hervorragend zu den Szenen passt und \u00e4u\u00dferst gut Inszeniert ist. Hinzu kommt, dass einige Kompatibilit\u00e4tsprobleme im Audio-Bereich der alten PC-Fassung behoben wurden, sodass mehr Ger\u00e4uschquellen gleichzeitig dargestellt werden k\u00f6nnen. Wo fr\u00fcher ein prasselndes Feuer die Musik unterbrechen musste, da auf der Dreamcast nicht so viele Soundkan\u00e4le zur Verf\u00fcgung waren, ist dies in der Anniversary Edition nun kein Problem mehr. Dazu kommt, dass mittlerweile nicht nur die englischen Synchronstimmen f\u00fcr die teilweise vertonten Dialoge zur Verf\u00fcgung stehen, sondern auch die japanischen. Das ist zwar nicht f\u00fcr alle eine gro\u00dfe Neuerung, da die Dreamcast-Version im Vergleich zur alten PC-Fassung ebenfalls beide Tonspuren besa\u00df, doch jene, die nur die PC-Fassung kennen, werden ihre Freude daran haben.\n\nDie Steuerung mit Tastatur funktioniert, wie \u00fcblich, hervorragend. Die Kompatibilit\u00e4t f\u00fcr Gamepads l\u00e4sst jedoch etwas zu w\u00fcnschen \u00fcbrig. Ich besitze zwar keinen X-Box-Controler, sondern einen Logitech Rumblepad 2, aber dennoch bereitet mir fehlende Kompatibilit\u00e4t derzeit Probleme, sodass ich auf die Tastatur zur\u00fcckgreifen muss.\nDiese kleinen Schnitzer im Bereich Steuerung und Grafik sind im Anbetracht des Alters des Spiels zu verschmerzen, jedoch stammt diese Evaluation direkt vom Release-Termin, sodass noch nicht zu sagen ist, ob in Zukunft Patches oder Mods sich um diese Probleme k\u00fcmmern werden.\n\nZu diesem Gesamtpacket kommt noch ein zus\u00e4tzlicher Hard-Mode, den es bisher noch nicht gegeben hat, der auch alten Grandia-Veteranen noch etwas Anstrengung und Konzentration abverlangen sollte.\n\nZu guter Letzt gilt nur noch zu sagen: Definitiv noch immer einer meiner Lieblings-RPG-Titel \u00fcber dessen Erscheinen auf Steam ich mich definitiv gefreut habe. Man kann nicht umsonst den Ursprung meines Spitznamens hier auf Steam gut erkennen.\n\nAlles in Allem ein ordentliches Packet. Zwar sind hier und da noch ein paar kleinere Schnitzer zu finden, jedoch ist mein Ersteindruck bisher ziemlich positiv. Wer Grandia II schon kennt, wird sich mit dieser Version \u00fcber eine leicht aktualisierte Version mit besserer Systemkompatibilit\u00e4t freuen. F\u00fcr alle anderen gilt: Wer sich mit ein paar kleineren Fehlern, die nicht weiter ins Gewicht fallen, und einer leicht veralteten aber Charmanten Grafik abfinden kann, sollte definitiv mehrere Blicke wagen, denn es winkt eine packende und interessante Story mit interessanten und gut durchdachten Charakteren.

I was ecstatic to find out that this game would be coming out on steam.  I loved the battle system which is really unique compared to other turn based systems. It uses a timer-like bar that indicates when your character is able to make his or her move.  I love the ability to cancel out the enemies moves and have them reset their position on this bar.  \n\nThe story is your typical jrpg stuff where it is the end of the world and a group of people have to combine their efforts to save the world from destruction.  The characters and their interactions are a joy to watch.  There is some romance in the game as well but don't expect too much from that.  The visuals reflect the age of the game and it must be noted that this game is not a HD remaster. In fact, its more of a port with the added bonus of having dual audio tracks and a hard mode added to the game.  In summary, I recommend this game if you are a JRPG fan and miss the old school turn based gaming that used to be so prevalent back in the ps2 era.  Moreover, if you would like to see more JRPG games sold on steam, I recommend to support these companies so that it gives them an incentive to bring the other games over to Steam.

I was obsessed with this game when I was a freshman in college. Incidentally, the semester during which I beat it also happens to be the semester in which I scored the lowest grades. There may be a connection there.\n\nThing is, it was worth it. Grandia II may seem like a prototypical JRPG, but here's the rub: just about everything about it is GREAT. The music, the story, the writing... it's all top notch. The adventure becomes insanely epic as you progress through the tale, and the whole affair is smarter than your average game, with commentary on religion, judgemental preconceptions, and social class playing out through crisp dialogue. Said dialogue is frequently laugh-out-loud hilarious.\n\nOne of Grandia II's strongest selling points is how it takes the typical RPG caveats and streamlines them, and it's so much more fun as a result. The menus are very intuitive and easy to navigate; it's all very clear and easy to pick up. Encounters are not random; though random encounters never bothered me, here the encounter system is implemented brilliantly, where approaching from behind gives you initiative (think Ni No Kuni) while being approached from behind reduces your initiative from the start.\n\nOther refinements that streamline the experience include how inns give you the option of restoring your health AND saving, instead of just one or the other. Same with save points. Yoan's Elixer, which revives fallen characters like Phoenix Downs, actually restores HP also, so you don't waste a rare item bringing a character back just to watch him get one-hit killed again. There are dozens more ways this game improves on the prototypical RPG formula. And unlike some JRPGs it doesn't take 40 hours for things to get going. The story gets interesting very quickly.\n\nThe battle system is one of the areas in which this JRPG shines the most. It's similar to Child of Light, where you can go for combo attacks and score more damage, or try to time it so critical attacks can cancel an opponent's assault. If you can't execute an attack in time, defending actually works to your advantage in this game, as it significantly lowers the damage you'll take. And if you can time your evades properly, you can avoid damage altogether while simultaneously repositioning yourself on the battle map. Watch out though, your opponents can counter and cancel your attacks as well. It's all extremely well balanced, and becomes real addictive real quick... just ask my freshman self.\n\nGrandia II comes HIGHLY recommended. If you've never tried it, give it an hour and you'll realize why it's so awesome.\n\nNote: As far as I can tell, the resolution and other settings cannot be changed from within the game. Fortunately, all you have to do is navigate to your steamapps folder for Grandia II, and the ini is super easy to find in the config folder. It's also very easy to edit.

The port runs at 30FPS however this is not a massive hindrance to gameplay. There does appear to be some teething issues with the port for people running the game on slightly older hardware, though they appear to be manageable for the most part. GungHo are actively fixing bugs that are present in a timely manner.\n\nAs for the game itself, Grandia II is a very engaging RPG. An engaging story that has you playing as a young Geohound (an atheistic mercenary) named Ryudo who is hired by Granas (a religious group) to escort Elena, a Songstress. The voice work is solid, if not quite cheesy at times; it reminds me of old Saturday morning cartoons in style. Japanese voices have been included in this port, though as a non-speaker I feel like I couldn't comment on delivery of their lines. \n\nBored of taking turns of just getting hit, and attacking? Grandia II's battle system is possibly one of the most refined battle systems ever conceived in a JRPG. The battle system feels like a more refined ATB system from older Final Fantasy titles. All battle participants are on a timeline, moving towards making commands, and executing them. This system allows players to manipulate the timeline using various moves such as doing a critical attack on an opponent to delay (& knock back) their next attack. However be careful, as many opponents can do the same to Ryudo & pals. \n\nNoriyuki Iwadare reprises his role as the lead composer of the soundtrack of Grandia. Like the original Grandia, Iwadare has created some fantastic passages of music that will have you humming to for a long time to come. In my opinion Iwadare has a knack for creating some of the most exhilarating, upbeat music that can really give you a kick up the backside.\n\nTo conclude, Grandia II is a masterpiece of its time. Whilst the visuals haven't aged as well as the original Grandia's sprite work, the presentation, gameplay & story more than make up for it.

Me encontr\u00e9 este dilema con Flight simulator, probablemente uno de los juegos a los que mas horas he metido a lo largo de los a\u00f1os, y al final deje pasar la oportunidad. Total, ya lo tengo en edici\u00f3n f\u00edsica me dije... y as\u00ed con varios juegos que ya poseo. Pero hay un par de excepciones, Shenmue (que lo tengo en dreamcast y en Xbox) y Grandia 2, que casualmente tengo comprado 3 veces y con esta 4. \n\nCon ello quiero remarcar el apego que tengo por este juego. Juego que marco un antes y un despu\u00e9s en mi etapa de jugador y que por cierto llego a mi de la manera m\u00e1s absurda. Sal\u00ed a la calle a comprar un juego, el cual estaba agotado en las tiendas y tras mucho divagar me encontr\u00e9 con Grandia 2 y Metropolis street racer en la mano. El ingles era un problema, pero me li\u00e9 la manta a la cabeza y me lo compre guiado \u00fanicamente por las im\u00e1genes de la caja. \n\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 encuentras dentro? siendo sinceros la historia m\u00e1s estandar que hay en el mundillo. Good Vs Evil, bien vs mal, un dios bueno y un dios malo. Nuestro protagonista es un duro \"cazarecompensas\" llamados Geohounds, que es un pasota con todo lo que no sea el dinero y hacer bien su trabajo. Todo cambia cuando te contrata la iglesia para hacer de guardaespaldas y una ceremonia sale mal.\n\nGr\u00e1ficos en su d\u00eda fueron pioneros. Un engine que permit\u00eda rotar la c\u00e1mara libremente, v\u00eddeos superpuestos en los gr\u00e1ficos para las magias, un mundo con carisma y una banda sonora de gran calidad.\n\nComo digo nos espera una historia con una base muy convencional pero que seg\u00fan pasan las horas se va volviendo complicada, giros inesperados y una recta final de escandalo que yo a nivel personal considero de las mejores que he jugado.\n\nEl sistema de combate es una mezcla entre tiempo real y turnos. Una barra nos indica cuando los personajes estar\u00e1n listos, y la acci\u00f3n se pausa para elegir la acci\u00f3n. La gran baza que introdujo Grandia 2 fue la capacidad de interrumpir las acciones si encadenabamos impactos cr\u00edticos en los momentos justos. Tendremos gran cantidad de formas de mejorar los personajes, pudiendo subirles los niveles de las habilidades f\u00edsicas, las m\u00e1gicas que van ancladas a unos \"huevos\" de magia que har\u00e1n que podamos hacer cualquier personaje m\u00e1gico, y unos libros con power ups que podremos subir de niveles y asignar independientemente.\n\nResumiendo, toda una obra maestra a los RPG japoneses con una historia que tal vez le cueste un par de horas coger ritmo pero que luego es un no parar de sorpresas.\n\nUna cosa a destacar es como est\u00e1 estructurada la aventura, y es que el patr\u00f3n se repite constantemente: \nLlegas a ciudad nueva -> 30 minutos de historia -> mazmorra -> enemigo final -> transici\u00f3n a nueva ciudad.\n\nEdito: Los fallos de sonido y las esperas despu\u00e9s de cada magia al final han quedado resueltos con el parche de hoy 3 de septiembre, por lo que ya no hay excusa. \n\n\nLo mejor:\n[list]\n    [*]Un RPG como los de antes\n    [*]Historia cargada de sorpresas\n    [*]Banda sonora\n[/list]\n\nLo peor: \n[list]\n    [*]La falta de di\u00e1logos hablados con voz en la mayor\u00eda del juego\n    [*]Los v\u00eddeos mantienen su resoluci\u00f3n original\n    [*]Ritmo de narraci\u00f3n repetitivo a lo largo de todo el juego\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1440527307, "timestamp_updated": 1443537859, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28,

It is a JRPG with active battle elements and a 3D field of combat which give it a unique edge, even for those not seeking its retro appeal.

This port is also extremely well done,  I highly recommend this to anyone, especially to people who have never played the original.   Grandia II is one of the very best Dreamcast games and is worth your time and money. \n\nThis is a classic JRPG that even with its old age, this is still one of the very best in the genre and many current generation of gamers never got to experience the original back in the dreamcast days,  if you're one of those who never got to experience the Grandia series then your in for one huge treat with Grandia II.   \n\nThe story starts out with Ryudo, the geohound taking on oddjobs - think mercenary for hire and as the story progresses you will learn more about the battles between light and darkness long ago, add in a couple of plot twists and some endearing characters who join your party then its off to save the world from impending disaster. \n\nBattles are pseudo-turn based with an active meter indicting who's turn is next, but with a flare of strategy as your turn can be delayed, or even cancelled if your not careful with your battle choices, however - you can do the very same to your opponents and learning these tricks is key to winning, especially during some tricky boss battles. \n\nEach character who joins has their typical unique character skills, and magic can be shared by the use of mana eggs - like with most JRPGs,  skill points are earned each battle and can be spent on upgrading or purchasing new skills/spells.  Whilst there is a minor grind if you obviously want to get every spell/skill maximised but the pace is fairly fast so for the most part, any SP grinding isn't usually a problem.\n\nThe graphics are obviously dated, but this remaster honestly does a fairly good job in updating the graphics and provides more options than the previous windows version ever did, just remember though that this game is quite old so don't expect cutting edge graphics, or highly detailed cut scenes. \n\nThe soundtrack is legendary,  some of the very best battle music ever created, awesome electronica style with hard rock edge.  Even after your 1000th battle, the battle and boss music never gets old.  The rest of the soundtrack is equally good.  I'd like to say some bad things about the game, but honestly - there really isn't any per say.   Okay, a couple of boss battles have somewhat 'cheap' mechanics but can easily be beaten with some perseverance. \n\n+ Good Battles\n+ Good Story\n+ Good Characters\n+ Good Soundtrack\n+ Good Skill/Magic System\n\n+/- Outdated Graphics", "timestamp_created": 1440477206, "timestamp_updated": 1440477206, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.646600", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17703670": {"recommendationid": "17703670", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006847337", "num_games_owned": 210, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3254, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464751038}, "language": "english", "review": "Disclaimer: This review is coming from the perspective of someone who only experienced the game through the PS2 port, so I can't make any comparisons to whatever differences there may be from the original Dreamcast release.\n\nI'm going to get the negative points, as I feel that is usually the main thing people look for first in a review.\n\n-Partially locked at 30fps, since this review was written 60fps support was added for battles while the rest of the game runs at 30.\n-No Native widescreen support, only 4:3 or stretched available\n-No audio settings in setup, which can be an issue because the mixing is very wonky, causing dialogue to often be drowned out by SFX and music.\n-Controllers may not work until you go into your Windows controller settings and set it to work with old games.\n-I have heard of one minor glitch that causes you to not recieve any coins if you skip through the results screen after combat, but I haven't experienced this myself.\n\nNow for the positives\n\n-The color is vastly improved over the PS2 version with noticable texture upgrades\n-Native 1080p support has the game looking crisp and clean.\n-There is an option for MSAA x2-x8, everything looks silky smooth\n-Original Japanese dub is selectable\n-Stable performance, although the game may be locked at 30 it is well optimized and I haven't noticed the game dipping below 30 as of this writing.\n\n\nWith that said, this is a fantastic update to one of my favorite games of all time and I eagerly await what GungHo ports next. I fully reccomend this to anyone who has even a passing interest in the genre, if only to experience what I consider to be the absolute pinnacle of JRPG turn based combat.", "timestamp_created": 1440475369, "timestamp_updated": 1441313123, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17703564": {"recommendationid": "17703564", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970320868", "num_games_owned": 2971, "num_reviews": 88, "playtime_forever": 4097, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443939860}, "language": "english", "review": "Changing my No to a Yes with patch 1.03.

What more could you want out of an RPG?\n\nDespite It's linearity Grandia 2 has so much attention to detail, particularly with NPC's and dialogue. Grandia 2 is very dialogue heavy but it's dialogue is what makes it such a stand-out title amongst other JRPG's. Unlike standard JRPG's where the NPC's talk to you and you walk away, Grandia 2 makes the NPC's relevant by adding character interaction whilst talking to them as opposed to them talking to what might as well be a brick wall. This gives more life to the world and more personality to the characters and setting. It's a truly unique experience that cannot be missed.\n\nThe combat is slightly imbalanced at times but is pretty enjoyable and has a few innovative ideas to spice it up. I reccommend playing on the game's hard difficulty though as Normal is a tad easy. Hard makes it so that you actually need to use some strategy if you want to progress smoothly. The battle music is easily the most awesome battle music i've ever heard in a videogame (the music that plays in the trailer). The rest of the soundtrack is also great, it gives off this 80's vibe which adds even more personality to the game. There's just something so quirky about the soundtrack and the narrative that makes it really alluring to play.\n\nThe visuals in the original were admittedly pretty mediocre, not because of the art design, mainly because of the quality. That is fine tuned considerably in this version and the world looks bright and colorful, it might not be everyones cup of tea but it's definitely nice to look at in this version.\n\nAll in all, this is an underrated classic and is my second favourite JRPG of all time for a reason. You should seriously pick this up and surprise yourself with this gem if you consider yourself a fan of this genre.\n\nNote: There are a few crashing issues post battle, best way to avoid them is to not skip the xp screen.

My then-girlfriend surprised me with a game, she said she thought I would like it just by looking at the cover art. She was right!\n\nIt's hard to put into words why I like this game. The story is not that great, your typical JRPG run-of-the-mill story you find used over and over, with their variance on it. I think what I really loved so much about the game was the character development. Every good JRPG has it and they do it well, but this game REALLY caught my attention with it. There were times when I played and I thought to myself, \"Wow, I love the direction they're going\", with either one character or the other. \n\nAnother thing I loved is, it's a 4-person party. I looooove 4-person party JRPGs. Really allows for some great boss fights. But what I TRULY love is, the game doesn't give you extra characters. You can never swap characters out; the four that run with you, are with you unless the game substitutes them out for someone else. I believe there's a total of 6 different characters in the game, they're all really diverse and unique, they bring their own element to the fights.\n\nYou level up like usual, collecting four types of currency; EXP, gold, SC & MC. Gold buys your usual things; armor and weapons, items. SC are Special Coins, they are used to purchase and upgrade your Special Attacks, which consume SP, the green meter under your HP & MP bars. MC are Magic Coins, they work similar to SC except they unlock Magic skills on the Magic Eggs you will acquire throughout the game. \n\nThere are numerous other reviews there that go more in-depth about this game & its playstyle, what it does, etc..

"Short Version:\nIf you played oldschool JRPGs but never played Grandia II, get this game!\nIf you like RPGs and look for an interesting turnbased/realtime combat-system mix, get this game!\nIn my opinion, this is one of the best JRPGs ever made, with quite certainly the best combat system.\n\nLonger Version:\nMy gametime doesn't tell, but I played through this game multiple times when it was originally released, so bear with me.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\nAwesome Storytelling: \nThere are multiple voiced dialogues and this version actually comes with the original Japanese voices, a great plus for me who only knew the sometimes a bit wooden english voiceovers.\nThe story itself is pretty awesome and told in some kind of episodic format with the characters on your team rotating throughout the story, you get to know these characters not only through simple cutscenes, but, what for me at the time was mindblowing, through conversations around the campfire when they are resting. Yes there are multiple games that use this mechanic, but for me Grandia was the first I ever experienced, so it made the whole thing even more enjoyable.\n\nThe Characters:\nWhile all of them are to a certain part classic JRPG tropes like the damsel in distress, the revenge driven clanleader, and the grumpy sellsword, each of them has facettes to their character you would probably not expect on the first glace. Each character has an interesting backstory and evolves a lot during the remainder of the game.\n\nThe combat system:\n[i]Ohh boy, where do I start. This system is in my opinion one of the best, if not the best, that has ever been created, the perfect mix between tactical turnbased and realtime combat.[/i]\nOkay nostalgia aside, I still believe this is one of the best systems I ever had the pleasure to play, it builds a lot around tactic instead of pure damage dealing and overlevelling your characters like a ton of other JRPGs. Instead of grinding it's just as effective to wrap your head around positioning, not just of your characters but also your enemies, and timing.\nWhile on first look quite simple the system has a lot of depth, with crowd control, animation-cancels, AOE-spells, a counter and a combo mechanic. There are so many different utility items it melts your brain considering the possibilities.\nAnd the bossfights are just a blast, the mechanics they employ to make the fights different are amazing. And because of the emergent complexity of the combat system there are multiple ways to kill bosses as well.\n\nGearing and customization:\nAs I said in the combat section already, this game is deep. There are multiple ways to build each character depending on what you are looking for. \nIn the game you can find so called eggs. Think of them as power-items that give your characters special magical abailities. Some are build around healing, others around damage, yet again some around meele and afflictions.\nWhile there are the obvious choices some fairly interesting and highly effective combinations are possible.\nDifferent weapons in this game can actually affect how a character fights and what he can do, it's important to think about your current team composition as well as their gear and skills when fighting, especially in the bossfights. Oh and do not sell your resistance gear, you will need it.\n\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\nYes the game is not perfect, here are some things that people might find annoying:\n\nOverpowered Items:\nI think this is something the new hardmode will (hopefully at some point, when it's more than just 20% more hP for enemies) fix, but there are a few Items in the game that are just insanely powerful. While the maximum damage per attack is capped at a certain level those items can reach those amounts already early in the game and oneshot a lot of enemies and make bossfights significantly easier.\n\nAnnoying character tropes:\nIf you do not like a Damsel-Priestess and a Tsundere as your main female characters, you are probably going to have a baaaad time. While their characters get deeper later on, especially in the beginning they can be annoying.\n\nSlow start:\nThe first hour of the game is dialogues and some 1 or 2 serious fights (there are other fights but you pretty much 2-shot everything). Give the game time, as soon as your party is full and the story gets going the combat system becomes extremely rewarding.\n\nCombat camera:\nThis... thing... was/is the only letdown about the combat system. It's not that it makes the game unplayable, it's just annoying, because sometime you do not see everything. But as soon as an enemy acts the camera usually zooms out and shows you what you need to see to make a decision, sometimes it can mess up your tactics though, if you \"forgot\" there was another enemy.\n\nVisuals:\nI'm glad they took the \"HD Remake\" off the title. It looks slightly better than I remember and runs on 1920x1080 (with black borders because of 4:3) on solid 30 FPS, but well it looks very, very dated. Also no 60fps, 4k, or widescreen... but... well, it's still pretty damn beautiful!\n\n[b]So yeah, do I recommend this: Hell yeah!

Und das als Englisch-Anf\u00e4ngerin damals!\nSo ich versuche einmal Schritt f\u00fcr Schritt auf diverse Punkte einzugehen.\n\nHandlung: Einfach Fantastisch! \u00c4hem ^^\nAlso es geht um den ziemlich kalten, recht geldgierigen S\u00f6ldner (Geohound) Ryudo, der einen Auftrag annimmt die gutm\u00fctige, naive Kirchenschwester Elena zum Gramia-Tower zu eskortieren. Dort sollen sie und ihre Schwestern ein Ritual durchf\u00fchren um Valmar zu bannen. Ohne viel zu spoilern: Valmar ist sozusagen der Teufel. Granas hingegen der gute Gott. Allerdings geht bei dem Ritual etwas schief und pl\u00f6tzlich m\u00fcssen Ryudo und Elena den gesamten Kontinent durchqueren. \nEs h\u00f6rt sich zwar recht vorhersehbar an, jedoch hat die Story einige unvorhersehbare Storyelemente und spielt mit den Gef\u00fchlen des Spielers. Au\u00dferdem ist das Spiel im Grunde eine einzige Kritik (An was? Spielt das Spiel oder googelt es wer sich spilern will ^^).\n\nGrafik: Ok, das ist f\u00fcr heutige Zeit ein kleiner Minuspunkt. F\u00fcr damalige Verh\u00e4ltnisse ist die Grafik revolution\u00e4r gewesen - kann heute aber nat\u00fcrlich kaum mit hochaufl\u00f6senden Grafiken etc. punkten. Trotzem, es gibt deutlich schlimmeres f\u00fcr damalige Verh\u00e4ltnisse, es ist nicht verpixelt und man kann alles gut erkennen. Au\u00dferdem wurde f\u00fcr die Anniversary-Edition die Grafik wirklich etwas hochgeschraubt - Schatten sind hochaufl\u00f6sender und in den Sequenzen ist alles besser erkennbar.\n\nMusik: Ok ohne zu \u00fcbertreiben - musikalisch ein Meisterwerk.\nEin Ohrwurm nach dem anderen, Handlungen werden gut untermalt. Bei dem ein oder anderen Ort stand ich Ingame sogar Ewigkeiten um der Musik zuzuh\u00f6ren. Mehr kann ich dazu einfach nicht schreiben. XD\n\nFazit: Ein wirklich episches Spiel, das man auf alle F\u00e4lle gespielt haben sollte. Es beinhaltet Fantasy, Romanze, und viel Witz, aber auch Spannung und Trauer. Ich hab an einer Stelle so geheult :'( (Kenner k\u00f6nnten sich denken was ich meine). Zwar gibt es das Spiel soweit nicht in Deutsch, allerdings ist das Englisch wirklich einfach. \nWie gesagt: Ich kann es jedem empfehlen der mal einen Meilenstein der Spielegeschichte spielen will ;) \n\nHaving fun! :D", "timestamp_created": 1440441531, "timestamp_updated": 1440441531, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 77, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.831304", "comment_count": "12",

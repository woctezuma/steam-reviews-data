A SIMPLE TIMEKILLER, YET HARDCORE SLAV MASTERPIECE [/h1]\n\n\n\n[h1] First Look [/h1]\n\nSlavistan, the simple to describe this game with a simple sentence is that this game, is a bundle of 3 Slav-themed minigames (with each based on different Slavic places: Russia, Balkan, Poland). Each minigame puts you in a different situations that happens in Slavic Country, [strike] based on majority Western people views about Slavic country such as Russia [/strike]. The game's purpose is to kill your time whenever you're feeling bored, or tired after a marathon of CSGO or Overwatch.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\n \nThe gameplay is unique, in a positive way. Because each minigame is fun and challenging. The dev team surely put a lot of hardwork in this work. And you need no worry about game-breaking bugs and glitches, because I haven't met even a single minor bug.\n\n[h1] Graphics [/h1]\n\nThe developer, Free Candy Studios, serves this game in a classic 8-Bit graphics. Well, this could be good, or bad. Depending on your personal preferences. But for me, the 8-Bit graphics are on point. Since we're playing an old Slav-themed game in a Slavic country (which is partly known for their poverty and old, slow, but reliable machinery, at least most people in the Western part of the world, they see it that way).\n\n[h1] Replayability [/h1]\n\nYou can ONLY play the game in three ways (only 10 MB-ish though), and that will bores you quickly. But the game is kinda challenging (especially if you're trying to reach a high score), and the game has 5 unique unlockable characters that surely challenges you more, to complete your Slav character collections. So i guarantee you, this game will be your first pick when it comes to killing time or winding up after a tough competitive CSGO match.\n\n[h1] Pricing [/h1]\n\nIt's really cheap, you'll spend a small fortune for a good 3 Slavic minigames. [spoiler] And they give discounts for this game quite often. [/spoiler]\n\n[h1] Verdict [/h1]\n\nThis game is a really good choice to spend your short free time. Maybe there are some issues with the game variations, but 3 minigames should be enough to spend your 15 minutes with a jolly good fun. A definitely must buy.\n\n9.5/10\n\nP.S.

You can squat down, drink vodka/pivo/rakija, cossack-dance to hardbass while avoiding a charging bear, or have a bar fight. You can play as a variety of Slavic characters, from a classic gopnik to your babushka.\n \nTHE BAD\nOnly three Slavic countries are represented (Balkans standing for Serbia). Also, you cannot eat semechki or drink kompot. And you cannot play as Boris the Shashlik King. And there is a distinct lack of mayonez.\n\nAll in all, a very cheap game completely worth the low price which will not have you on your end of month butterbrot recipe right after payday. If you're slav, buy it. If you're not slav, buy it.", "timestamp_created": 1479933125, "timestamp_updated": 1479933125, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count":

Slavistan has strong arcade influences, and currently consists of 3 locations (game modes): Russia, Poland and the Balkan peninsula. In Russia, the most challenging game mode, you have to keep dancing by pressing the correct arrrow key when prompted to do so, while collecting the vodka bottles and Adidas shoes thrown at you, and at the same time evading the bears that roam around. In the Balkans (where I live, so I can pretty much confirm it's true), you engage into a bar fight, where somehow every single person (and bear) is against you. In the final game mode, in Poland, you must keep your balance while squatting behind the nightclub with your mates, having to drink in order to manage to keep your balance more easily. \nThere are also unlockables in the game, more specifically different character models. As you get higher scores in the 3 countries, you unlock other characters such as a bear, a gopnik and your grandma.\nOverall, it is a pretty good slavic-themed time-killer, worth its current price of 2 euros, as it will get you at least an hour or two of fun.\n\nTL;DR: You want to see your babushka run from bears, fight bears, and/or squat with bears?

The crowd of gopniks gathered in front of your glorious performance will throw you various pickups that give you protection against bear attacks as well as alcohol that refills your health.\n\nSecond one is in the Balkans. You are sitting at the bar with Radovan, when he suddenly starts to argue with the Croat sitting at the nearest table. You try to calm the situation, but after so many bottles of rakija all you can say is: \u201cj\u0454b\u0454m ti majku!\u201d, and soon the whole village is after you. The goal here is to fight everyone in typical Yugoslav fashion, swinging the mouse to throw drunken punches.\n\nLast one is in Poland. You\u2019ve clearly had too much vodka, but your friend Piotr has brought the whole tracksuit crew with him and they want you to squat outside of the \u201ccheeki breeki\u201d bar with them to drink even more. So you try your best to stay on the soles of your feet whilst chugging one beer after another \u2013 in usual Slav logic, the more intoxicated you are the easier it is to find your balance.\n\nFor a funny little indie game made by two people this is actually pretty cool \u2013 plus at first it can be frustrating enough to make you shout \u201c\u041aurwa ma\u0107!\u201d, but it doesn\u2019t take long to unlock all optional characters and gets old quick.

Hitler was chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945, and served as dictator from 1934 to 1945. His policies precipitated World War II and the Holocaust. Hitler committed suicide with wife Eva Braun on April 30, 1945, in his Berlin bunker.\n\nEarly Years\n\nDictator Adolf Hitler was born in Braunau am Inn, Austria, on April 20, 1889, and was the fourth of six children born to Alois Hitler and Klara Polzl. When Hitler was 3 years old, the family moved from Austria to Germany. As a child, Hitler clashed frequently with his father. Following the death of his younger brother, Edmund, in 1900, he became detached and introverted. His father did not approve of his interest in fine art rather than business. In addition to art, Hitler showed an early interest in German nationalism, rejecting the authority of Austria-Hungary. This nationalism would become the motivating force of Hitler's life.\n\nAlois died suddenly in 1903. Two years later, Adolf's mother allowed her son to drop out of school. He moved to Vienna and worked as a casual laborer and a watercolor painter. Hitler applied to the Academy of Fine Arts twice, and was rejected both times. Out of money, he moved into a homeless shelter, where he remained for several years. Hitler later pointed to these years as the time when he first cultivated his anti-Semitism, though there is some debate about this account.\n\nAt the outbreak of World War I, Hitler applied to serve in the German army. He was accepted in August 1914, though he was still an Austrian citizen. Although he spent much of his time away from the front lines, Hitler was present at a number of significant battles and was wounded at the Somme. He was decorated for bravery, receiving the Iron Cross First Class and the Black Wound Badge.\n\n3\nGALLERY\n3 Images\nHitler became embittered over the collapse of the war effort. The experience reinforced his passionate German patriotism, and he was shocked by Germany's surrender in 1918. Like other German nationalists, he believed that the German army had been betrayed by civilian leaders and Marxists. He found the Treaty of Versailles degrading, particularly the demilitarization of the Rhineland and the stipulation that Germany accept responsibility for starting the war.\n\nAfter World War I, Hitler returned to Munich and continued to work for the military as an intelligence officer. While monitoring the activities of the German Workers\u2019 Party (DAP), Hitler adopted many of the anti-Semitic, nationalist and anti-Marxist ideas of DAP founder Anton Drexler. Drexler invited Hitler to join the DAP, which he did in 1919.\n\nTo increase its appeal, the DAP changed its name to the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP). Hitler personally designed the party banner, featuring a swastika in a white circle on a red background. Hitler soon gained notoriety for his vitriolic speeches against the Treaty of Versailles, rival politicians, Marxists and Jews. In 1921, Hitler replaced Drexler as NSDAP party chairman.\n\nHitler's vitriolic beer-hall speeches began attracting regular audiences. Early followers included army captain Ernst Rohm, the head of the Nazi paramilitary organization, the Sturmabteilung (SA), which protected meetings and frequently attacked political opponents.\n\nOn November 8, 1923, Hitler and the SA stormed a public meeting of 3,000 people at a large beer hall in Munich. Hitler announced that the national revolution had begun and declared the formation of a new government. After a short struggle including 20 deaths, the coup, known as the \"Beer Hall Putsch,\" failed.\n\nHitler was arrested three days later and tried for high treason. He served a year in prison, during which time he dictated most of the first volume of Mein Kampf (\"My Struggle\") to his deputy, Rudolf Hess. The book laid out Hitler's plans for transforming German society into one based on race.\n\nRise to Power\n\nThe Great Depression in Germany provided a political opportunity for Hitler. Germans were ambivalent to the parliamentary republic and increasingly open to extremist options. In 1932, Hitler ran against Paul von Hindenburg for the presidency. Hitler came in second in both rounds of the election, garnering more than 35 percent of the vote in the final election. The election established Hitler as a strong force in German politics. Hindenburg reluctantly agreed to appoint Hitler as chancellor in order to promote political balance.\n\nHitler used his position as chancellor to form a de facto legal dictatorship. The Reichstag Fire Decree, announced after a suspicious fire at the Reichstag, suspended basic rights and allowed detention without trial. Hitler also engineered the passage of the Enabling Act, which gave his cabinet full legislative powers for a period of four years and allowed deviations from the constitution.\n\nHaving achieved full control over the legislative and executive branches of government, Hitler and his political allies embarked on a systematic suppression of the remaining political opposition. By the end of June, the other parties had been intimidated into disbanding. On July 14, 1933, Hitler's Nazi Party was declared the only legal political party in Germany.\n\nMilitary opposition was also punished. The demands of the SA for more political and military power led to the Night of the Long Knives, which took place from June 30 to July 2, 1934. Ernst R\u00f6hm and other SA leaders, along with a number of Hitler's political enemies, were rounded up and shot.\n\nThe day before Hindenburg's death in August 1934, the cabinet had enacted a law abolishing the office of president and combining its powers with those of the chancellor. Hitler thus became head of state as well as head of government, and was formally named as leader and chancellor. As head of state, Hitler became supreme commander of the armed forces. He began to mobilize for war. Germany withdrew from the League of Nations, and Hitler announced a massive expansion of Germany\u2019s armed forces.\n\nThe Nazi regime also included social reform measures. Hitler promoted anti-smoking campaigns across the country. These campaigns stemmed from Hitler's self-imposed dietary restrictions, which included abstinence from alcohol and meat. At dinners, Hitler sometimes told graphic stories about the slaughter of animals in an effort to shame his fellow diners. He encouraged all Germans to keep their bodies pure of any intoxicating or unclean substance.\n\nA main Nazi concept was the notion of racial hygiene. New laws banned marriage between non-Jewish and Jewish Germans, and deprived \"non-Aryans\" of the benefits of German citizenship. Hitler's early eugenic policies targeted children with physical and developmental disabilities, and later authorized a euthanasia program for disabled adults.\n\nThe Holocaust was also conducted under the auspices of racial hygiene. Between 1939 and 1945, Nazis and their collaborators were responsible for the deaths of 11 million to 14 million people, including about 6 million Jews, representing two-thirds of the Jewish population in Europe. Deaths took place in concentration and extermination camps and through mass executions. Other persecuted groups included Poles, communists, homosexuals, Jehovah's Witnesses and trade unionists, among others. Hitler probably never visited the concentration camps and did not speak publicly about the killings.\n\nWorld War II\n\nIn 1938Hitler, along with several other European leaders, signed the Munich Agreement. The treaty ceded the Sudetenland districts to Germany, reversing part of the Versailles Treaty. As a result of the summit, Hitler was named Time magazine's Man of the Year for 1938.

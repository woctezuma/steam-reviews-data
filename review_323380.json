The setup is that you're an unnamed playtester on a game that's been stuck in development hell for years. You end up with 'debug' powers in the game world and need to use these to progress, while playing witness to the squabbling between the major actors in the game's development; which gives you an insight into the painful history of it all. This setup is used to good effect right from the beginning (e.g. you spawn and pick up the sort of legendary sword you'd expect in such circumstances and then it's almost instantly wrenched from your grasp by the lead designer after an argument about whether the game should even have any combat or not) and all throughout we get skewerings of familiar concepts like crowd-funding, ridiculous fan demands, etc. Mechanically though it's also very interesting and well put together. Your debug powers don't extend to changing anything about your own avatar; but what you can do is trap and edit the attributes of all NPCs in the game. This is handled through a toggling interface rather than actual code cutting but the upshot is that all the behaviours and armaments of the objects you encounter can be tweaked and buffed, with the caveat that you can only use things you've already encountered. Want to create an army of hovering attack dogs that use the fire-proof properties of rocks and will attack mushrooms on sight? Have at it! This leads to a sandbox-y approach to problem solving and the games makes experimentation suitably easy so you never fear just dicking around. If I had any complaint it would be that there's just not enough of this and it seems to end just as you're properly motoring with it all. Oh, and there's one attack type which is almost game-breakingly powerful once you work out how it functions. The upside to that is the game never outstays it's welcome and I think most people here would get a lot of fun out of this 'game about making games'.", "timestamp_created": 1515423281, "timestamp_updated": 1515423281, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39163650": {"recommendationid": "39163650", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016051885", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 361, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 361, "last_played": 1515357452}, "language": "english", "review": "Odd but very intersting game experience.

It's a commentary on game design and development that I think works in multiple ways and is told with a very dry humor that I really enjoyed.\n\nThe overall look of the game is very appealing, sort of comic-booky with splashes of color that really stand out. The voice acting is excellent - I was pretty jazzed to hear Rusty Venture. The gameplay is really excellent - you can't really do anything yourself, you have to freeze and edit enemies so that they become your allies instead of fighting you, and you can also take their abilities (down to fighting and walking) and give them to other creatures. I did find that the puzzles in the game didn't really match the complexity of such a powerful tool - there's pretty much only three creatures in the game that have abilities I'd say you need, and you might be able to work around two of those; in addition there are creature upgrades you can find but I never used any of them or felt like anything would have been significantly easier with them.\n\nWhen you're given the chance to design your own level and are given more resources based on how well you explored the overworld, I thought that was actually a lot more fun than I expected, and I had a really good time listening to a couple of the characters play through it and comment on how it was put together.\n\nOverall, don't miss this one.", "timestamp_created": 1513070614, "timestamp_updated": 1513070614, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38192158": {"recommendationid": "38192158", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012736826", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 406, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512854386}, "language": "hungarian", "review": "Hogy az ember tesztel egy f\u00e9lk\u00e9sz programot, az m\u00e9g csak hagyj\u00e1n... na de \"bel\u00fclr\u0151l\"?!

Even after playing it, it sticks out as a game that does not want to succeed as such: it functions best as a metanarrative on the experience of play, and the responsibilities and capacities of creators and consumers in the modern space. That's probably a suicidal shtick, but if you enjoy narrative-experiential walking simulators such as [i] The Beginner's Guide [/i] and vacuously unfunny alternative universe Crows, Crows, Crows titles, (Dr. Langeskov...) maybe it'll do something for you. It's advertising itself as a 'darkly comedic story,' but I disagree: I smirked a few times, and that's about it. \n\nThe game seems to lose sight of its narrative ambitions at times, lost amongst some less-than-ideal play systems. Mostly trial and error puzzles, of which there are few, a functional collectathon that rewards world building texts and audio logs (which [i] interrupt [/i] your adventuring in order to be played), and shallow power acquisition. [b] But that's the point,[/b] the game insists: you're walking around an incomplete indie-funded mess, a receptacle of consumer's hopes and designer's difficulties. And against this I rattle that neither parody nor self-awareness preserve a game's systems, and by the end of the relatively brief adventure (~2-3 hours), The Circle has a response for me: I'm entitled in this perspective. Yeah, well, maybe I am. \n\nI was sufficiently enraptured by the story to see it through to the end. I think the game's division of achievements behind sub-par game systems (such as waiting for audiologs, and collectathonning in a bland world), as well as playthrough-exclusive achievements amidst a twist-dependant narrative, is stupid: but my criticisms of its systems melt away with claims of intentionality.

Being able to trap and alter monsters to help you in overcoming challenges is quite a nice feat. It also adds a puzzle element to the game, as you will need to use your creatures to overcome certain challenges. Such as finding an entity with Flameproof to fight the active Flammers.

Still, it is a bit of fun to get through, and the story does do a good job of showing how easily ideas get thrown around and scrapped.\nI do have a couple complants: the backtracking in the overworld can get incredibly tedious, especally when Life becomes and issue.

You play as a playtester, exploring an unfinished game that has been repeatedly scrapped in various phases of development. By befriending an in-game entity, you learn to manipulate the environment and creatures within the game, to learn more about the developers and history of the title.\n\nThis core of the gameplay is fascinating, locating creatures and swapping properties in and out like a mad scientist. You will often need to locate a particular creature to steal its ability in order to progress or defeat a tough enemy. In some ways it is a creative puzzle game. Often, the combinations you create are hilarious. As an added bonus, you can name your new creations (what would you like to call your flying dog with a railgun for a mouth?).\n\nIf the game were limited in scope to only focus on this core, it would likely be a better game. However, there is another plot, a conflict between the developers, that I found less intriguing. Though this culminates in a very entertaining scene, I still felt that the title would have been better without it. The game attempts to make an argument about \"ownership\" when players begin to feel they have a better understanding of the game world than its initial creator (think if viewers decided that certain aspects of a new Game of Thrones book were inappropriate, and wrested control of writing and publication from George RR Martin). I can't say that the attempt falls completely flat, but I will say that The Beginner's Guide does a much better job exploring this theme.\n\nHowever, the gameplay in the Beginner's Guide is nowhere near as engaging as the Magic Circle.

You use various abilities stripped from mobs to turn other mobs to help you. It takes some out of the box thinking and there are no single solutions to any challenge. \n\nHowever, the game is definately a casual experience. There is no challenge that will test you beyond your witt or patience. There is combat, but you are not directly involved. \n\nThere is a story here as well. It's a meta commentary on a meta game, where you play as the 4th wall inserting your own version of meta as you progess... Yup, it's an interesting concept. As it plays out however, there are some weak points. Nothing that ruins anything, but don't expect an epic story like Firewatch or Valley. \n\nWhere this game suffers is in level design. The game is slightly open-world. As you play you open new parts of the level. However, they weave into each other. Parts show up on top of other parts. It can get difficult to track where you have and have not been. But it's not so difficult that you'll ever get completely lost. I found it a bit annoying at times, but never to the point of frustration.\n\nAchievements in this game are fair yet not easy to 100%. Expect to play the game at least twice if you're achievement hunting. I played till the end and found out I missed a decent portion of collectibles.

Not [i]too[/i] meta--never gets preachy or up on a quirky high-horse. Treats players like they have a functioning, analytical brain at all times. Low stress gameplay, just a fun ride through a weird world, spying on some devs with problems. Beaten in 4 hours according to Steam, progressing at a tempered pace. I haven't done so yet, but in about 10 hours one could 100% it (following guides, at least).\n\n\n [b]Pros:[/b]\n- Fufillment from aquiring an increasing number of combat abilities.\n- Exploration, with rewards for your time.\n- Encouraged player-driven comedy, regarding the 'combat' options & some other segments.\n- Good comedy overall. Appropriate and funny. Game made me smirk a lot.\n- Challenges/puzzles that are not hard to understand, but might be difficult to overcome. [spoiler]The fire puzzle can kiss my a**, I finally flew over it. [/spoiler]\n- Interesting characters, plot-driven. Unfortunately, relatable, especially if you've been keeping up with game-o-sphere happenings.\n- Has some nice personal touches. You become a character yourself, and unlike most similar games, I felt like I really was.\n- Fosters suspence-of-disbelief very well. I'm still impressed at the glitch execution--most glitch or crash motifs are done sloppily and feel obviously fake. With few exceptions, simulated game failures felt like they were actually happening, at least before my brain caught up with what was happening. [spoiler] I'm especially sensitive to this kind of stuff--serious props for finally not making me cringe or flip my keyboard in disgust. In fact, it's what drew me in to buy the game in the first place! [/spoiler]\n- [b]Some seriously cool usages of the meta narrative.[/b] I don't want to spoil any of them because they are the highpoint of the game, and what it does best. In a sentence, the [spoiler] real [/spoiler] devs really utilize the game's setting.\n- High-quality voice acting. Seriously, a great cast who convey whatever his character's personality is. [spoiler]Hearing Dr. Venture was a little distracting, but not unwelcome. What's with James and playing megalomanial blue disembodied eyes in videogames? [/spoiler]\n- Doesn't pull punches? I'm not sure how to explain this, but for a laid-back game...I found myself listening to dialogue, thinking of something darker/angrier, and then being surprised when the characters actually said that same thing. Pleasantly surprised. Made the characters feel more like real people.\n- Nonlinear, somewhat. You choose what you do first, how you do it...a sense of choice/planning goes into what you do.\n- Kinda nihilistic without being drab or repulsive.\n- Themes about facets of gaming that too few people fully understand/sympathise with, IMO.\n\n [b]Cons:[/b]\n- Bit of an annoying opening, or--it was too predictable. It's not long though, and does serve a purpose.\n- I found the plot surprisingly confusing--I'm sure it was told to me, but a lot of required information passes by very quickly. It's all easy to tune out, even the extra audiolog-style reward snippets. Sometimes hard to tell what plot is critical, and what is comedy.\n- Depending on how you play, game can be frusturating. There is basically one sequence of abilities one must gain to progress--if the player reaches an impass too many times in a row, it can be a turnoff. Literally--I turned the game off for a week. sorry pro.\n- Speaking of breaks, don't take too many. Game is best played in as few sessions as possible, so that one doesn't forget the story/objectives[spoiler], or fail to take a hint [/spoiler]. I came back to my second session a little disoriented. This isn't exactly a 'con,' unless a player is really busy irl or frequently switches games.\n- I wasn't aware that one could summon all friendlies or the map until I was nearly at the endgame. There are randomly (?) appearing hint popups which finally led me to the right buttons. Not sure if this was me being a dumb player, or a conveyance issue.\n- While exploring, there were too many areas that felt too large given player speed, and a lot of backtracking. While the game isn't bad looking (I found the 2 contrasting styles to be nicely noncomplementary & good visual storytelling), the environments become bland quickly due to the nature of the nonlinear design. [spoiler]The 'create your own' segment kinda sank that in for me. Not that it wasn't really, really cool regardless.[/spoiler] This is especially a problem, because the player often needs to remember specific locations to progress.\n- While fun, I found that the core mechanic eroded in a similar way. Too difficult to just do the thing you want to do sometimes.\n\n\nI detailed the cons more than the pros, but overall they don't cause much grief unless a player's sensibilities are seriously sensitive to one.\n\nTL;DR, compelling game, please buy it, [spoiler] I need money, [/spoiler] you'll probably enjoy your time.

I think I counted maybe two actual puzzles in the whole game, and you as the player don't ever get directly involved in combat. So if you're looking for something with challenging or fun gameplay you might want to look elsewhere. What we're really here for is the story.\nYou play as a being who finds themselves in a world unfinished by its developers, and are tasked by a mysterious voice to essentially mess with their progress and find ways to screw up their game. Along the way you find little notes and audio logs attesting to a messy 20 year long development process with multiple complete restarts, and which serve to flesh out the world outside your small unfinished game. While the story is very short (I completed it in maybe four hours) it is well written, interestingly told, and overall I found it engaging and fun to participate in.\nThis is the kind of game for people who were fans of Home Alone.

I do not find the gameplay interesting; it's slow-paced and repetitive, and the \"puzzles\" are all so abstract that you end up with a lot of \"was i meant to do that\" scenarios. I beat the hiver queen just by getting the mindswap ability and putting it on one of my ally monsters. Maybe the game encourages freedom but that just makes everything feel unrewarding. And the last segment of the game is unrewarding too. One easy, EASY puzzle at the E4 demo, and overdramatic and kind of boring cutscene, and then a slow/repetitive \"build your own game segment\" that you have to start from the very start every time even if you screw up right near the end. \n\nThe game is also really not that visually impressive. The black and white aesthetic doesn't work and the retro style is, well, intentionally dated. Animations aren't that great and often pretty janky. The \"conductor whispers\" in the music are cute as first but get tiresome quickly. The voice acting is pretty solid though, I'll give it that, and the small snippets of story hidden away are decently rewarding to find.\n\nAlso, the game is like 3.5 or so hours long even if you're poking around a lot and $20.

I\u2019m not sure that in the world of video games, the same principle applies when you make a game about game development, because otherwise, this game would\u2019ve won.\n\nIt\u2019s a fun little romp through a satirized version of the turbulent development of a long-anticipated game and you are a beta-tester for this still fairly broken game. It makes fun of games stuck in development hell and constant course corrections over the years (Duke Nukem Forever comes to mind) as well as over-inflated game developer egos with hints towards Richard Garriott and Peter Molyneux and doesn\u2019t stop before also making fun of fanboys and their perceived entitlement of an intellectual property based on their admiration for said intellectual property. \n\nTo say more about the narrative of the game would spoil a lot of the surprises, but I found it highly entertaining. The dialogues are written with tons of levity and it\u2019s clear that it isn\u2019t meant as a scathing critique of any one thing, but more of a lighthearted satire at the expense of how seriously we sometimes take this medium. But what really brings the script together is the fantastic voice-acting from all the characters.\n\nGameplaywise it continues the theme of game development, with you traversing an unfinished world filled with hostile creatures that you yourself can\u2019t fight because the designer opted to remove the combat altogether right when you start playing. But you\u2019re given the ability to manipulate the game world itself through a very simplistic form of changing the source code. You\u2019re able to undelete things since garbage collection apparently hasn\u2019t been implemented yet and you can retool properties and variables of objects and creatures, turning enemies into allies and giving them a variety of different abilities with tons of creative potential with all the available combinations. It\u2019s not a very deep system and there isn\u2019t a ton of finesse to it, but there are a few puzzles you need to solve with this mechanic. \n\nIf there\u2019s one thing that bothered me about the game it was the final stretch where you are tasked to create a \u201clevel\u201d of this fictional game yourself. You don\u2019t really need to put any thought into it, but it\u2019s really the low-point of the game for me, since it takes just a little bit too long and the punchline to that particular part of the game isn\u2019t the funniest. The game is also fairly short. You can beat it in as little as two hours if you don\u2019t go out of your way of collecting the \u201cdeveloper\u201d commentaries and notes which only serve to provide some additional humor and I\u2019m not entirely convinced that it deserves the $20 price tag, but I still have to praise the game for being primarily focused on a narrative and theme while still managing to provide the player with interesting if not massively rewarding gameplay and not just a walking simulator, so I\u2019d definitely recommend it at a discount.", "timestamp_created": 1492456198, "timestamp_updated": 1492456304, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31192097": {"recommendationid": "31192097", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992702317", "num_games_owned": 250, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 339, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492400845}, "language": "english", "review": "Very much enjoyed the mechanics and humor in this game.

The Magic Circle might not be very long (I have about 4 hours of playtime on record to finish), or mind-blowing in any way, but it is, in fact, incredibly unique. The mechanics are interesting, the story was good, and there was even some puzzles in there that I didn't really expect.\n\nPros:\n+ The story. This is a game about game devs working on a twenty-year long video game project with an \"auteur\" who won't allow his \"vision\" to get tampered with by his former pro-gamer coworker and their spunky intern. You are a playtester who starts mucking around in the code and...\n+ The mechanics: ...bringing back formerly \"deleted\" enemies and scenery and stealing attributes like fire attacks, and adding yourself to its list of allies. I made a mushroom hop around and a key breathe fire. By the end, I had a horde of allies following me around and fighting my battles.\n+ Meta-humor. Tons of references about game development hell, with things like a DOOM-esque sci-fi area that you can explore (complete with pixely goodness) from an abandoned version of the game, game devs arguing about how the player can beat the final battle without a sword, storyboards and sketches, notes from the devs about unfinished levels, etc.\n+ Puzzles. There was definitely more of a puzzle aspect than I suspected after playing the demo! Pleasant surprise!\n+ Secrets to find. Hidden bits of story, upgrades for your minions.\n\nNeutral:\n~ There are basically two sections to the game: 1) A big open, interconnected world with lots of different areas and unlockable upgrades, story points, enemies to edit or fight. This was the main game and it was incredibly fun, but then... 2) There's a \"level designer\" bit, where you have to design a level with a good difficulty level and interest curve for another character to play through in order to finish the story. This was not quite as fun for me because it felt tedious, and a definite shift in the game's mechanics. You could still edit enemies, but there wasn't any skill to it.

unfinished game. You, the player are tasked with testing a game that has been stuck in development hell, however the game is nowhere near finished regardless of the multitude of years spent in development. Along your way you stumble across a being who has been stuck within the game since its inception, trapped and alone, the developers indifferent to his existence. You are given the power to shape and mold the creatures as you see fit, outfitting them with different features from various other entities within the game. \n\nThis game is well worth your time, with its fantastic story direction, and overall freedom to accomplish tasks as you please. If you've \"seen it all\" from the game industry, this game is for you.\n\nPros: \n\n- Freedom of progression, as well as freedom to accomplish tasks in any way you see fit.\n\n- The innate lack of a combat system for yourself, forcing you to rely upon the creatures you encounter along the way to protect you. \n\n- Mold the games creatures any way you like to accomplish any task. Take features from specific creatures, and add them to your personal collection of modifications you can apply to anything at any time. Do you want a turtle that has a teleportation pad on its back? YOU GOT IT.\n\n- Fantastic Story Direction, with a twist at the end I wasn't expecting whatsoever.\n\n- Fantastic soundtrack, which made me feel as though I was actually within the game, controlling everything myself.\n\n- Simple collectibles system.\n\n- Return to the game world after completing the game to allow for completionists to find any missed collectibles.\n\n\nCons: \n\n- Short game. For the price point of $20, the game is incredibly short, spanning about 5-7 hours, whilst they are incredibly enjoyable, it is a tad much for the game.\n\n- There is an issue of glitching through the game, as well as glitching into specific objects at certain intervals.\n\n- Clunky movement system, wherein the player hitbox seems larger than the player himself.\n\n\nOverall: I would recommend this game to anyone I know, due to its completely unconventional nature in that you are the one to shape the game world and bend it to your very will.", "timestamp_created": 1482236961, "timestamp_updated": 1482236961, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28475309": {"recommendationid": "28475309", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058575439", "num_games_owned": 542, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485996461}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Disclaimers - [/h1]\nPlayed for about 30 minutes as part of my [url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsd4qfq-hrCyqiN6rpMVLVvLQafPZqv2e] Let's Play My Steam Library[/url] playlist for my Youtube channel.

Buy on sale. \n\nThe Magic Circle is a meta-game about being some kind of ghost/beta tester in a game trapped in development hell. The story is mostly told through the clashes between a developer who is too visionary for his own good, a rabid fangirl of the sort that sends death threats over delays, and a pro gamer contract-locked into a heavily narrative game despite opposing narratives in games. The dynamic is interesting, but only a few moments of the story are ultimately memorable. \n\nGameplay consists of trapping and (visually) reprogamming enemies with traits stolen from other creatures and objects. There's no limit on how many followers you can create through this method, and the stupidity you can cause with it is absolutely the highlight of the game. Combat is mostly trivialized by your army of death, but there are a few environmental puzzles that require you to combine traits in creative ways. Unfortunately, this system disappears almost entirely in the last third. \n\nI can't get too much into why I disliked the ending moments without heavy spoilers, but suffice to say it throws out all of the good gameplay and replaces it with something that's just tedious.

Al\u00e9m deles, faz parte do time Kain Shain, respons\u00e1vel pela intelig\u00eancia artificial de Dishonored.\n\nOu seja, temos aqui caras experientes na ind\u00fastria de jogos, que resolveram abandonar o desenvolvimento de jogos AAA e buscam criar outros tipos de conte\u00fado, no cen\u00e1rio independente. E devo dizer que eles come\u00e7aram com o p\u00e9 direito.\n\nA primeira coisa que voc\u00ea faz ao entrar no jogo \u00e9 entrar no jogo. Com uma bela quebra da quarta parede logo na primeira cena, seu trabalho, como jogador, \u00e9 testar o t\u00edtulo de fantasia medieval em primeira pessoa The Magic Circle, que est\u00e1 h\u00e1 20 anos em desenvolvimento. O plano \u00e9 fechar ao menos uma demo jog\u00e1vel para o p\u00fablico, que h\u00e1 tempos clama pela nova obra de Ishamel Gilder, desenvolvedor do projeto, e que se tornou cultuado ap\u00f3s o sucesso de sua primeira cria\u00e7\u00e3o, um adventure.\n\nN\u00e3o demora para voc\u00ea perceber que falta muito para aquilo se tornar um jogo de fato. Gr\u00e1ficos inacabados, gambiarras de game design e mesmo itens ausentes, n\u00e3o programados, s\u00e3o rapidamente encontrados. Tudo isso enquanto Ish vai discutindo os pr\u00f3ximos passos do projeto com Maze Evelyn, desenvolvedora, que j\u00e1 est\u00e1 perdendo as esperan\u00e7as em tudo isso, e Coda Soliz, assistente novata, que \u00e9 fan\u00e1tica pelo trabalho de Gilder.\n\n\nPouco tempo depois, o jogo acaba. E ent\u00e3o, ele come\u00e7a de novo. Ap\u00f3s finalizar seu trabalho, uma esp\u00e9cie de intelig\u00eancia artificial faz voc\u00ea voltar para o prot\u00f3tipo. Essa entidade \u00e9 um resqu\u00edcio da primeira vers\u00e3o de The Magic Circle, que originalmente seria um FPS no espa\u00e7o. Ela clama por sua ajuda para, de dentro do pr\u00f3prio jogo, tentar termin\u00e1-lo. Ou ent\u00e3o acabar com esse sofrimento de uma vez.\n\nNessa nova empreitada, voc\u00ea ganha habilidades para hackear e \u201cquebrar\u201d o jogo, de forma a mold\u00e1-lo de uma maneira que voc\u00ea consiga resolver os puzzles e concluir sua tarefa. Uma dessas formas de manipula\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 a habilidade de editar NPCs. Voc\u00ea pode, literalmente, entrar na programa\u00e7\u00e3o de um monstro e alterar coisas como forma de movimenta\u00e7\u00e3o, habilidades especiais (resist\u00eancia ao fogo, por exemplo), definir NPCs inimigos e aliados. Criar um cogumelo voador com um lan\u00e7a-chamas como aliado \u00e9 uma das in\u00fameras possibilidades que voc\u00ea tem.\n\nDurante sua jornada, voc\u00ea ir\u00e1 se deparar com os desenvolvedores (no formato de grandes olhos). \u00c0s vezes eles se dirigem a voc\u00ea diretamente, outras, est\u00e3o falando entre si. Em ambos os casos, o jogador come\u00e7a a notar como um processo de desenvolvimento t\u00e3o ca\u00f3tico os afeta.\n\nLidar com outras pessoas, ideias diferentes e problemas pessoais \u00e9 constante no mundo de trabalho. N\u00e3o seria diferente no desenvolvimento de um jogo, algo que algumas pessoas pensam ser m\u00e1gico e maravilhoso.\n\nS\u00e3o nesses di\u00e1logos, aliados a outros arquivos de \u00e1udio e texto espalhados pelo mapa, que est\u00e1 a for\u00e7a de The Magic Circle. Com um humor muito bem constru\u00eddo, ele pode ser visto como uma cr\u00edtica \u00e0 ind\u00fastria, na sua forma de pensar e lidar com seu p\u00fablico. E mesmo na resposta do p\u00fablico, que pode ser cruel e devastadora.\n\nA hist\u00f3ria vai progredindo dessa maneira, pouco a pouco, lhe dando pe\u00e7as do que est\u00e1 acontecendo. Tudo isso culmina com um encerramento que n\u00e3o poderia ter sido executado de melhor forma. Talvez voc\u00ea s\u00f3 ache engra\u00e7ado, talvez voc\u00ea pare para pensar um pouco como enxerga videogames. Mas tenho certeza que indiferente voc\u00ea n\u00e3o vai ficar.\n\nA parte gr\u00e1fica de The Magic Circle pode soar estranha para algum desavisado. Digo isso, pois h\u00e1 uma mistura de conceitos e mesmo algumas coisas fora de lugar. Mas tudo isso \u00e9 proposital. A mistura de elementos e as mudan\u00e7as repentinas de estilo s\u00e3o executadas com esmero.\n\nA trilha sonora tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 de extrema qualidade, dando o clima perfeito para todos os momentos do jogo. A dublagem tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 destaque, e d\u00e1 vida a todos os personagens que aparecem na trama.\n\nPor fim, vale citar que \u00e9 um jogo bem curto \u2014 mesmo enrolado em algumas partes, 4 horas foram suficientes para termin\u00e1-lo. Mas isso, nem de longe \u00e9 um problema. Pelo contr\u00e1rio, ele tem a medida certa para contar o que precisa ser contado.\n\nExistem colecion\u00e1veis, que s\u00e3o os arquivos de \u00e1udio e video que mencionei anteriormente. Explorando bem, d\u00e1 para pegar a maioria, sem muitas dificuldades, j\u00e1 no primeiro playthrough.\n\nQuando peguei The Magic Circle para fazer sua an\u00e1lise, apenas havia visto um trailer e pensado comigo mesmo, \u201cdeve ser s\u00f3 mais um joguinho meio pirado com algumas piadas nonsense\u201d. Pois bem, fico feliz por ter errado, e descoberto que ele n\u00e3o \u00e9 s\u00f3 isso.\n\nThe Magic Circle \u00e9 um belo exerc\u00edcio da metalinguagem, que critica e faz piadas com a ind\u00fastria de jogos tocando em pontos importantes, \u00e0s vezes esquecidos: quem s\u00e3o as pessoas por tr\u00e1s dos t\u00edtulos que tanto amamos? Que hist\u00f3rias pessoais est\u00e3o por de tr\u00e1s da constru\u00e7\u00e3o de novos jogos? Quais direitos n\u00f3s, jogadores, temos em cima de obras de outros, se \u00e9 que temos algum?\n\nAl\u00e9m de um enredo muito interessante, o t\u00edtulo traz mec\u00e2nicas peculiares, que d\u00e3o ao jogador uma liberdade diferente do que \u00e9 comumente encontrado, abrindo possibilidades promissoras.\n\nTalvez seu \u00fanico problema seja a falta de localiza\u00e7\u00e3o para o portugu\u00eas, o que pode afastar da obra quem n\u00e3o domina a l\u00edngua inglesa \u2014 e para The Magic Circle, compreender a hist\u00f3ria \u00e9 essencial. O jogo tamb\u00e9m possui legendas em franc\u00eas, italiano, alem\u00e3o e espanhol.", "timestamp_created": 1479950474, "timestamp_updated": 1479950474, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26927250": {"recommendationid": "26927250", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041281288", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 417, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466296263}, "language": "english", "review": "What the hell who is the player and who is the author?

Instead of looking for bugs, documenting and making repeatable cases, etc. you just do whatever you want and explore an unfinished open world. You don't really look for bugs but you're often rewarded with story logs if you explore places you're not 'supposed' to get to.\n\nThe developers are basically gods that can change the game world at an instant and at their whim. And while Ish especially has many whims, there were times during game development that others (for better or worse) helped stagnate development.\n\nStory was fun, discovering what happened in the past via audio logs was nice, music was nice, visuals were (intentionally at times) mediocre. I felt most of the overworld graphics were suitable to the game; black and white made it feel like sketch work. But sometimes in other areas the graphics were intentionally so old it figuratively hurt me to play through all the jagged lines and low res graphics. But even the overworld graphics/assets, if colored and used in a proper game, would look very mediocre by today's standards.\n\nThe big draw in gameplay for me is that you get to change attributes on creatures/objects you find in the game. Each creature has its own properties (like movement: ground, attack: melee, special ability: fireproof, ally: hero, enemy: none). You can take these properties and then place it on other objects. So you can take a rock and make it mobile, your ally (so it follows you as a pet), and attack with flames.\n\nYou do so much walking in this game that it really would be nice for a run/sprint button even if momentum didn't carry over to jumps. I would have liked to move faster, jump length wasn't really a problem.\n\nOther thoughts:\n[*] Finding new ways of getting around the world is pretty important. I went from walking to [spoiler]Minecraft ender pearling[/spoiler] to [spoiler]magic carpeting[/spoiler].\n[*] It would have been nice to have separate non-subtitle and substitle language controls (as someone who likes to mix them).\n[*] I lost an ability when I met [spoiler]Cerebra. Cerebra mindswapped the corpse then the corpse mindswapped my cyber-rat with the lightning rod ability. The corpse died and I couldn't find it. And then when I went to the 'final boss' and died, the corpse with lightning rod showed up next to me when I respawned even though I never had access to editing it before. It wasn't summoned before the boss (using LMB+RMB) but just appeared afterwards.[/spoiler]\n[*] It keeps track of creatures edited, so if you want to 100% that stat you need to keep an eye out. I ignored duplicates of certain things on my run because I wasn't aware of that stat and there was no real reason to do so.\n[*] You can clip through certain things and get stuck or fall out of the world. Luckily the game allows you to teleport to certain locations on the map.\n[/list]\n\nWorth a try if you like the idea of a pseudo-programming/game dev game. I'm not aware of another game that plays this angle with this gameplay.\n\nTo be honest, I wanted more from the game. I was hoping that eventually you could edit your own properties. I only found 7 actions/attacks to choose from and 5 special properties. It's a decent amount because they're very distinct (no ice beam vs fire beam) but not quite satisfying if you want a sandbox. But even then, you don't really find a place that you need to use all of them.

You play as an intern tester inside of a game stuck in development hell. \n\n+ The gameplay is also designed around that same premise. You have the ability to hack/edit enemies, take their abilities, add them to others and turning them into your allies. Mixing and matching abilities is cool and creates a lot of different possibilities in how you approach a puzzle. \n\n+ After completing the game I saw some videos, went online and discovered multiple ways of completing the game that I had never even though of. The fact that there are multiple ways of solving puzzles in many creative ways is really cool. \n\n+ The game features a mish mash of different art styles to reflect the poor state of the game. \n\n\nThe Average:\n\nThe story/dialogue is compromised mostly of the developers arguing about what the game should be and what features should be in it. I felt the story get a bit strange given the satirical nature of the game and a lot of the humor can be hit or miss.  I wasn't too fond of the characters. \n\nSomewhat short, clocking in around 2-3 hours depending on how much you do or how fast you solve the puzzles. This can be extended by going after all the collectables. \n\nConclusion\n\nA fun game about how not to make a game. I thought a lot of the ideas were very creative and the themes presented shed some light on the current state of the video game industry while never taking itself too seriously. The concept of mixing different abilities for your allies is really neat, an idea that can easily be explored in other games. A fun if not distracting game while it lasts.  \n", "timestamp_created": 1476634736, "timestamp_updated": 1476634736, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546559", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25987696": {"recommendationid": "25987696", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031383772", "num_games_owned": 703, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476168517}, "language": "english", "review": "Very very good.

Not in a way that makes fun of how poorly games are made, but in a way that helps you see the beauty and wonder of all games. Many games have brought me to the verge of crying in sorrow, but this is the first to have me cry with joy. I'll get a bit spoilery now:\n\nTowards the end of the game, you become the game developer, and the game becomes the player. As players go, the game was sensitive, polite, and forgiving, but I still wanted to strangle it for being so inconsistent, harsh, and critical. It woke me up a little to how inconsistent, harsh, and critical I had been of the game up to that point.\n\nAdvice I want to give any players going in to that part, don't treat this as a cheap minigame. Really make the game your own, and put in the time and effort to get a high score. The highscore itself I don't think is important, but the more of your heart and soul that you put into that game, the sweeter the ending will feel.

Overall, while it was unique, simple, and rough looking, it was actually really ****in good. I had a huge problem putting it down.

First of all, it's set inside a game trapped in development hell for 20 years. It has a story centered around a few of the developers, an entity within the game known as the Old PRO, and the player. The developers are in a deadlock and can't set aside five minutes for some simple playtesting without making a major fundamental design change. The PRO is sick of it, so he makes contact with a playtester (the player), and mentors them in the art of messing with the world from the inside.\n\nIn gameplay, this boils down to two main abilities: restoring deleted/dead things, and editing alive things. You have the power to freeze creatures in place, then mess with their abilities. You can swap between a few movement types, several methods of attack, a number of passive abilities, and its AI allegiances. The last one is pretty important, since the developers (in-universe ones) cut all combat. \n\nSo for the most part, you have a mob of creatures running around with you to fight on your behalf. The actual fighting is mostly a footnote, though. The focus is on finding the right parts to outfit them so they can take on the variety of unique scenarios. Sometimes the solution is overwhelming numbers of melee attackers, but often you'll need to get creative.\n\nAs for how it holds up in practice, there's a lot of fun to be had, but there are many more solutions than there are problems. The first time through I felt pretty clever about some of the tricks I used, but afterwards I had a look at the forums and realized that every situation that had me stuck for a bit had about half a dozen other solutions that either I never considered, or involved some creature hidden in a part of the map I only discovered after it would have helped. Maybe this criticism boils down to me wanting more, but on the flip-side it never got repetitive. My first playthrough lasted around 5 hours. \n\nOn a technical level I haven't run into any notable issues. Your mileage may vary; check the demo if you're unsure. There were a few bugs that I encountered, but these were mitigated by one of two things: first, the context of a game about an unfinished game, which allows them to wave off things like jumping up to inaccessible areas or gaps in the terrain as deliberate. It sounds like cheating but they actually highlight it deliberately in a few cases, particularly the entire intro sequence, so the few issues that weren't intentional don't break immersion. Second, for anything that actually does cause problems with gameplay, the developers are extremely heavily involved on the forums. This game was released over a year ago, I posted a bug report two days ago, it got patched yesterday. You won't be left in the dark looking for support on this one.\n\nIn terms of narrative, the dialog is a bit overdramatic at times, but the characters are generally likable, if a bit eccentric. They all have their own agendas, and at times this left me wondering whose I was supposed to be following, and if I was supposed to be saving this game, burning it to the ground, or just trying to sabotage the lives of the developers for giggles. Voice acting is excellent and the writing does pretty well at setting the scene of a stressed out game studio.\n\n[b]In summary[/b], solid game, would recommend to anyone who enjoys organic puzzle games with really flexible and creative solutions, likes the idea of a drama about the worst group project they've ever had in school except twenty times worse, or is interested in game development and especially if they recognized the concept that the title of the game is a reference to.\n\nOh, full disclosure: I bought the game myself a few months back and decided I liked it then, but never got around to writing this. I replayed it recently, and as I mentioned above, I reported a bug and it got resolved very quickly. As a gesture of thanks for my detailed feedback and reproduction steps, they provided an extra copy of the game that I could share with a friend. It's worth pointing out that I wouldn't have replayed it or compiled the comprehensive bug report if I didn't already like the game, but it's still a potential incentive for bias that happened prior to writing the review, so I'm obligated to mention that detail.", "timestamp_created": 1471996631, "timestamp_updated": 1471996631, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 47, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.816313", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25100329": {"recommendationid": "25100329", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058598929", "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 215, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479069694}, "language": "english", "review": "It's like No Man's Sky, but good.", "timestamp_created": 1471988756, "timestamp_updated": 1471988756, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.327706", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25082636": {"recommendationid": "25082636", "author": {"steamid": "76561198145012922", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 472, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481788713}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is hilarious, entertaining and oddly attractive.

It's a game where you control a \"playtester\" in a highly unfinished and disfunctional game, and you can exploit the game and manipulate various creatures' parameters to achieve your goal. Then, for the second part of the game, [spoiler] you actually get to create your own levels in a rudimentary but fun editor, using a very similar interface to the one you learned in the first part, and then an automatic 'player' goes through your level, comments on it as they play, and gives specific quantitative feedback on how fun it is.

You don't have a weapon, so combat relies on editing creatures so they view you as a friend, and other creatures as an enemy.\n\nYou can also remove abilities from creatures and objects, and add them to others. This will let you change how the creatures move (walking, flying, not at all) and how they attack (melee, flamethrower, railgun, no weapon). This system lets you come up with some creative solutions to both combat, and environmental puzzles. Its the kind of game where different players will come up with different solutions to problems.\n\nFor example, one enemy, the flamer, is basically just a big round rock which breathes fire. I found an inanimate rock which was fireproof, so I removed \"fireproof\" from the rock, and added it to my weird looking dog ally, so it could kill those flamers without fear of death. Then I made the flamers my allies and resurrected them, to help me fight a boss.\n\nIn one area I needed to get across a lava stream, and I'd seen this turtle like creature nearby, which was big enough for me to stand on. I made it fireproof, and then made it think that rocks were its enemy, so it would go attack a rock on the other side of the lava, carrying me across.\n\nThe story has some fun moments, parodying game development and fan culture, ranging from subjects like players who just want to skip all the story, the rise in popularity of early access games that are missing large chunks of content, and the media driven E3 style events. The voice acting is fantastic.\n\nUnfortunately the game is really short. I finished it in exactly 3 hours (my research before I bought it suggested it would be 3 to 5 hours and usually I'm on the upper end of the scale). Its a shame, because I was just starting to really enjoy it, and then it was over. My least favourite part is the section that's set in a retro sci-fi level with ugly pixellated graphics. Again, this is a parody, but it didn't change the fact that trying to understand the level layout and identify enemies literally hurt my eyes (it looks worse than 1993 Doom).\n\nThe Magic Circle is a fun little game that has some really good ideas, but due to its length I would say buy it on a deep discount sale.

That won't make much sense until you've played it, but if you ever got kicks out of using no-clip in a game and exploring all the places you weren't supposed to see then this is right up your alley.\n\nThe plot exists on many levels, from a basic look a dev' team stuck in development hell, to an instrospective and existential view of all gamers and why we play the games we do. All this, complete with easily the best voice acting I've heard in a game of this size. \n\nI was able to beat the game with 95% of the collectibles in about 5 hours, which I think was the perfect length.

The world is quite small but as open as it gets. There are several puzzles to solve and all you have for doing so is a bunch of creatures - and their abilities. You can swap around these abilities and combine them to build the \"perfect\" creature for solving any special puzzle. \nAnd all this is packed in a nice story about the development cycle of said unfinished game.\n\nIt IS a [i]really[/i] nice game. A bit short, though. As you can see I've about 10 hours on record and that was sufficient to beat the game twice (without skipping any cut scenes or dialogues) and get all achievements (including the notorious \"collect all and everything\" achievement).

As one of those artsy meta-games, in the game it is a \u201cgame within a game\u201d, wherein you are a playtester for a gaming company whose game, the Magic Circle, has been in development hell for the last 20 years. You are quickly introduced to the four main characters. Ish, the pretentious game developer who seems to be riffing on a number of haughty, pretentious game designers. Coda, a fangirl new to the company who has joined the team and is responsible for creating a demo but who is deeply angry about Ish\u2019s failure to deliver a game for so long, and extremely possessive of the game world. Haze, a pro gamer who joined the team ten years ago to try and help Ish understand gamers. And Pro, an AI trapped inside the world, the PC of the previous version of the game which was trashed ten years ago when they started over from scratch.\n\nThis game is really driven by story, but it suffers from the flaw of everyone being kind of a jerk. The \u201cgood guys\u201d are Pro and Haze, and they\u2019re trying to destroy the company around them. It just goes downhill from there. This makes it hard to really like any of them; they\u2019re kind of fun to watch for a bit, but after a while, it just becomes horror heaped upon horror. Moreover, the actual character arcs are fairly limited, and unfortunately, it felt a bit inconsistent at times.\n\nThe actual gameplay isn\u2019t very good either; in fact, I\u2019d classify it as outright bad. While some of this is intentional meta-badness, it is genuinely not a fun game to play. The gameplay consists of pretty obvious, basic actions. It is definitely not a twitch-based game, and is really centered around solving puzzles with the tools you have.\n\nThe core of the gameplay \u2013 in fact, the ONLY gameplay in the game \u2013 is shooting a little magic circle under an enemy. You have tons of time to do this, so this isn\u2019t really hard. Once they\u2019re trapped in your circle, you can strip off all the abilities from the enemy or even make it into your friend so it will attack other enemies for you.\n\nThis sounds neat, but it is literally the only gameplay mechanic there is. There are a few enemies later on in the game which your dudes cannot attack easily, and which require you to kill them by getting a tractor beam ability to pull them down to be attacked, or to get the railgun ability to shoot them from range. Then, you just do the same thing.\n\nThese three things \u2013 plus the ability to ride around on the back of a fireproof turtle \u2013 solve every puzzle in the game.\n\t\nThe result, then, is that the gameplay mostly consists of wandering around the game world searching for collectables; you can complete the entire game in under two hours if you\u2019re just trying to beat it, and frankly, the collectibles don\u2019t really add all that much.

I dunno. This is one of those games I can't go into a lot of detail about because, I think, a lot of it is more of how you see, interpret, and pursue things.

I feel like it was maybe supposed to be a bit more \"Ah!\" for me, but again - I think this may just not be quite the game that really tickles the deeper fancies of someone who doesn't find the nuances of designing levels and such to be especially compelling, or perhaps someone who doesn't have direct experience with dealing with \"fans\" in a situation like that.\n\nI'm really not sure.. but ultimately, I can't say that I'd strongly recommend this to everyone and anyone, it definitely is more of a niche title, but that isn't a bad thing.", "timestamp_created": 1460439865, "timestamp_updated": 1460439865, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.462998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22368388": {"recommendationid": "22368388", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088692626", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 433, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490229401}, "language": "english", "review": "Let me just start off by saying\nHOLY HELL THIS GAME\n\nSo, now that's outta the way, let me be more specific.\nThis game is fucking insane. It lets you build your own little army of Frankenstein-esque monsters that only gets cooler the longer you play. \nThe gameplay is highly interesting - I found myself going out of the way to find as much stuff as I could in order to build a stronger batch of minions. The graphics serve the game's purpose extremely well, and the color effect that surrounds actual objects is an excellent way to break the monotony. The music, in a similar fashion, follows the game's need very well. Occasionally, you'll hear someone's voice (possibly Ish, or maybe a musical director, idk) commenting on how the music sounds to him, as though they were merely toying with possible tracks in the early stages of the game. It all looks very finished in a way that is intentionally unfinished, if that makes sense (prolly not, but oh well, take it for what you will XD)\nHonestly, you could just spend a good five hours exploring the overworld, mashing together your army of abominations (looking at you, Sentinal). The process is so engaging, and it just feels nice to have a loyal group of monster friends. \nAnd, for a game that does a good job preaching against story-heavy games, this game has an excellent story. It does what a game's story should do - supports the gameplay without hindering the player. Plus, it's just friggin' good. I'm horrible at explaining without spoiling, so just trust me when I say it is amazing. (Or don't, your call XD)\n\nIt's just so well made.

And right of the bat its clear this game wont ever be done the way this team works.\nSo natrually you meet a mysterious figure which just happens to give you the power to steal and edit powers from any creature in the game.\n\nBut what to you actually do?\nThe editing part ist not very exicting, its not a minigame or a puzzle, and no its not programming. Its a easy to understand list of base values for the creature, that you can alter. The principle is simple: Trap with a one mouse button, go near it, press E. Strip the thing naked of all is features, or simply set it to friendly and name it Carl.\nTry giving a rock some personality with ground movement and melee attack, call him Chutuly, or Jimmy, let him fly.... You know just do stuff and play around.\nThe good thing about this game is that it doesnt hold your hand to much. Instead it releases you into the wild after an half hour and goes \"do whatever, here is your main goal, go find a way to do it\". But during this I never felt lost. The map has a reasonable size, and contains a few \"puzzles\" you have to solve, to get to certain powers. \nBecause you need to get the \"Flying\" perk once to use it on another creature.\n\nNow of course the game isnt perfect. Once u edited a lot along the way there comes the fact that the map is confusing (every ever edited enemy is shown there, and if its to many at one place they just flood into other parts of the map (visually) ). I personally found every single character over the top, but that was ok, you kinda get that vibe from the beginning. And finally: I found the variety of objects to edit a bit lacking. Just having a few things more would have been nice, the current pool of objects is explored rather fast.\n\nSo how is the game in total?\nIts great. The idea has been translated well and makes for a nice exploration game with some puzzle solving and a lot of foolery to play around with. By providing different areas that are easy to tell apart and a constant narration to most things you do, the game doesnt get boring before it ends.\nI like it, buy it if you are into sandboxy stuff or unconventional games like the Stanley Parable that try something new. Heck, you probably still have fun as a Point&Click nerd because this game is essentially that, walk, click, do stuff, see how the world responds.\nRecommended.\n", "timestamp_created": 1459927747, "timestamp_updated": 1459927747, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22265027": {"recommendationid": "22265027", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995430562", "num_games_owned": 842, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 216, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459667092}, "language": "english", "review": "It's not often that I find a game that I really want to share (and thus review) as much as The Magic Circle, what the developer has accomplished here is truly something special.\n\nTL;DR: [spoiler]This game pretty much gives you a behind the scenes look at what a game in what the game community calls \"development hell\" and then hands you the freedom to try and fix the world or break it in bizarre ways.[/spoiler] Really needs to be played to be understood\n\nI ended up getting this game through the Humble Monthly program, and I was just going through each of my 6 new games and just 'kicking the tires' so to speak and then about halfway through I started up this game...

Starting out, you'll think that all the game is doing is just satire of incompetent game developers and games stuck in development hell, but it turns out there is much more to it. The game has excellent gameplay and voice acting. The gameplay mainly involves editing enemies that approach while discovering hidden parts to the game. The editing gameplay mechanic can lead to whacky things at times like having a rock for an ally that moves and shoots out fire. The voice acting within the game really makes the story shine.

It\u2019s not Portal, though. It\u2019s kind of an RPG in the same way that Portal is a First Person Shooter. The trappings of its mechanics are within the recognised mechanics from a million first-person RPG games, but that\u2019s wrapped inside a well-devised universe with well-written characters, and the actual gameplay is spun out at 90 degrees from that. If I had to add another game\u2019s influence to cite, The Stanley Parable is where I\u2019d go next.\n\nAnd I can\u2019t say a lot more than that about it. The game is a metafiction, as you can see from the mostly-in-universe website. In-universe, The Magic Circle is the long awaited, long delayed sequel to a massively beloved twenty-year-old text-based adventure game (Real-world touchstones: Ultima, Bards Quest, Fool\u2019s Errand). The author of that game is a classic games-autor white-bearded-male, who has taken on the avatar of the great God within the game \u2013 the Skyfather \u2013 but whose twenty-year promises of future games are starting to ring hollow. Veteran gamers will instantly recognise the heavy flavours of Richard Garriott in the character\u2019s history, along with strong notes of Peter Molyneux and even to people like Cliff Johnson, and here you start, as a player given early access to this massively long awaited sequel to a hugely popular game. Except there are some assets which look\u2026 strange in context. Something isn\u2019t quite right. The trailer hints at this fairly well.\n\n\n\nThe game plays a lot with concepts of game space, of being inside which game. It has a lot to say about narrative vs mechanics (coming from former Bioshock developers, there\u2019s an air of critical catharsis which I would suspect more of being dirty laundry if they hadn\u2019t got Ken Levine to voice a character), game development, fandom, actually getting things done and the sorrow of half finished universes.\n\nIt took me about 6 hours of playtime to get through it, and while that\u2019s quite short, it\u2019s fully formed and\u2026 complete, really. There\u2019s a lot there, and a late twist that spins a lot of the game on its head.\n\nIt\u2019s in early access at the moment, but as I say the game is complete. Early Access is an early release before they\u2019ve got the translations down, which will take a while to finish and collate \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of there there \u2013 and as far as I could tell all the glitches were intentional (it is, in part, a game about inserting your gameplay crowbar into the cracks of the world).\n\nYou should play this game. I hope they release a demo too, but don\u2019t watch Lets Plays, don\u2019t watch it streaming.\n\n\u2026 And that\u2019s it, really. There\u2019s some deeper stuff about the mechanics, about juxtapositioning, about commentary that I\u2019ll get into eventually, but so much of what\u2019s cool is tied heavily narrative-based modification of the mechanics, and I like the story too much to spoil it for you without giving people a chance to buy it first.", "timestamp_created": 1456173332, "timestamp_updated": 1456173332, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568888", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21368327": {"recommendationid": "21368327", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992115346", "num_games_owned": 228, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 269, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456073598}, "language": "english", "review": "8/10 ship it.", "timestamp_created": 1456073726, "timestamp_updated": 1456073726, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501725", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21356187": {"recommendationid": "21356187", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013189743", "num_games_owned": 245, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 382, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456030429}, "language": "english", "review": "An intriguing and thoughtful game.

Really really short. I beat it in < 2 hours.\n-The level design is atrocious. Seriously. It's worse than some early 90s FPSes. A significant amount of my playtime was spent being lost.\n-It thinks it's smarter than it is. The conceit of the game (you're trapped inside a game that has been dragging on in development for 10 years) is interesting but the main characters are insufferable and a lot of the writing is overwrought.\n-It is absolutely and completely without challenge. You could watch a Let's Play of the game and have nearly the same experience as playing it, albeit without the whole \"getting lost\" part.\n-I really cannot overstate how bad the level design is.\n\nOverall if you can buy the game for <$5 it's probably worth it.

This is also one of that character.\n\nThe Magic Circle contends with itself as a game in the making, displaying all the petty gluttony of a developing studio for the attention they want, the accolades they think they deserve, and all the bloody underthings of the human nature of creation.

Gameplay, while not being bad, is obviously a mere tool to the narrative. In that regard it is akin to the \"The Beginner's Guide\" or \"The Stanley Parable\", though gameplay is a little bit more complicated in this one. It is relatively unique, basically putting a limited developer editing tools at your disposal in order to \"bend\" the otherwise unwinnable game to your benefit. At the same time, the game itself is relatively short (as it is evident from my time played) and doesn't expand on the idea a whole lot. Aside from collectibles and some mutually exclusive achievements, there is little replayability of note in this case.\n\nMy verdict is - buy it if you're interested in a short story-driven experience. I feel it does deserve the money. Do take into account the shortness and lack of proper replayability. Maybe you'll want to wait for the sale offer, as much as my heart bleeds saying that.

But the fun doesn't have to end there, thanks to The Magic Circle. In The Magic Circle, you play a buggy, half-finished RPG, fixing it and altering it as you go, providing an adequate emulation of playing one of Bethesda's titles. \n\nAll jokes aside, this game is really fun. It's really more of a puzzle game than an actual RPG, but it handles the puzzles in a pretty unique way. The monsters in the game can be trapped and edited to have new abilities that you take from other monsters, giving them various purposes that can be used both for combat or solving puzzles. At one point in the game I accidentally broke the \"planned\" solution for crossing a river of fire, but I was able to solve the puzzle my own way by adding some Teleport abilities I had taken from another area, putting one on my fire-breathing mushroom and tossing him across the gap, and then putting another teleport on my pet rock and standing on him to teleport across the gap.

Moreover, the story is excellently done. The characters are well developed, believable and thoroughly entertaining to listen to, with top-notch voice acting that makes the dialog thoroughly hilarious to listen to.\nUnfortunately, when it comes to the gameplay aspects, a dozen little annoyances come up and begin pestering you like dogs nipping at your heels. \n\nThe biggest, in my opinion, being a lack of a decent way to organize your minions. By the time you reach the mid-game, you will have recruited a small army of mobs and only be able to scroll through them one at a time or by searching through whatever in your immediant field of view, which bogs the pacing down tremendously.\nThe second being that in the in-game hacking minigame it can be difficult to tell whether the option you are hovering over is the one you are attempting to select or the one right below it, and can easily accidently select the wrong button and have to retry the entire section. An indicator to show whatever you are currently posed over would make a world of difference.\n\nThirdly is that some of the puzzles can be quite unintuitive, especially if you are going for 100% completion and are attempting to micromanage an army at the same time, related to point 1, above.\nNone of these points are dealbreakers, but they what could have been an amazing game merely good, and it also is worth bearing in mind that at 20$ for an experience that lasts four hours, fans who are hoping for a longer experience are going to likely wind up disappointed.\n\nOne final note is that it takes a minimum of two full playthroughs to gain all the acheviements, which I feel is an unfortunate design choice for a humor-focused title such as this. The old adage about a joke never being as funny the second time you hear it rings true in this situation, especially since if someone has already found all of the hidden extras, they are unlikely to want to replay the story again just for completion sake.\n\nThat being said, I did enjoy my time playing the magic circle, most especially due to the stellar voice acting the cast put on. The story is definitely the highlight here, and I would recommend it to those who enjoy meta-commentary based games such as The Stanley Parable.\n\n8/10.

This is a game with a purpose.  And it's damn fun to boot.\n\nThe basic concept is that you're a beta tester for a hilariously and tragically unfinished game trapped in development hell by its creators, who are all various shades of borderline-insane.  Then, a being calling himself \"The Pro\" (voiced by Stephen Russell, the guy who played the hero in the original Thief Games) contacts you and tells you he wants you to fix this mess and get the game SHIPPED.\n\nHow do you fix it?  By literally stealing \"Life\" from the nooks and crannies of the world, then using it to essentially hack into enemies to make them do what you need them to do.  It's basically a big open-ended sandbox puzzle game.  One filled with secrets, hidden abilities, and tons upon tons of audio logs detailing the game's spiral into madness.\n\nEvery time I thought I had the game figured out, it threw me another curveball, forcing me to rethink everything about it.\n\nIf you can think of a way to solve a problem, it's legit.  And BOY are there a lot of possibilities.  Army of fanged mushrooms?  Easy.  Demon-monkey-dogs you lob as if they were GRENADES?  Knock yourself out.  And that's just the simple stuff you can do.  The vast amout of surprises and twists the game throws at you is sheer madness, and I love it.  And that finale...I will not be forgetting that amazing conclusion any time soon.\n\nAs someone who is studying to hopefully develop games in the future, this game hit home in so many amazing ways, and I had an absolute BLAST with it.  Don't look up anything more about the game.  You'll just spoil yourself.  This is a game that thrives on discovery and surprise.  Anything you look up can ruin things for you.\n\nSo, if you're curious about game development, or you want to see crazy new story angles, are a fan of emergent gameplay, or just want a snarky and clever open-world puzzle game, you NEED this game in your life.

For example: at one point there are enemies that shoot flames at you if you get to close, so all you need to find is a rock and take its 'fireproof' ability so your minions are unharmed.

The world is expertly crafted to resemble a pre-alpha game that\u2019s a mash of too many ideas, all coexisting in the same code base which end up mashing together in unintended ways. This is reflected in the game play which is based around messing with things and changing up behaviours so you can access things you otherwise wouldn\u2019t be able to. The story is one that definitely has a specific target audience in mind and, whilst it might not be for everyone, definitely plays to its strengths as a piece of commentary on the industry.

It's not particularly difficult, or long, but it backs up its sometimes-subtle, sometimes-blunt statements about what motivates players by living by them.

The premise is that you are in an unfinished game and have limited abilities to edit the game as you travel through it.  The integration between the game mechanics and the story make this exceptionally engaging.  There are a bunch of fourth wall jokes and gameplay is fairly non-linear/open-world.  You can reach the end of the game fairly quickly (about 5 hours) but there are many side/easter egg things that encourage you to go back and discover afterwards (or before).  I highly recommend this to people who enjoyed Portal 2 (not that it's SUPER similar, but the blend of puzzle and comedy is somewhat reminicent).\nYour progress in the demo will carry over into the full game.  I've done an LP here but encourage you to play the game yourself before watching the end. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLL5JEFvVpx9rBFMQ-7YygNarrBXUBwY1A", "timestamp_created": 1442436519, "timestamp_updated": 1442436519, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.755538", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18001194": {"recommendationid": "18001194", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112206804", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 441, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1438281024}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is great!

You asume the role of a Beta tester who is contacted by the protagonist of the original version of the game. Whose goal is to ruin the game in any way possible. The story takes a few different twists and turn having you venture to E4 and into 8-bit sci-fi settings. Aswell you can discover other elements of the story scattered in glitchy objects and audio logs. Overall the story is phenomenal and I loved it. 9/10\n\nVisuals: They are amazing! Having all the textures be unfinished sketches but with colored versions appearing around you and your allies was a great Idea. 9/10\n\nGameplay: It's good and interesting but slowly gets a boring after awhile with little to no chages to the formula. The way it works is you can take attributes form some enemies and stitch them onto other creatures to create new allies. However there is only so many time is it's fun to have a howler fly around and breath fire on a guy with 4 heads. The game also has great emphasis on exploration with stuff such as in game dev logs and Life upgrades. 8/10\n\nFinal thoughts: The magic circle is great but is a little too short for the price paid and the gameplay can become a little stale. But I must stress this game is still wort you time and if you can find it on sale it is a game worth owning.\n\n8.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1440795578, "timestamp_updated": 1440795578, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17730135": {"recommendationid": "17730135", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996674335", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 483, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1440620383}, "language": "english", "review": "The Magic Circle is more of an exploration game than a puzzle game.

There are so many things that need to be considered from cost of development to marketing. Throw in some ego and human error and things can get really messy. So messy in fact that in The Magic Circle, the game decides to turn against its creators, with your help of course. With the ability to hack into the games code and other useful tools given to you from an old pro, you will start a twisted journey to take the power from the powers that be. Perhaps more importantly find out who they are. The Magic Circle is a somewhat of a linear story, it isn't super difficult and the puzzles are rather light. What the game does boast is quite the atmosphere, everything can change in the blink of an eye and usually does. The entire game is also somewhat satirical and humorous, poking fun at game design and developers. Hacking into objects and bending the rules is entertaining but nothing that is seriously complicated or strategic. It's just fun. I would've loved to see this expanded on more but the story is front and center here. I would say that The Magic Circle falls under the walking simulator genre, not that I feel that is a bad thing and mean this in no harmful or derisive way. The voice work is amazing and visuals match. You will sometimes hear the composer deciding what music is appropriate for the scene and this made me chuckle.

The game took maybe five hours to beat, half of which was not what I would call gaming.  The first time I actually thought \"I'm having the slightest bit of fun\" was for about half an hour at the end [spoiler]when you design the levels[/spoiler].\n\n2)  [b]It felt like someone wanted to tell a story and chose the wrong medium[/b]  Instead of writing a book, they created an interactive video and called it a game.  I don't have too much of a problem with that genre, but it should be made known (and I should have researched this game more beforehand).\n\n3)  [b]The story was as lame as the game-play[/b].  I didn't care for any of the characters, and I wish they would have just gone away and let me play in my world.  Also, the game play is almost entirely basic.  You hack a creature and modify its abilities...but there are so few options that it is basically always the same.  And since you can have all of them follow you, the abilities are never strategically limited.  You never have to decide between abilities when you have them all.  Not to mention, upgrading the monsters is unnecessary, so that's a waste of a feature.  Take strategy out of the tags for this game.\n\n4)  [b]They could have done a lot more with the game.[/b]  I feel like it is missing something, and that they could have flushed it out to make it worth the $20 price tag.\n\n[b]Are there any Pros?[/b]\n\n1)  I liked the art style, environment, and atmosphere, though I wish you could have brought more of the dull landscape to life/color (like you do to some objects / creatures.\n\n2)  The game played smoothly and was intuitive.\n\n3)  While I didn't love the story, but I have to give them credit for originality.  It was a cool enough concept to hook me into buying the game.\n\n\n[b]So why wouldn't I recommend this?[/b]  I didn't have fun, plain and simple.  Mostly because it's not much of a game for the price.  Was it the worst game I've played?  Definitely not.

Even so, I had a blast.\n\nLong version:\nSo, the idea is that this is supposedly an eagerly anticipated sequel that's been in development hell for something like 20 years and is still a long way from finished. There's cut content that you can restore, mechanics that were planned but never implemented (or axed right in front of you), change logs scattered throughout, the developers drop in and have conversations with each other and with you (assuming you're a tester), etc. It's a great idea and unfortunately, The Magic Circle just doesn't quite manage to sell it. It's not large enough or layered enough with older versions (and logs, etc) to genuinely feel like a project that longrunning and embattled. It's more of a broad overview of what something like that might look like, on a macro scale. It's probably fine in the long run - this is an indie game made by a small team on a small budget, and it's not really fair to expect anything quite as elaborate as the premise suggests. But it does undercut the illusion a bit.\n\nSimilarly, the writing definitely gives a broad, parodic sense of the sort of personalities and conflicts that might go into a debacle of that sort and the clashing priorities at work, but because they're so broad, they never quite feel like real people and the commentary on gaming culture and development is pretty surface level. But hey, it's funny and it works well enough in context, just don't expect deep insider insights.\n\nThose are really my main complaints, though. The game itself is brilliant, with a core mechanic in the main section that lends itself to a huge range of solutions to problems and a sort of anarchic tinkering with the game structure that is really enjoyable and beautifully realized, right down to visual representation on literally every editable object of all the different traits they can be assigned. And while the game isn't particularly large, that overworld has plenty of nooks and crannies to hide logs and other collectibles and special creatures and such. Heck, I'm still missing a couple and I could swear I've scoured everywhere. And while the scope undercuts the simulation a bit, there's some neat tricks with desktop simulation and such that help sell it. There are also a couple of later segments that are fun (if a little didactic) in other ways and while they're not as original or massively appealing as the core conceit, they're still well done with a bunch of scope for doing your own thing.

The game will tell you what you can't do before forcing you to figure out that you can. It doesn't hold your hand or force you into a decision. And then it does, in occasional moments of brutally self-aware beauty.\n\nExploration, exploitation and some seriously out-of-the-box thinking are punctuated by fragments of an overrarching narrative. Most of which is hiding around dark corners or on thin ledges, but all relating a story devoid of violence, romance, magic or politics. For most of the game the player doesn't even seem to have much role or influence in the story.

The project director seems out of touch with the people he works with, as their conversations break down into drama and backstabbing, with no consensus on what the game should be. The project has become the most important thing in his life, but he can\u2019t decide on what it\u2019s supposed to be. Over the long development a part of the game seems to have gained sentience, and wants you the player to take over and finish the game yourself.\n\nYou explore an unfinished world, full of half done or abandoned designs, reaching back to the early 90s. The older designs look like System Shock 1, while the new one is a fantasy adventure. You solve puzzles by capturing creatures and objects, and modifying their properties. Even though the game is broken, your method of interacting with it is quite nice! This game was made by Jordan Thomas, best known for making The Cradle in Thief 3, Fort Frolic in Bioshock, and then as Creative Designer on Bioshock 2. By now he knows how to make a game, and The Magic Circle feels like a game made by an expert. There\u2019s no newbie design mistakes, and the game does all it can to make the experience as smooth as possible, without sacrificing complexity. There\u2019s often several solutions to puzzles, so you\u2019re unlikely to get stuck anywhere.\n\nTo make a game as meta as this requires the developers be smarty pants. And so they were, invoking authenticity in all the dialog and notes you come across. The references in the game clearly come from Looking Glass, Irrational Games, Ion Storm, and Origin. The closest comparison to this would be The Stanley Parable and Portal 2, but it\u2019s more ambitious than either of them.

Stephen Russel, especially, is a joy to listen to (which is great as you'll hear plenty of him), bringin his near-trademark \"no-nonsense down-to-earth\" style to his role. Regardless,\n\nThe writing, too, is great, with each character's dialogue showing enough content to give me a sense of their basic motivations (creator wants to make the game perfect, lead actress wants the thing to be over with and move on, etc), but as you play, you find enough information to elivate them from *just* characitures and sterotypes into actual people. In the end, I found myself fealing sorry for the villian of the piece despite him having brought it on himself.\n\nSecond, the gameplay: It's a nice twist on puzzle gaming (for the most part) where you're going around rewriting and editing the world around you - in a very literal fashion - to suit your wims. This gives all the puzzles a very non-linear feal, giving me the real sense that I could find new answers to every puzzle I faced.\n\nNot that these are \"puzzles\" in the traditional sense, no no no - no Hanoi Towers here. Similar to the likes of Myst, this game uses the world itself as your obstacle, with your motivation being exploration and self-challenge. All too often, I would just sit there, wracking my brain over how to use what I'd collected so far to get across some barrier to the goodie that awaited me.\n\nThird, the gmae's style: even though the point is that the game is very \"unfinished\", I actually do like the black-and-white overall theme of everything. It makes the use of what sparse color there is in the game VERY striking, even jarring, which is exactly what the creative team probably wanted.\n\nOf course, the style of \"unfinished\" extends everywhere, from the creatures you meet all the way to the music itself, which somehow manages to sound great despite the composer/sound designers intentionally flubbing their parts to make it sound very rough draft.\n\nThe humor's good, too. I found myself laughing at several moments in the game, when I wasn't kackling with glee, at any rate. And the subtlties of this game's story are near critical mass. I won't spoil them for you save to say this: collect everything you can. Leave no stone untunred, mess with everything you get access to, and explore all those hard-to-reach and out-of-the-way places. You will find the effort well worth it.\n\nThis game does have some flaws. The end game puzzle, while EXTREMELY satisfying, felt a bit buggy - and funnily enough, that's not intentional here. Too often, I'd be unable to take some actions because the game wouldn't let me despite my having what I needed to do so. If it's not a bug, then I would recommend some better indication of what it takes to use things properly here, to avoid needless confusion.\n\nIs the game short? Sure, I beat it in 7 hours without 100%ing it, and I imagine it would take about 10 for me to get what I missed. But that's not a bad thing here, as it's not about qunatity, but quality. This game is as long as it needs to be. No more, no less, and for that, it's extremely satisfying without being daunting.\n\nI recommend this to anyone who's interested in the game industry in any capacity besides just \"but game, play game, trade it back in\", especially to those who are looking for some snark and fun gameplay to go with thei commentary.\n\nAnd to answer the creators' urging at the end of this game: yes, I'm interested in making something of my own now.

It\u2019s a game that innovates with both its mechanics and storytelling, bringing the players in and having a nasty conversation with them. It\u2019s a game about the people who play games and the people who design them, which understandably isn\u2019t everyone\u2019s cup of tea.

It's clear the developers are trying to say something with it, but I'm not sure they themselves know what it's supposed to be saying.\n\nI'm quite sure I was supposed to have some revelation about video games like Spec Ops or The Stanley Parable. But while those games played all up and down the scales of meta, questioning and prodding the relationship between the player and the game, as soon as The Magic Circle grasped onto a point about anything, it slipped and fell off, eventually ending so far down the \"CAN YOU TELL THIS IS SATIRE YET?\" hole: in the second half of the game, you are required sabotage an entirely faked demo for \"E4\", the massive gaming convention (yes). It feels less like a story about video game development and more like pent-up retribution the team was directing at their former employers. It struck me as immature.\n\nThe characters are all just awful people. Its few attempts at trying to cause sympathy are, well, I'm just going to say it, creepy. One of the characters announces that they're sterile. There's mentions of orgies in the woods at sex castle dungeons. It is extremely creepy and forced and trying way too hard for the Video Games Are Art award. Everybody is bitter and angry and hostile and sarcastic. There was no part where anybody smiled, or laughed, or seemed in any way pleased about anything.\n\nBut I'm giving the game a thumbs up. Why? The parts and the narrative about the struggles about video game development rung true. The mechanics of undeleting and editing characters, to having lordes of pets, to the puzzle solving, were ultimately fun. Climbing to places I'm not \"supposed\" to go to find easter eggs feels rewarding. The game developers know that I'm going to explore every nook and cranny, and they make it worthwhile. There are stories and lore littered around which perhaps give a glimmer of insight, however surface, into the choices and problems that face video games.\n\nThe game was at its best when it showed people genuinely trying to make a *good* video game, rather than simply get paid, or get out of a wretched contract, or get revenge on the designer (which, spoilers, are the three goals of the main characters at the end).\n\nThe developers also knew that making a game about an unfinished prototype is a slippery slope -- it requires a certain kind of \"not polish\" that needs to seem intentional, rather than lazy. They pulled this off super well. The art style is \"placeholder textures\", but when you get near objects, they spring into color and life, showing that yes, they can draw things for real. Some feel like they're out of a freeware game -- unaligned pieces of Arial text and boring controls, but when you go \"behind the scenes\" and rewrite the game's mechanics, it feels like a really well-done hacker movie, with snippets of code zooming past you. This is a trick that's hard to pull off, and these guys did it.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that although first-person, you never hold any gun. It's about puzzles, interaction, and exploration, which is always refreshing to see.\n\nSo yes, is it a good game? No. Not by a long-shot. Is it worth your time, and do I recommend you play it? Yes.

I was never really sure.  The majority of the game you\u2019ll spend your time listening to the wonderfully written and acted dialogue which had me hunting for another audio clip as soon as one was over.  The actual gameplay comes in the form of editing and stealing your defeated enemies attributes in order to solve puzzles.\n\nYou\u2019ll be taking most of your cues from Olmec from the Legends of the Hidden Temple who quickly hangs a lantern on the fact that he sounds like he's plotting to betray you.  I couldn\u2019t help but immediately question the protagonist's sanity as I stared into the multicolored eyes of the virtual rock that I was taking orders from while he recited his Mein Kampf.  Thankfully the rest of the cast is far more humorous and relatable even while they are being little eccentric.  You\u2019ll see these characters as giant floating eyeballs delivering the game\u2019s backstory and plot as you leisurely walk around.   \n\nWhen you run into an enemy you have to trap it with a multicolored circle that allows you to walk up and edit the creature\u2019s attributes.  This lets you give it new abilities and make it fight for you, or accidently give it firebreath and then set yourself as it\u2019s enemy as I did more times than i\u2019m proud to admit.  These abilities can be swapped amongst the creatures to create floating fireproof abominations that look like they\u2019re from the Island of Misfit Toys, which might sound disappointing but ends up going very well with the tone of the game.\n\nVery early into playing I began searching my keyboard for a sprint key that I was sure must be there somewhere\u2014It wasn\u2019t.  The game does allow you to teleport to various locations on the rather small map and summon the editable carcasses of your slain foes to you.  I still constantly found myself shaking my head at the pace of my character and wondering why I was given the useless zoom function instead of a sprint.  I suspect given the size of the game and the fact that you spend the majority of the time listening to audio diaries a sprint feature would end up feeling silly.\n\nVisually the game looks like a schizophrenic watched Casablanca while playing Skyrim which provided a good chuckle.  The game very adeptly attempts to appear like an unfinished game, which results in the problem that it looks like an unfinished game.  Thankfully the game doesn\u2019t last long enough for you to grow to hate the art direction, and I found myself torn between being annoyed by it and loving it.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a serious game stay far away, this game is not difficult or long, but that\u2019s ok because it\u2019s not trying to be!  I am almost tempted to file this game under interactive short story as it would feel far more at home there than listed as a \u201cgame\u201d proper.

I played it to what I guess you'd consider 100% completion in a few afternoons over a long weekend, and said to myself, \"this eliminates all doubt, new genres of game still exist to be uncovered if developers bother to look.\"\n\nThe better part of a year later, a game called The Stanley Parable came out. I had very much the same thoughts about it.\n\nSomewhere in there, The Swapper released.\n\nThe pattern here, I guess, if there is one, is that the most imaginitive stuff coming out lately seems to have been on the puzzle game front. I tend to think of those three titles as such - Antichamber is built around its own weird school of bizarro-logic, and The Stanley Parable contained enough endings and possibilities that I found myself drawing a flowchart. That's puzzle enough for me. The Swapper, possibly the most traditional puzzle game among the three, was still freaking weird, still engaged on some sort of intellectual level, and still was a great deal more captivating than most titles I played its year of release.\n\nWhy would I bother to preface this review with a comparison to those three games? Well, I tend to think that The Magic Circle can happily co-exist alongside them. While a bit rougher around the edges than those titles, it shares the same ridiculous sense that it's out to tread a sort of new ground, and doesn't really care if the player wants to go along with it. People expecting a core puzzle game aren't likely to exactly get their fix here. This is a confident game, very much its own beast.\n\nThat's okay by me. The Magic Circle isn't a terribly challenging puzzle game, but it's built around a rather novel idea - you're here, essentially, to further break an already-broken piece of software. Certain items in the world are entirely rewritable, their behaviors yours to define. This is the means by which you progress in the small-but-concise game world.\n\nThe programmer in me is hooked on the concept from square one. Visual touches like bits of code flying around the screen as you interact with the game's editable objects (I confess getting a weird satisfaction from reading them and trying to suss out where they'd go in the game's engine), placeholder textures, and so on help to ground the idea that while the world around you essentially functions, you're effectively playing as code in a hapless machine.\n\nThe world is packed with nooks and crannies where the in-game game's \"developers\" (read: antagonists) have left change logs, notes to each other, and audio recordings. For the most part, it's reasonably well-written, even. I didn't outright laugh at anything to be found here, but I smirked. And that's really the game's intended effect, I think. If you've followed any vaporware story, any failed Kickstarter project, in the past few years, The Magic Circle has a few choice words of cynical sympathy for you.\n\nSadly, a couple of awkward dialogue choices, particularly in the early game, stand out for that reason. I cringed at a handful of one character's monologues. I appreciate that the game is trying to make a particular character come off as downright weird and unlikeable, but it doesn't change the effect - there were scenes of melodrama I had to force myself not to skip from sheer embarrassment. Intended by the developers or not, it's not exactly pleasant to sit through.\n\nThere's another thing I wish to address, and that's that the game stands in a weird Twilight Zone. I encountered a lot of visual bugs, frequent missing textures, and a significant amount of pop-in in my five hours with the game. I am not sure if this was intentional (that's how effective this game is as a satirical work), but it did make exploration more difficult than it needed to be at times. Given the labyrinthine design of the overworld map, I found myself relying on visual landmarks for navigation, and it did get in the way when I'd have to wait for one to pop back in.\n\nI like to get the negative out of the way in reviews though so I can refocus in on what a game does well. A very effective final 20 minutes and ending, some frankly ingenious multi-solution (if perhaps a tad easy) puzzles, and a visual style that consistently surprises make this game the first real standout for those looking for a unique experience in 2015.\n\n--UPDATE (7/16)--\n\nI wasn't expecting this review to get so popular. I posted it, looked away, and to my surprise, it's sitting on the storefront. Because it's there, and I happen to be in control of it, I think a nice little thing to do might be for me to answer any user questions below, since other people who click on this might have them.\n\n\n[i]mendel asked:\nDo you know Doublefine's Hack'n'Slash where you reprogram the game in order to progress? Is TMC more than HnS in 3D with a different backstory?[/i]\n\nI've not actually played HnS. I followed its development a bit, but Double Fine lost a bit of my personal confidence with the whole Kickstarter, failed project, Kickstarter, Early Access, conga line they started to, shall we say, dance in. So.. take the following answer with a grain of salt.\n\nTMC does not go as far as Hack'n'Slash in its \"hacking\". By no means do you interact directly with the code you're manipulating in the game. A better way to think about TMC's approach to hacking might be \"you can equip items on objects in the game world\".\n\nFor instance, say I'm being attacked by a spooky ghost. I might, in TMC, replace his ability to fly with the limitation that he may only walk. That might be a way I can avoid him.\n\nHack'n'Slash, by comparison, looks more geared towards actual programmers. (in fact, I'm a little tempted to go play with the demo if there is one)\n\nOne thing I would point out, if you're unsure, is that TMC does have a gameplay demo that lets you see the first hour or so of gameplay. It's what sold me on a purchase.\n\nHope that helps!", "timestamp_created": 1436756143, "timestamp_updated": 1437079976, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 352, "votes_funny": 16, "weighted_vote_score": "0.920862", "comment_count": "9", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17020617": {"recommendationid": "17020617", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017943247", "num_games_owned": 323, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 838, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459835912}, "language": "english", "review": "It's amazing, there wasn't a single moment I didn't enjoy and I was actually intrested in the story and puzzles riddled throughout this off the rails experiance.", "timestamp_created": 1436755057, "timestamp_updated": 1436755057, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17020342": {"recommendationid": "17020342", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054136634", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 298, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448491441}, "language": "english", "review": "-Beat the real game\n-Made my own game\n-Called it \"Dicks and Pussies\"\n-B1tch loved it \n\n\"10/10, would make another sequel\"\n", "timestamp_created": 1436753206, "timestamp_updated": 1436753206, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17020304": {"recommendationid": "17020304", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999908506", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448521479}, "language": "english", "review": "I didn't see any indication of this on the store page, so I do want to warn everyone that there are a few instances of some pretty strong language in this game.

It's not even close to alpha, with constant re-writes of the celebrity lead game designer.\n\nBut something that grew and became smarter within the game code throughout the years wants out, and it enlists your help in an attempt to wrestle the game free of the incompetent development team and bring it to life.\n\n\nGameplay-wise this is divided into two acts with several more or less interactive cutscenes in between.\n\nThe first act is mainly a puzzle game. Main mechanics are 'ghosting' (the ability to be recognized as 'dead' by the game engine, thus not harmed by 'live' gameplay elements, as well as able to interact only with other 'dead' elements) and 'editing'. Editing allows you to capture monsters in the game and switch their allegiances and powers, which allows you to collect a group of guards ans assassins able to interact with the game world in ways you cannot.\nThe creature powers and the puzzles are creative and sometimes well hidden, allowing for some headscratching and creative try-and-possibly-miss approaches. You can beat this part with only exploring and solving some of these puzzles, and replayability is defintitely a thing.\n\nThe second act is creation, as in creating a game so your code-bound ally can get out through the release gate. This basically breaks down to creating a (simplified) video game of your own. Your mastery of the game engine (measured in puzzles you solved, powers you found, secrets you unearthed, etc., in the first 'act') dictates what elements you can use in this phase, and how many.\n\nThe Magic Circle  is a fun and creative game that narratively pokes fund at the games industry (developers and fans alike), although at time it walks the line between thought-provoking and preachy.\n\nI got the game in the starting for 17 \u20ac, a rather fair price in my estimation, but then I have the disposable income, like to reward well-done art, and in hindsight would have bought it for the full starting asking price of 20 \u20ac. But the fun to be had here is at least worth 10 \u20ac.\n\nTL/DR: Gameplay is a lot of fun if you are into creative puzzlers. nuff said. Narrative has a few weak points, but is entertaining.

Reprogramming enemy behaviors makes all kinds of weird and messy solutions possible, and the game actively encourages you to use whatever means to get the job done.\n\nDuring all this, you're constantly finding commentary snippets, changelogs, deleted content and actually seeing the developer egos clashing about the state, mechanics and philosophy of the game. And after all that is said and done, it really gets crazy.\n\nDiscussing about the last hour of the game would really be doing The Magic Circle a huge disservice. Let's just say that all the problems, considerations and points of view that go into making a big budget video game really do get thoroughly explored in a rather ingenious way.\n\nHow much actual enjoyment one gets out of The Magic Circle depends. It's not a particularly fun game to play, and the graphics range from drab to gaudy with no real middle ground. The music is just, well, incomplete and bad.

Expected to end with thousands of different combinations of \"npc parts\" but in truth got about 30 and from those only five useful and some of those became obsolete eventually.\n-Short... less than 5 hours of game-play with \u00bdhour of cut-scene/audio content that as a player i had to wait out to get the whole thing....

It's not that you won't 'get' the jokes, but more that it's mostly a collection of petty squabbles and cross-purposes that likely aren't nearly as funny if you haven't been forced to deal with similar situations in the past.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Good writing (with one caveat I'll explain in more depth later)\n+ Simple mechanics that allow for experimentation and exploration\n\nCons:\n\n- Requires a bit too much backtracking in a few areas\n- Quite short (3 Hours for me, with only a bit of wandering around in search of secrets)\n\nYour Milage May Vary:\n\n* Pokes fun at the clashing of different game development ideologies\n* Purposefully 'unfinished' aesthetic\n\n----\n\nIt's definitely a fun premise for a game. A man is working on the sequel to an accidental smash hit he made years ago... and has been doing so for more than a decade, with the help of a 'pro-gamer' who helped it gain noteriety in the first place and a super-fan seeking to make the next iteration everything it can possibly be, with or without its originator. You, as a sort of ascended Character Controller, are tasked by an unknown force with moving through what working bits and pieces exist in the game world in order to... well, you don't know what you're trying to do at first, and once you learn the story doesn't develop too much further, so I won't spoil it here.\n\nIn any event, you quickly gain the ability to hack game assets and frankenstein their abilities into various little minions in order to solve puzzles. It plays this up as something that more or less grants you total power over the world, and for a time it certainly feels that way - stripping the legs off of a dog-creature to bring a mushroom to life and let it follow you around like a loyal pet is fun in a dark, sadistic sort of way - but eventually the novelty wears off and it's clear that the ability has very clear limits, designed specifically to keep you on track and solve puzzles in mostly static ways.\n\nBut that's okay, at least in my opinion. The system is still fun in and of itself, and it means more attention can be paid to the plot when it pops up. The narrative actually has very little to do with you as the player. instead, it focuses on /why/ the development of the game you inhabit has stalled for Duke Nukem Forever lengths of time, as well as the dissatisfaction with the situation coming to a head amongst the employees. If you have memories of disaster-plagued group projects in high-school, college, or work, it should resonate pretty strongly with you. It's well-written, well-acted, and really encapsulates (in a caricature-ish kind of way) what happens when leading individuals in a creative endeavor have entirely different end goals - or worse, no clear goals whatsoever.\n\nThis all comes to a head in a somewhat preachy, extremely long-winded speech by the 'esteemed writer' at a not-quite-E3 press event where... lots of things happen that security /really/ should have interrupted. Quickly. Instead of not at all, the way it turns out in the game. It's awkward, really, and is the only bit of the game's writing that honestly had me shaking my head in confusion and apathy.\n\nAnd then it was over, barely three hours into my play session, dropping me into a mode where I could see if I could toss together passable levels using a combination of the game's usual 'throw states on a creature' gameplay and some creative tools. While seemingly good for a mode taped to the end of another game, I'm not sure it was actually something that would pull me back in now that I've completed the story mode.\n\nAll in all, was it worth $20? Eh... Barely. I definitely enjoyed my experience with the game and recommend it if you're at all interested in game development or creative writing of some sort, but that's a steep price to pay for the amount of content that you don't have to build yourself.

It emphasizes exploration more than puzzles or combat, but I think it\u2019s somewhere in that range. Very refreshing and very worth your time.\n\nI\u2019d been excited to play this because of Jordan Thomas\u2019s involvement (Shalebridge Cradle, Fort Frolic), but otherwise didn\u2019t know what to expect.\n\nThe first surprise is that it\u2019s the funniest game he\u2019s worked on. The narrative is mostly delivered by overhearing conversations, sort of a comedy radio play. The characters are exaggerated blends of some well-known developers (Richard \u201cLord British\u201d Garriott, John Romero, Warren Spector, Stevie Case, etc.). Some characters talk directly to you, but since you are involved in the fiction as a \u2018player\u2019 it frequently makes jokes as it breaks the 4th wall. The world contains a huge number visual gags about unfinished/buggy/clich\u00e9 games and these are funny as long as you\u2019ve looked at a level editor or bad game even once. There\u2019s also text logs that poke fun at the petty disagreements that happen when developing a game.\n\nThe second surprise (though more in tune with Jordan\u2019s other work) is that it\u2019s really creepy. Everything in the game\u2019s presentation is trying to unsettle you. The world looks like it\u2019s barely held together and every action you take looks breaks the world just a little more, almost to the point of snapping in two. There\u2019s layers of subtext anywhere you look and it\u2019s like snooping in someone\u2019s trash. The motivations and origins of characters are mysterious enough to draw you in and push your comfort level as you voyeuristically hear their interactions.\n\nThe third surprise is the actual gameplay. It\u2019s hard to tell if this is a FPS, RPG, or what from the trailer (or even the first hour of play). It finally hit me that the easiest description is that it\u2019s a necromancer game with some light puzzle elements. It\u2019s presented as an open world, but some directions are blocked off until you find a decent combination of \u2018spells\u2019 to open up a new path. The necromancy also plays into the creepiness since your army of the undead is kind of a loud menace that won\u2019t give you personal space.\n\nThe final section of the game goes in some crazy directions with story and gameplay. It\u2019s a little too much to take in as one big chunk, but it\u2019s also a great climax that makes the game feel complete. It\u2019s a nice self-contained story and I can\u2019t fault for being a bit meta or navel gazing when it\u2019s so unlike anything else I\u2019ve played before.", "timestamp_created": 1431886718, "timestamp_updated": 1436586098, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.637619", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15857909": {"recommendationid": "15857909", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022164071", "num_games_owned": 1240, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500491067}, "language": "english", "review": "Heartfelt, full of dark comedy as well as some thought provoking moments, this is one of those rare games you kinda wish was longer, or would get a sequel...but the more you think about it, the more you realize it's perfect the way it is.", "timestamp_created": 1431798806, "timestamp_updated": 1431798806, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548555", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "15857862": {"recommendationid": "15857862", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970757749", "num_games_owned": 383, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1977, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1437665801}, "language": "english", "review": "For anyone who is a fan of game design, this is a sometimes funny, sometimes fascinating, sometimes all-to-real look at the behind the scenes of making a video game.

Be warned that I do not like Early Access because of how many projects that never get finished!\n\nWelcome, one and all, the The Magic Circle. Welcome to a land where gametesters are gods and the designers are lazy. \n\nThe Magic Circle is a very innovative and creative first person adventure game. You begin by starting the game with nothing in hand and the creators of the virtual world talking in the background. The game is a strange one. Imagine The Stanley Parable mixed with Portal; even though it's not like either of those games in the slightest. For some strange reason, the game reminded me of those two games in many ways. \n\nYour character has no name and you don't have any weapons, even though this is an RPG... an unfinished one (on purpose, it's part of the game's charm). The game has beautiful graphics from every era along with colorful characters and gameplay! \n\nPros:\n+Beautiful graphics style\n+Original gameplay and story\n+Unique artstyle\n+Lots of 4th wall breaks\n+Original UI for upgrades and inventory\n+Amazing voice acting\n\nCons:\n+Graphical errors (such as me being able to look through walls/ floors in certain places)\n\nThe game isn't a short one. If you're expecting a short and sweet Early Access indie, then you are mistaken. The game is very polished and has amazing voice acting. This hidden Steam gem should be known by everyone.

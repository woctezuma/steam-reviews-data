Yes, those games seem far more exciting and interesting from what I have read, especially Eden. Yes, this game is meant as a large exposition, so it is expected to have lengthly character and plot development. Yes, this route has been a bit more surprising and impactful, in comparison to Yumiko's, but it still suffers from the idle conversation that I think plagues this game. Yes, some of this chatter on this route was actually quite important to give a more comprehensive understanding of Sachi's underlying struggles, but dam* I just can't stand it anymore. \n\nI think I've given this game quite a fair chance at this point. My downvote will stand. I'm just gonna finish the anime, and call it a close to this series for me. By all means, if you believe an almost un-necessarily long-winded exposition is worth your time for the events that come in Leisure and Eden, be my guest. But, I will pass on this series. \n[i]Edit 2[/i]\n\n\n[i]Edit[/i]: (8/17/17)\nSo, I chose to watch a bit of the anime (first 4 episodes), and I think I know what my problem with the VN is. It seems the point at which you branch onto each of the girls' routes is staggered along the common route. Michruru seems to be first, Amane, Makina, Sachi, with Yumiko being last. I chose the LAST route first, which made for a gruling grind through the common route with little action and foreshadowing. The anime also provides several in-the-moment scenes and foreshadowing scenes which hook you far more, and actually make you interested in continuing the journey through the story. It also cuts out several of the scenes from the VN that add no value to plot progression and character development, which made me not want to continue the VN more and more as I progressed. I recommend looking through a guide to see the best way to approach the routes. I'm gonna try out a route that branches earlier, then I will see if this VN deserves an upvote.\n[i]Edit[/i]\n\n \nAllow me to begin by saying that this VN is certainly not bad, but not particularly high on my VNs-to-go-down-in-history list. This is where a \"Neutral\" button for Steam would come into play, but that is fundementally useless. However, I am leaning toward a downvote.\n\nI played down one girl's route, Yumiko's, both good and bad endings, and it wasn't what I expected, in a bad way. For one, the bad ending just abruptly ended. I didn't even know whether I had finished the game or not. Given its rating and some of the clips from the anime that I had seen, I wasn't entirely sure what I expected, but certainly not how it actually played out. How I see it, it's a slice-of-life VN that roles into a more \"loose-cannon\" type of narrative that gradually tugs at your heart-strings.\n\nFrankly, about the first 25-30 hours, it is just slice-of-life, with very occasional dabblings with some more action-packed scenes. As many have said, it gets more dramatic and emotional once you end up on one of the girls' routes at about the 30-hour mark. However, leading up to that divergence in narrative, there is so much drivel, idle chatter, romantic jokes, and attempts at humor that it gets tiresome extremely quickly. All the while, you are wondering when something of more substance will occur. I get character development, there is plenty of it, but hell they talk for the sake of talking in so many of the early scenes that it seems as if the writers didn't give a lick of consideration for the time-sink and attention readers need to give to these almost meaningless exhalations of air.\n\nThe MC, Yuuji, also came off to me as one of those characters who lost everything and ends up developing some sort of dark-humor, sarcastic facade that attempts to cast his past in shadow with an aura of mystery, when all it does is make him look like a juvenile who has yet to find out who he is and what he wants out of life. However, as you get to know him he does become somewhat likeable and endearing, while he also introduces many quotes about life, time, and society that are noteworthy, which I greatly appreciated.\n\nThe other characters exhibit your traditional tropes: kuudere, \"tsundere,\" younger-sister figure, older-sister figure, class-rep figure. The roles were carried out flawlessly, but damn the shear amount of annoying interaction between Yuuji and the others was astronomical. Not surprising given the reason why all of them are at Mihama Academy, but it still remains a fact. Michiruru's utterances are faithly annoying throughout the entirety of the common route, aside for one particularly interesting scene. Makina is initially a bit mysterious and intriguing, which quickly falls flat on its face to expose a perturbed being that genuinely becomes somewhat charming with the unique way she talks. But this novelty eventually wears off and becomes more of a nuisance whenever Yuuji interacts with her. Amane, holy hell, the amount of romantic approaches she performs on the Yuuji goes from tantalizing to \"Would you give it a break,\" fairly quickly. Not much to complain about with Sachi. Her devotion is admirable, but once you get familiar with her, the outcome of any interaction with her becomes fairly predictable. Now, Yumiko, my girl of choice, as it were. She is just a mysterious character for the majority of the common route. Interactions with her get extremely predictable after the first two meetings, and again with its equal dose of annoyance with how she tries to circumvent problems. However, things really take a 180 once you reach her route. A turn for the better? Eh, perhaps, but she just really needed to be honest with herself. The shear amount of time she spent denying and apologizing for things amounted to most likely 1/5 of her lines in the entire VN. Got old fast.\n\nThe artwork was perfectly acceptable, albeit with a tad low of resolution. A point of note is that some of the scenes had animated background sprites, which were very effective at adding value to the scenes. No complaints on the H-scene front, aside from the requisite comment about censorship, but that is just beating a dead horse. The voices were nothing to write home about. Entirely acceptable.\n\nOverall, really disappointed. From what I have seen from the later VNs in the series it gets pretty interesting, and there looks to be quite a bit more action with the new introductions to the series: Phantom Trigger.

Almost like it started off as a Kinetic Novel and when they realized they had to have choices in it they just threw one in at the next point they could.\n\nOverall, I'm not a huge fan of the way choices work throughout the game, will spoiler tag the explanation because it's probably better to experience it without knowing how it works when you read it yourself. [spoiler] Basically, the first few choices are meaningless, only subtly changing things in that scene. After that, your next choice(s) just determines which route you wind up on, and in some cases it's pretty unclear why a certain option would set you on that route. But those choices all come down to either putting you on a character's route or locking you out of that route and sending you to the next choice. And once you're on a route, there's only one more choice, which in almost all cases is just a guess you have to make, with one choice leading to the good ending and one leading to the bad ending, with no particular logic as to which choice leads to what. [/spoiler]\n\nI do find the story a pretty strong point though, throughout reading this, I went through pretty much every possible feeling (unfortunately that does include the feeling of boredom, but that only happened 2-3 times throughout, and for over 60 hours, that's pretty good as far as I'm concerned). That's pretty much all I can say about the story without going on a very detailed and spoiler-filled rambling session.\n\nThe translation is okay, it does the job, there are some typos throughout, but not a lot to be concerned about. There are some times the translators very clearly took creative liberties as opposed to an actual translation, usually with the result of it varying from being kind of awkward to being utterly cringe inducing.\n\nI'm going to sum up a couple of my problems with this in one paragraph to end this review off because they sort of mesh together for me. One of them being that the protagonist is unvoiced, it's kind of a common trope that I don't really get, it just seems to make things awkward to me, all kinds of no-name characters get voices, but for the protagonist we're just supposed to use our imagination or something? The other problem is that this release doesn't support Japanese at all. The reason I say these go together is because with the protagonist being unvoiced, and there not being any options to view anything in Japanese, you can't really follow along with a lot of the humor that's lost in translation, and a lot of it gets lost because naturally the protagonist is pretty heavily involved in a lot of the conversations.\n\nOverall, not without its flaws, but I still very much recommend this, I was pretty much hooked on it from the time I started until I had finished every possible scene, cursing the times I had to work or sleep when caught in the middle of something particularly fascinating.", "timestamp_created": 1506643983, "timestamp_updated": 1506646048, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.589023", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35240686": {"recommendationid": "35240686", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095021083", "num_games_owned": 222, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 20698, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510585822}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0428\u0443\u0442\u043a\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e \u043c\u0430\u043c\u043e\u043a \u0431\u0435\u0441\u0446\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b.", "timestamp_created": 1506515235, "timestamp_updated": 1506515235, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552850", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35219995": {"recommendationid": "35219995", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159647129", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498480157}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4f60\u770b\u770b\u4eba\u5bb6\u77f3\u5934\u95e8\u90fd\u51fa\u5b98\u4e2d\u4e86\uff0c\u5230\u5e95\u8fd8\u8981\u6211\u5427\u4f60\u653e\u7070\u5230\u4ec0\u4e48\u65f6\u5019\uff1f", "timestamp_created": 1506424790, "timestamp_updated": 1506424790, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.572544", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35175800": {"recommendationid": "35175800", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027783888", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 2689, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512815390}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is too beautiful too pass up.

In fact, one of the best reads out there. Second only to Katawa Shoujo, but as in that VN, this has me wishing I could have met the girls when I was in high school. Not sure I would have been as helpful to them as Yuuji, but... I kind of identify with them somewhat.\n\nAs you can see by the time I've spent on the game, it took me a while to get through all the routes. Now, the game centers around Kazami Yuuji, a young man with quite the past. One that is barely touched on in most routes, but the broad strokes are that he has been trained from youth an agent for some spy group (which appears to be multinational), and is agent 9029 (which based on how some of the routes mention makes him basically 007 for this organization). He simply wants a normal school experience, and this school, which has five other students, is basically the best choice. He is a second-year student.\n\nAs for the girls... I'll mention them in order of my playthrough.\n\nMatsushima Michiru is a second-year student, sporting bleached blond twin-tails, and trying to be a tsundere (though her concept of it is a bit... odd). She is a bit of an idiot, but a well-meaning one. And frankly... she is likely much smarter than she acts. Her route was interesting, and the end of her good route may be the earliest of all of them timewise.\n\nSakaki Yumiko is a second-year student, and the prodigal daughter of Sakaki Michiaki, who is the President of perhaps the most powerful corporation in Japan. And since she is apparently the only daughter, her route's main issue is Daddy Dearest... Her route was also interesting, and was the first to delve slightly into Yuuji's backstory. The good route, I would say, ends at the second-longest point in time.\n\nSuou Amane is a reddish-haired... well-developed third-year student. She is the most flirtateous with Yuuji, though that is partly due to her backstory. If you go her route, she has (in the words of Lilly from Katawa Shoujo) a \"healthy adolescent sex drive\".  Her route... man, her route is a tear-jerker. There are many parts of that route that can make you cry, especialy her history... and the end of the good route. Her good route ends at the latest point, by far. [spoiler]All the way to being a grandma.[/spoiler]\n\nIrisu Makina is an innocent and carefree first-year student. She has a bit of a lisp due to events in her past, and is the former successor of the Irisu Clan, which is a very powerful financial clique with holdings worldwide. In fact, they may well rival the Sakaki's East Beach Railway Express Group. She acts as the immature fool. Thing is, she picks up concepts very quickly, so... there may be some of that prodigy she was before the major incident in her past. She calls Yuuji \"Onii-chan\" at the start, and unless you go into her route, will continue to do so. Considering she technically buys you as her \"Papa\" if you do go into her route, she is a bit naive at times. Her route is action-packed, and while I'm not sure how I feel about the ending, seems to work. Her bad ending ends six months later, while the good ends a year later. [spoiler]Also noting the change in her condition between both... well, I wonder if that still applied.[/spoiler]\n\nKomine Sachi is a pink-haired (because we need one in any VN, right?) first-year student, who... well, she acts as the maid for the school. Mostly because she cannot turn down a request, and tries to be a \"good girl\" at all times. While she is safe in the school, this is not so much an issue, but outside of it... this could lead to problems (one of which may have lead to her getting put in the school). She realizes early on that she has history with Yuuji. Her route has the most tear-jerker moments. And the roller-coaster of feeling is a trip, but a cathartic one. Her good ending is probably the second earliest in time period (there might be a few days difference between Michiru's and hers).\n\nThis is a phenominal story, and deserves to be read. Thing is, I'm not sure how one could continue afterwards. This alone makes me wonder if Fruit was supposed to be a standalone title, but it became so popular they put out two sequels. At least two of the routes are ill-suited for sequels simply because of how far into the future they go. Anyway, just a slight issue.\n\nSide note: This VN, like Katawa Shoujo does not have a \"True\" Route.

Welp, as you can see my display picture is one of the girls in this VN (the best girl of course), and well while I do have the unrated one, i bought this on steam coz the sole purpose of supporting the developer (and actually for some steam exclusive CGs too (oh and a background for my profile too)), soo here's the thing:\n\nPros:\n+ A VN with great story, with a total of approximately 60+ hours of gameplay (reading), with half of it is a common route to introduce you to the characters and half of it for each 5 girl's route with two endings for each of them.\n+ Starts out as a comedy, slice-of-life story, and turns out to be a really deep story once you get into one of the girl's route. [b]It really goes from just-the-tip to balls deep pretty fucking fast.[/b]\n+ Suou Amane is the best girl.\n+ The main character is [spoiler]a guy with dark past, a reserve mercenary for the government,[/spoiler] having an acute case of sarcastic streak (which is good), and actually is worthy of having a harem for himself not like some sort of generic harem MC.\n+ The main girls consists of an idiotic pseudo-tsundere, a chipmunk-faced girl with a streak of making profanity and sexual jokes outta nowhere, a maid that taking all things up too literally, a loner girl that perhaps spends all time in her room downloading porn from the internet, and the best girl that will take care of you all time, wait for you to come home in your room while making food for you filled with love, so attentive to your needs, and is horny all the time (which is a good thing ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)).\n+ The soundtrack is just magnificent, it will always fit in to the scenes you read. The ending songs are lovely too.\n+ Suou Amane is the best girl.\n+ The CGs here are just beautiful too look at, and i shit you not it's moe overload.\n+ The voice actors are also amazing.\n+ Did I already said that Suou Amane is the best girl?\n\nCons:\n- The long common route may or may not annoy you, it's a decent slice-of-life stories but maybe its just too long for some readers, especially the ones that are new to VNs.\n- The steam version have all specific-type-of-scenes censored because of obvious reason which is not that bad, but some kind of jokes are also censored (now THAT'S bad).\n- Not all situations are realistic, especially the route of some specific [spoiler]bottle-blond[/spoiler].\n+/- The bad endings will leave you wrecked more than the [spoiler]Angelic Howl bus wreckage[/spoiler]. I feel bad of joking about that omfg.\n\nOverall, if you have watched the anime and loved it, the VN is for you, it's million miles better than the anime.

This game is truly excellent. A great deal of time and effort have gone into creating storylines and characters that will get you truly invested in their universe. The realness of this VN is completely startling. That might sound strange as there are things like \n\n*****SPOILERS*****\n[spoiler]A girl who lives inside another girl due to a heart transplant\nA man whose arm is possessed by a demon\nA maid who comes to school in her underwear due to an offhand comment [/spoiler]\n\nThat does not negate my earlier statement though. Most VN's have oversimplified characters due to the limited nature of the genre. However, whever Fruit goes into VN cliches it always makes sense like \n\n*****SPOILERS*****\n[spoiler]The over-sexualized character who wants to sleep with you for some reason. She wants to do it because of the guilt she feels over something in your past. (That explanation is lacking due to it taking hours for the game to develop and I did it in a sentence) [/spoiler]\n\nThe comedy, darkness, and attention to detail all combine to create a legitimately astounding game. All of this without even mentioning the absolutely beautiful artwork and cg's that are all throughout the game. \n\nOne note before we continue. This game is not for the faint of heart. This game legitimately made me cry and feel nauseus and I don't regret that for a moment. The subject matter is extremely dark, so don't go in expecting sunshine and rainbows. If you can stomach some complexity and darkness in your games than please do yourself a favor and play this game.\n\nMy one regret is the pricetag. $40 is high for a VN but Fruit is legitimately great enough, and long enough to warrant it.\nSo pick it up on sale if you can, but definitely play this gem.", "timestamp_created": 1495638337, "timestamp_updated": 1495638399, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.577300", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31761912": {"recommendationid": "31761912", "author": {"steamid": "76561198361694834", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 7448, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505268655}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros: \n-60+ hours of gameplay (even with quick reading)\n-5 different routes\n-Yuuji's wisecracks\n-Tsunderes \n-Kuudere\n-Plenny of humor\n-Plenny of tears (although I'm too fruitless for them ([spoiler]except for meowmel...[/spoiler]))\n-Well crafted stories\n-beautiful ost\n-harem school\n\nCons:\n-60+ hours of gameplay (even with quick reading)\n-Makes me cringe (quite a lot of times ([spoiler]do you rike fish???[/spoiler]))\n-situations not so realistic \n-heavily censored (come on, man, this is basic knowledge in middle school and up)\n\nA bunch of things that happen: \n[spoiler]\nKick ass on a daily basis\nJam an airplane engine with turkey\nRuin someone's rep with a single phone call\nRun away a bunch of times\nStart a family\nFake-date a bunch of times \nGo to first base\nFake a funeral\nFly to America (while toppling the school orchard )\nBlow up your school\nHave man on woman action (once 12 times in a day)(quite a lot)\nLearn of their \"pleasuring\" hobbies\nMeet a childhood friend\nSnipe somebody from 1400m\nHave a beach vacation \nHave someone literally around the same age as you call you onii-chan and papa\nGain yourself 70M\u00a5\nGet chased around Japan\nKill a corrupt mother\nTeach some military skills to someone\nHave someone give you a bj and screen it (and you get to see it as well)\nHave a girl masturbate on your bed\n[/spoiler]\nTl;dr all the way worth it.

Compared to KS and IMHHW, this game is extremely dark and gloomy, so I will reiterate that is NOT for those faint of heart or looking for something cheerful to read. However, if you are looking for a story very rich in character development, you won't be disappointed.\n\nI do not recommend the all-ages version. One of the best things about this game is its very mature theme and humor. Very much of said humor is sexual, and I feel the reader would be missing out on those incredibly hilarious moments. Beyond that, for some of the characters, the sexual nature of the relationship is actually very important. The all-ages version attempts to make up for this with some bonus scenes and CGs, but it does not entirely make up the difference in my opinion.\n\nI would without a doubt give this VN a solid 9/10.

I am against censorship, especially the double standard that exists where extreme violence is ok yet bare breasts lead to madness, but that's an argument for another time. \n\nThis VN has a massive amount of glowing reviews. As a result, I approached this game with the surety that I would absolutely adore it. I'm easy to please. Give me compelling characters with clever dialogue and even a dash of plot, I'll happily read for hours on end. You want to throw in some strife? Great, have at! I require a little drama in my VNs. In the case of The Fruits of Grisaia, I just have to possess the patience to click through 500+ screens worth of everyday, boring \"life stuff\", for lack of a better term, before hitting a patch of story progression. Then we're right back to hearing about what Amane is cooking for Makina today, or what Sachi is cleaning. Rinse and repeat.\n\nThe mistaken belief many writers seem to have is that quantity is better than quality.  The common path is ridiculously long and drawn out, adding little to the experience except to establish what these girls eat and watch on tv. I would have gladly skipped it all and started with one of the girl's paths--that's how little I feel the 6 hours I spent trudging through the common path actually added to the story. Did I mention I read fast? It's also annoying to have to click after each sentence, especially when everything is so drawn out and convoluted that it could have been said in 50 pages rather than 100. Forget about the slow auto text, I'll just have to live with the carpal tunnel. \n\n Yes, I'm bitter. I feel like I'm the only person in the room that doesn't get the joke. I have trudged through 3 1/2 story lines, and I'm still not impressed. (I'm working on Amane now and saved Makina for last, at least she makes me chuckle fairly consistently.) On the positive side, I found the girls' backstories sympathetic and somewhat compelling, but that just isn't enough for me to recommend this game.\n\nI'm going to add one final thought, one that only a few other kindred spirits might understand: I wasn't merely soured on this novel because of the protracted plot. I absolutely detest it now due to the simple phrase \"That a fact.\" That phrase was uttered by every last character in this VN, but what's truly reprehensible is that the MC said it at least 100 times. I am not exaggerating.\n\nTL,DR: Long, drawn out, repetitious plot; underwhelming twists; and I pity the next fool that I hear say \"that a fact\" irl.", "timestamp_created": 1489708038, "timestamp_updated": 1489708038, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.571889", "comment_count": "10", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30489316": {"recommendationid": "30489316", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965049785", "num_games_owned": 653, "num_reviews": 390, "playtime_forever": 4634, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511693068}, "language": "english", "review": "There is alot I can say about this game, but probably far too much for a short steam review.

My fave is yuuji's sister (she's badass!) The visual novel is well drawn, well paced, and well scripted. Frontwing has done a good job partnering with sekai project to get these great VNs released in the west. I highly recommend to play the trilogy and THEN watch the anime.

I got it on sale for $20 because I'm a bargain shopper when it comes to games. If you just can't wait then buy it for the full $40. I waited and I've seen it on sale numerous times since I learned of the series existence. This game revovles around a teenager with a jaded past coming to a high school of \"unorthodox\" girls. Each girl has their own unique personality and tragic backstory. Most, if not all routes will leave you tearing up. I recommend following a guide for the decisions to get certain routes complete. One major disclaimer: THE BEGINNING IS LONG AND DRAWN OUT BUT PLEASSSSSSSSSSEEEEE STICK TO IT!!! I remember someone else mentioning that in the reviews before I bought this.

There are two versions of this game: the all-age version here on Steam and the unrated version on Denpasoft. There exists quite a few differences between these two.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s talk about the similarities: \n - Same prices ($40).\n - No fundamental change to storyline, albeit a few small changes here and there.\n\t\nThen, about the differences, the following describe the all-age version on Steam:\n - Removed H-scenes: This is the single biggest problem why people not recommended the all-age version. While the H-scenes can be skipped on a few routes, for Amane\u2019s and Yumiko\u2019s (especially Amane\u2019s), the H-scenes contain a lot of character developments and internal monologues. And the skips also make the rhythm of the game felt abrupt.\n - Modified and cropped images: This happens to more casual ecchi scenes (likes when Amane walking around half-naked, which changed by adding a brassiere; or when Makina try to temp Yuuji, which changed by cropping only the non-ecchi part of the image). This is alright but a few cropped images look a bit unnatural.\n - Modified dialogues: Same reason above, a few ecchi jokes got modified.\n\nThere also exists a patch to convert the Steam version to unrated version, you can use it at your own risk.\n\nIn conclusion:\n - If you want to enjoy this visual novel to the fullest or want the best value for $40, buy it on Denpasoft.\n - If you don\u2019t like H-content, or intend to give it to someone who doesn\u2019t like H-content, or simply want to own this game on Steam, or want to get it on Steam sales, etc., then I recommend this because the story is fundamentally the same.", "timestamp_created": 1482473494, "timestamp_updated": 1482640394, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28398229": {"recommendationid": "28398229", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002155332", "num_games_owned": 273, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 48, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1446023214}, "language": "english", "review": "tl;dr 9/10, no H scenes, get it now, it's ace. \nA few years ago, this was my first japanese VN I read after starting with Katawa shoujo.\nI didn't expect the level of quality and writing in this and I gunuinely don't believe the lack of H scenes in this do anything to detract from the wonderful set of characters and high production value of this VN.

Makina played loli's role so well, Sachi with her Plain minded, Amane with her perferted older sister style, Michiru really pissed me off with her Self proclaimed Tsundere, And there is Kuudere sakaki.\n- Good music.. \n- And the best of all is, Great Story!

After already completing the unrated version one time, I decided to re-read it on Steam to refresh myself of the story before reading the second in the series, \"The Labyrinth of Grisaia\". This work is incredibly well written and provides a perfect blend of comedy, drama, action, and romance. \n\nThe characters are superbly thought up and become very well developed throughout the story and in their respective routes. The interactions that result from the mix of personalities provide for very interesting situations, ranging from off-the-rails banter, to serious moments of drama. The protagonist is incredibly charming, maintaining a serious but sarcastic demeanor, one could only describe such a character as \"a badass motherfucker\". This is not to say he is without defects however as he holds onto internal flaws and conflicts that have resulted from his traumatic childhood, shying him away from the typical \"Gary Stu\" archtype, resulting in something more.. human. This is something that stretches and covers all the charaters as well. Each and every girl has their circumstances for attending the special Mihama Academy, and in each of their respective routes, these stories are unraveled. There is much to relate to or emphathize with when it comes to learning about the characters.\n\nThe plot of this novel is incredibly interesting and engaging. I found myself binging this 80 hour game non-stop and completing it within a week. There are a few weak points and inconsistencies in certain routes, however I think you'll find yourself not minding them very much at all because of how excellent the surrounding details are.\n\nThe soundtrack is the next main selling point of this work. \"Atmospheric\" and \"Incredible\" are two words that come to mind. You won't find a single dull moment while reading this novel while this OST is accompanying the gripping plot.\n\nIn conclusion, I can guaruntee there are at least a few things for everyone in this story. I absolutely 100% recommend picking this up when it goes on sale or otherwise ($40 hardly seems like a bad deal for 70+ hours of enjoyment, don't you think?). The only negative I can really say is that this VN will truly spoil you. There are very few novels that measure up to this one in terms of excellence, you'll find yourself more often than not, not able to read things of mediocre quality quite as easily anymore. As for the question of whether to get this on Steam or purchase the uncensored version from Denpasoft, that's completely up to you.

This is the first part of the Grisaia trilogy and introduces the five different love interests - since they are fellow students in Mihama Academy, a school for special cases, they all have a dark past, which can be discovered in their respective routes. Especially Makina's route also reveals more about the protagonist's backstory.\n\nThe game contains only a few choices, starting several hours in, and the last four are the points where the different routes branch off. It took me 100 hours to complete the game with all the routes.\n\nWhile the first half of the game largely maintains an upbeat mood with a pinch of dirty humour added, the five routes all have a darker undertone. Even though vastly exaggerated, the struggles of the five girls are at their core highly relatable. It is interesting to see how they deal with their issues, and how the protagonist tries to help them in overcoming these problems.\n\nThe adult content is removed from the steam version, [strike]but there exists a restoration patch on the internet.[/strike]\nEDIT: The restoration patch is no longer available.\n\nFinally, I want to say that the game is mostly self-contained - there are no cliffhangers, so you get a satisfying experience even if you do not continue the trilogy... but after playing this part you will most likely be addicted anyway.\n\n[b]Tip for the already addicted:[/b] There is also a spinoff on steam called [i]Idol Magical Girl Chiru Chiru Michiru[/i], which is a parody on the magical girl trope.\n\n[b]Tip for playing on Netbooks:[/b] you can reduce the target fps to 30 under [i]Configuration -> System -> System -> Launch System Config -> Display 1 -> Frame Rate[/i], which should greatly reduce the workload and slow down the CPU fan.

Es gibt insgesamt zwar nicht viele Entscheidungen die man treffen kann, aber daf\u00fcr sind diese gut gew\u00e4hlt.\n\nBei manchen anderen VNs finde ich, dass alle Charaktere irgendwie \u00e4hnlich wirken (vermutlich weil sie vom selbem Schreiber kommen), aber hier sind alle 5 Charaktere stark unterschiedlich, bieten eine tiefgehende Geschichte (soweit ich von den 4 gelesenen, das beurteilen kann) und wirken zu keinem Zeitpunkt flach. Man kann zwar zugeben, dass sie so ein paar Vorlagen f\u00fcr diese Sorte von Spiel folgen (Tsundere, Maid, ...), aber das hat mich zumindestens nicht gest\u00f6rt, vorallem weil sie die (bekannten) Thema anders angehen.\n\nF\u00fcr die, die es interessiert, die H-Szenen wurden vom Spiel entfernt. Wenn man aber das Original nicht kennt und auch keinen gro\u00dfen Wert darauf legt (so wie ich), dann st\u00f6rt das keines wegs. Die Szenen werden so aufgebaut, das man an den Stellen weis, dass es passiert und danach wird meistens eh nochmal dr\u00fcber geredet. Und auch ohne die H-Szenen gibt es gen\u00fcgend Bilder mit \"Augenschmaus\" (wenn man das so ausdr\u00fccken darf).\n\nInsgesamt steckt das Spiel auf jeden Fall voll von Emotionen, ich durfte beim Spielen/Lesen sowohl sehr viel Lachen, vorallem am Anfang, aber auch mit den Charakteren mittrauern und mitfiebern.

And, well, it blew any ideas I've had about what a visual novel could do straight out of the water.\n\nI picked routes in order of who I thought were the most interesting characters; ironically enough, that led me to play through the story in probably the best way possible. \n\nSo if you're looking to buy this game, do it like so:  Yumiko, Michiru, Sachi, Amane, Makina.  It's probably the best way to do it.  There are lots of Amane references in Makina's route, for example, so it's best to do hers first.  And so on, and so forth.\n\nFirstly; this VN is so massive that it has replay value.  Immediately after finishing the last route I intend to go through the whole thing again in order to see how intimiate knowledge of the characters affects their behavior.  I'm a particularly fast reader; gameplay times will vary between players, but you can expect anywhere between 35-80 hours of raw content, depending on how you read.  There's definitely enough content in here to make it worth it.\n\nI purchased this game when it had a 50% off sale; however, after playing this through I can confidently say that I wouldn't regret purchasing it for its full value, or perhaps even double its full value.  This VN is that good.  \n\nWhat sets this VN apart from others, though?  One of the largest complaints of the story is how long the common is.  To some this is a positive, and others a negative; personally, I don't think a shorter common route would have benefitted the story in the slightest.  Not only does it effectively set a cheerful setting, it allows for a reasonable amount of time to get to know the girls on a superficial level; that way, you're not at all rushed when the time comes to actually select your route.  And, moreover, the choices to enter these routes are pretty obvious; you won't accidentally find yourself on a route unless you pick with your eyes closed, and FoG has a system that allows you to flip back to an option, anyways.  \n\nThe common route succeeds in everything it's designed to do; frankly, I have no complaints with it at all.  This isn't something that you can or should settle in a single sitting; I spent one day on the common route, and one day on each of the girl's routes, but that's probably not a time commitment everyone can make.  \n\nSo, yeah.  It might take you several sittings to get through the common route.  The VN helpfully splits things pretty neatly with time/location transition screens, so you can do a few days of the common route at a time before stopping to take a break.  \n\nThe individual routes...well...they vary from ridiculous levels of heartwarming to crushing despair.  Each and every route is a ridiculous rollercoaster of emotion.  So many themes are explored across all five routes; humanity, survival, love, family, sanity, to name some of the more prevalent ones.  \n\nThe protagonist immediately attracted my attention.  You can tell that he's pretty twisted right from the very beginning; it adds to much of the humor and drastically affects the way the plot goes.  This VN dives into complicated subjects with varying detail; from reading this VN I've learned a good exercise program and how to survive an impending bomb blast, amongst other things.  Expect adult situations and violence frequently; this story dives hellishly deep into exploring survival and humanity and becomes impossible to take lightly.  This story is extremely heavy on character development and oftentime the plot intertwines with the exploration of both the protagonist and the character of the route; all of it is done extremely well.  \n\nThe plots for all routes are done incredibly well; certain things require a little bit of suspension of disbelief, but as far as I'm concerned they don't detract too much from the story.  And, of course, the characterization is extremely solid for every character involved.\n\nThis story is meaningful and poignant.  I unashamedly cried several times reading through it.  There are other VNs in my inventory that still require exploration, but I don't think that they'll come even close to the tragic and heartwarming story that is the Fruit of Grisaia. \n\nThe music and art are both excellent; there are quite a few memorable tracks and the CG collection is excellent; including the SDs and H-scenes (You'll need a patch for those; it is worth it.) there are over 500 CGs in the VN.  The art in the VN is the best that I have seen in any VN to date and the music is up there.  \n\nThis VN also has narration for the girls in Japanese; I personally kept them on for the most part, but I'm sure that it doesn't appeal to everyone.  Use at your own discretion.  \n\nHumor, despair, and heartwarming; this VN will not disappoint (honestly, most of the negative reviews are requests for the 18+ patch...).  Even if you're not a genre fan, I wholeheartedly recommend purchasing this VN.\n", "timestamp_created": 1467858602, "timestamp_updated": 1467858602, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516661", "comment_count": "9", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24124309": {"recommendationid": "24124309", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150499581", "num_games_owned": 187, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 5825, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482962400}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game!

That\u2019s great, frankly, for fans and publishers alike; publishers have a veritable treasure trove of VN\u2019s to pick through and bring to us as the fanbase grows for such games, and fans can expect a whole lot of quality offerings from Japan because there\u2019s a huge variety of things to choose from, with large fanbases already installed to show the products are good. The Grisaia Trilogy, as a whole, is such an example, and for the most part, it\u2019s one that\u2019s been handled very well across the board. Sekai Project, the US publisher for the game, launched a Kickstarter for the trilogy, and while some games that have been funded that way have taken more than a year to see any sort of release, Sekai wasted no time getting the first game, The Fruit of Grisaia, out into the market while there was still some hype behind it. Not only that, with the anime already simulcasting over at Crunchyroll, there almost isn\u2019t a better time to get the game out into the waiting hands of its backers and fans, frankly. Of course, a rushed product would only hurt the project going forward, but for those who are afraid of such a thing, let me reassure you up-front: The Fruit of Grisaia is an amazingly high-quality piece of work, from start to finish, and its translation is pretty damn good across the board. That\u2019s not to say that there aren\u2019t some minor hiccups along the way, but for the most part, backers and those of casual interest alike should take heed that, even at the projected $30 asking price, the game is well worth it.The Fruit of Grisaia is essentially the tale of Yuji Kazami, new student transferring into Mihama Academy, which essentially acts as a super-restrictive private school for people who have lots of issues and, in most cases, special reasons to be there. In Yuji\u2019s case, he\u2019s something of a hired assassin, working for the Japanese government due to various circumstances in his life. Having reached a point in his life where he\u2019s wondering if there\u2019s more to life than just killing people at the behest of his employer, Yuji asks to experience a \u201cnormal\u201d life for a while, and while putting a trained killer into a normal school probably isn\u2019t a great idea, accommodations are made to place him in Mihama, where his personality defects will be less problematic. As the plot progresses, you\u2019re introduced to his five female classmates: Amane, a \u201chorny big sister\u201d type who\u2019s repressing a good bit of her childhood, Yumiko, whose kuudere tendencies mask a life she\u2019s not thrilled to be a part of, Makina, whose moe tendencies hide some odd familial issues, Michiru, a fake tsundere whose behavior masks something far more depressing, and Sachi, whose hyper-obedient nature comes from some less than pleasant roots. Yuji doesn\u2019t especially want to get involved in any of this, of course, but part of living a normal life ends up being that you end up getting attached to people eventually, and as the player, it\u2019s your job to guide Yuji into the life of one of these ladies, in hopes of helping both the lady in question, and Yuji.\n\nMy opinion :\n\nThe Fruit of Grisaia is a great visual novel with a time people really are imance this is main strength with a very good story adapted into an anime in 2014 two out season that really exlente is that racontre very good history with a supplement in oav. Level graphics the game is the problem of working around longer than I have appreciated most about the game is the fact that a lot of time as d\u00e9marage the stop of the game ........ silk followed by the path to a character I really appreciate and the soundtrack is interesting music are just some epic. If I understand the name of 2 recently released on PC is not court it will complement ch\u00e9re I think your view of the game.\n\nTh\u00e8me :\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCnsC97pN8c\n\n\nConclusion :\nIn the end I recommend the game is for me one of the best along very very well work a great soundtrack . Indeed the price is a bit high for a visual novel, but really 30 euro to its visual novel want nothing else expect the balance that are high enough to be game", "timestamp_created": 1467464445, "timestamp_updated": 1467464445, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.674163", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23970424": {"recommendationid": "23970424", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106192387", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 94, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467514725}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\n\u4e4b\u524d\u662f\u770b\u4e86\u52a8\u753b\u7248\u624d\u77e5\u9053\u8fd9\u4e2a\u795e\u4f5c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6709steam\u7248\u5c31\u6765\u652f\u6301\u4e00\u4e0b\u4e86\u3002\u8d85\u7ea7\u8d5e~\uff01\n\n\u6700\u5927\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u82f1\u6587\u3002\n\u6258\u798f\u9605\u8bfb\u6ee1\u5206\u7684\u8868\u793a\u770b\u5f97\u90fd\u6709\u70b9\u96be\u53d7\u3002\u3002\uff08\u6211\u53c8\u60f3\u8d77\u6765\u4e86\u88abSAT\u9605\u8bfb\u6240\u652f\u914d\u7684\u6050\u60e7\n\u5c31\u5f53\u51fa\u56fd\u524d\u518d\u590d\u4e60\u4e0b\u82f1\u8bed\u5427\u3002lol\n\n\uff08R18\u8865\u4e01\u5728\u8bc4\u8bba\u533a\u53ef\u4ee5\u627e\u5f97\u5230\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1467332510, "timestamp_updated": 1467332510, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23957513": {"recommendationid": "23957513", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153349144", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 3380, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510044091}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e00\u4e2a\u6551\u8d4e\u4e0e\u88ab\u6551\u8d4e\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\u3002\u9ebb\u5b50\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6574\u4e2a\u6545\u4e8b\u7684\u6e90\u5934\uff0c\u64ad\u4e0b\u79cd\u5b50\uff0c\u7ed3\u51fa\u679c\u5b9e\uff0c\u679c\u5b9e\u518d\u6492\u4e0b\u79cd\u5b50\u3002\u96c4\u4e8c\u662f\u9ebb\u5b50\u7684\u679c\u5b9e\uff0c\u4e94\u4f4d\u5973\u4e3b\u662f\u96c4\u4e8c\u7684\u679c\u5b9e\u3002\u9ebb\u5b50\u7684\u8fd9\u4efd\u5584\u610f\u5c31\u8fd9\u6837\u4f20\u9012\u4e86\u4e0b\u53bb\u3002\u518d\u8005\uff0c\u6211\u89c9\u5f97\u52a8\u753b\u505a\u7684\u633a\u597d\u7684\uff0c\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u592a\u957f\u4e86\uff0c\u5751\u751f\u8089\u597d\u7d2f\u554a\u3002\u6700\u540e\u8bf4\u4e00\u53e5\uff0c\u5929\u97f3\u771f\u53ef\u7231\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1467299710, "timestamp_updated": 1467299876, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23865880": {"recommendationid": "23865880", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104262314", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 7391, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498576938}, "language": "english", "review": "First of all, don't take my hours written seriously. I've played this game for hundred of hours atleast 250 and I haven't finish the game. This is a no spoiler review.\n\nGraphics 10/10\nThis Visual Novel came out in 2011 and it looks fantastic. Unlike Nekopara and recent Visual Novels, this doesn't use the moving sprites. But nevertheless it's looks astonishing and beautiful. The Artwork is well-made and personally love the artstyle, CGI are amazing, and the character designs are fitting.\n\nStory 10/10\nThe plot is amazing, each route has their own stories while able to interact with others well. It's hard to not spoil anything without a good review. The common route let's you immerse yourself with the characters, interact with them, see how they live their daily lives. But their route comes along and you see them in a different perspective. I won't dig deep in this due to spoilerish contents.\n\nGameplay 9/10\nCompared to other Visual Novels, this has a more simpler mechanics. Just press Esc or right-click on your mouse the options are shown, and the Quick Load, Quick Save, etc. are in the screen already. This buttons doesn't block much of the screen for a good view of the game. Visual Novels doesn't need complex gameplay hence for an easier narration.  \n\nSound 9/10\nThe music and themes for this Visual Novel are soothing and immersing. Fitting for the school setting and the story crawling of the game. In the climax of the routes tend to have tension building music and whatnot.\n\nCharacters 10/10\nThe characters are extremely likeable. The MC isn't stupid, he is a wise-cracking bimbo telling jokes left and right. And he knows when he likes a girl. Every girl cast are memorable and to this date after 2 years after watching the anime and the Visual Novel, it's still etched into my brain who they are.\n\nIs it worth? Fuck yes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1467044350, "timestamp_updated": 1467044350, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 33, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.692203", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23860986": {"recommendationid": "23860986", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971153978", "num_games_owned": 417, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 6791, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467272470}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't want to spoil anything, so i keep this brief:\n\n- Story 9/10 Dont get fooled by the presentation, stories range from silly and implausible over fun to really sad and heavy.

The game has a distinct Japanese, comedy-anime style setting and takes place at a secluded school for societal rejects, essentially.

He's an ex-military prodigy with zero social skills, constant PTSD, and he loves to lecture everyone like he's their mom.  He is surrounded by five hot anime chicks who have varying levels of interest in him, but rather than set out to have sex with them (which is what I would do if I was the protagonist of a hentai game!), he constantly teases and berates them.  The girls' personalities, similarly, are unidimensional, and it's clear why they can't function in regular society, but ultimately this is where the humor comes from.

This game will drive you down every road for each character which I felt was very effective at truly making you decide who you love and want to go for. This game has five main characters excluding the player, however there are ten endings. Each character has one good ending and one bad ending which really gives the game some replay value. Each character has a very interesting unique personality from each other.\nOne of the key things I found very interesting about this game was the developer\u2019s decision to make scenes focus on all the girls just talking about a random topic. For example, which room they should have dinner in or what they should call each other even though the player isn\u2019t talking in those scenes but rather sitting aside. I felt this gave very true character development.\n[h1][b]What could have been better:[/b][/h1]\nThe story is [b][u]very long[/u][/b]. In fact, probably the longest visual novel I\u2019ve ever read. However, it contains the same amount of player choices as for example a six-hour visual novel would have. Because of this, I felt there was huge gaps in between the player choices which lead to me feeling as if it was linear. Personally, I like the ability to decide my own future within the story to a relatively advance degree saying that the retail price is exceptionally high compared to other visual novels.\n[h1][b]Would I recommend:[/b][/h1]\nYES! By far this is my favorite visual novel. However, if you intend to get this game please don\u2019t pay full retail. It\u2019s not even remotely justifiable. But with that said everything is amazing from the unique characters to the way they\u2019re represented within the visual novel.\n\nP.S.

It has one of the best plot I\u2019ve ever seen in the past 7 years of my anime/manga \"career\". Fruit of Grisaia has sparked an obsession within me for its sequels in particular and other Visual Novels in general.\n\nEven if you are not familar with the concept of visual novel and only watch anime or reading manga before, I'm sure you still going to love this game, since this is also the first visual novel I've ever play as well. The immersion level that you get when playing a visual novel game has no equal, it let your imagination go as far as you want, and you can decide the final conlusion by making the right choices through out the game. That is to say, the game has multiply routes for you to choose. Each and everytime I finished an ending, I was mind blowed by the godlike character cast, excellent production value, great comedy and extreme lewdness (only with the Unrated Patch, Steam edition was censored). There is an abnormal amount of psychological depth and serious storylines, which is amazing for such a game often overlooked as \"purely harem and fanservice\". I was even more surpirsed that they can manage to do all those things repeatedly 5 times in a row, through out 5 endings for each girls in the school.\n\n10/10 Would buy full price. Can't wait for the sequels.\n\nP/S: Fruit of Grisaia already got an anime adaptation, with 2 TV series and one special episode, but I would dare say don't even bother watching it.

But I really enjoyed getting to know the quirky characters and the humor in this part of the story was a joy to read through, it also helped that many of the illustrations in this part of the game were in the adorable and amusing \"chibi style\" which helped a lot with letting the reader actually see what the insane jokes and misunderstandings actually looked like and how each individual character reacted to them.\n\nThe music is also great. It's dramatic where it needs to be, sad where it needs to be and funny where it needs to be. It's not on the level of say, Jun Maeda's music in the Key VNs but it is still a wonderful soundtrack.\n\nLastly, the choices are pretty clear and to the point. In some VNs it can be difficult to see where your choices will lead the story, but in Fruit of Grisaia it's very obvious and seeing that was a pleasant surprise for me.\n\nAll in all I fullheartedly think this is worth the price tag, it's a great visual novel and I'd recommend it both to lovers of the genre and those who are simply curious about VNs. \nI absolutely loved Fruit, and honestly hope Labyrinth and Eden will continue the trend set by this game.", "timestamp_created": 1464090343, "timestamp_updated": 1464196653, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.703173", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23079789": {"recommendationid": "23079789", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122697344", "num_games_owned": 1799, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 314, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453117089}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6ca1\u6c49\u5316\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709R18\u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u6211\u8fd8\u662f\u53bb\u770b\u52a8\u753b\u597d\u4e86", "timestamp_created": 1463658790, "timestamp_updated": 1463658790, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.608785", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22977373": {"recommendationid": "22977373", "author": {"steamid": "76561198257274630", "num_games_owned": 171, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 1083, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 9, "last_played": 1516181399}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e70\u4e70\u4e70\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1463235204, "timestamp_updated": 1463235204, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22972579": {"recommendationid": "22972579", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051453198", "num_games_owned": 120, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1437, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475300687}, "language": "english", "review": "The beginning of the VN follow closely to the anime but once you reach the different character routes everything change and it begin to be very interesting :)", "timestamp_created": 1463218638, "timestamp_updated": 1463218638, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22840655": {"recommendationid": "22840655", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122506176", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 159, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468589485}, "language": "english", "review": "AMAZING !!", "timestamp_created": 1462612511, "timestamp_updated": 1462612511, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.447741", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22820606": {"recommendationid": "22820606", "author": {"steamid": "76561198281943027", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464200033}, "language": "french", "review": "Je viens de finir une des routes possible et je dois dire que j'ai pas lacher ce VN avant de connaitre le fin de mot de l'histoire.

Grisaia no Kajitsu is painfully average in many regards. Let the fanboys pour their hate upon me, yet I shall still hold my position. The game suffers from some of the worst pacing I have ever experienced, only being topped by that of Hoshizora no Memoria. Ive tried to like this, as can be shown by my playtime. I was almost never idle when I was playing. Yet, I feel disappointed. About 70% of the entire game is filler. It is full of bland and boring dialogue,  with uninventive slice of life scenes. So far, i've only completed 2 routes, and i'm on my 3rd. Yet I have continuously found it difficult to keep forcing myself through the dull happenings that constantly plague the story just to get to the meat of the game.\n\n Ive heard many people praise the game for exploring the backgrounds and psyches of the characters, and it does live up to that expectation. However, you have to get through 40 hours of sleep-inducing dialogue and repetitive events. Its simply not worth it unless you have a shit ton of patience. Granted, even that probably wont be enough. Ive played around 20 visual novels, 7 of which take around 20-50 hours to complete. However, those visual novels contained something this one does not. An interesting plot. The plot is entirely non-existent, only focusing on character exploration of each heroine. The common route is merely 30 hours of filler. Its absolutely mind numbingly boring.\n\n All in all, this game was a disappointment to me. I picked it up on its release date when it was being hyped up by a shit ton of people. If theres anything I can thank this visual novel for, its getting me into the meat of the genre. However, I can not recommend this. Buy this if you are looking for a game ENTIRELY character-driven, as that is all you will get. If you are trying to find a thought-provoking or engaging story, I would recommend G Senjou no Maou.\n\n Edit 1: The heroine routes are pretty good, I will admit. The flashback scenes hold quite a bit of tension during them, and keeps you hooked the entire time (unlike the rest of the game). Even so, I don't think it's worth it to have to go through the utterly mediocre and bland common route. Many people say that the reason that Grisaia is so great is because of its comedy and its characters. While its characters are where it shines, and they are quite complex, that is simply no excuse for the lack of plot focus in the game. It feels like the writer should have spent more time focusing on creating a compelling story rather than dragging the game out with filler.\n\n Some of the scenes tugged at my heartstrings, but they left no lasting impression. In regards to the comedy, it might just not be for me. I honestly tried to enjoy the slice of life elements, but they just aren't that great. The comedy falls flat, and just doesn't compare to legitimately funny and gripping VNs like Majikoi Oh Samurai Girls. I will admit that I am judging this game harshly, but I truly did enjoy many parts of it. I do think this is one of the best VNs on steam, but I can't wholeheartedly recommend it with its flaws. Hence why I made a negative review instead of a positive review.\n\n Edit 2: Alright, so I have currently finished Sakaki's route, and am now on Makina's. While I felt that Amane and Michiru's routes were quite dull, I found Sakaki's route to be much better. It started out very dull and boring, but ended up being quite good in the end. I don't wish to spoil it, but I honestly preferred it much more over Amane and Michiru's routes. Makina's route so far is quite cute in all honesty, and I think that she might be my favorite out of all of them. Also, it seems like the majority of Yuuji's (Protagonist) backstory is revealed in this route, making it much more interesting. I'm still not going to give this game a positive review as I feel that more people would see this if it was in the negative reviews rather than positive, and I have not seen any other reviews shed light on the game's issues.\n\n I would recommend this game hesitantly ONLY to someone looking for slice of life with a bit of tragedy mixed in (definitely don't look for a compelling overall story, as that is not what you will get).", "timestamp_created": 1455407975, "timestamp_updated": 1460324900, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519022",

The game is not perfect, some of those 40 hours (50 at a relaxed pace) certainly feel a bit unnecessarily padded out. But before you know it, you'll be fully commited and won't be able to stop reading. \n\nThe main character Yuuji initially comes off as a bit rough unlikeable compared to a typical VN protaganist but as you come to understand his terrible struggles, you'll be rooting for him as well as grieving for his past. The cast of girls initially seems very one dimensional but as you explore their pasts and their stories, you come to realize how much depth and darkness everyone has buried deep inside them. Helping them heal, in turn helping Yuuji begin to heal, is a truly special experience. \n\nNot all routes are created equal, the common route is lighthearted enough and a bit mundane, probably intentionally so to set up what comes after. The routes with each of the girls are each as long as or longer than many other visual novels, and deeper than most as well. Some are a little lighter than others and others are very disturbing. But I have no problem admitting that this story made me very emotional at times in complex ways.

Yes, steam sells all-age version, which cuts few adult scenes out of it, but considering sheer amount of reading material, its just tiny part. Anyway if that bothers you there is comunity guide describing how to \"restore\" it to full version. So there is no point complaining about that.\n\nStorywise game starts in light tone describing \"adventures\" of Kazami Yuuji in his new school. There is lot of laughs to be had and its quite enjoyable read. But as soon as you chose which \"route\" you want go (which girl you want to romance), story gets mutch more serious, because each girl have tragical past and serious problems to overcome. That said, game can be pretty sad and some of the endings might considered good endings but definitely not \"happy\" endings.\n\nOnce you chose route rest of story is totaly different from other routes No filler is being shared betwen story lines. That means aproximetly 15 hours of reading material for each girl (and i dont consider myself slow reader :) ).\n\nI am not expert on VNs, but i consider writing in this to be pretty good. Each girl's story is pretty strong and left lasting impresion on me (that kind where you fail to fall asleep, because you keep replaying over some of the dramatic scenes in your mind). But its not all tragic, this game have lots of humor as well, some scenes are so funny, they left me laughing for minutes, before i was able to resume reading ... specialy Sachi's lines in Makina route are just totaly awesome!\n\nBoth character and background art is well done, but i would appreciate more animation to the sprites. Blinking and mouth sync would be nice.\n\nVoice acting is in japonese so i dont understand a shit, but i think it conveys emotions quite well. Just listening to Amane talking puts me at ease and paints smile on my face :)\n\n\nOverall, i like this \"game\" a lot.

There will also be minor spoilers ahead, you\u2019ve been warned!\nThis VN is a story about a person who has had a very deep past about himself and his family. He gets enrolled to a \u201cspecial\u201d school where he meets 5 girls (I know, typical VN right?) and gets to know them better as the story progress further. You also get to know the story behind the girls, why they are in this school, their past etc. This is quite a unique style as most VNs have a style of \u201cget the guy, forget everything else\u201d thing, this VN actually puts you in a realistic environment as the Main Character (MC). All the girls have a different personality (Again, very typical here), but they are all very loveable and picking a route to complete can require some thought as it feel like you need to do all of them. \n\n[h1]Okay for the actual features now[/h1]\n\n[b]Graphics: 10/10[/b]\nOverall artwork, design and CGI elements are all on point. The visuals themselves are very appealing to the eye, as you would see in the anime (If you\u2019ve seen the anime). There is nothing else much to say\u2026the art is just too good.\n\n[b]Storyline: 8/10[/b]\nAs I mentioned above, this will heavily focus more on Makina\u2019s Route. As for the common route, this is just the stepping stone for getting to know the characters, the setting and the general story. It is very long and some chapters take a long time (Sometimes an hour) to be completed. Some of the chapters focus on each of the characters which is nice for getting to know them. \nNow, as for Makina\u2019s Route. It starts off as \u201cThis might actually go well for us\u201d feeling until you get around chapter 8 of the route and realise that the situation is harder to handle than usual. This route is filled with a lot of in depth character perception and by this point a lot of character development as arisen, nice touch. JB, Makina\u2019s Mother and The Irisu Clan are also heavily involved with this route as well as the MC A.K.A \u201c9029\u201d by the company he works for. The story does get a little complicated between the relation of Makina and the Irisu Clan, which made the entire route seem a little off. It also splits in a few parts in which it shouldn\u2019t have, making it harder to understand than it already is. There is also a reason why Makina needs to be alive, but the clan wants her dead, but this reason wasn\u2019t mentioned right until the end which was frustrating as it was such as important note.   \nThere is a good and bad ending to this route (As well as in the other routes). Your choice at the end of the route will affect the ending, so save before choosing. I did manage to do both the good and the bad ending. The good ending, well as from the name, is \u201cgood\u201d in a way. The bad ending however didn\u2019t feel like a \u201cbad\u201d ending per se, it felt more like a \u201cneutral\u201d ending to be honest. But overall, this route was really solid and well made. \n\n[b]Sound: 9/10[/b]\nSoundtracks including the OP theme, the menu soundtrack and the in-game scene soundtrack were very nice sounding, most were almost on point in the scene. It is not quite perfect as in some scenes (Tiny amount maybe only 4-5), they could\u2019ve made better soundtracks in the situation. In this case it gets a solid score, very well done.\n\n[b]Gameplay: 9/10[/b]\nIt is a solidly built with all the features a VN would ever need, some are even beyond the boundaries of the VN like a feature to optimise up to 3 monitors, which is completely unnecessary, but great otherwise. There is the usual speed text slider which works absolutely fine, I did find the faster speeds still a little too slow, but they\u2019re good enough as they are. You also have full voiced support (Except for the MC), you can turn them off if you wanted to, change the volume and turn off some and keep the others on (Great if you want to role-play) as one or more of the characters. \nUnfortunately, the SHIFT + TAB feature doesn\u2019t work as great, sometimes it opens, sometimes it doesn\u2019t and sometimes it would slow down the game as if it was going to lag or about to crash, not a pleasant experience. I would suggest just using ALT +TAB is you want to switch between the game itself and something like a group chat, this way the game doesn\u2019t get affect at all. This is VN, but for some reason idle FPS is usually around 25-30 FPS, I don\u2019t know why, but this value should be at 60 FPS, not 25-30 FPS. Not saying it doesn\u2019t reach 60 FPS, it does, but only when you are constantly reading, but even if you leave it idling for 5 seconds, it would dip down to 25 FPS at the lowest.\n\n[b]Price: 10/10[/b]\nJust look at my hours on this VN\u2026It costs \u00a330 and you can probably get it on sale for around \u00a320 or less if you\u2019re lucky. This is totally worth it, no doubts about that one. Took me 61 hours to finish ONE ROUTE, yes ONE ROUTE!! That should tell you a lot. So, if you are planning to finish all the routes, you\u2019ll definitely get your money\u2019s worth here. This is a must buy for the person out there willing to spend the time on reading all the chapters and finishing all the routes.\n\n[b]End of Review[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1454112504, "timestamp_updated": 1454112586, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 33, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.751272", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20803914": {"recommendationid": "20803914", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036316241", "num_games_owned": 558, "num_reviews": 304, "playtime_forever": 405, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458070999}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ud504\ub860\ud2b8\uc719\uc988\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\uc791\ud55c \uc57c\uac9c \uadf8\ub9ac\uc790\uc774\uc544\uc758 \uacfc\uc2e4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\uac8c\uc784\uc758 \uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc774\ub984\uc744 \ubc1c\uc74c\ud558\uae30 \uad49\uc7a5\ud788 \ud798\ub4e0 \ud559\uc6d0\uc5d0 \uc8fc\uc778\uacf5 \ubc0f \uc18c\uc218\uc758 \uc5ec\uc131 \uce90\ub9ad\ud130\uac00 \uc0dd\ud65c\uc744 \ud558\uba74\uc11c \ub9fa\uac8c \ub418\ub294 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8ec \uac8c\uc784\uc774\uba70 \uc8fc\uc778\uacf5 \ubc0f \uc5ec\uc131 \uce90\ub9ad\ud130\ub4e4\uc774 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \uacfc\uac70\uc758 \ud2b8\ub77c\uc6b0\ub9c8\ub97c \uc131\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0 \uad6c\uc6d0\uc744 \ubc1b\ub294\ub2e4\ub294 \ub0b4\uc6a9\uc758 \uac8c\uc784\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\ub2e4\ub9cc \uc2a4\ud300 \ubc84\uc83c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc131\uad00\uacc4 \uc7a5\uba74\uc774 \uc798\ub824\ub098\uac14\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ube44\ud310\uc744 \ubc1b\ub294 \ub4ef \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uac8c\uc784\uc758 \uba54\uc138\uc9c0\uc640 \uad00\ub828\uc9c0\uc5b4\uc11c \ud574\ub2f9 \ub0b4\uc6a9\uc758 \uc0ad\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uc11d\ud574\ubcf4\uc790\uba74 \uc800\ub97c \ube44\ub86f\ud574\uc11c \uc774\ub7f0 \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \uc990\uae30\ub294 \uc0ac\ub78c\uc740 \ub300\ub2e4\uc218\uac00 \ud3c9\uade0\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uae30\uc5d0 \uc801\uc808\ud55c \uc131\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uac8c \ub418\ub294 \ube44\uadf9\uc801\uc778 \uc0b6\uacfc \uc6b4\uba85\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub294\ub370 \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc131\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uad6c\uc6d0\uc744 \ubc1b\ub294\ub2e4\ub294 \ub0b4\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uacf5\uac10\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ubc18\ub300\ub85c \uc2e4\ub9dd\uc744 \ud558\uac8c \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uadf8\uac83\uc744 \uac10\uc548\ud55c \uc81c\uc791\uc9c4\uc774 \ud574\ub2f9 \uacc4\uce35\ub4e4\uc5d0\uac8c\ub3c4 \uba54\uc138\uc9c0\ub97c \uc804\ub2ec\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uacfc\uac10\ud558\uac8c \uc131\uad00\uacc4 \uc7a5\uba74\uc744 \ud3b8\uc9d1\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc131\uad00\uacc4 \uac00\ub2a5\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \uad6d\ud55c\ub41c \uad6c\uc6d0\uc758 \uba54\uc138\uc9c0 \uc804\ub2ec\uc774 \uc544\ub2cc \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc778\uac04\uc5d0\uac8c \ud3c9\ub4f1\ud558\uac8c \uad6c\uc6d0\uc744 \ubd80\uc5ec\ubc1b\uc744 \uac00\uce58\ub97c \uc120\uc0ac\ud55c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ud310\ub2e8\uc774 \ub418\ub294\ub370\n\n\ub530\ub77c\uc11c \ubaa8\ub450\uc5d0\uac8c \uad6c\uc6d0\uc758 \uae30\ud68c\ub97c \uc900 \uadf8\ub77c\uc790\uc774\uc544\uc758 \uacfc\uc2e4 \uc81c\uc791\uc9c4\uc758 \ubc30\ub824\uc640 \uc874\uc911, \uae30\uaebc\uc774 \uc720\uc77c\ud55c \ucee8\ud150\uce20\ub97c \uc790\ub978 \ud76c\uc0dd\uc740 \ub098\uc774\ud305\uac8c\uc77c\uacfc \ub3d9\uae09\uc758 \uacf5\ud5cc\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\uc815\ubc1b\uc544\uc57c \ub9c8\ub545\ud558\ub2e4\uace0 \uc0dd\uac01\ub418\uba70 \uadf8\ub9ac\uc790\uc774\uc544\uc758 \uacfc\uc2e4 \uc81c\uc791\uc9c4\uc774 \ub178\ubca8 \ud3c9\ud654\uc0c1\uc744 \uc218\uc0c1\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uc0ac\ub8cc\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "timestamp_created": 1453986097, "timestamp_updated": 1454404650, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 150, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569639", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20676080": {"recommendationid": "20676080", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005112979", "num_games_owned": 254, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 9474, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453908263}, "language": "english", "review": "TL:DR I *recommend* this game but not the steam version due to content cut in the Japanese version this is based on. \n\nFirst I'd like to say I have mixed feelings about the version here on steam. I got interested in this VN because of the anime. I  loved the humor that contrasted some pretty dark moments. That's not to say the VN here lacks that humor. It's just that the VN spends a lot more time with those dark elements. Overall its heavier than the anime. What does that have to do with the steam version? Some claim that in addition to the removal of the adult scenes that some of the more lewd humor was edited from the script. It's quite possible this happened even before it was translated. So I'm not pointing fingers. Just makes me wish I had bought the denpa version (which I will probably still buy since I do like this series).\n\nI honestly thought I wouldn't mind the cut adult scenes since the denpa version is censored anyways. But in hindsight I've come to realize that, lewd or not, cut content is lame. Seriously. The fade to blacks are jarring and you inevitably end up wondering what happened when the characters make subtle references after the fact. So, yeah, mosaics suck but cuts are worse, imo.\n\nThat all said its still a solid game with a lengthy story. I'd give this version a 6/10 (8/10 if it was the full version)\n\n+Good Art\n+Great story\n+Great humor at times\n+-There's one character just can't bring myself to like. On the other hand they have considerable depth despite some cliche trappings.\n+-Be ready for the onions\n+-Be prepared for some extended backstory flashbacks that get a little heavy handed when setting the mood. Like the writer wanted to be extra sure you got the intended tone.\n+-In general all the characters are well developed but I sometimes had to roll my eyes at the suspension of disbelief breaking extremes\n-Cut content (Cut in Japan)\n-Wish there was a little more variety to the soundtrack (the tracks aren't bad just got fatigued)\n-Wish MC was voiced. I know that's not common for VN's but in this case he's such a boss and I did see the anime first\n-Sadly there seems to still be some minor bugs/translation issues. I ran across a couple. The worst of which rendered a conversation's text and audio out of sync for quite a while.

Um ehrlich zu sein, bin ich aber auch froh dar\u00fcber, denn hier habe ich gemerkt, wie schwierig es sein w\u00fcrde, die verschiedenen Charaktere in einer deutschen Lokalisierung angemessen darzustellen, ohne dass sie etwas von ihrem Charme\nverlieren w\u00fcrden. Insgesamt ist die Vertonung aber sehr gut gelungen, wozu u.a. auch der Soundtrack z\u00e4hlt.\nZugegeben, manche Stimmen fangen nach einiger Zeit schon an, zu nerven.

This is an update after having finished the entire game. All five paths, all ten endings.\nHaving done that, I've gotta say. Holy shit, that was an incredible experience. Maybe, my expectations (tempered by the likes of Sakura Swim Club...ugh) had an effect on this, but... I literally ended up dropping everything else I was playing on PC at the time just to consume more of these narratives. I know that the localization of The Labyrinth of Grisaia is in progress and I'm very much excited for when it will come out.\n\nPros: \n-Since this is a VN, let's get the most important bit out of the way first. The writing in this game, while it takes it a bit to get started, is absolutely PHENOMENAL. Each of the character arcs is handled incredibly well. Each of the five characters are thought through and are very interesting character studies. Not to mention, the way the character personalities clash is often hilarious. It's to the extent that I've found myself contemplating some plot points or speculating about possible upcoming events while at work or on my commute.\n-On the note of writing, I've gotta give major props to the writers that handled the translation. The amount of vocabulary that I've learned from this game exceeds most natively english titles. There were even times when I saw a word, thought it was a typo, looked it up, and learned that it was an actual word. Well done. \n-This game doesn't fall into the pit trap of having copy/pasted narratives. Yes, there's some similar themes that happen on occasion, but I was pleased to see that each of the paths is basically unique and even each of the endings is distinctly different. \n-The voice actors have done an excellent job. While I, no longer, speak Japanese, but the emotion, intonation, and delivery have left me often just letting the VA finish the particular line before advancing to the next bit....and, that doesn't happen often, as I'm usually speeding through dialogue, not bothering to wait on the VA.\n-The music, while I feel that some of the loops could have been handled a bit better, otherwise, I have no complaints. Each individual track is fantastic, been pleasant enough to listen to, and I don't recall any of them having become grating, even after a multitude of repetitions.\n-The art in the game is superb. I won't even deny that a handful of scenes have made their way into my wallpapers collection.\n-Unexpectedly enough, there's also quite the collection of bonus material. I know that VNs commonly include their art and a few other things with them, but this is even more generous.\n\nA couple of other comments, though they are not exactly cons:\n-The way each of the routes is set up, once you branch off, what happened in the other route no longer exists. As a result of that, there were points where I couldn't help but feel a bit guilty choosing one option, knowing that I've avandoned the fate of a character in favor of another. That being said, I believe that this VN's character progressions would have suffered quite a bit if it was a \"help everyone\" type of story, so I'm not really complaining. Hell, it's not often that a narrative has left me to care this much for a character.\n-I've gotta mention the censorship. I've gotta give credit to Frontwing to having included additional content in the M-rated version to make up for the cut scenes, but... It does (apparently) have an effect on one of the character arcs and it's the matter of personal principle to note this. I suppose, at least, that's easily enough remedied if you desire to do so.\n\nTL;DR: All in all, though, it's been a marvelous and enjoyable experience (to the point of considering this to be the best VN I've consumed to date). I know that the $40 pricetag may seen intimidating, but if it'll help, I'll say this much. The first story arc I complete was Sachi's. In my opinion, even if the game had ended with just that, I'd still consider this to have been money well spent.

If you are concerned about the removal of adult scenes, you can get this game legally from denpasoft and you should do so if this is a deal-breaker.  Personally, I enjoy them being removed so long as it is not done awkwardly because I think it actually improves the flow and pace of the story.  With this game we still got all of the build-up and even some racy images leading to these scenes, so I was really glad the game did not just skirt around the issue or totally ignore that aspect of the romances.\n\nThe characters in this game, and one girl in particular (Amane) will stick with me for a long time.  Some of their stories connected with me more than others, but the ones that did were absolutely riveting and unforgettable.  There were moments I laughed out loud and times I cried.  I was genuinely rooting for every character, including the protagonist, who has a face in many scenes although he is not voiced.  His character, however, was very interesting...just as interesting and intriguing as the heroines and that is a real accomplishment in this type of game!\n\nIf I had any criticisms of the game, it would be that the beginning (the common route) is on the lengthy side.  I went into this game knowing almost nothing about it (and I recommend not spoiling ANYTHING), and I was really starting to wonder where the author was going with this game.  However, I did enjoy it...it was amazing for short half-hour sessions as the common route is broken up into distinct scenes that take place during different times of day, creating many amusing vignettes.  Once I got into the main routes, I would read for hours, dying to know what happened next.  It's almost like this was 2 games in one, since the way this game made me feel was so different between the common route (very long, very amusing) and the main routes (suspenseful, heartrending).\n\nIf you are still reading this by now...buy the game!

There is NO NUDITY unless you get some fan patch which adds the scenes, that being said its fine without it, \"that\" topic is suggested and you will know when its happened. the language isnt censored so its quite realistic in that sense.\n\nThis game is different to your standard VNs because firstly its extremely long, 29hours in and ive not finished even one of the five routes. Afterthat its got massive amounts of character building and best of all the protagonist has a personality and his own motivations, hes the kind of character that you would remember because he is on par with the other people in the game. \n\nOnce you get into the seperate routes you will notice that this isnt you standard \"everything is happy\" scenario, these six people have gone through extremely hard upbringing hence them being alone in this education facility. Those paths will slowly unveil themselves as you choose your various routes, it is possible to fail, it is possible to stay neutral or die or get someone killed. This can be a complete slap in the face if it wants to be. \n\nAll in all though a single playthrough is estimated around 25-35 depending on the speed you read at and add 10 hours for each route. There is massive amounts of content here, all in all its one of my favourite visual novels so i can't recommend it enough.

Most of the VNs available there are rather geared towards heavy fan-service (not to say Grisaia has none) and usually aren't really good overall when compared to other ones - as can be seen from their score on VNDB (Visual Novel Database).\n\nThat being said Grisaia is one of the few exception, hopefully soon to be joined by Muv Luv as well. The story is entertaining, you easily get attached to the characters and for once the protagonist isn't your typical blank canvas - if anything he is very un-japanese in his behavior, which is a breath of fresh air in a Visual Novel. \n\nFor those who don't know what a Visual Novel is, it's fairly simple. Just imagine reading a book, with images and music to set the mood and atmosphere. On top of that, sprinkle a few choices you can make as a reader to turn the story towards what you want it to become. Note that in most Visual Novels, different routes are drastically different from one another (it isn't an \"illusion of choice\" like in The Walking Dead for instance).\n\nGrisaia has no 'true ending' per se, and each route (5 of them) all have their own story attached to it. If one of the character doesn't interest you, there is no need to read her route. Just choose what you want to see, and enjoy the story.\n\nNote: For those worried about the H-content being removed from the Steam version, I only played this version of Grisaia and didn't feel like anything was 'missing' - the story still flowed fairly naturally, and you still get plenty of lewd jokes (Amane, Sachi, please...). However, if you are really adamant about playing the original version, than Steam might not be the right place. \n\nHave fun reading!", "timestamp_created": 1451423681, "timestamp_updated": 1451424224, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526316", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20056864": {"recommendationid": "20056864", "author": {"steamid": "76561198192476234", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459854052}, "language": "english", "review": "I recommend the game for people who likes to enjoy experiencing different kinds of unique people out there , and their journey .

Yes, there are choices but they are very few compared to other choice-based storytelling games, you should expect to read a lot of throughout the game. Expecting otherwise will probably leave you disappointed, if you don't like reading you should turn back, because The Fruit of Grisaia has A LOT of reading. It's admittedly a different experience from reading a book (the BGM, voices, and illustrations help guide you on the atmosphere and the appearances/emotions of the characters rather than just leaving it up to your imagination), but you shouldn't buy this game if you hate reading.\n\n* (If you don't want to read the long paragraphs of text you can skip to the short paragraph at the end for a summary)\n____\n\nMoving on, The Fruit of Grisaia is a standard visual novel, with choices that lead you to different routes that each focus on six different heroines. It's pretty lengthy and depending on your reading speed, it will probably take you somewhere around 60-85 hours to go through everything. Despite it's length however, there's a great attention to detail throughout Grisaia. An off-hand remark in one route becomes something the character actually does in another route, and the storywriters took great care in interwining each route indirectly with each other. The other thing is that all of the main heroines in Grisaia have background and purpose behind their characters. What might seem like a silly anime trope has a deeper and perhaps darker backstory behind it.\n\nEven if the characters started out as simple archetypes, they sure don't now. Everything the characters do has some explained reasoning for it, and again you can see that the writers took a lot of careful detail in weaving the character's backstory with their personality and actions.  And again, despite the fact that there's thousands upon thousands of lines of text, the story for each route is quite diverse. I was surprised at how the seriousness and setting could change within each route, and it's nice to see that the routes for each heroine have their own little slice at all the different atmospheres and backgrounds a story can possess. The other thing I enjoyed was the fact that throughout learning each heroine's backstory, you also learn more about the past of the main character, Yuuji, and his personality as well.\n\nIt's something of an intricate puzzle piece, where all the different parts of Yuuji's past and personality connect across all routes, and over the course of the game you learn more and more about him. In addition to the diverse storytelling is that the writers of the story aren't afraid to pull their punches. Each route has a bad and a good ending, and even though you know that there's a better alternative ending, you can't help but be surprised, or even disturbed about the endings that just happened. Some of them can be absolutely brutal, and others can be lighter and less emotional.\n\n____\n* Short Version\n\nTo put it all succinctly, the Fruit of Grisaia is an absolutely enthralling and intersting visual novel with a diverse set of characters and storytelling and prose that is enrapturing in it's own way. The writing isn't afraid to hit you with a few punches, and the amount of detail that goes into crafting each route and character is amazing to say the least. This game is fantastic, and is worth every penny (for me at least). \n\n\nIf you're on the fence about whether or not you'll enjoy the game, you may want to watch a couple episodes of the anime adapation (I wouldn't watch more than 3, otherwise you'll be spoiled a bit) which will help you get a feel for the writing style of the game. It doesn't really showcase everything, but it should give you an idea of whether or not you'll enjoy the game (but don't judge the game solely by the anime, it doesn't really do the VN justice). If you have watched the anime before and enjoyed it, buy this as well. The anime doesn't really do the game complete justice, and although I watched the anime prior to playing the VN, I still found myself surprised at the turns the story took.", "timestamp_created": 1450992121, "timestamp_updated": 1450992121, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19918366": {"recommendationid": "19918366", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012125842", "num_games_owned": 832, "num_reviews": 115, "playtime_forever": 825, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495832168}, "language": "english", "review": "Buy Unrated Version on denpasoft \nIt is  a great novel but a lot is censored (language etc).\nunrated is justice", "timestamp_created": 1450988437, "timestamp_updated": 1450988437, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 235, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.791744", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19917874": {"recommendationid": "19917874", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081087814", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2694, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468692600}, "language": "english", "review": "My personal best VN / Bishoujo Games out in the steam are per June 22nd 2017.\nIt is the First out of 3 Grisaia Series.\nYou are a transfer student going to Mihama Academy, the specialized private school for troubled and unique individuals. You along with other 5 girls are the with live a [i]normal? [/i] school life. and so you thought..\n\n[h1]Pros / Good points [/h1]\n\n[b]Story[/b]\n-The main story is one of the most eloborate main story out there. All the characters are fleshed out on the main story including Yuuji , the main protaganist. As for the girls route, expect some heavy scene and well written story that would definitely touch your heart.\n\n[b]Characters[/b]\n- Even though for the first Trilogy, it has little cast of characters, they are all well written, unique and have their own unique personality. Not to mention all 5 girls and main protaganist they all have their own inner conflicts to be faced. It is so hard to find a VN that not only focus on the girls, but the main protaganist character development too.\n\n[b]Soundtracks. [/b]\n-Grisaia Trilogy have one of the best OST out there. It blends perfectly with the story and the scenes. I can only think of Clannad that can out match this one.\n\n[b]Graphics and Optimization [/b]\n-The graphic looks amazing. Scenes and character are drawn perfectly compliments with a good optimization that supports up to 1080p.\n\n[b]Dollars per hour[/b]\n-Expect some lack of sunlights.

In the end you must together with main heroine ( of your choosing ) overcome the hardships of traumatic pasts and find a solution.\nAll I can say that every route has a very detailed story and can be very emotional ( depends on which type of peson you are ). All of the characters are well developed and you will come to care for all of them ( of course there will be one special character which will be your favorite in which I would suggest to do her route last ).\n\nGameplay : Mostly you are gonna read... alot, no joke here I spent 100+ hours on reading every route and every ending ( of course I did a mistake with the common route so the time to actually be needed to read will be for 70+ ).\nThere will be only 5 choices in every route ( actually 3 of them are common route the other 2 are in which you chose a girl and which ending you will get ). So in other words only those who love visual novels will enjoy this.\n\nSound : Amazing simply amazing. from the voice acting to the soundtracks and even to the sound effects everything was simply perfect, indeed added the right atmosphere from funny,happy,amusing,sad,anger,horror everything was simply perfect in that retrospect.\n\nBugs : none to be had... seriously its hard to do those in those kind of games\n\nGraphics : Those who like anime style will like the graphics here even though its just a couple of pictures and maybe a few animations.\n\nSummary : This game is simply like a book, amazing characters, great atmosphere, brilliant storytelling, and of course a great deal of time will be spent so its well worth the money.\nI can't spoil to much if you want to enjoy so I can't add to much detail to the plot ( and since the game is all about the plot I can't add anymore information ). But I will suggest to all of you do to the following routes in this order :\nMichiru > Yumiko > Sachi > Makina > Amane ( this is how I did the routes ) of course as I wrote before I would suggest to do your favorite girl as the last route ( and since Amane was mine favorite I did her route last )\nOverall I'll give this game a 9\\10 ( Only because I didn't cried from every route )", "timestamp_created": 1443471499, "timestamp_updated": 1443471508, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18234610": {"recommendationid": "18234610", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983032086", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1944, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443441661}, "language": "english", "review": "There are plenty reviews for this, so my two cents aren't really needed, but all the same.\nPersonally, I've only played this - as of this writing - through one character story to it's end(s), but I'd say the story and characters to this 'game' are wonderfully made. While it certainly has it's own fair share of silly and ridiculous moments, it also hits you with a surprising level of emotional character depth, development, and progression. Like other reviewers have noted: it can be kinda heavy if you're able to get into the story and characters in it.\nMy only regret after having finished one character path is I don't know if I can handle doing it again to try another character - I kind of feel attached to the one path I did follow and I don't know if I can really see it playing out any other way. That said, it's more like reading a book than playing any conventional game - as is typical of this genre. While the visuals it gives you are decidedly nice and well-made, don't go into this expecting to have fun perverted adventure unless you're still a teenager and... easily... roused. But if you enjoy reading a story that's equal parts comical, ridiculous, highly suggestive, and emotionally potent... I can't think of a better conduit to get your fix.

Keep this in mind as you read my review. This is going to be as spoiler free as I can make it.\n\nThe Fruit of Grisaia (Grisaia no Kajitsu) is more or less a picture book about a battle-hardened child soldier attempting to return to a normal life. I'm sure most people are thinking the same thing I was, \"If I wanted to spend $30 on a book, I'd want a physical copy and it better be good.\" Well, while the former isn't possible, the latter is completely true. VN games always turned me off, before; lack of action, lack of many choices, pure focus on story, lots of reasons that I'm sure many people share. Despite all the reasons for not wanting this game, I found myself returning to the store page every now and then. I finally managed to grab it for around $12, and I feel like I ripped off the developer. This game is well worth the full price, and probably over. Just about every character, no matter how minor a part they play, has a personality. You either hate a character, like a character, or love a character - and not always for good reasons. The 5 classmates - Yumiko, Makina, Amane, Sachi, and Michiru - are all perfectly unique. There's almost no \"copy/paste\" idea present. The interactions between characters seem extremely natural, as well. I refrained from writing a review until I had finished every route the game had(other than the bad routes), and I found it harder and harder to do that as I progressed. Despite the circumstances of each of the characters, you can relate to every single one of them. I often found myself caught off guard when a character said \"Yuuji\", because I was so engrossed in the story that I had actually assumed the role of the main character. The replay value is pretty decent, as well. I'd love to travel through this story once more. The scenes often invoke emotions you can't imagine; I laughed at the most ridiculous things, I cried when things happened, I even felt myself worrying about the characters. By playing through the dating routes, I realized a common theme is that none of the bad stuff would've happened if Yuuji(you) hadn't showed up or made the choice to interfere. That caused a feeling of hopelessness and self-doubt in me, as well. That being said, I highly recommend playing through every girl's route. You learn more about not only the girls, but Yuuji as well. As you learn more about the circumstances for each girl being there, you learn about Yuuji's own past; a past he keeps hidden away. If you don't find the emotional aspect convincing enough, this game teaches practical knowledge, as well. I learned self-defense techniques, how to deal with women, and survival and cooking skills, to name a few. I can't remember the last time I learned something I could use in everyday life from a video game, aside from a profound lesson on human nature or a phylisophical idea. I'm currently letting my little brother play through himself, and he is the typical \"COD AKSHUN POW POW GUN FIRE GIT GUD SKRUB\" gamer. He loves it so much I had to threaten to take the computer away in order to write this review. I also plan on buying a couple copies for my close friends, and sharing this experience with them. I have fallen in love with this game, and it has sparked an interest within me for other VN's. If you see a Visual Novel in my library, it's because of Fruit of Grisaia.\n\nTL;DR: 10/10 Would buy full price. Get this game.

The vn is the first of three popular visual novels in Japan that are planned to be brought to the west. My playthrough including every ending took me 60 hours with me reading at a fairly leisurely pace, so there is a fair amount of content to keep you satisfied. Unfortunately, as you can expect, sex scenes were cut for the steam release but there is an uncensored version and I'm sure you can figure out how to read the vn uncensored if you care about it enough to, I personally found it great even without them.\n\n        The main cast of girls have a good spread of personalities, each with a bit more depth than it might first appear.\nIn the most basic terms, there is a fun loving imouto type character, a caring if lecherous onee-san type, a maid who obeys any request, a borderline shut in who might be a bit on the paranoid side and a genius comperable to Cirno who tries her best to be a tsundere. The mc and side characters are also good, and help keep every hour you are reading enjoyable even during early segments that build atmosphere and character relationships through slice of life.\n\n         While Grisaia is mostly slice of life every main girl has a hefty load of problems that they will have to deal with in their route and some of it can get fairly dicey. The vn has a great balance of serious tone and enjoyable every day life to it that can make you very attached to the characters and involved in what happens to them later on in the vn.\nTLDR: If you are looking for a vn on steam, you can be sure that Grisaia is probably some of the best steam has to offer. It is a little pricy for some, but if you can catch it on sale I would definately reccomend buying it if you are interested.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1442589659, "timestamp_updated": 1442589659, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18077261": {"recommendationid": "18077261", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068445882", "num_games_owned": 392, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2572, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471712491}, "language": "english", "review": "The Fruit of Grisaia is a masterpeice I have only just finished one of the endings and it made me feel more than I am capable of feeling.

Very much worth it at full price, although I'd still say try and snag it when it's on sale - as I think the 18+ version denpasoft might be better, as it keeps the full story intact from what I'm told. (( Even if they mostly just took out the sex scenes; still never a fan of a good read being messed with. ))\n\n\n+ Pros +\n\n- Very long read ( Clocked in nearly sixty hours total. Fifty or slightly less if you're a very fast reader or skim some of the basic parts of the VN. )\n- Each girl has a great story to tell.\n- Main Character is great as well, with a story you'll want to know more of as time goes on.\n- Great soundtrack\n- A GREAT deal of voice acting. (( Granted it's in Japanese ))\n- You'll come to care for each girl over time, along with caring for the MC, Yuuji. (( Holy shit, his way of thinking cracks me up at times. ))\n- Each route has two different endings, offering around ten endings or so.\n- A emotional roller coaster, that will make you laugh, smile, sad, and even at times feel tense.\n- Many of the cliches you'd come to expect in 'anime like' settings are not present. Such as how the MC reacts to the girls and how they at times react to him.\n- After reading each route, get nifty stuff to download; voice clips, wallpaper, icons, and some nice pictures!\n\n\n-- Cons --\n\n-  Very little in terms of choice picking; you have about two or less per route. About a dozen or less choices if I recall correctly.\n- One of the endings feels. . .\"ill-fitting\" compared to the rest, but still good. Take it with an open mind.\n- Opening Video somewhat spoils key points, if you pay close attention or keep rewatching it.\n- No english voice acting, it's only in Japanese. (( May not be a con for some, but do wish there was more, as I feel the voice acting would connect with me more, if it was in english. ))\n- Due to this being the All-Age version, several scenes were taken out. Mostly the sex scenes, along with some parts of the game being 'toned down' just a bit, due to being consider 'too mature'. Shouldn't effect the reading, but I still greatly dislike something being messed with. (( Sometimes you might even miss the fact they had sex, which for one or two scenes can change your view on what's going on. ))\n\n\n+- Other Notes -+\n\n- The steam version, while not 18+, does offer a number of artwork not in the first version of the VN.\n- Being in fullscreen and trying to Shift + Tab on steam wasn't a wise idea, as it seems the VN struggles to work with steam on that aspect. Nothing too bad, but somewhat buggy to deal with. May just be me.\n- I'd highly suggest reading the story in a certain manner, via playing through the list below, as it feels the best reading wise, along with not effecting your view points of the others if read in another manner;\n\n* Michiru > Yumiko > Sachi > Amane > Makina\n\nNOTE: You can still do the routes in any order you wish, and it may not effect you much if you decide to choose. . .Amane first, or Michiru last. This is just my view and how I read through it, when suggested by another. The pacing felt right, and by doing this you also slowly learn more about a certain character; in a way that feels well paced and enjoyable.\n\n\nIn the end? Yes, I'd say get this VN ASAP if you're looking for a damn good read. Although I'd say get the steam version only if it's on sale, while getting the full version on denpasoft's website.

So let's get this review going. This game is a \"Visual Novel,\" meaning that there's really nothing in the gameplay department apart from making a few choices at certain plot-relevant crossroads, but gameplay isn't what we're here for, this genre is all about the story, so what sets this apart from others in the genre? (list of differences to the non-steam version at the end)\n\nThe first thing that catches my eye is that instead of a bland, everyman, blank-slate protagonist like a large portion of visual novels, we get Kazami Yuuji, an unsociable, military-raised teenager not so different from Sagara Sousuke (for anyone who has watched Full Metal Panic). Yuuji is blunt and a bit bad with handling personal relationships, but I honestly have to say that he's a great guy; he is incredibly capable and very rarely does anything negative without a good reason. Our supporting characters are also very unique and each play off of Yuuji and each other in very entertaining ways (though I will freely admit that Makina can get on my nerves). Here's a quick overview of the other students while keeping spoilers to a minimum (skip a paragraph if you don't want to see):\nMakina: Girl with stunted growth and childish tendancies. Ends up picking up a lot of bad habits and harsh language from Amane and Yuuji.\nAmane: Well-developed body and lots of erotic teasing made towards Yuuji. Very maternal and watches over Makina carefully. Also seems to want to take care of the socially-hopeless Yuuji.\nMichiru: Girl who is outright stated to be purposefully attempting to fall into the \"Tsundere\" archetype, but more often than not ends up looking like nothing more than a contrarian idiot who's the butt of most of the jokes around the dorm.\nSachi: Highly devoted girl who will listen to any order given to her. Often goes around wearing a maid uniform do to an offhand comment about it suiting her getting mistaken as an order (not an uncommon occurence). Has some obvious issues with common sense and flexible thinking.\nYumiko: Aloof and introverted, but has some violent tendancies when annoyed or threatened. Despite this, she is probably the most reliable of the group for tough conversations (if you exclude Yuuji since we're kind of playing as him)\n\nThe aforementioned choices in the game will lead you down the character arcs of different heroines depending on what you choose, though this game makes it pretty easy to get to your favorite heroine since there are very few choices in the game and the ones that actually matter are essentially \"Go down this girl's route right now or continue the main route until we give you another choice.\" Ostensibly, each girl has one more choice leading you to the bad end or the good end, though I'll be honest and say that I can't agree that every girl's endings split into those two categories [spoiler]more specifically, one girl's endings would be better described as bad/worse while another has good/better[/spoiler]. Every heroine (Yuuji as well) has some sort of emotional baggage holding them down which got them put into this school to begin with; needless to say, if you go into a route and get details about these incidents, you can get drawn into some seriously heart-wrenching moments of fear, depression, desparation, and rejection as you relive the most painful moments of someone's past.\n\nHaving just replayed the Matsushima Michiru route in celebration of getting my hands on the steam release, I will freely admit I was brought to tears multiple times despite knowing everything that was going to be said, and this girl's route probably wouldn't be considered heaviest of the tragedies presented here (though, paraphrasing some words from the game, \"You can't really compare two tragedies to each other,\" so I feel a bit bad trying to order the routes by tragic-ness). I look forward to replaying my favorite two routes next. As a side note, knowing the characters issues in advance actually explains a few strange moments that I hadn't noticed the first time around, so the replay was quite worth it.\n\nAs promised, I will list out the differences I've noticed between this and the non-steam release. First off, this is absolutely the exact same translation that was provided in the original version (not that this will surprise anyone who knows what a pain translating a game can be). Though I noticed that there don't seem to be translation notes popping up in the corners anymore, so either those got removed or I missed the option to toggle them. Also, on the steam page, you might notice some CG that weren't in the original game; there's a fair number of those scattered throughout the game. Anyway, next up, Steam doesn't like erotic content, so the intercourse scenes have been removed. Judging by the routes I've replayed so far, usually this is just taking a hacksaw to the scene, cuting out the part of the game with erotic CG/descriptions, and skipping to the conversation afterward (leaving a very awkward transition), but sometimes they change the scene slightly and toss in a new CG to make the transition slightly less abrupt, turning it into a chaste, heartwarming moment as opposed to a lustful one. There are also some other changes to the non-heroine moments, like a certain flashback scene involving the captain of Amane's old club in middle school being changed to be less suggestive. Some of the other changes: There was some nudity in the original version besides the erotic scenes, such as when some \"girl-talk\" was happening in the bath, so the character sprites were changed slightly to cover the naughty bits with soap. Also, some scenes got cut in places, but were removed so subtly that I didn't even notice until I went back and looked at a CG set for the original game (Michiru and Sachi building sand...stuff on the beach got drastically shortened, but I didn't even notice until I realized I never saw the CG of Michiru being burid in the sand (This review has ended up mentioning her quite a lot, hasn't it)). This all being said, they kept a very large amount of content in the game. For example, stuff like Amane standing around in Yuuji's room in her underwear ended up making it passed the censor stick, and if that made it by unscathed, I highly doubt they made many big cuts besides the one beach scene that I happened to remember.\n\nConclusion: Hilarious characters, engaging story, and fun to replay despite (and/or because of) knowing the plot. Easily a massive thumbs up from me. I really want to play the two sequel games, but the complicated language used in this game is making my doubt my Japanese is fluent enough for the task, so I might have to wait until the others get translated...that or watch the anime versions for the condensed story.", "timestamp_created": 1441597250, "timestamp_updated": 1442386703, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17860855": {"recommendationid": "17860855", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138374517", "num_games_owned": 1075, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 359, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1447580680}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u51b7\u996d\u8fd9\u4e48\u8d35\uff0c\u8fd8\u6ca1\u80cc\u666f\uff0c\u4f60\u4eec\u65e5\u5446\u771f\u50bb\uff0c\u7adf\u7136\u4e70\u8fd9\u4e2a\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1441280956, "timestamp_updated": 1441280956, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.447851", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17855734": {"recommendationid": "17855734", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023591911", "num_games_owned": 359, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 3389, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1447378452}, "language": "english", "review": "$20 for Grisaia is a steal.

As you can see, I have put a lot of hours into it, so, thats good proof that its worth it. \n\nThis is the first of three visual novels made by Front Wing and released by Sekai Project. Hopefully soon the next two will be released on Steam.\n\nI have experienced many visual novels, and this would be one of my favourites of all.

If not my favorite for now.\nI related a lot to the main character: being somewhat without any purpose in life, cynical, detached from everything. Even if he somewhat lack of social skills, and how to deal with these girls.\nAbout the girls: they seemed to have a rich background and interesting personalities. \n\nThis visual novel is very humor oriented, and it's true that's sometimes it becomes annoying. But besides that, the story is very well written, with a touch of poesy and vivid descriptions of sensory experiences.\n\nThe art style is awesome, there's a lot of different interactions and illustrations for a visual novel. Some music are awesome, and some are somewhat mediocre. So I'm a bit reserved about it.\n\nBut the quality of the dialogues, and interactions between characters are absolutely awesome. I think that I will rarely found such quality elsewhere.\n\n(I've only finished one path, but there wasn't any explicit erotic scene, and I must admit that it is better that way. I prefer when this type of content is implicit. I've not done all paths though.)\n\nWhat can I add? The beginning can look long, but in the end it's worth it. The story is growing like a flower, slowly but it is beautiful. Full of intelligence and humor. The author have a lot of imagination, and shows us that even happiness can be reached with such anodyne things in life. And that we can understand each point of view, because if someone behave a certain way, there is a reason to such a behavior.\n\nThe price is certainly what makes me buy it, because I was really surprised that a VN could be so expensive.

Definitely a great mix of comedy, drama and romance!\"[/b][/i]\n\n     The Fruit of Grisaia is the first of the Grisaia Trilogy. The Fruit of Grisaia is a visual novel where you take the role of transfer student, Kazami Yuuji as he enters Mihama Academy and hopes for an \"ordinary\" school life. As the story progresses, you will come upon the 5 heroines of the novel namely: Sakaki Yumiko, Suou Amane, Komine Sachi, Matsushima Michiru and Irisu Makina. Each heroine has their own unique story and personality.\n\n    As said by most players, this is a very long visual novel with a lineup of up to 32 scenes/chapters on the common route alone excluding the around 17+ scenes/chapters for the heroine's actual arc. The price of the game is well worth it because aside from its very long content, it also features the whole CG Gallery, Scene Replay and Music Collection unlike other Visual Novels in Steam where the CG Gallery and other features are removed from the actual VN. I finished this Visual Novel by around 50+ hours. After finishing one of the 5 arcs, you'll also unlock a Secret feature but I'll let you see it for yourself once you get your own copy of The Fruit of Grisaia.\n\n   I recommend this game to big fans of visual novels. This ain't for you if you can't stand to read a lot of content because this is really a very long novel. The content of the novel is very well written and packs quite a lot of humor. Each chapter/scene, whether its a common route or a heroine's arc, is very much worth every minute of your time. From the cuteness of Yumiko to Michiru's clumsiness, the novel will give you quite a feel of watching an actual anime episode. If you're looking for some humor with a mix of drama and feels, this is one of Steam's best Visual Novel available! If you don't believe me, then see and feel it for yourself!\n\n[h1]My Personal Rating:[/h1]\nStory/Plot: 10/10\nMusic: 10/10\nGraphics: 9/10\nCharacters: 9/10\n\nOverall: 9.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1438324617, "timestamp_updated": 1452169181, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 55, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.828652", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17298723": {"recommendationid": "17298723", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076724845", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7686, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451302091}, "language": "english", "review": "I also watched the anime and I found it pretty interesting, but this is just too much for a mortal like me.

This novel had me laughing, tense, and crying all through, this is in my opinion one of the greatest purchases i have ever made, ive only done the Amane ending and to be honest that was the ending i was eyeing for when i started reading and heard that there were multiple endings for each girl. My heart is rarely ever touched and shedding tears does not come easy for me but this novel really grabbed me. After reading i felt like it had changed me in the end, i felt the need to re-invent myself and find my own way and never give up, during reading i noticed that me and yuuji were the same though our circumstances were different, i sat here with a life with a unclear purpose and desired something to protect as well as yuuji, and after reading this novel it awoken something inside me and ill never forget this experience. im writing all this deep thoughts more for me than really for a review, and i know that i cant give up and ill find my prupose somewhere as yuuji did.\n\nPROS:\nthe novel presents several choices (not much at all), took me 15 hours of reading to find the first one, these choices, though may seem unnessecary at first actually lead you down the ending for 1 of the 5 girls, going on my instincts my choices led me to the amane ending and i dont regret my choices in the slightest, in fact im damn proud of it.\n\nCONS:\ni dont have much in terms of cons that arent biased, for example when i was doing the amane route and i had to read the long diary that took me a good 8 hours to get through and the ending of the diary was already know before you even started so i was generally uninterested in the whole thing and got pretty tired of reading it.\n\nSUMMARY:\nthis novel is absolutly beautiful and i encourage others who are fans of anime related novels, romance novels, and gut twister novels, to give this one a look, espically if youre someone like me who have a strong sense to protect people you care about or purpose seekers, you will NOT regret reading this, i promise you, and if you thought otherwise you have the freedom to message me on here and slap this review back in my face, but i absolutly stand by on what i just typed down.", "timestamp_created": 1437338785, "timestamp_updated": 1437338785, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552562", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17118397": {"recommendationid": "17118397", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971532050", "num_games_owned": 688, "num_reviews": 209, "playtime_forever": 177, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448668483}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]*I played through all of the game with an offline version of the game*[/h1]\n\nFruit of Grisaia is a visual NOVEL not a dating sim; you will be reading for hours before you make your first choice and another hour before you make your second choice. The story is a long and rambling account of a strange guy going to an obscure school of only five weird female students. Yes the setup is absurd, but Fruit of Grisaia knows it and goes with it.\n\nAs a novel I have to say how good the writing is since it is often thought provoking and emotionally touching. The problem is that those good moments are amongst a sea of silly-stupid encounters with those girls. That sillyness is fine if you like over-the-top Japanese cutesy schtick, but it's incredibly annoying if you don't. All the girls are to some degree frustrating-annoying with the Micharu girl being way off the scale. Michiru is so bad she is obnoxious. Makina is annoying but you later learn about her inner demons and why she is who she is. In fact, all of the main characters have their backstories developed wonderfully. Every character has their own genuine motives, wow. Micharu is still a pain in the ass. \n\nOther than the story: the art is lovely and each of the characters can be individually muted. Use the scroll wheel down to advance the story.\n\nOverall I admit I like Fruit of Grisaia.

I enjoyed what I saw, but I felt like too much was missing from the original novel. I wanted more.\n\nI came to this visual novel expecting a funny, lighthearted at times experience complemented with jokes that could make anyone laugh, but also deathly serious in some situations. I expected each character to just come across as another archetype in different circumstances.\n\nTwo endings in (Michiru and Yumiko), and I have realized how gravely I had underscored this novel.\n\nFrom tackling powerful topics, such as depression and suicide, and giving each character a truly memorable personality, Grisaia no Kajitsu is without a doubt an experience unlike any other. The ways that each character embrace their \"unusual\" circumstances are worthy of earnest praise and commendation, and every victory and defeat that affects them affects the player just as much.\n\nSome people will equate this game as simply another eroge in the market and will lament that this is \"the censored shell of the original\", but perhaps it is because of the removal of the h-scenes that allows one to appreciate the story behind those acts of affection. To simply read through this game to alleviate one's desires would be a massive disrespect to the true nature of this novel, in my opinion.\n\nThe Fruit of Grisaia is an experience like no other. Time and again, I have been truly awed by the thoughtfulness of the plot behind each route, and the execution of the plot to make almost every action feel unquestionably real (even though sometimes the \"actions\" done are beyond reality.

I was expecting writing up with the likes of Clannad and Little Busters.\n\nThat being said, it's still very good. I would say the character routes are, in fact, more intriguing and in-depth than the character routes from aforementioned visual novels by far.\n\nFirst off, this visual novel does not have a true ending. The story leads somewhere entirely different based on which girl's route you choose. This is a very character-oriented visual novel. \n\nSecond, this visual novel does not have a lot of choice-making. The choices you have to make are pretty much limited to route branches and good/bad endings. While this is not a negative thing during the characters' routes, it could possibly have some impact on the very long common route if you are a person who would like to branch off into a character's route as soon as possible, or like to re-read parts of the common route and see what would happen if you made a different choice.\n\nThird, the soundtrack is very good. Some visual novels tend to have a pretty forgettable soundtrack with the exception of a few major tracks (I'm looking at you, Sharin no Kuni, Himawari no Shoujo), but that is not the case with this one. It's one of those soundtracks where it's easy to hear that it belongs to The Fruit of Grisaia.\n\nFourth and last, the artwork is very pretty. The backgrounds and the CG are top quality. Couldn't ask for any improvements on those. After you complete a girls route you even unlock system voices, icons, and desktop wallpapers related to that character.\n\nMakina is best character na no yo sa", "timestamp_created": 1434280154, "timestamp_updated": 1434280154, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 64, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.828310", "comment_count": "21", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16377904": {"recommendationid": "16377904", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082398403", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1440373753}, "language": "english", "review": "I just did one route and it took 30 hours (9 hours of it were offline) and holy it was amazing.

What surprises me is that there is a slight difference in the games so far, nothing to claim it a horrible remake but enough for me to realize the difference. It could be that the english patch was just a fan made version (totally plausible) or they decided to spruce it up in this remake but i digress.\n\nI completed the non steam version 100% and i have to say that this is one of the best visual novels out there. The story at first seems nice and the charecters are cool but it the further you delve into the game the more story you get. Each of the girl charecters is unique with a brilliant back story that turns into a magnificent work of art and each story you complete the more is revealed on the protaganists story. While this game is beautiful it also is able to realy pull on your heart strings if you give into the game. If you have watched the anime and then play this game you will realize how much has been stripped from the anime so that they could air it in just one season. Also, if you try and base the routes off of what was on the anime you will probably have a rough time. Im not 100% sure if the earlier on choices have much of an impact to the game in the long run but deffinently give it an intresting change for the moment. While the steam page claims it takes 50-80 hours to complete it actually is a lot longer because those 50-80 hours are for one route and there are a total of five routes. Speaking of which, if you happen to get the good ending the first time dont be affraid to go back and choose the bad ending. They generally have quite the spin of events on the story. Overall, this game is amazing and if you have 40 bucks (or less, you know the sales steam have) this is anything but a waste of time.

I don't play Visual Novels, and I actively dislike most of Japanese entertainment offerings from games to anime and manga.  So this review is from someone who is not in to this whole scene. I have also read the fan translated version, so my hours in this one don't actually reflect the true hours I've spent on this story. \n\nOne note, this is the \"no p0rn\" version of the VN, and personally I think it only improves the story. The sex in the fan translated was mostly gratuitous and didn't really add anything useful to the story. I haven't played the story enough to say whether the censorship affected some of the jokes, however. Which would be a shame, because the adult jokes were often quite funny. But the sex scenes were useless. I'll have to get back to you about that.\n\nFor some reason, I just love this \"book\". It starts as a pure fluff comedy slice of life kind of thing, with slightly mysterious subtext. It helps to be aware of the Japanese stereotypes of \"kuudere\" and \"tsundere\", etc. for certain jokes. And make no mistake, there are a lot of jokes in this story. \n\nYou'll be laughing with tears in your eyes.\n\nThe game starts with a \"common route\" where you make some fairly insignificant choices, and then finally you choose the girl you will be pursuing. Yes, the whole game is basically a romance, with the twist of all characters (including protagonist) being emotionally unstable and having usually huge psychological problems.\n\nThe game also makes a huge genre shift about 6 hours in, once you're done with the common route. The common route is absolutely hilarious comedy, the story then starts to slowly turn more serious and with less humor. Until you will be crying, and this time not because of laughter.\n\nHowever, if you make right choices, you will be graced with a good ending, so there is always light at the end of the tunnel. Just warning you that there will be a lot of drama and it all will look very bleak.\n\nThere's only two dark spots on the VN and the main one is the presence of a loli. That is to say, the Makina route, which (should) give the creeps for anyone who isn't in to little girls. Yes, technically she's not much younger than Yuuji (the protagonist) but the route even plays up her youthful appearance. So, yes, it's disturbing. My advice for those who find  lolis as disturbing phenomenon as I do, is to buy and play the VN but just... well, when Makina gives you money, refuse.\n\nThe second, but more of a minor problem, is the Michiru route. Because that sorely tests your suspension of disbelief. The premise of the whole route. The core of the issue... It's just pure and unadultered fantasy magic. But if you can swallow that, it's fine and often quite funny.\n\nAmong the best parts of the whole story is the protagonist Yuuji who is both a sarcastic badass, and hilariously unable to understand normal life.", "timestamp_created": 1433584997, "timestamp_updated": 1433584997, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16218730": {"recommendationid": "16218730", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006714408", "num_games_owned": 234, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 2804, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468963331}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 Would watch Tunafish Man again.\n\nbut seriously, the emotional joy I experienced going through the game and reaching the \"good\" ending is possibly greater than a young me several years ago finding out that  Kraft Dinner exists.", "timestamp_created": 1433576191, "timestamp_updated": 1434946966, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 45, "weighted_vote_score": "0.708010", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16207266": {"recommendationid": "16207266", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132436122", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1433522614}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5582\u5582\u5582\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u6211\u73a9\u5b8c\u4e86\u7531\u7f8e\u5b50\u7ebf\u5b8c\u4e86\uff0c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8fde\u4e2aH SCENE\u90fd\u6ca1\u6709\uff1f\n\u8fd940\u7f8e\u5200\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\u7adf\u7136\u662f\u5168\u5e74\u9f84\u7248\uff1f\n\u5197\u8ac7\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\uff1f", "timestamp_created": 1433522281, "timestamp_updated": 1433522281, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16182297": {"recommendationid": "16182297", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078150731", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 71, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443126106}, "language": "english", "review": "Well...it's censored sadly\nStill has a good story tho\nWorth to buy", "timestamp_created": 1433408069, "timestamp_updated": 1433408069, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.466517", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16176767": {"recommendationid": "16176767", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990425293", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 5498, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450175554}, "language": "english", "review": "Half of the visual novel is a telling of shenanigans, while the latter half splits to five heartbreaking stories where 'the fire really hits the fan'.

Period. \nThe interaction between the characters is well done. Had me laughing most of the time and emotional at some parts. \nThe music is one of the best. It fits really well with the situations and just adds more feelings to it. \n\nIf you checked out the anime before coming here, then you'll be in for a surprise. They are different. Just like books and movies, they change it up.\n\nI'm a fan of this game. I've played this before with the fan-translated version and plan on playing the rest of the series. I got the steam version just to relive the experience once again because this game is that good.\n\nThere are a few mistakes in the steam version of this game. A few examples are spelling errors and a few mismatched dialog. \nThis is of course not 18+ so if you are in it for that version, just wait a bit.\nI did hear that they made a few changes due to not being 18+ including taking out some scenes but also adding few more. I did notice when I compared it to the fan-translated one. It does not make much of a difference, so far.\n\nI absolutely would recommend this game that is looking for an incredible story to laugh until your sides hurt, relaxing to idle chatter of philosophical questions with music that just makes you so comfy it is like you are melting, and the.. well you just have to see for yourself. :D", "timestamp_created": 1433224969, "timestamp_updated": 1433224969, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.574819", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16125464": {"recommendationid": "16125464", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981093028", "num_games_owned": 518, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1433205427}, "language": "english", "review": "this is gonna be really messy and probably a terribly written review, but hopefully I get my point across. \n\nThere are 3 reasons as to why I bought Grisaia on steam.\n1. I love the series.\n2. To support the people that made it.\n3. To write a review telling you that you should buy it too.\n\nI've read this VN once before with the unofficial translation, and absolutely fell in love with it to the point where I wanted to do whatever I could to support it when available. I ended up purchasing a Japanese psp version of the game, and now this one, and I plan to buy it again when DenpaSoft releases the unrated version(oh boy, h scenes!!). This VN stands as one of my favorite VNs and stories overall, only beaten out by Muv Luv Alternative. \n\nThe characters in this story are all really well done. They are extremely enjoyable, and if you don't like one of the characters, you're bound to like another.\nYuuji is a fantastic protagonist, who manages to be an asshole and a sweetheart all at the same time, in some manner.\nAmane is the onee-san type role, and absolutely fantastic. Her route has a bit of a boring spot but quickly picks up and is one of my favorites in the game.\nMichiru wants to be your run of the mill tsundere but manages to be a very interesting character.\nSachi is a maid who does what everyone says.\nMakina's the loli/imouto type, and I'm not too interested in her but her route is fantastic, probably the best in the game.\nAnd Yumiko is your violent kuudere, similar to Senjougahara from the monogatari series.\nThere is a lot more to each character, and a reason they act the way they do, but if I were to say more I'd spoil all the fun.\n\nThe story is absolutely fantastic, but if I were to go on about it, I'd probably end up spoiling it for you so I don't want to say anything, but there's plenty of good twists and events within the VN to really keep you interested.\n\nThere isn't a whole lot of choices to make in this vn. A few filler choices in shared route, and then 2 choices per route(One to get on each route, and one to decide the ending).\n\nThe one thing to keep in mind when reading this vn, is that it is extremely long(VNDB states about 50+ hours). The shared route goes on for quite some time.\n\nThis VN is definitely worth the cost, and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys VNs, or anime. \nIf you watched the Grisaia anime, the VN is a must, as the anime doesn't nearly compare to how good the VN is.\n\nAs I said earlier, if you'd rather wait for an uncensored version with more anime boob, DenpaSoft is also going to be releasing one at a later currently unannounced date.", "timestamp_created": 1433205434, "timestamp_updated": 1433205434, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.557400", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16124994": {"recommendationid": "16124994", "author": {"steamid": "76561198176784677", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 212, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1445250716}, "language": "english", "review": "storyline so good \nartworks so good \n\n10/10 would rate", "timestamp_created": 1433202965, "timestamp_updated": 1433202965, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506351", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16121826": {"recommendationid": "16121826", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023834212", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 644, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1433367802}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely amazing. \n\nCharacters are among the best I've ever seen and their stories are just superb. \nCan't wait for the other two to be translated.\n#backer 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1433188887, "timestamp_updated": 1433188887, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.573040", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16115785": {"recommendationid": "16115785", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016403096", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2342, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505663822}, "language": "english", "review": "THE ANIME WAS A HUGE LETDOWN\n(wanted to put that on the top because some people might judge it accordingly)\n\nI have never done a review before and I don't write too much so this will most likely seem like a very sloppy review however I feel the need to speak out for this great game. Rather than a review this will most likely be highlighting good points, there are obviously bad points to every product in existence so this will mostly be telling you why I think this game is amazing rather than comparing to other products and rating it accordingly.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone who is familiar with and enjoys anime/manga. I relate this to these specific people because most people who will read light novels or play VN's will most likely touch this game if not play through it.\n\nI think that this visual novel is an extremely good first visual novel as it offers a very rich and enjoyable storyline with characters that really make this game great. The choices are very simple and obvious. The only question you will have to ask yourself when you play this game is \"Which girl shall I choose\" and from that point you will be able to enter said route. However this can be a downside for those who choose according to the situation and like to see who they end up with. However the choices are not dull in determining good ends and bad ends. Sometimes the game will have you wanting to choose what will end up as the bad end and this can be very surprising and this brings life to the game. However the choices are ultimately very few and simple so I will state what is really good about this game.\n\nThe characters.\nOk first of all- Kazami fucking Yuuji. This is the character that you will play as and you will fell like batman or some shit when you are reading this VN. The fact that his background is mysterious when playing through this game adds a great amount of enjoyment throughout the entire duration of the game.\nI will not go into detail for every single girl but just like a good VN should it caters to alot of different taste (even though some may be wrong) and has a very unique different story for each girl that does not make replaying every route worse than the first one you played through. I will mention one character Michiru I personally do not think that she is best girl per se. However this is honestly the first time I have seen the character of \"Girl trying to pretend to be a tsundere\" and I say trying to pretend because it is blatantly obvious and this causes for some great comedy scenes.\n\nPlaying the game-\nI personally learned alot through this game, whether it be a way to approach or think about life. Or mearly just a quote from Kazami's 'Master\" this game will introduce many new ways of thinking and approaching problems that you may have not thought of before. You will enter our main characters thought process and adapt to his methods of handling situations that you may be able to relate to in your own life. This is ultimately very situational but even if they do not relate to you specifically this can be extremely engaging and enjoyable.\nThe game has a very smooth progression that is paced extremely well in my opinion.\nYou may find that your life will be based around playing this game and spending all your free time on this throughout your first play through. This is very normal however this can be a bad point for some people.\n\nThe Soundtrack-\nI love this soundtrack. From the moment you open the game for the very first time to the opening to the appropriate music for the right scene to the ending songs. I love everything about this soundtrack.\n\nThe Story-\nObviously as a story oriented game how can this be anything but amazing. The thing I like the most about the story however is the fact that every story is so unique to the point that playing through every story does not feel like you are repeating the game, rather playing say a set of 4 sequels to your first choice.\n\nDark aspects-\nThis game is not afraid to explore some dark aspects and sometimes can be slightly uncomfortable to read for some people (such as blatantly describing starvation). This is honestly one of the main reasons why I rate this game so highly. The story will get serious at an increasingly genius pace. They will relate every girl to a typical character you may have seen before and then show you that everything may not just be sunshine and [loli]pops!\n\nGreat CGI and Voices-\nWhile playing this game you will really feel like you are interacting with the characters. This is extremely important for a VN and this game does it extremely well. The voice actresses/ors do a magnificent job in portraying every character/sidecharacter and the CGI will make it very easy to ascertain who you are talking to, when and how many people are in the scene. I cannot emphasize enough how important it is to do this properly and this game does it beautifully.\n\nThe Art-\nWhen placed during the right scene the artwork in this game can bring a tear to your eye. The artwork is not merely but in many important scenes you can read many important traits of each character in how they are portrayed in the art and how they are feeling within the scene. This is so amazing in so many parts within this VN. However that is not only the case. The art does not only crop up in important scenes it remains amazingly consistent throughout the entire game allowing you to feel so much more in depth to the characters within almost every scene in the game.\n\nIn conclusion I think that this game is a great game to buy if you like anime/manga.This game is very well written and Sekai Project do not slack when it comes to translating properly, so you can expect some really great writing such as: http://puu.sh/i7ho0/2d6e3a4185.jpg. Also added points for being able to choose the voice of your menu.\n\ntl;dr\nIF YOU HAVE NOT PLAYED A VN BEFORE BUT LIKE ANIME/MANGA PLAY THIS GAME\n10/10\nwould bang", "timestamp_created": 1433165849, "timestamp_updated": 1433165849, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521418", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16112755": {"recommendationid": "16112755", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150546736", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 218, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498983654}, "language": "english", "review": "selling your soul to sakaki yumiko is not a sin", "timestamp_created": 1433148877, "timestamp_updated": 1433148877, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16111954": {"recommendationid": "16111954", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048895474", "num_games_owned": 215, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1619, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466032821}, "language": "spanish", "review": "10/10 - Michiru best girl", "timestamp_created": 1433142640, "timestamp_updated": 1433142640, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.667692", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16111608": {"recommendationid": "16111608", "author": {"steamid": "76561198217273696", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454433529}, "language": "english", "review": "Very nicely crafted and humorous visual novel, very nice voice actor and nice routes would buy.\nMakina route is very deep and moving but I'm currently waiting on the 18+ DLC to be released.\n\nUPDATE:DLC will not be on steam separate games confirmed by a fansub translator who is being moved to the team", "timestamp_created": 1433139872, "timestamp_updated": 1433243546, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.470426", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16111507": {"recommendationid": "16111507", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093114710", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2482, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1433252071}, "language": "russian", "review": "\t\n\u041d\u0435\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043b\u0438 \u044f \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0438\u0437 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u044f\u0437\u044b\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0439, \u043a\u0442\u043e \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u043b \u044d\u0442\u0443 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443?

But please note, watched the anime is the same with playing the VN in skip mode. which is you'll be missed the emotion of the story.\n\nCommon route have a very refreshing \"unusual\" school-life-themed story. A bit long but truly enjoyable. The character development is really good eventhough some part is really boring.\n\nHeroine route will tell you the tragic background of girl's route you take which is totally different with most VN i've played. (Eventho it's still not better than G-senjou no maou imho)\nYou can really feel the emotion which is delivered perfectly. And it's totally reccomended to play all route in order to fully enjoyed the rest of the series.\n\nDespite there's cut for the H scene, for me the H scene in kajitsu is nothing but fanservice.

Kazami quickly learns that he is the sixth student to have started to attend a school and that his other classmates are all of the opposite gender.\n\nYuuji's classmates consist of a cute little ball of energy named Makina Irisu, who has a noticable lisp in her voice when she speaks do to having a very small tongue. Makina is usually intimidated by people she just meant and usually hids behind her bestfriend/older sister figure Amane Suou.\n\nUpon opening up to someone, Makina shows her more troublemaking side and loves to use the fact that she is small and adorable to get her way with just about anyone who she is comfortable with.\n\nMakina's tramatic past has to deal with her rich family background that is just as amazingly well-written as it is sad. A mother who has abandoned her and screws around with other men.\n\nYuuji's next classmate is a fake-tsundere by the name of Michiru Matsushima. Michiru has conciously decided to act as the token tsundere archtype, although it is pretty easily to tell that it is forced. Michiru tries to empress others with her tsundere act, although most of the time she fails horribly due to the fact that she is a massive klutz, but at the same time she is very sweat and cares about her friends dearly.\n\nMichiru trama is rooted in an accident that she was a victim of and she suffers from an identity crisis that has nothing to do with her fake-tsundere persona, but is so bad that she is almost suicidal.\n\nThe best girl is Sachi Komine, a girl with a passion for the maid lifestyle and an unhealthy obsession with helping others. Sachi is the first girl you will speak to upon entering the school as she is very suspicious of you being an intruder.\n\nSachi takes on the role from a class rep, who will take on any request no matter how ridiculous it may be. Sachi also has shown many times throughout your run to be someone who takes every way too seriously and has a serious weird catchphrase when someone has to explain something to her when she either has the wrong idea or just being weird.\n\nSachi loves being praised by others, mostly the main character and adores it when you pet her on the head. She also has a weird obsession with expecting you to do perverted things to her or the other girls and has a slight masochistic nature to her personality.\n\nSachi's trama deals with the fact that she is convinced that she was the cast for the people in her life disappearing and so she will do anything anyone tells her to in the hopes that she has to never again experience the pain that she went through as a child.\n\nThe next girl is Sakaki Yumiko, the daughter of the person who is currently funding the school that they all attend. Yumiko is at first very hostile towards the main male character and likes to keep her distance from other, preferring to spend most of the day in her room when not attending class.\n\nYumiko is a menace, always caring around a box cutter blade to threaten anyone who approaches her, due to her paranoia.\n\nMuch like Makina, Yumiko's issues have to deal with her family, being the daughter of a Wealthy businessman, who treats her like a pawn for him to use when he feels the need to and how her fathers cold personality affected her and her now dead mother.\n\nLast but not least, we have Amane Suou, the big sister character who absolutely adores the main character, play the role of the horny big sister character with large breasts.\n\nAmane is almost a enigma as she is quite shocked when Yuuji introduces himself as if she knows something about him, but never says anything.\n\nShe quickly latches on to the main male lead, using her feminine charms and large assets to gain Yuuji's affection. she is very aggressive in the aspect of romance and is not afraid to fault her body to the point where even being naked in front of Yuuji does not embarrass her all that much.\n\nAt the same time she is very shy with simple affectionate actions shared between loves. (like kissing)\n\n Amane always has an upbate expression on her face and loves to make dirty jokes when around Yuuji, that may in fact not be jokes depending on her mood. She also sometimes has a sultry grin on her face when she is trying to seduce Yuuji who usually brushes her off due to being a big tsundere himself.\n\nAmane is charged with taking care of Makina playing the motherly role for the girl, which is best better than some people twice her age.\n\nshe is an exceptional cook having been raised in the kitchen at her families restaurant and has a passion for driving since she got her license.\n\nThat being said Amane also has her tragic past to deal with that she can't seem to escape from. Amane trauma deal with Societies need for a scapegoat to focus all their hatred and sorrow upon, and her own self imposed atonement for something that she had no power over and the trauma of being the lone survivor of an tragic event that took the lives of many.\n\nIt is up to Yuuji  to help each of these five girls overcome the tragic past and find a place where they belong and find a place where a broken weapon like him can belong and find love.\n\nThis is a truly great story that I recommend you buy and experience as soon as possible. \n\nTruly 9/10 work.", "timestamp_created": 1433125335, "timestamp_updated": 1433125335, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488802", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16108766": {"recommendationid": "16108766", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010838885", "num_games_owned": 232, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 846, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1436042637}, "language": "english", "review": "An excellent visual novel, this tells the story of a young man, Yuuji, with a military background who tries to reinvent himself at a \"normal\" school... and ends up at a small academy with five very broken girls.  \n\nThe game starts out light-hearted and mysterious; clearly everyone has secrets--including the main character--but the group is insistent on them remaining secrets.

By playing through all of the endings, the player reveals a good portion of Yuuji's own tragic past as well.\n\nIt's a clever story, with fascinating characters, a wicked sense of humor... and ultimately, a satisfying conclusion (if the player makes the appropriate choices, that is).

lots of fun, you decide to give it a try. After you take a seat you simply have to wait until the train is ready and when it finally moves... well it is not how you imagined - it moves really slowly and nothing is happening that should cost as much as this did. Still at some point you reach the peak of track and suddenly you realize that real fun is just beginning. And then it happens... you go up and down, right and left. You just give in the pleasure, because there is nothing you can do. And finally when it ends you are happy that you paid a little fee so you could experience that ride.\n\nLike I said this game is similar: First you have to buy it (although you may think it is expensive), then you wait until it is downloaded and when it is done, you start it and it feels quite slow, but when you reach certain point, that will change and you will experience real emotional roller coaster. When you are done with it you just won't regret purchasing it.\n\nJust keep in mind that some people have motion sickness and also - Amane, Michiru and Sacchi >> Makinia and Yumiko.

The girls are interesting, and a few have backgrounds that are darker than a civil rights parade. The art is top notch and the voice acting is well done and hilarious at times. The choices for the girls are few, so to get set on a certain lady's path doesn't take much, but considering it's a 20 hour game per route, you will probably not complain much about the choices.

To be more precise, I am referring to the female genitalia.\nMichiru: ...What? Did you just say... genitalia?\nSachi: Allow me to explain...\nSachi: I will construct a heap of sand above your groin to emphasize your current inability to move, then dig a tunnel offering direct access to your genitals.

I read this in a book the other day.\nSachi: To conceal a flaw in your security system, it's wise to make an obvious \"hole\" to draw focus away from the true weak point... In other words, we attract attention to this hole in order to distract from your undeniably inferior breasts.\nMichiru: ...What... are you talking about? huh? is it the heat? has heat gone to your head?\nSachi: Please don't say such things.

In Kajitsu the story begins with the protagonist Kazumi Yuuji transferring into a certain school and meeting 5 other girls who attends it. There are only 6 students the school.\nIt gives off a very unique feel, unlike all other school-related VNs. The heroines are, unique, eccentric and weird in some way or another. To be precise, the entire school is full of weirdos, even Yuuji himself.\n\nThe common route is entertaining and really intresting, because the characters are all weirdos like with Michiru's stupidity, Sachi's lack of common sense, Makina's downright rude personality, Amane's horny big sister role player,Yumiko's \"classic kuudere.\"  and Yuuji's tsundere personality.\n\nIt has good voice acting and all of the heroines and have nice soundtracks.\nThe art style is very pleasing to the eye and with vivid colours being used it makes a nice ambience around the visual novel itself.\nThe interface is very detailed and nicely designed.\n\nTo sum up i would definitely recommend this great title from Frontwing, The Fruit of Grisaia isn\u2019t a game to be missed, and whether you\u2019re a fan of visual novels, anime, or even just well-written stories, this is something that\u2019ll be a deep, engaging experience.\n\n[url=http://azusantiara.com/2016/02/16/the-fruit-of-grisaia-review/]Full review click here[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1432976899, "timestamp_updated": 1455605610, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 52, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.703540", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16073316": {"recommendationid": "16073316", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099931597", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463061137}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u300a\u7070\u8272\u7684\u679c\u5b9e\u300b\u7cfb\u5217\u4e00\u5171\u4e09\u90e8\uff1a\u679c\u5b9e \u4e50\u56ed \u8ff7\u5bab\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7cfb\u5217\u662f\u6211\u73a9\u8fc7\u8d85\u7ea7\u826f\u5fc3\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u3002\u8dcc\u5b95\u8d77\u4f0f\u7684\u5267\u60c5\u3001\u552f\u7f8e\u7684\u4eba\u7269\u3001\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5fc3\u91cc\u6d3b\u52a8\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u505a\u5f97\u5f88\u7528\u5fc3\uff0c\u8ba9\u73a9\u5bb6\u80fd\u6df1\u5165\u5176\u4e2d\u4f53\u4f1a\u5230\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4eba\u7269\u7684\u611f\u53d7\u3001\u611f\u60c5\u3002\u6211\u6700\u559c\u6b22\u91cc\u9762\u7684\u98ce\u89c1\u4e00\u59ec\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7537\u4e3b\u7684\u59d0\u59d0\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5341\u5206\u6eba\u7231\u7537\u4e3b\uff0c\u6bcf\u6b21\u90fd\u80fd\u5728\u5173\u952e\u65f6\u5019\u62ef\u6551\u7537\u4e3b\uff08\u96c4\u4e8c\uff09\uff0c\u6027\u683c\u6211\u8d85\u559c\u6b22\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u8fd8\u662f\u5b66\u9738\uff08\u8bf4\u9053\u8fd9\u91cc\u5c31\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b66\u6e23\u5c31\u5f88\u4f24\u5fc3\uff09\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u91cc\u6211\u5f3a\u70c8\u63a8\u8350\u5927\u5bb6\u73a9\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u76f8\u4fe1\u5927\u5bb6\u4e00\u5b9a\u4e0d\u4f1a\u540e\u6094\u7684\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1432975122, "timestamp_updated": 1432975122, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.647204", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16073021": {"recommendationid": "16073021", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009108939", "num_games_owned": 920, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432973331}, "language": "japanese", "review": "Been waiting a long time for this >.<\nGreat VN -

It's my favorite visual novel.\n\nThe interface is great and comfortable, there is a good selection of Extras, like CGI and even Windows soundpacks and even icons. On a technical standpoint, it's a great game.\n\nI may not have many hours on this (Unless a R-18 patch is released, or created by the users) - but I have played it.\n\nNow with the story, it has its fair share of funny moments, and its fair share of dramatic moments..as well as those moments that had me on the brink of tears, or just depressed for multiple days.\n\nAmane's route is outstanding. One issue in this version is that you're missing out on the adult content, which is coincidentally a large focus of her route. Though, there is also a lot of humor and fun in this version without any adult content. I will not spoil Amane's route at all because it's something that you truly have to experience for yourself. When I first played through her route, I only got 2 hours of sleep for 2 nights in a row, just because of how interested I was. It's amazing. \n\nSachi's route is very good, it's interesting finding out exactly what drives her to act as she does, just make sure that you are ready for the reason. Try not to get the bad ending for her, though..truly horrifying. I don't know fully how to put how I feel about her route into words, but I assure you that it's great. The R-18 content here does not matter as much, I believe- though in general I do believe that not having it is a general issue.\n\nYumiko's route is nice, she's sort of like a tsundere/kuudere mix in personality, and her route is generally good, but not exceptionally remarkable overall. I enjoyed her route a lot, especially in seeing how she slowly becomes close to you, or Yuuji. Nearing the end a lot of unexpected things happen, and it is all played out pretty well, but once again, when you compare it to something like Amane's route, it's hard to stand out. However, I still enjoyed it a lot.\n\nI have not yet completed Makina's route, though it is pretty good so far. Lots of humor, and a lot of dark stuff as well. Each route has two sides, and they are all generally played out well. R-18 content here as far as I have gone doesn't matter at all, but I can't say for sure since I have not yet completed it.\n\nI have not started Michiru's route, but some people argue that it is the best route in the entire game. Others argue that Amane's route is the best. They're generally the two most acclaimed in this game.\n\nOverall, there was not a single moment in which I wanted to just get through a certain part to get to the good stuff so to speak. The entire experience was perfect, from the comedy to the pure horror at some points in time, everything was great. I do not have a single complaint for this game, but it goes without saying that the R-18 version is the definitive version to get.\n\nIf you're looking for an outstanding visual novel that will last you over 50 hours of gameplay-\n\n(Yes, even with quick reading)\n\nlook no further than Grisaia no Kajitsu, or \"The Fruit of Grisaia\"", "timestamp_created": 1432970460, "timestamp_updated":

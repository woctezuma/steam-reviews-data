You get close to that in Crusader Kings II, but it's not exactly what I had in mind. This game, even though it's entirely different, is also surprisingly deep.\n\nBeing a huge fan of Dwarf Fortress, I've noticed this game on DF forums and was a bit skeptical at first, but bought it anyway. It turned out to be, like DF, largely based on procedural generation, and able to produce quite detailed worlds, full of things to do, and many thigs that a king would do, like aforementioned audiences, complaints, and disputes; but you can also discover a lot of hidden stuff, change your kingdom's laws, listen to musicians and comedians, upgrade different buildings, buy or free slaves, co-operate with bandits, guilds, and orders, or fight them - there is a lot to do.\n\nThe biggest drawback is, of course, graphics, for someone who doesn't like them. If, however, like me you are a fan of old-school, text-based games, this is probably the best one you can get, and one that receives new updates all the time, and is everything but forgotten. For a pretty low price it can be well worth it and provide a lot of fun. The other thing I don't really like is how fast the game develops - each turn equals one year, I would prefer a system of one turn = three months or something. \n\nWhat I would like to see in the game is some more interaction with the various estates - nobles, clergy, and burghers, granting privileges, receiving help, and maintaining the balance of power like in MEIOU mod for EU4.\n\nMy favorite thing was an abomination musician whom I letted sing and there was the message: \"Enjoy the chaos of my magical musical stomach\".

Sure, I've only played a little while, but it's more fun than I imagined.\n\nThe soundtrack has a few good songs but is otherwise lackluster.\n\nObviously it's pretty low graphics, but the writing makes this not a problem.  It IS a text-based game, after all, and the text is very well-written.  I've found one spelling error and no grammatical errors so far.  You can see the care put into some of the ASCII art faces.  (Apparently those are randomly generated, but that took a lot of programming for such a small game.)\n\nThe gameplay is well done, though I imagine it will get slightly more repetitive in the future.  The system is simple enough for a child with a decent vocabulary to understand.  Heck, you could probably teach a kid common tabletop roleplaying lingo using this game and a dictionary.  It does seem to be mathematically balanced thus far.\n\nOverall, I recommend this for any fans of text-based games, fantasy literature, and ESPECIALLY tabletop roleplayers and wargamers.\n\nUPDATE:  I would like to add that, in what little time I've had this game, the developer has released two large, content-heavy updates.

Other than a few crashes at the end of a turn and some minor typos, there is nothing to hate about this game.  Since you can just save before ending a turn, and that's probably one of the best times to save anyway, the crashes are only a minor inconvenience once you know about them.\n\nThe setting is great.  Much like the more recent Elder Scrolls games, there's very little direct story, but you can find snippets of lore and background everywhere if you look around.  There are plenty of books in various places, with topics ranging from military strategy to history to fiction.  More areas and characters are added each update, and all of them add something to the world.\n\nThe gameplay itself is pretty basic on the surface.  Each unit has a power value, and the bigger power value in a battle usually wins.  Diplomacy is on a numerical scale and is mostly superficial - war, peace, gifts.  But as you play, you begin to find things that change the dynamics.  I won't describe them in detail, because part of the charm of the game is in the exploration and learning new things at the game's pace.\n\nAfter initially seeing the mechanics, I expected to be done with this one in half an hour.  Instead, after four hours, I feel like I haven't even scratched the surface and I already want to do multiple playthroughs.\n\nYou can conquer the continent.  You can negotiate peace with the other empires and become an explorer.  You can become a real estate baron and make your money from combat arenas and taverns.  Or you can sit in your throne room for hours as travelling bards come by and play songs for your amusement.

However be aware that you are  buying an investment and not a complete game.\n\nRight now the most important mechanic (warfare) is an astoundingly one dimensional pure stat battle, aka whoever has a bigger troop score almost always wins. So thus the game is decided by how much gold you can spend to spam troops. However the gold generating mechanics of this game are also woefully under designed, the most obvious gold generator being peasents  take far too much investment to make worthwhile. Bandits seem to be far superior in generating gold, as they seem to not require building upgrades to make gold, but they generate less gold as you defeat more enemies. There are other methods of generating gold you can discover exploring the wild however most of them require such huge investments of gold and resources you can legit just start winning the game by spamming troops then killing every faction. I experimented with acquiring various buildings and almost of all them give reallly low returns for the huge investments required to acquire, I would say just spending all your gold on peasents would almost always be a better return. Execpt of course in the north where there seems to be two buildings which give a big return on the investment ( thickblood tavern and slavers)\n\nIf you are hoping that this game is going to be some complex kingdom warfare game as I did, do not expect much at the current state of the game. The diplomacy is almost nonexistant, with me only ever using diplomacy on foreign kingdoms to ask for trade routes on the first turn of the game. You can also of course pay minor bandit factions for truces and to attack other kingdoms. However these actions cost way too much for the returns. Paying 3k gold for a group of 50 bandits to stop raiding you, then pay another 3k gold for them to focus on raiding someone else.\n\nLate game is a unbearable grind of repetiviely passing your turn then selecting an enemy faction, then selecting the invade option, then select each troop category you wish to bring on this battle, which of course asks if you want to bring # of peasent or not, then the screen asks if you want to bring # of solider, then the next screen asks if you want to bring # of knights or not, then the next screen asks if you want to bring # of tier one faction A unit 1, then the next screen asks if you want to bring # of faction A unit tier 2, then the next screen asks if you want to bring..... Which you can see my point, this is one of the only games where I feel as the game gets progressively worse as you acquire various types of units accross factions. Having to type in a number to tell the game how many troops you want to bring is extremely mind numbingly boring especially when you do this ten+ times for one battle. Then after you invade you get 1 land, and due to the fact you have snowballed, every single turn is you passing then invading your neighbors. So you have to select a faction, select type of invasion, select every single troop 50+ times depending on the number of the lands in your game.\n\n\nUltimately i can see this game being a great one if the dev follows up on his promises. Right now the rpg mechanics are nonexistant, as well as the strategeic elements. The only thing to do in this game is generate gold, which is one dimensional, and only a few avenus are worthwhile. However while it may seem that this is a negative review, I don't regret the five dollars I spent on this game. I don't think i will be playing again anytime soon, but will come back in a year. I will either be pleasentingly surpised, or heavily dissapointed at the state of the game then.\n\nI would give the game a 6/10", "timestamp_created": 1500068415, "timestamp_updated": 1500069519, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540070", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33486162": {"recommendationid": "33486162", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000421883", "num_games_owned": 697, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 586, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 42, "last_played": 1515354331}, "language": "english", "review": " \"this is the game warsim, a command prompt based game, which, though simple on the visuals, is amazing in depth, and the game is outright spectacular. when i first heard of it on itch.io, i supported it, due to its potential.

I race over to my girlfriend A. Z. Shae's house not only to see her, but she has her own landline and lives close enough to civilization to connect to an awesome BBS as a local call.  We boot up her Amiga 1000 (using the Kickstart 1.3 disk) and have the modem dial us in and connect.  Ah, yes.  I log into my kingdom!  Sadly, I only receive five turns for the day, but this will reset at midnight...\n\nWarsim: The Realm of Aslona reminds me of these ancient, glory-filled days of BBS door games.  Taking control of a tiny kingdom, you slowly build up your forces and and attack other kingdoms to grow your own.  Graphics?  Who needs them, I have a great imagination!  Well, OK, there are some bits of ASCII art here and there, and the 1.23*10^23 random ASCII faces that the game creates for NPCs.\n\nFrom your throne you have a number of options every year.  Should you buy more troops?  Improve your fortress?  Explore your lands?  Meet with subjects and advisors in your throne room?  Add more taxes?  Release slaves?  Call a festival?  Hire a new champion?  It is all up to you but your advisors will give you hints.  Kingdom reports give you hard numbers on what is happening in your realm and in others.  I really enjoy the number of choices available.\n\nA new aspect that I did not see in the games of the ancient past is the 'Explore the Realm' action.  You can wander (twice a turn) through your kingdom finding places of interest.  These can be forts, mines, dungeons, traps, monsters, etc., giving an old school RPG feel to the game.  It reminds me of the old hex map adventures where each hex has an encounter of some sort.  Many of the visited sites can be attacked and added to your kingdom's list of bling, which is a really nice touch and adds to the feeling that your kingdom is a diverse, living place and has more to it than just generic 'lands'.\n\nWhen you end your turn you are given the opportunity to battle against other kingdoms ranging from internal struggles against rebels and bandits, to a vast array of semi-randomlly generated foes of increasing toughness.  Many kingdoms have special troops or secret powers that they use against you.  A successful invasion takes land from your foe and adds it to your realm.  This is the core of the game.  Lands give you more gold and more troops which allow you to attack more powererful foes.  Of course the AI kingdoms wish to relieve you of your own lands... Once the battle starts you have no control and the final reports are basically lists of the dead.   The battles seem very basic at this point and seem to match the weakest fighters first, then the more powerful troops.  There are no tactics.\n\nThere are many unpolished areas, but this is an early access game.  The music has one level- loud, so for me it is turned off for now.  A number of locations are not yet finished, but there are notes in game to tell you this.  I found the songs of the visiting bards tedious and their songs didn't seem to add to the 'war sim' aspect of the game, but I may be missing something here.  The battles and their reports are pretty lack-luster and I hope to see more flavor text for these.  The same goes for the arena fights.  I would enjoy seeing more text description of the battles and fights, especially since there are no graphics above ASCII.  \n\nAll-in-all I am really enjoying this nostalga-riddled game and I can see the great potential that it has for expansion and improvements in its future development! \n\nPros:  Nostalga Inducing, interesting content, ASCII artwork, some exploration with your little war\nCons: Limited setup options, unfinished (early access), some parts felt tacked on, Only AI opponents\n\nFinal word: Worth the pittance:  enjoy watching the game and your kingdom grow.

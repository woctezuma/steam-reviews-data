So let me make this short:\n\nThe reason [i]BLARP![/i] is so cool is that it's one of those games that can only exist in VR. There's no way to have this sort of gameplay in a flatscreen 3D game. You'd have to go all the way back to 2D to have even an approximation (something that would be sort of like Particle Mace.)\n\nIn Blarp, you corral an ever-growing number of floating eyeballs, in an ever-growing room, twirling them around like a bolas, or a bunch of yo-yos. With the analog range of the Vive's trigger, you can pull them in to you with varying force, which you can also offset by swinging them around. Just make sure you don't let any of them actually touch your hand, or it's instant game over. Your other hand has an extendable shield to help you keep them in check (I never use it.)\n\nThe aim is to swing and release them to hit randomly placed floating targets that level you up. You keep leveling up, adding an eyeball each time and seeing the room get bigger and bigger.\n\nAs the swarm of eyeballs tethered to your hand grows and grows, it becomes easier to throw them in the general direction of the target and trust that one of them will hit it, but it also gets more difficult to maneuver them around without one of them touching your hand. Add to this the fact that some of the eyeballs are smaller and move much faster (either the new ones, or the old ones, I'm not sure.)\n\nThere are a number of indicators to help you play. The eyeballs are linked to your hand by smart tethers that let you know how far each ball is just by looking at the dashes on the tether. The dashes also dynamically change as you exert a pull with the trigger. It's very intuitive and makes it easy to manage a huge number of eyeballs without having to look at all of them - just look at your hand and the opacity and length of the tether dashes. There are also audio cues to help you, for instance, locate the floating targets without hassle.\n\nLet's talk about the visuals and audio. Cabbibo, the developer, is fond of psychedelic shaders and abstract dynamically generated music. The screenshots in the store page give you an idea of how trippy the game looks. It's rather ugly in screenshots, but in motion you see how gorgeous it is: there are layers and layers of hidden fields, that you peek at when looking the wakes behind the eyeballs, or the mat under your feet, or your controllers. The walls of the room ripple and flex satisfyingly when you smack the eyeballs into them. The eyes themselves each emit a sound sample, growing into a cacophony that's pleasing yet overpowering.\n\nThis is pure VR arcade fun. The sense of progression is palpable, the gameplay simple but deep and compelling.\n\nI would improve a few things. Have more colour coordination rather than the vomity scheme, while maintaining the effects. Left handed mode. A checkpoint or extra life every few 5 or 10 levels.\n\nOkay, this review ended up much longer than I planned. I love this game so much.

The title is kinda bad, the graphics in game aren't very stunning, and the gameplay is basically just way too simple.\n\nSo what is Blarp!?  You start off in a small room with two sticks... one that acts as an \"attractor\" and one that acts as a sheild.   When you pull the trigger on the attractor, this rainbow eyeball flies towards that controller.  The idea is to make the eyeballs collide with another rainbow colored target that then causes an additional eyeball to spawn, and the size of the play area gets a bit bigger.\n\nSimple...right?  Well that's partly why this game seems bad to me.  You just walk over to the target... press the trigger on the attractor, wait for the eyeballs to head towards the target... release the button and step out of the way and repeat.  Every time I got \"blarped\" by an eyeball was my own fault for not jumping out of the way fast enough, or not releasing the trigger fast enough.\n\nAlso, eventually the play area gets bigger than your actual physical play area, but there's no real way for you to move in-game other than moving your feet for real, so basically whatever size your play area is, eventually this game will eat it all up and then \"hit a wall\" literally. \n\nGoing by other reviews this was supposed to be strangely addictive or fun, but I played it for about 5 minutes and was already tired of it.  I think I would have liked it better if I could have used the shield to whack blarps off into random directions or something, but instead the whole shield thing was pretty useless.\n\nIf you're looking for a fun game, this is fun for about 10 minutes tops and then you'll be looking for something better. You'll also probably not want to come back to it either unless you're so hideously bored that this looks interesting by comparison.\n\nThings I liked about this game: \n[list]\n [*] ...    nope. there's nothing here.\n[/list]\n\nThings I didn't like about this game:\n[list]\n [*] too simple.  It's about as much fun as hitting tennis balls against the wall.\n [*] Graphics are ugly\n [*] Sound effects are kinda lame too\n [*] No music. \n[/list] \n\nI'll stop there... this game is just bad. Don't do it.  Buy something else.\n\n\nIf you doubt me on the \"lasting appeal\" go look at the positive reviews and see how much lasting appeal this had for them.  Most haven't even broken the 1 hour mark.  If this was my very first VR game I would be like \"OOH NEAT!\" and then I'd get bored in less than 20 minutes.

I didn't understand it at first. The goal of BLARP! is to get the little eye creature (called Blarps) to the little goal spheres that pop up around the level. You attract them using your right Vive remote and try to swing them at the goals. You have a shield on your left remote to bounce them away. Every time you hit a goal, it spawns a new Blarp. There's a catch though: if a Blarp touches your attractor, it's game over. At first I was frustrated because I'd always get hit by a Blarp from behind me after making a few Blarps. I was so confused as to why people were raving about this game. Then I found the secret: how hard you press the trigger is how much you attract the Blarps. I was mashing the trigger and they would zoom at me. But if you just lightly press on the trigger, they come in slower and you can manage them.\n\nAfter figuring that out, the game became less stressful and more fun. The gentle melodies of the music, the flow of the Blarps; it becomes very zen like. Its premise is simple, the graphics aren't crazy but fit well, game mechanics are well thought out, and it gets more challenging as it goes on (20+ Blarps gets interesting) At $3, this is a no brainer purchase for the Vive. I have a 2m x 2m playspace and a low ceiling and while I was cursing my low ceiling, I had a lot of fun with BLARP! and I'd recommend it to any Vive player.

(Right now, I believe that the only thing shown is a single \"highest score\".\n- A public leaderboard of some kind. (I've no doubt that my meager high score of 27 will not fare well against the masses, but even better would just be listing friend scores.)\n- Perhaps a second audio track. I LOVE the existing one, and the way it intensifies over time, but it can get a bit repetitive.\n\nThese are certainly not required changes for enjoyment of the game. A lot of people have mentioned the price, and how it compares to other games.

Does it innovate and excite? No on both counts. But as a physics exercise, Blarp is fantastic at demonstrating what VR, and more importantly motion controlled VR, can do.\n\nThe game is basic, almost painfully so. A psychadelic eyeball called a \"Blarp\" is floating around in a box with you. You can 'attract' it by pulling the trigger of the Vive Bagel Blaster associated with your right hand, and the Blarp will attempt to make sweet, sweet love to your remote. When you stop pulling the trigger, the Blarp continues on its last path and velocity, whether or not your remote is still there. Also of note is that Blarps can not turn on a dime -- more accurately, they can maybe turn on a manhole cover. What this means is that you bull-and-cape it into running into a target floating in the box with you. Upon hitting the target, another Blarp spawns, and now BOTH of those Blarps independently try to track down your Bagel Blaster when you pull the trigger. As you fling these helpless eyeballs into more and more targets, more of their compatriots spawn, attempting to destroy the interloper (your remote) in their midst. You keep going until you \"get Blarped\" (to use the in-game verbiage), i.e. a Blarp runs into your remote.\n\nThere are no complex mechanics or systems to learn, just an intrinsic understanding of momentum and spatial awareness. Yet despite the simplicity, the game achieves its goal quite readily -- you realize that there is literally no way to play this game outside of VR. Without the depth perception, you won't be able to determine how far away the Blarps are from your remote, and by extent you'll end up striking out. Without motion controls, you wouldn't be able to 'swing' the Blarps from target to target (although I will readily admit that a PS Move could easily do just this, the only benefit of the Bagel Blasters of the Vive is being able to carefully sneak your way past a Blarp cloud as you gather them up for the next target.)\n\nAs a game, aye, it's lacking.

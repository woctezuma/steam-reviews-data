VR in its current state is very weird about its movement. Either being like Pavlov in moving with the touchpad or just succuming to telporting, Climby seperates itself from the rest with serveral other movement options aswell as the what the games titles suggest. You can long/high jump aswell as move your arms back and forth like exaggerated walking, or you can enable the pad to walk incase you want that. It feels so satisifing to climb a tall part of a map aswell as doing a successful jump, and with its workshop support I couldn't recommend this game more for an early VR title.", "timestamp_created": 1516209545, "timestamp_updated": 1516209545, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39395714": {"recommendationid": "39395714", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088359879", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 362, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 168, "last_played": 1516381032}, "language": "english", "review": "I broke my lamp playing this game.\n\nWorth it", "timestamp_created": 1516126484, "timestamp_updated": 1516126484, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39375778": {"recommendationid": "39375778", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086017019", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 65, "last_played": 1515546710}, "language": "english", "review": "They really nailed the multiplayer.", "timestamp_created": 1516053359, "timestamp_updated": 1516053359, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39364781": {"recommendationid": "39364781", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011428153", "num_games_owned": 577, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 121, "last_played": 1516149753}, "language": "english", "review": "TL:DR; A decent game that does what it says. Good fun, Much better with friends. But can feel alil rough around the edges at time. Worth 10$ in my mind. I think you will get your money's worth.\n\n\nLong Review. This game can be alot of easy to get into fun. My only real issues are in two seperate regards. \n\nFirst the controls can feel really clunky at times. I know many users get motion sick when using trackpad controls, but the way the arm swinging/walking in place, style of walking works in this game just feels alil funny to me. Personally I DONT get motion sick playing... well just about anything to be completely honest. I seem to be immune. So for me I quickly switched over to trackpad movement. Which I am happy to report is an option in the full game. IT ISNT IN THE DEMO. \nwhich had me alil worried when I tried the demo. But sure enough it is there. With one minor issue. To walk at full speed you need to press BOTH track pad controlers in the same direction. Which I just find alil silly. This is the only game so far in my almost 80 VR game list that does it this way. So its not intuitive at all. I wish the Devs would just simply make the trackpad control the same as every other game.\n\nSecond issue is a more difficult to fix one however. I feel like the creators of this game are really limiting the creativity of this game in a major way by having only the most basic of textures for the terrain of the game. Sure this is really quick and easy to work with and super easy to learn for anyone who wants to play or make their own maps. But it makes it alot less interesting in the long run. Every map ends up feeling like an unfinished source map or something, with grid textures as far as the eye can see. I think it would be alot more interesting if there was just some more options as far as textures on the objects are concerned. This way when you download a workshop map of the effel tower you feel like your actually climbing it, and Default texture tower. \n\nHowever that being said the Devs have already taken a step in the right direction by allowing you to change your skybox to anything you want. So +1 to devs there. So if the Devs keep up the good work im sure this game will grow to be a great fun climbing game. And currently It is probably the best on the market anyway, so they have all the reason to keep updating it so they can hold that place.", "timestamp_created": 1516023537, "timestamp_updated": 1516023537, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39337292": {"recommendationid": "39337292", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065770365", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 203, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 203, "last_played": 1516372175}, "language": "english", "review": "Had very little experience of multiplayer in vr,\nafter trying the demo decided to give the full game ago, early access or not this is the most fun i've had in vr yet.\ndespite virtual climbing for a few hours my arms are tired as hell, and the community in this game is a lot of fun with other players helping me along physically by holding there hands out to assist me in climbing.\n\nclimbey is an extremely fun game and runs great even if you have a system slightly below mininum requirements for vr vive (like I currently do)\n\nnot sure how active devs are on this game but this is an incredible experience worth far more than 10 usd in my opinion and will probably be a regular until I experience all the levels on this game from both the community and the original maps/levels themselves.", "timestamp_created": 1515933875, "timestamp_updated": 1515933875, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39324792": {"recommendationid": "39324792", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061459131", "num_games_owned": 311, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 87, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 87, "last_played": 1515889056}, "language": "english", "review": "A ton of fun with friends online but needs a fairly large playspace.

They're all worth owning for their own reasons. The Climb has scenic views, feels the most realistic and was all around great (though it could really use more content, if I didn't get it in a bundle I'd have been disappointed at how much it was for the content). To the Top requires the least amount of movement (your hands have long reach, and you jump by grabbing with both hands, letting go and looking where you want to go)  and was disappointing at first, but grew on me while I tried finding all the gems and doing speed runs. It's fun if you give it the time to grow on you (though some of the music in that game REALLY doesn't want you to), and was worth it at the discount price I got it at.  This one I have spent the least amount of time on, but I can say it's not too bad and I'll come back to it eventually. It involves the most amount of arm movement of the three games. It takes a bit of practice, but it's pretty fun flinging yourself across the map in this game. This one has multiplayer too, so that's a thing if you're into that (To the Top plans on having it in an update). And it's the only one that doesn't feel a bit overpriced!\n\nI post this mostly for those seeing these three games and trying to decide which is the best to get. They all have different mechanics, and very much feel like completely different games because of it. If you want \"realistic\" rock climbing (and the most exciting IMO), go for The Climb. If you want speedrunning and gem collecting with ease of use, go with To the Top. If you want to \"throw\" yourself across the map, get this game.

Climbey increases that feeling by giving you the possibility to jump by swinging your hands down. You'll have to get used to it and I can only recommend to download the demo to try it out by yourself. Apart from the \"normal\" white surface that you can climb on there is a blue surface which will speed you up and get faster the more and harder you swing down with your hands. Also there some kind of rope slips.\n\nClimbing alone can be fun but the best way to play Climbey is definetly the multiplayer mode. It has some beautiful cooperative mechanics and perfectly uses the VR technique. You can hold one of your hands in the air so your friends can grab it. Once they grabbed your hand you can also push them forward to reach the next step much easier and with less risk. You can grab your friends backpack or helmet as well to stick to them.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1173068792\n\nIn the evening/night (UTC) you will often have some players online to play with (be sure to check the steamdb site if you want to be sure).\nLike most VR games Climbey uses open mic and I've already met some great, cooperative people and had a lot of good laughs.\n\nThere are quite a few default levels but there is an ingame level editor and steam workshop support for much more content. People already created a ton of beautiful, challenging and fun maps so there is always something new to play.\n\nOne thing I also need to mention is the possibility to use any 360 degree image as skybox because it adds a lot to the surrounding atmosphere and I would definetly recommend trying that. You can find some good city panoramas (which turned out to be the best kind of skybox) on the Climbey subreddit.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1174022863\n\nAlso you should beware that Climbey is one of those games where you have to be very careful with your enviroment. Even tho I played a lot of VR I still manage to hit especially my ceiling quite often in this game.\n\nI also tried The Climb from Crytek (using Revive) but I have to say apart from the graphics, Climbey is better in every aspect. The climbing and jumping is much more fun, it has an awesome cooperative multiplayer and lots of content with the Steam Workshop support. Also it is much cheaper.\n\nSo what are you waiting for?

I'm not sure why I took this long to put up a review when it's definitely one of my favorite (if not my favorite) game to play in VR. As someone who's had a pretty strong fear of heights, this game has surprisingly helped me overcome a bit of that fear and am now able to climb ladders with little anxiety. I ended up using a 360 photo of skyscrapers in Paris to add to the sensation and I believe one of the main reasons I was able to overcome some of that anxiety in real life. I still have moments where my feet and hands cramp up from levels that are open, difficult, and with very few checkpoints, but I actually enjoy these moments considering I've never felt this way outside of VR playing video games. I'd say this is a great game for seasoned VR players, but I'd extremely recommend it for those new to VR. I wish more games would adopt the climbing mechanics this game has brought to the table, but would like to see some map design and textures. The workshop features are also a great addition and probably the main reason I have so much time invested in this game. The game allows users, with creative minds, to build custom maps for the commuinity to download and play. I love it when theres a bunch of 4 or 5 star maps I haven't tried yet. They download in seconds so there's virtually no wait.

The minimalistic, purposefully WIP design is appreciable for how readable it makes each level, but the drawback is that the game is not particularly pretty or interesting to look at.\n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]\nClimbey's whole premise is in its name: you climb. That's really all there is to it. Locomotion is both based on arm-swinging and dragging yourself along surfaces onto which you can hold, with one or both hands. The player's interaction with each surface is simple enough: white blocks can be grabbed, grey blocks cannot, blue (ice) blocks are slippery and red (lava) blocks kill on impact.\n\nPast this, the game's fun factor entirely revolves around the levels themselves, which sadly aren't all good. The stock array of levels can be quite forgettable and often offer a single, fairly simple challenge based on one gimmick which varies every time. While user-created levels are often more daring and complex, if only for their attempts at being thematic (as much as the game's artstyle allows them, really), they are often extremely linear.\n\nAnother issue of gameplay is the jumping. It is possible to leap across relatively short distances (albeit still far exceeding the average human ability) by grabbing onto the air and pulling back. While timing helps, the actual results is still mostly random and only becomes more difficult to control over longer jumps - and a dangerously high amount of levels rely heavily on jumping across particularly long distances. This creates a big problem especially when the player has to jump backwards or while holding onto objects, dozens of meters above the nearest surface. Community-made levels in particular over-utilize long distance jumps to the point of being infuriating.\n\n[h1]VR IMPLEMENTATION[/h1]\nClimbey in its current form would not be playable without VR. Motion-tracked hands is integral to gameplay but room-scale is relatively unneeded: due to the rather physical nature of the game it is obviously better to stand up clear of any other objects, but it is possible to play the entire game without ever moving your legs. The option to enable 90\u00b0 turning via the touchpads also makes it possible to play entirely still without turning around, especially useful if you are confined to a 180\u00b0 playspace.\n\nThe game is relatively high on the discomfort scale: the lack of touchpad locomotion (arguably the most prone to causing simulation sickness) in favor of dragging/armswinging is rather comfortable in itself, but the game has a lot of forced movement in the form of slippery platforms, ziplines, trampolines and of course plenty of falling down. The sense of vertigo is also very prominent for obvious reasons and while the game does not pretend to be a cure for a fear of heights, enough time spent toying around with it will greatly dull the effect.", "timestamp_created": 1498315719, "timestamp_updated": 1498315719, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32672168": {"recommendationid": "32672168", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036057832", "num_games_owned": 984, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 40, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498208200}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun and robust idea as long as you are absolutely immune to motion sickness..\n\nPro: Exciting and immersive.

I recommend this to anyone looking for a real Room-Scale game. Movement in this game feels so real. To run you grab the grip buttons and move your hands and arms like you would if you were actually running.. well unless you're weird and run with your hands down like you're an anime ninja. Anyway, you jump by basically grabbing the air and pulling yourself into a jump. A \"Dyno\" in rock climbing terms. I would recommend changing the direction movement to controller rather than headset. Makes walking thin platforms easier in my opinion. \n\nSo what makes this game so cool for me was the community in the game. Games filled up pretty quick, though most of the time with VR games for me it seems to be the time of day and when a game is new. Overall multiplayer was smooth. No lag when anyone connected, I grouped up with about six people no problem, and no lag with other players. I actually ended up getting taught by some kid which I thought was rather interesting. He showed me how to propperly jump, assisted me in climbing, and even let me hop on his backpack when I couldn't land some jumps. It was honestly wicked cool of that kid to show me. But I also saw how easy it was to teach the game. You could literally hold your hand out as an extra grab point and pull up someone. You can point at things, talk to them, and just interact with them on such a deeper level than traditional gaming. Then to have a workshop setup where you can create your own map only blows up that potential. I thought I got pretty good when I was beating most of the default maps on my first run around 1 min laps. Some other guys joined and banged out the same run in 20 seconds. Some craazy shit when you think someone is actually moving like that in real life. \n\nOverall I am happy with my purcahse. \nIf I could recommend anything I'd say I would just polish up graphics a bit. The game is still a work in progress so before I actually say anything negitive I'd like to point out any and all flaws could potentialy be fixed by the time you read this. Really my only complaint is that the tutorial is actually hard if you've never played, which is the purpose of tutorials. Some parts are easy while others take some pretty good accurracy and skill to land. Tutorial should be more basic climbing and make it more apparently you have the ability to set check points. I saw a board that said checkpoint in the beginning that was just there, but I quickly read it and moved onto whatever seemed like a play button.

The graphics and art style leave a lot to be desired, but the rest of the game blew my expectations away.\n\nClimbey is a fun, simple game with potentially infinite content. This is the exact type of game I want to see on VR. Easy to pick up yet is challenging, has responsive controls, and tons of non-repetitive content. It doesn't require a lot of room to play either, despite how much movement is in the game. Most of your real life movement will be arm flailing. Your character is far from stagnant, however. The walking mechanic has restored my faith that future VR titles can do locomotion well. It works well and feels natural. Jumping works just fine as well, but it's tricky to be accurate with it, and is one of the hardest parts of the game. I'm not sure if I have just gotten more use to VR or if it's the natural movements you have to make with your body to walk and jump in this game, but I did not feel any m otion sickness.\n\nThe user created levels expand the potential content of this game to the moon.  It's fun sitting in a lobby with other players and listent to the chit chat as every tries to make it through a course someone created.\n\nThe game is a bit physically demanding. Not to a great degree, but enough to break you out in a sweat. Just know what you're getting into. This is not a relax and unwind kind of game.\n\nI think Climbey is a must-have for new VR owners.

It doesn't utilise the teleportation method of travel as most VR games do and I absolutely love it for that. It's much more immersive needing to skillfully jump to get around, with the bonus of being able to run by swaying the controllers back and forth similar to running in place. Also has multiplayer and that's a huge plus for me; not many VR games currently support multiplayer and the few ones that do are also the highest rated -- surely not a coincidence, it's fun to interect with others in VR. \n\nSimple Pro/Con list for lovers of TL;DR-style: \n\nPROS:\n\nMultiplayer if you can manage to get players together for it. You can even grab onto other players' hands and they can help pull you up if you're struggling to progress. Lion King all over again. \n\nLevel editor. Not a big fan of it since it's in VR mode and not on the desktop, but it exists and for those people willing to stand up in their room for possibly hours and meticulously craft a level, I appreciate your dedication. \n\nImmersive movement. I can run, jump, and even use gestures with other players. Not everybody's a fan of manual movement and they might prefer teleportation to avoid nauseau, but I personally love it. \n\nChallenging, but not because I feel limited in what I can do. (like in other VR games) \n\nUpdated frequently. (As of December, 2016)\n\nYou can play \"Rock, Paper, Scissors\" with people online. Or just flip them off. I'm not judging anybody. \n\nGreat workout: Save money on gym, flail arms around in your room while wearing expensive blindfold, profit.\n\nA good amount of content for the price. Also a good amount of custom levels, some of which are very nicely-designed maps.\n\nCONS:\n\nNot many players, but as this game does have niche appeal, it's understandable. It's also a game that can be very physically demanding to play with all of the motions involved, so what players are around will likely tire out quickly.\n\nIt can be very buggy at times. It's not fair to dock anything for this as the game's freedom of controls allows for many variables and in general this isn't a rare issue with VR games as they're all early designs. There are a few technical issues, but nothing as severe as crashing or being unplayable. Again -- fully expected to have lots to iron out with a game like this. I hope to see this game a lot more polished in the future. \n\nMinimal graphics. For some probably too minimal. I personally like the clean look, wouldn't mind a few more choices for aesthetic.\n\n\n\nFinal thoughts:\n\nWould love to see a desktop version of the level editor included and more graphical options since the game is fairly barebones in its appearance so far. Aside from those gripes, it's my favourite VR game and at a great price. \n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1482889324, "timestamp_updated": 1482889324, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562504", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28731540": {"recommendationid": "28731540", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073462382", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 509, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497768338}, "language": "english", "review": "Edited as of 1/2/17  Ok.

The novelty just wears off and now that I'm more or less used to VR now it's become a worse experience for me. Many would argue that the steam workshop combatability creates limitless gameplay (to which I'd agree) it DOES not add new mechanics which the game in my opinion desperately needs. \n\n+The graphics are simplistic and cartoon-inspired which takes away the realism yet somehow adds to the fun.\n+Adrenaline is created through the vast heights and jumps you can make, but the novelty wears off \n+/- The robot is nice...? But I'd like to see him input more based on what you're doing and not what level you're on\n-The mechanics and novelty for me PERSONALLY just wear off too quickly to replay\n-The free demo is better then the game to a certain extent\n-The running locomotion is useless, found my self bunny hopping more then walking around\n\nOverall the game is still very nice and the potential here is large, this, in the future could be part of a massive open world VR genre and it brung out the inner parkour machine in me.

I don't feel any symptoms of motion-sickness until after an hour of gameplay!\n\n2. Most intuitive movement control system I've experience.\n\n3. Physics of falling and propelling yourself are good, although, you can jump like a grasshopper. That can be a bit disorienting.\n\n4. Steam Workshop Integration. I cannot stress how important this is. There are only 15 levels built in, the rest are all user made! Super cool, in my opinion.\n\n5. Multiplayer is good. Helping friends is neat, and voice chat is integrated.\n\n6. Add your own skyboxes and change your player color. Is there anything these guys didn't think of?\n\nCons? Not many.\n\n1. The in game level creator / editor isn't very easy to use. I'm a slow learner though, so perhaps thats just me.\n\n2. Sometimes I notice a bug whilst walking, my game doesn't always register that I've let go of the grip buttons and try to keep walking. I have to click them again to make them register.

So you can yoda them the whole time by staying on their back. Yoshi them where if they mess up you can use there body to jump off of. Or feel like a action hero trying to grap your friends hand whos hanging off a ledge.\n\n-3 YOU NEED IT very good for demoing to new people though may disorient them a little but just tell them to not move their physical body while their virtual one is and that will solve a lot of problems,\n\nFavorite part was in 1 of the first few missions there is a huge vertical wall that angles you eventually just hanging and gets my heart pumping so fast i loved it.", "timestamp_created": 1479118953, "timestamp_updated": 1479118953, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26594560": {"recommendationid": "26594560", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041296498", "num_games_owned": 148, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503546460}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun as fuck.

In Climbey you traverse massive levels by climbing, jumping, and walking through various obstacles in order to reach a destination. The most important thing with these kinds of games is accurate and satisfying movement and I feel that the developers have found that \"Super Meat Boy\" sweet spot in excellent traversal mechanics. The best thing about this game is that the movement for me (FYI I am very prone to motion sickness) did not cause me to get nauseas.\n\nAnother great aspect of this game is the fact that you can climb with other people. The experience is a lot like AltSpace or Rec Room in that you can carry on conversations and interact physcially with people that are half-way across the world from you. Hell, I just played with a bunch of Frenchman (I live in the United States) and it was a lot of fun getting to talk and interact with people that come from a competely different continent from me. \n\n[b] TL;DR [/b]\n\nThis is a great VR game that any Vive owner can throw a couple of hours into.

The climbing feels great, the jumping feels AMAZING once you get the hang of it, and the comfort options mean that I don't feel any sickness whatsoever.  \n\nBefore I jump into how I don't like a lot of this game, I want to emphasize that I still recommend it.  It's still a ton of fun, and the core mechanics are almost enough to carry the game, but there ARE issues.  These are issues that are pretty much entirely due to level design, which can be fixed by the developer.\n\nIt's early access, so poor level design is something that might improve, but the levels that come with the game feel like they were thrown together.  It really does not feel like any care or time was put into most of the levels past the tutorials.  The major problems are:\n\n- Difficulty curve that is all over the place.  Some levels have ridiculously precise jumps from walls that you need to do.  Then after those, you have some levels that are ridiculously easy, with almost no challenge at all.  The game lets you specify 3 checkpoints of your own per level, but some levels are so long that that is not nearly enough, and some levels are so short that even using 1 seems like overkill.\n\n- Lots and lots of waiting.  Most levels have moving platforms of some sort, and when you screw up, you'll spend a solid 5-10 seconds waiting for a platform to come back.  I got to what I think was level 10 or 11, with several platforms that each seemed to take over 10 seconds to rotate back around, and I got bored and closed the game.  It's a major problem in almost every one of the levels.  \n\n- Lots of repetitive gameplay.  I enjoy jumping, then turning around, and jumping again... but I don't really enjoy doing the exact same jump 8 times in a row.  There are a lot of areas in the level that are very long, skinny platforms that just take a long time to walk across, and there's really no reason for them to be that long.  Same with several climbing-up-the-wall segments.  Moving through some of these levels feels like a chore.\n\n- Levels don't do a good job at eaching mechanics at all.  About 8 or 9 levels in, you're finally shown the sort of \"ice platform\" where you can get a lot of speed, but the game hasn't explained the mechanic at all, and never gave you the chance to really learn what to do with it.  That point in the level is preceded with... just a bunch of very easy to traverse moving platforms.  The dev could easily have taken the earlier parts of the level to gradually introduce the ice mechanic, but instead just makes you do it once for a HUGE jump that isn't intuitive at all.\n\n- Levels are just... not elegantly designed.  They feel thrown together.  Huge walls that are huge for no reason.  Some levels have multiple routes, some have a single route that's not obvious at all.  Lots of random jumping on tiny platforms.  \n\nYou can excuse some of this, the game comes with a built-in level editor, but I really hope that the dev takes some time and goes through each level with some more care.  Early levels should be teaching one or two mechanics, gradually increasing their difficulty, and then testing your mastery of those mechanics.

It tells you to hold the triggers and move in a walking motion, but this will only move u forward one step and then right back to where u started, u can let go of one trigger and ull do some terrible stutter step, so to move u basically do the jump motion and leap frog everywhere. Edit: I have since been told after the fact that the grips walk to prevent the leap frog motion.  This may be true, but easily overlooked since there are no diagrams during the tutorial.  Aside from that, the jumping is still aweful as I explain below, still dont recommend a game where u fight the controls more than u fight the levels.\n\nThe game lost its fun on the third level of the tutorial, i was messing around and setting checkpoints but i jumped three times and got to the last platform, ran out of checkpoints and had to make the jump...i did this like 8 times, jumped three platforms perfectly, got to the last one, and no matter how i jumped, it would either sent me straight into the air, backwards...most of the time backwards.  I lost my sense of joy and forfieted and just went on to the next level.   But even then after about 2 or 3 great jumps, the controls would throw me in a random direction and i would fall and start over again.  I could only do this so much before refunding, when your core mechanic is glitchy at best, you cant charge 8 dollars for it.\n\nSecond Edit: I have also learned from this review the extreme toxicity of the playerbase due to the unknown walking motion, however all of the angry ppl didnt address the jumping issues, which is literally 95% of the this garbo game.  This game fails on alot more fronts than i thought and really glad i didnt continue to play multiplayer with these kinds of people.  I guess instead of staying positive and getting more people into VR, we can show them how toxic we all are and let VR die since we already can barely get 50 people on a top game like onward...thank goodness for refunds.", "timestamp_created": 1477949405, "timestamp_updated": 1478545427, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.289447", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26340634": {"recommendationid": "26340634", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100434268", "num_games_owned": 191, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 878, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510415498}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is a great workout if you want it to be and has a really smooth and smart locomotion system that is greatly suited to climbey. the multiplayer and workshop support is awesome also as it means the amount of maps are endless and they both adds some spice for anybody that was starting to somehow grow bored.

Hands down, best VR climbing game out at the time of this review. No question.\n\nI have been having a lot of fun with this game. I'm sure it will also be one of the games I show friends after they get the hang of VR. \n\nWith the level editor and nice steamworkshop so you can try out other people's levels, I think this game is worth $10. I spent about an hour in the level editor and made a really cool level and submitted it. Right now there are only a few levels. It's looking like a few new levels are coming out each day. There'll probably be more this weekend since that'll give players the freetime to make more levels. If you were to just play the levels the game comes with, you'd finish the game in maybe 45 minutes to an hour.\n\nUnfortunlatly I couldn't find anyone online. It seems like one of those things where you and your friend have to agree to get online at the same time. The main problem I think is that the lobby forces someone to stand in an empty room and wait. This is a problem because it's super boring to wait, so the longest I've been able to make myself wait is about 3 minutes before I give up and just play singleplayer. Assuming everyone else is like me, there would never be any games online. I think it's be great if players could join you mid game. If the dev is looking for a method that involves writing no code, at least make the waiting room more of an open playground or something. Hell, just swap out that empty box room with the demo level. That'd be perfect.\n\nThe number 1 reason why I love this game is the feeling of \"Don't look down, don't look down, shit I looked down.\" Is soooo terrifying! The higher up I climb, the more I feel like I could fall and die. If you love being scared of heights in VR, you will absolutly love this game. There were so many moments where I was holding onto a ledge for dear life.

You can walk into the direction you're looking by swinging your arms or alternatively \"throw\" yourself around the world by \"grabbing the air\" with both hands.

After trying the demo I was hooked by the way it felt to basically do super-human VR parkour. I would HIGHLY recommend trying the demo, especially since it is free and you have nothing to lose. Even though it is limited it does a great job showcasing the potential with the game. However, I wasn't prepared for the feeling I would have going through the various levels in the full game.  \n\nThe game's movement mechanics really lend themselves to VR and is what sets this game apart from anything else on the Vive. It's easy to get completely immersed once you start pumping your arms like a sprinter and start swinging around and flying through the air like some sort of crossfit Spiderman. The amount of freedom you have when completing the level is what I really love about the game and it utilizes room scale nicely. There are so many ways to tackle the various obstacles and challenges that are placed before you. Also since there is a more natural mapping to how your actions translate to movement in the game I didn't experience any type of motion sickness whatsoever and felt empowered beyond imagination. However, if you do get motion sickness there are options to help minimize this.\n\nThere were two moments I experienced that really blew me away and solidified this game as one of my favorites. The first is when instead of trying to climb across a beam to cross a gap I decided to just jump as high and far as I could. After swinging my arms downward as hard as I could I basically did a Hulk jump and somehow landed directly on the goal after flying through the air for a few seconds. The second was when I had to reach a goal that was below me that I had to reach while flying through the air at high speed. Based on my trajectory it looked like I was going to barely miss it so I dove on the ground backwards at the last second and was able to barely grab the goal.\n\nThe fact that this game will have online play AND a level editor which allows for community created content makes me fully anticipate that the replay value for this game will be off the charts.

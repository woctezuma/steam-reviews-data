Most games like this bore me really fast but Clone Drone has held my attention for two campaign chapters and enocuraged me to make two maps. Really quickly I'll go through the big positives.\n\nPros:\nCombat is fast, fluid, and easy to understand.\nKilling enemies like Spidertron 6000 looks and feels great.\nGame has a level editor.\nDismemberment looks and feels awesome.\nGreat upgrade system that allows new players to get what they need and lets veterans get what they want fast. The upgrade system doesn't hold you down or limit you.\n\nNow for the cons. I should mention that I really like Clone Drone, however since the game is in early access it is flawed.\n\nCons:\nArchers are annoying. Very annoying. You basically dance around them waiting for an opening.\nThe Level Editor is annoying. Consistent issues, no ease of use, limited enemies and a plethera of other problems.\nYou can't move your sword mid attack. On one hand I get it. every attack is commitment. one can't just spam attacks while frantically moving the mouse hoping to score a kill against a difficult sword enemy. However when fighting spidertrons hitting higher points on their legs is a total chore and hassle.\nThe duels are underwhelming. I remember my first 1v1 duel with a high level sword bot. I was excited, being a big fan of the combat system and wanting to see what high level ai could do to me. Well I jetpacked forward and killed it instantly. What a shame.\nThe Hammer. I hate the hammer. I understand the point of the hammer. However using the hammer is a chore. Using a hammer consists of beginning your swing while backing up from the approaching the enemy. After the hammer swing is ready move cloe to destroy the enemy. Don't get me wrong the hammer has its purpose but isn't as much fun as the laser sword or bow.\nMy final con is a big one: Optimization. The game for the most part runs fine on my 1060 6gb and 3.5 ghz 6 core cpu. However when I put in Fleet Overseers the game dipped to 20 fps when they used their laser attack.\n\n\nFinal Verdict:\nAll in all I've had a lot of fun with Clone Drone so far and expect to enjoy myself more in the future. While the game has its fair share of flaws the good outways the bad here.

I had every upgrade possible.  I would like to see at least an increase in enemies when getting to obsurd rounds.  Secondly i would personally enjoy hidden achievements like getting to rounds 20 30 40 etc, shooting a bow at the commentator or at the king because currently it does nothing if you shoot at them.  maybe if you hit upgrade bot enough he explodes and you cant get anymore upgrades for that run, just things fun like that.

It's easy to get into initially, and as you get better the gameplay seems to expand.

This may just be me, but I have stuck to his philosophy for many games and most of them I enjoy and were time well spent. Do I think you could get 15 hours out of this game? Yes, but you really need to like this game. For an average player who just plays the story mode you would get around 4-6 hours depending on the person. I have played endless mode, workshop maps and even twitch mode. Those other games modes I have listed are very fun to do and now that they added the workshop you can in theory get 10's of hours of more game play just by playing those. Personally I enjoy the gameplay and the story of the game. If this game is 15 dollars and is released with the full story and all the modes they want to add I'd 100% say it is worth it, if you like games like paint the town red, I'd highly suggest this game to you. \n\nPros: Fun machanics\nFun game play\nGood controls\nA good amount of difficulty\nWorkshop maps\nEach update adds something new/needed to the game\n\nCons:\nStory still not finished\nTwitch mode feels like it is really lacking, spawning one or two enemies every few rounds is boring for both the player and the viewer. \nThe updates are a few months a part and the story mode updates are even longer\n\nOver all rating: 7/10\nTo sum it all up, this game is really fun to play on and off with the workshop maps, there are a few bugs since it is still in early access and the twitch mode isn't very fun.

I got this game quite a while ago an unlike other Early Access games out there the developers of this game actually update it regually with big updates such as challenge modes and whole new sections of the 'campain'.\n\nIt's most basically a sword fighting game although you control your swings which isn't too common but you see in games such as Mount & Blade and the dead For Honor but it comes down to never using the downards swing since it has such a small hit box while the side to side swing. And with the weapons, unlike just being a large stick that you swing and it does X damage, they actually matter where they hit. Since your player and the enemies are voxel based they take damage depending on where they get hit. You or them get hit in the leg and you'll be hopping around like a slow moving idiot. Get your arm cut off and you'll be more easily stunned when a bad guy blocks your attack.\n\nThey added in a few new abilities and weapons from when I first got this game, such as the hammer, flaming weapons and things like the jetpack. But just with the hammer I breezed through things since the bad guys can't block a hammer swing and it's pretty much an instant kill no matter where you hit them since if you hit them in the legs they lose them both and die instantly and if you hit them in the side they die instantly. The only downside is that the hammer swings a tad slow and you can't block arrows with the hammer but if you just zig zag you can dodge them easiliy enough. But because there's such a varity of bad guys in the game it means you have to change tactics with each one like with the jetpack doods or Spindertrons. Don't get me even started with Spindertron!\n\nWhile there isn't too much with the story you still get attached to your characters with nothing but a name, age and favourite colour. Although it seems I'm always stuck with people who are 80+ in age which does take away from it a tad. It takes place in the future where robots have taken over the universe and enjoy killing and tormenting humans by putting their minds in robotic bodies and having them fight other robots in The Danger Zone. You're a clone of the human in a drone. You could say you play A Clone Drone in the Danger Zone...\n\nOkay that wasn't that funny...\n\nBut as you play through either the story or challenges you have two comintators judging you and maing fun of you in an over the top way that makes it enjoyable and even more fun than the gameplay already is. All in all this game has so much potental with the story finishing up and it coming out of early access and even at this point its a really fun game that is really worth getting if you get the chance.\n\n(Note that my playtime is low, but I've played a lot of this but mainly in offline mode where steam doesn't think it counts and I played it before it was even on steam.)", "timestamp_created": 1507381272, "timestamp_updated": 1507381337, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500315", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35542858": {"recommendationid": "35542858", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142465692", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510537952}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Muito divertido.

Clone Drone is very well made (with a few issues) and can soak up your time. Be warned, however, you will be frustrated during your journey into this game, but not due to any glitches or technical issues.\n\nYour human-bot is fragile. \nAny significant damage to your head will kill you.\nLost both arms and have no kick? Dead.\nTake an arrow to the wrong area of your chest? Dead.\nShot an arrow at a level 3 sword-bot at too close a distance? D-e-a-d.\nLost a leg to some jetpack-bots and can't move far? Might as well be dead.\n\nSome people hate that kind of thing, but I'm a glutton for punishment, so I loved it. \n\nThe next thing you should know is that there are several ways to play; there is the Story Mode, the 'classis' Endless Mode and the Challenge Modes.\n\nStory Mode is unfinished as of this review, but the developers are currently working on it, and it is a great way to introduce yourself to the concepts of the game. \n\nEndless Mode is just that, endless. Each of your human-bots are pitted against an endless supply of more and more difficult arenas that you have to survive (or die and use a clone to survive).\n\nChallenge Modes will put you through a set amount of arenas with restrictions, such as bow-only, hammer-only and kick-only. There is also Steam Workshop support, so if you're into creating challenges to torture others, you can, or if you're a masochist like me you can take on those challenges.\n\nThe gameplay starts simple but complicates in varying degrees. You start with a lazer sword and the movement speed of a Jazzercising grandmother, but each successfully completed level grants you one upgrade. You can choose to make your sword a fire sword which gradually burns away bits of your enemies for a bleed-like effect, or give yourself a bow, which gives you a slow-moving but effective projectile at dispatching enemy archers and flame raptors (No, that's not a typo).\n\nAlternatively you can use the upgrade points to create 'clones' of your human-bot. These serve as your extra lives, and you are limited to 5 total per run. Period. Recently the developers added a 'repair' function as well that you can spend your well-earned point on.\n\nThe upgrade point system is where some will get frustrated, and others intrigued. For example, do I risk not having a clone for the start of the Gold-difficuty levels and buy the booster-style jetpack, or do I play it safe in case I get ambushed in the next level and die? The wrong choice could end your run, but then again, your personal skill will do you in just as quickly.\n\nSince this game is Early Access, I can only imagine that things will expand and get better as time moves on.

I beat levels without doing a single hit\n\n\nConclusion:\nThe game offers a lot of potential, with the good combat system that allows you to slice enemys apart and cripple them, you might have a lot of fun. The levels are well designed, and some challenges are really hard to beat so you have to make up a good strategy. Thanks to the level editor and the workshop, you get an infinite flow of challenges to beat. Unfortunately, i've been waiting for the third story chapter quite a while now... and there isnt any sign of it coming soon. That is the only reason why i have mixed feelings about this game. After all, it was worth the 20 bucks and i had a great time.\n\n\nTL;DR:\nFreaking jedi robots and flame spitting robot dinosaurs!", "timestamp_created": 1503570574, "timestamp_updated": 1503570574, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34456656": {"recommendationid": "34456656", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982853608", "num_games_owned": 602, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 703, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511756347}, "language": "english", "review": "Killer robots who try to destroy and/or decapacitate you through kicks, hammers, bows, swords and the commentators who constantly insult you and the Human race in very amusing dialogues!

I get that's the point, but going through the early levels again & again is a bit tiresome. To be clear, once you clear a certain number, you do get a \"checkpoint,\" so no need to go through the WHOLE game again. \n\u2665 Some upgrades feel more viable than others, which tend to just go ignored. For example - the hammer, despite its cool ability, feels supremely inferior to the sword.\n\u2665 Some higher level enemies (such as the raptor or hammer bots) don't feel very challenging. Probably dependent on playstyle though. \n\u2665 A bit more music variety would be nice, as the combat track does get somewhat repetetive after a while.\n\nAll in all, well worth the money, in my opinion.", "timestamp_created": 1501126222, "timestamp_updated": 1501126285, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33821812": {"recommendationid": "33821812", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073087380", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 95, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510370794}, "language": "english", "review": "love it", "timestamp_created": 1501119527, "timestamp_updated": 1501119527, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33804103": {"recommendationid": "33804103", "author": {"steamid": "76561198237493826", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 600, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507221539}, "language": "german", "review": "Ganz nice bis jetzt!", "timestamp_created": 1501058423, "timestamp_updated": 1501058423, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33796683": {"recommendationid": "33796683", "author": {"steamid": "76561198400860925", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2944, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 52, "last_played": 1513615436}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game!!!

That being said, you can defeat any level without a single upgrade, in theory.\nUpgrades help, add to your tactics (some weapons are better against some opponents), but you can use just a basic sword and environment to your advantage - sawblades, spikes, lava... Having Kick ability can be very handy in that regard. But the environment can be used against you, too.\nEverything is voxel based, so you can dismember (and be dismembered) during fights. It's cute to see those huge hammer bots skipping after you after you cut off one of their legs. And it's oddly satisfactory to cut off legs of spider bots bit by bit.\nCompleting challenges unlocks additional weapon upgrades (fiery weapons), which at first look just like a visual improvement, but in fact make them much more powerful.\nAlso, Steam workshop levels added, brings in some freshness to the game.\n\nIn short: buy it, try it, you won't regret it.\n\nOne thing it lacks - multiplayer.

Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.\n- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.\n- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.\n- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.\n- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.\n- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).\n- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn\u2019t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. \n\nFill the Ravioli shells.\n\n- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.\n- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.\n- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a \u201chomemade\u201d touch as well.\n- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.\n- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. \n\nForm the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.\n\n- Roll the dough into two sheets\n- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.\n- Fill with the ravioli mixture.\n- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.\n- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.\n\nCook the Ravioli.\n\n- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.\n- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.\n- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest \n- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed plates\n\nServe it up.\nTop with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!", "timestamp_created": 1499220020, "timestamp_updated": 1499220020, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494704", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33249087": {"recommendationid": "33249087", "author": {"steamid": "76561198229510980", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 538, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509758146}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is extremley hard to win.

Up for a challenge? Try endless mode! Test your self!\n\nSeriously a really fun game, max amount of levels i've got to is 37 on endless mode, try and beat that! buy the game and challenge friends to see who can last the longest.\n\nThis game has its own type on mechanics, such as losing parts of the players body giving them a disadvantage and being able to upgrade the player after each level. Funny narrators, even though its text-to-speech (Funny just to have that) they add really good jokes that really do make me laugh after being stressed by a few levels xD. Levels are interesting but sometimes the same level pop up and it gets annoying after a while, but keep in mind its still early access!\n\nStory mode, is interesting and i can see it will be way greater in the future and i seriously cant wait for it!\n\nFun to play in spare time to challenge your self, or to even build a character to be hard to play or even easy to play to mess around! Workshop is there for more challenges and theres even a level editor! now thats like a dream come true to me, i love designing!\n\nThis review may seem all over the place, but well thats how i type.

Spolier shown in the trailer.\n\nPLAYSTYLE:\nAt the moment you have a few different categories of playstyles to chose from:\nStory:\nPlaying through levels of differnet difficulties and somewhere find a story (not like AAA kind of story but a understandeble story).\nSPOILERS: The story isn\u00b4t completed yet.\n\nChalenges:\nPlaying through levels of different difficulties but with at twist depending on what chalenge you chose. Most of them are for a specific weapon which will unlock cool abileties conected to that weapon after completed the whole series of levels (10 - 14 levels).\n\nTwitch mode:\nPretty obvious, but in simple terms; you play with your stream and the viewers can chose which enemis will come next or choose your upgrades (never trust your viewers in this mode >:D).\n\nHOW IT FEELS PLAYING\nIt feels pretty solid but has a few bugs that are sometimes funny to experience.

This game is really fun and offers a lot in what it already has. The ability to slice enemies in half is very satisfying and with the addition of photo mode, you are able to set up really cool shots. It is still early in development and many features are still being added. However, there are still many things that do hold this game back. Some of which are very hard to control. As it is now, I would definitely recommend this game. It is fun and very playable even. I play games in waves and will play a game until I lose interest. This game has been one of the very few that is fun to go back to and play fro a while.\n\nFor this review it is important to take in all the factors that may alter the game. As far as I know (please correct me if I'm wrong) there are only 2 dedicated developers who work directly on the game. With that in mind they have lives and deserve to take breaks. Though they did make this commitment to the community they should in now way feel obligated to give up their entire life. \n\nI would also like to say I am just a customer who wants to know what I think. Keep that in mind that everyone has different preferences and you might find something wrong or great about the game that I didn't. I am not trying to tell you to buy this game, I just want to give you my opinion to help with your decision.\n\nPros:\n- Addicting game play that is fun to both play and watch\n- Passionate developers that want to help the best they can and want to talk with the customers\n- Twitch mode allows for streamers to be challenged by the viewers and adds a bit of unpredictability to the game mode\n- The workshop is a great place to see what people are making and adds something different to mix things up. The new update that adds color customization adds so much more. It allows you to make the map truly how you see it.\n- The enemies in the game offer a wide verity of obstacles that allow for experimentation with which ones work well together\n- The Game play is different from other many other games that gives a unique and clever game that has the violence and fighting as many hand to hand combat games but in a cartoonist and child friendly way\n- the commentators are funny and have a wide variety of comments so that it doesn't become repetitive after a while\n- flameraptors are really fun. They have a lot of potential and are hard to beat if you don't know their weakness. this leads me to the con though. The bow makes the flameraprots easy. this might have been on purpose but I think it should be a little harder.\n\nCons:\n- There are bugs that are not all bad or that big but do sometime take away from the games experience\n- (as of now) story mode is very interesting and has a lot of potential but is still in development and not that long. As of now the two chapters are very similar except with different enemies and a different ending. The ending of the second chapter is interesting and makes me excited to see what will happen next. \n- There are still some balancing issues that should be fixed such as the bow. It is a great weapon once you get fire arrows and slow time but at a certain point is still no mach for the sword\n- The hammer is great in my opinion and has good damage to wield-ability but doesn't have as much depth as it could. I think there should be more ways it can interact with enemies.\n- kickbot only because they have killed me so many times and have been the end of many endless mode runs. (yes I am still salty) the only other thing with these is maybe having a different kind.\n\nSome bugs that one person points out may not have happened yet to another or might be a rare occurrence. If you find a bug please let the developers know because that shows how prevalent it is and has a higher chance of being acknowledged.\n\nOverall the Game is great and is ever improving. If you can look past some of the fixes that exist in a lot of games than it is really fun and addictive. As with every rating, don't use this as the deciding factor and even though I would highly recommend the game, know that you and I are different and you won't fully know until you play for yourself. If this game doesn't interest you now but looks kind of fun, keep checking on it because that one little update could be what you were looking for.

I do have some recomendations though! 1st. They should make the robots not jump alot because if your up aginst a level 3 hammer bot they jump and swing to the side. The Hammer is so big you cant dodge it! 2nd. I think they sound make a pvp arena and teamwork mode. 3rd it would also be really cool if they made a championship. 4th.

Then, you inevitably lose to something foolish. finally, when you start back at the beginning, the enemies at this point are so different in regards to how accurate they are and how fast they can attack. it's almost impossible to go from the silver tier back down to bronze and make any progress after. So basically, unless you are already in a good mood or have infinite patience, this game will be fun-right up until you make the smallest error. Then you lose a limb, which takes away any upgrades that you've already purchased that utilize that limb. If you survive that round, then to get your limbs and upgrades back you must forfeit your next upgrade to purchase a clone. \nThese are just issues I've noticed playing. It seems to me that too much emphasis is placed on the importance of purchasing clones, rather than upgrades that you can then learn to use to survive longer. My recommendation to the programming team; maybe repair the player's robot between matches? or maybe just replace 1 missing limb?\nI very much like how balanced the gameplay is and that the game runs very smoothly, and would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes arena-style gameplay; just make sure that you're in a good mood, because every mistake is punished severely...",

Right now, even though I love the game and it is really fun, I get bored doing the same thing over and over again. I also really, really want a multiplayer for this game. It would be so fun just to fight to the death and get an upgrade every time you kill another person. I also think it would be cool if you could create maps, like make shipment from Call of Duty for example. Wouldn't it be cool if you could go from third to first person in the game? Just a thought. Finally, I think that it would be cool if you could create your own character. I know that it would be hard to do but it would be cool.

against AI in an arena filled with enemies and traps. While at first it seems simple, the combination of the different enemies soon turns it into a battle of quick reactions and tactical use of your available weapons. The story mode provides a good tutorial into the game by being moderately difficult, abeit rather short with only 2 chapters (more to come). The main chunk of the gameplay comes from challenge mode and endless mode, with twitch mode being obviously something that only twitch streamers would sink time into, though it is definitely a fun mode as well.\n\nEndless mode is basically just the player versus wave after wave of robots, following the same structure as the story mode. After each wave you return to your lobby and use a skill point to upgrade your robot. The maps come in groups of bronze, silver, gold, diamond and titanium with each map either being one shared between them all with an increase in enemy tier or a map unique to that difficulty. The enemies slowly progress as the game goes on to increase the variety and while it is more common to see the tier 3 and 4 enemies towards titanium, lower tiers can still appear as well to sneak in a cheeky killing blow while your guard is down. One of the best parts of this mode is the combination of the enemies which forms a formidable force to fight against. For example, a single Mark 3 Sword Robot might be easy to handle on it's own, but add any archer bot to the mix and suddenly you can have an arrow that you dodged deflected into your back by the sword robot. Another example of this was a kick bot knocking me into the swing of a hammer, perfectly positioning me for the killing blow. The interaction between the enemies results in random and interesting fights each time you play.\n\nThe second time sink mode is Challenge Mode. This requires the player to follow handicaps such as using the hammer or bow only, as well as other ones such as random (clone always) upgrade challenge where the upgrade is randomly selected for you, forcing you to (respawn a lot) change your playstyle according to (how many clones you got) what skills you were given. It's a fun mode and it even rewards you with bonus abilities that can be used in endless mode as well as a cool statue in your lobby area.\n\nI've followed this game since it was on itch.io and it's been fantastic. For an EA game it is quite solid and I've rarely run into any bugs that have broken the game. The content gets updated regularly so that it feels like you have something significant to come back to whenever you see this game has a patch. With the recent addition of photo mode it's also a blast just to try and show off to get a cool looking photo. Overall this is a fantastic game that is well worth the money and time.\n", "timestamp_created": 1491110261, "timestamp_updated": 1491110261, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30892953": {"recommendationid": "30892953", "author": {"steamid": "76561198254631916", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 590, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508713548}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is awesome game because....\n\u2022 Attention to detail (Ex. each hit can decapitate or cut a bot in half with good timing)\n\u2022 Voxel type of art style\n\u2022Story's logic/ plot checks out\n\u2022 Very intense battles with high room for skill\n\u2022 You have the tallest skill ceiling in the world \n\u2022 \"Fair\" battles where you have 1 crutch over the enemy since you are out numbered\n\u2022 Twitch mode is unique way to get streamers involved in the game", "timestamp_created": 1491109491, "timestamp_updated": 1491109491, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30892620": {"recommendationid": "30892620", "author": {"steamid": "76561198252996132", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 367, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511240331}, "language": "english", "review": "Good", "timestamp_created": 1491107949, "timestamp_updated": 1491107949, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30890079": {"recommendationid": "30890079", "author": {"steamid": "76561198354706071", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1100, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495500764}, "language": "english", "review": "What an amazing game 10/10 awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1491095786, "timestamp_updated": 1491095786, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30884339": {"recommendationid": "30884339", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112714478", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512956260}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] Great Everything![/h1]\nThis game is great, the devs are great and the community is great.

select few level builders, because it affects me and there is nothing being done about it, i simply cannot under any circumstance, give the game a posative review given the state of the forums.\n------------------------------\nsection 1: content breakdown\n------------------------------\n\nThe level editor in itself is well built, less unpredictible and generally rounded well, but it alone is not a full package, the workshop its connected to is litteral garbage, try as hard as you want to make nice content, simply putting up ret@rded spam is going to make you more popular anyway, dont waste your time or effort with this feature, it is a waste of time.\n\nThe main game functions perfectly well, though performance could still be optimised.\n\nIntergration features work perfectly well, however they are being exploited by a select few individuals.\n\n------------------------------\nsection 2: community and developers\n------------------------------\n\nThere isnt much to say about the developers, eric is as stuborn and simple minded as ever, the other two developers build a game, its fine, its what youd expect, but unfortunetly, the community is more than developers...\n\nThe twitch communites growth is negative, the viewer averages across the day are decreasing, (foreign streams do not count- being streams that dont regularly visit), as for the viewers, well they are viewers, they reflect the community, and it really shows when you stream, the average age given is <13, which is probably why it is unfavorable to stream this game\n\nThe workshop is the biggest faliure the game has, underused, underprotected and ultimetly ignored, full of spam, creative property being stolen, rude content, and generally a poor attitude, its had its day, its allready dying.\n------------------------------\nsection 3: bullet points overview (pros vs cons)\n------------------------------\n\nPros:\n----\n*has twitch intergration\n*level editor itself is good\n*is value for money (\u00a31>5H playtime)\n*features a unique concept\n*commentary is good quality\n*reliable generally\n----\n\nCons:\n----\n*Still highly buggy\n*Community has degraded below anything i am willing to deal with\n*Community numbers are dying off\n*Overall interest on external sites is almost non-existant\n*Content creators ignore the workshop due to its ridiculously low quality given its potential\n*Level ratings are not based on quality\n*Lack of tournements\n*Underused forum\n*Lack of showcases for \"high quality items\"\n*Hostile users\n*Low user age\n*Non-diverse content created due to a lack of workshop compatibility with twitch mode\n*enourmous memory issues with spidertrons\n*various other breakages with enemies and their AI\n*currently more than 100+ listed bugs\n*extremely poor performance given simplicity\n*level editor is shackled with restrictions and a poor camera\n----\nConclusion\n\nAs hard as the developers try, if they continue to ignore the community, the game will rot inside out before it is even given a full story, if i were them, id make a botched exit and abandon it in its current state as a failed project, it attraced the wrong mixes of crowds, and the community fell apart due to a lack of moderation, remember, numbers arnt everything, quality is needed too.\n---------------\noverall ratings\nEndless gameplay: 9/10 (Almost garunteed reliability and a good vannila level spread for titanium, though still needs a higher challenge for titanium)\nCommunity and developers: 0.5/10 (Uncensored, full of spam, an utter joke in its current state)\nLevel editor: 5/10 (Editor is perfect, the workshop connected to it isnt)\nWorkshop: 0/10 (Physically unusable, spam ridden, full of trolls and \"review bombs\", not worth using)\nIntergration: 6/10 (More work needed to make levels twitch compatible)\nReliability: 6/10 (Though the game can reliably be played, it lack of solidity with blocks quickly unravels a large ammount of issues)\nCompatibilty: 4/10 (memory leaks with tabs has become almost unbearable, if you want to use the game, make sure its the only thing open and you dont click out of it)\n----------\n\nGlobal Overall Rating: 2.5/10 (Only usable in singleplayer without the workshop, Genrally poor)", "timestamp_created": 1491046433, "timestamp_updated": 1499969393, "voted_up":

Endless mode, infinite maps that you need to kill all the robots to pass to the next level. Challenge, 7 realy hard challenges (at least I think they are hard). More than the 3 main modes there is a twich mode, really usefull.

"playtime_forever": 1476, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498200075}, "language": "english", "review": "I just love this game. It has funny dialogue, a decent combat system, and a pretty large variety of upgrades. Each robot human has their own occupation, age, and favorite color, which may not seem like anything important, but still adds diversity to the game.The controls work after getting used to them. You can lose almost every body part and still keeping working.(losing limbs may provide disadvantages.) One thing that I found out about this game is the strategies. They change based on your experience in the game, until you form the most efficient techniques. I love how rage inducing and comedic this game can be. To explain my feelings toward this game, I will divide my text into four sections.(Useful info: the arena has five tiers, which are bronze, silver, gold, diamond, and titanium.) (Also, if you hate long text, then stop reading.)\n\nStory Mode- (without spoilers) This mode is a good introduction to the game. It contains an adequate difficulty curve and the story serves its purpose to make you continue. The basic rundown is that humans are being harvested, humans are being used for gladitorial entertainment, and you can not escape. Until they update this even more (I know the game is early acces) it will not contain the most playtime in the game. (but still check it out)\n\nTwitch Mode- Beforehand, let me notify you that I am not a twitch streamer. This mode is the most multiplayer esc mode. One person will livestream this and the viewers can bet on the streamers death, spawn enemies, and can make the crowd put out emojis. (the different robots sitting in the arena have emojis over their head) Also, the viewers can give the streamer clones.(max five) They can also bet on which tier they die on. This is a jam packed mode, but the viewers can be relentless. The streamer will almost always die before gold tier. This may need some balancing, but please note that I haven't done this mode.\n\nEndless mode- Probably the best mode. (This or challenge mode) This is an endless gamemode (hence the name) that will progress you through the 5 tiers. The titanium tier will go on forever until you die. Each level you beat gives you one upgrade. (As goes everymode, I forgot to say this) Endless mode contains a fair difficulty curve, until you reach titanium. When you reach titanium, the game doesn't get any harder, which kinda sucks. This doesn't matter because titanium still is really difficult. You can test out strategies, mess around, or get serious and aim for a pb. (Mine is titanium 44, I beat 43 with one missing leg and another VERY small stub leg, oh, and a missing arm, quite a formidable score.) I spent probably the second most amount of time on this mode. (This will change because I will always go back to this mode). I highly recommend getting this game just for this mode.\n\nChallenge mode- I LOVED this. The challenges had variety and I would love more. Challenge mode currently contains four challenges. 1. The Inferno Challenge- In order to obtain (one of the best perks) flame breath, you must go through 10 stages of fierceful, flaming enemies that give you no room for error. This challenge was exciting and pretty difficult. For me this was the easiest, but for others, this seemed like the second hardest. 2.Random Upgrade Challenge- This one is all on the RNG and can be very rage inducing. I personally felt that this challenge was the hardest and took me the longest. I  decided to watch a video of someone trying it and laugh at them. (They beat it in their second try :(   ) This just gives you a trophy and is necessary for all of those completionists, so good luck ;). 3. Bow only Challenge- This challenge is self explanatory, you can only use a bow. Bow only is one of the most gamechanging challeges because some bots can block arrows.(you will find out how to kill those) The general opinion seems to be that this is the hardest challenge and I can agree. You will develop new strategies and manage to (not) make it to the top. Beating this gives you flame arrows, probably the worst of the 3 unlockable upgrades.(It isn't a bad upgrade, just the worst of the 3) 4. Hammer Challenge- As expected, one may only use a hammer. This was a pretty easy challenge after getting the hammer controls down. The Hammer Challenge unlocks a flaming hammer, which is fun to go around and crush people with. Note:All of these challenges give you trophies that will be next to your upgrade station.\n\nAll in all, this game has the already great content and even better potential. I thank the developers and urge them to continue updating this masterpiece. (My apologies for any missed information and scattered thoughts.) Oh, and by the way, I know this is unexpected, but I recommend this game. \"Such robot diversity\"", "timestamp_created": 1490500328, "timestamp_updated": 1490500712, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12,

Now that it's on [i]Steam[/i] I had to see what all the fuss was about.\n---\n\n[b][i]Clone Drone in the Danger Zone[/i] likely gained popularity primarly from [i]Twitch[/i] streamers, which automatically puts it in a fringe category thats not my usual jam.[/b] By 'fringe' I suppose I am loosely referring to games that get lots of knee-slap laughs and are quick and relatively lite. There is a even an option in-game to play with [i]Twitch[/i] viewers interaction. I was also surprised to find that this title is only single player. \n\n[i]Essentially, this is an 'arena' game where you fight wave-after-wave of enemies of increasing difficulty.[/i] There is a small but digestible skill tree of upgrades you choose from between each wave. You can get things like a jetpack, a fire sword, the ability to kick, more energy, etc. The choices are small, but they are potent which is all that matters. There are bosses and slightly different level layouts. The controls are fun and work well. Another interesting aspect is that there are robot commentators that say all kinds of semi-random and fun stuff that keep it fresh. This part probably did well with the streamers.\n\nWell, overall I found it enjoyable. I definitely see the appeal and will keep it, for sure. It's definitely something you play in short bursts. For instance, I've played for a mere 30-40 minutes before writing this, and that felt like a long time. That was over probably 6 play sessions. I enjoyed them all, but tire quickly after a burst.\n\nThe one thing that I have to say is that it probably isn't worth $15. Yeah, it is well done and it is [i]fun[/i], but I think a $10 tag would sit better with me. I think the content is kind of slim for $15. The skill tree is quite limited, and the combat is relatively simple. There is no controller support, either.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+It is fun. In fact, I think the trailer doesn't capture it well enough. You have to try this to actually [i]get[/i] the draw (or at least I did).\n+While there isn't much content, what is there is high quality.

Jetpack Bots, Hammer Bots, Mark II Hammer Bots, Mark II Sword Bots, Mark I Archer bots, you get the jist of it. The goal of the game is simple. To try and get to the hardest arena and beat it. At the end of every sub-level of fighting, you go down an elevator and get a chance to get upgrades. This counts as getting an extra clone (life), getting kick mechanics, getting a bow or more! Maybe even a jetpack! This game is just slicing and dicing all the other competitors. There are traps to assist you too! Sawblades, Flame Throwers, Spikes, the lot! This game also has an Endless mode which proves that you can replay this game even after finishing it! This is a must buy game, if you want to feel like a robot slicing and dicing others! \n\nGraphics / Visuals - This game reminds me of the game Trove by the graphics used.

The combat is voxel based, meaning damage is based entirely on where the weapon hits, rather than arbitrary numbers, which greatly adds to the immersion and combat. The weapons are varied, fun to use, and useful, while the enemies also provide a wide variety of challenges. That, combined with the sheer amount of levels, means that there is massive replayability. The announcers provide funny dialogue, which gives this game personality you'd be hard pressed to find elsewhere, and makes Clone Drone stand out from other games in the same genre. While the game is not entirely without bugs (it is still early access), it is completely stable, with very few bugs, none of them gamebreaking.\n\nIn addition to all that the game has to offer already, its community and its dev team is also excellent. The creator regularly streams development of this game, and takes suggestions and feedback form the chat. Doborog can also be found in forums, both here and on itch.io, where it was originally released. In fact, the hammer bots in game were originally conceived by the community. The community of this game is funny, creative, with some avid fanfic writers thrown in. In addition, the development speed of this game results in major updates every month or so, each one making the game better than the last, adding new features and changes. \n\n\nIn conclusion, this is a magnificent game, with fast paced, fun, and varied combat, excellent humor, a great community and dev team, with a nice soundtrack to top it off. In other words, get it already.", "timestamp_created": 1489773918, "timestamp_updated": 1489773918, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.636696",

All i want to do is kill the king robot..\n\nEndless Mode is just like any other type of level based rogue like - get as far as you can and try to top the leaderboard!\n\nTwitch mode is an awesome addition for streamers looking for a bit more interactivity in their streams - viewers can spawn enemies, place bets and even give the player more clones!\n\nIm really impressed with the developers of clone Drone in the Danger Zone, the players were listened to, were included in the development and they even have some awesome development streams!\n\nIf your interested in checking put the Inferno challenge aswell as flame breath z here is a video showing the 10 stages to unlock: https://youtu.be/daSjYID98gw\n\n\nTL;DR: This game is a game i would spend $20 on,\u00a0 so its definatly worth its current price - especially if you are a teitch streamer.", "timestamp_created": 1489683819, "timestamp_updated": 1489683819, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.582384", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30544047": {"recommendationid": "30544047", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031063183", "num_games_owned": 208, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 3044, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 10, "last_played": 1514341626}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought this game through Itch.io and I have always loved it.

Ninety nine percent of the time, I'll never play any of those games ever again. If I do, it's only to make a video because \"other\" people seemed to enjoy it. Clone Drone in the Danger Zone is one of the very few games that I frequently return to to play for \"myself\". I absoulutely love this game.\n\nSo .. what makes it so good??\n\nWell, when I'm searching for a game to play for my own enjoyment, there are usually a few main factors that I look for. Firstly, I want a casual game that doesn't require me to sit down and invest obscene amounts of time in order to get anything done. I want to hop on, be able to play for anywhere between 5 and 60 minutes, and come out feeling like I achieved something or that I simply had a good time. I want simple gameplay mechanics that are accessible to anyone, but also allow for deeper, more technical and strategic gameplay, for those that are more familiar with the game and are looking for a challenge. I want CUSTOMIZATION and UPGRADE trees! I want to be able to build my character in the way I want; adding the skills and abilities that I feel suit whatever approach I'm currently taking. I also want something that's aesthetically appealing, but most of all, I want a dopea$$ soundtrack to accompany this otherwise perfect concoction of game elements - and guess what?? Clone Drone has one of the BEST sountracks that I have ever heard in a game, EVER.\n\nEven in its early stages over on Itch.io, Clone Drone has had unlimited replayability value since the implementation of its Endless Mode, and now with the latest update that brings Challenges and a whole bunch of other sweet bits and pieces, the future of Clone Drone is looking bloody brilliant. The developer is also insanely active in the community, regularly live streams the game's development as he does it, and is frequently adding new content to the game.\n\nI honestly can't praise this game enough. Clone Drone in the Danger Zone is the bee's frickin' knees. Get it.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOn a side note, I did a short video covering some of the new things added in the latest update, and the Random Upgrades Challenge mode.

Armed with 3 weapons each with different play styles, you take on the killer robots awaiting you in the arena. As you progress, you gain upgrades like a jetpack, or a clone that help you more efficiently dispatch the increasingly difficult enemies. \n\nGame Modes!\n\nThere is a developing story mode that is intriguing, but currently incomplete. (They are working on it, sometimes in front of you with dev streams) There are currently 2 chapters to play.\n\nEndless Mode is what you probably will spend most of your time on. With so many levels, divided into 5 difficulties, you try and get as far as possible before your inevitable death. Can you reach Titanium?\n\nI haven\u2019t played the Challenges as of this review, but they contain various challenges to hone your skills. Hammer, Bow, Inferno, all of them provide a unique re-playability to the already awesome game.\n\nDon\u2019t forget Twitch Mode! That\u2019s right, a mode designed for TWITCH STREAMING! This is, by far, the most difficult mode. So participate in killing the unfortunate streamer, or stream it yourself.\n\nClone Drone in the Danger Zone is always improving, with enemies, weapons and upgrades. \u00a0\n\n\nTL;DR \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Honestly it is the best game I have played and would recommend it to anyone.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 9.98/10", "timestamp_created": 1489676225, "timestamp_updated": 1489676225, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567240", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30542421": {"recommendationid": "30542421", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963043559", "num_games_owned": 422, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512086959}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Um jogo incr\u00edvel com um potencial de crescimento enorme.

The lists of each are apparently incredibly long. Your robot does a series of motions as they are hurtled toward their first arena bout, that communicate, in order: Sweet, I have a sword (up-beat) ; wait I'm a robot!>?!?!? (down-beat); I have no control over my fate (down-beat); well, I better do the best I can (up-beat).  No really, watch it closely. \n\n Add to this  the ongoing storyline of the robot empire coming towards earth and harvesting human minds along the way, and it means that:\n\n1) each robot you play as had a life that was shattered by being \"harvested\" by the robots.\n\n2) each time commentatron and analysis bot mention previous \"contestants\" in the arena, they are referring to your previous playthroughs.\n\nIt generates, at a whole lot of different levels, buy-in and determination to overcome the game's pretty severe difficulty. You're doing it for yourself (both you as the player and you as the robot character), you're doing it to fight back against the robots, you're doing it to get revenge for your fallen fellow harvested humans, and you're doing it to save humanity.

If you want to make sure you keep your trophies, make sure to back up the ChallengeData.json before trying a data reset.\n\nAnd if you are getting any red screen on crash, send along a screenshot so we can narrow down what's going on!\n\nHope we can get you up and running again!!"}, "40454381": {"recommendationid": "40454381", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152311109", "num_games_owned": 295, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1489, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 258, "last_played": 1521065164}, "language": "english", "review": "A+", "timestamp_created": 1519797045, "timestamp_updated": 1519797045, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40446837": {"recommendationid": "40446837", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140394221", "num_games_owned": 453, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 297, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512823937}, "language": "english", "review": "Good clean robot slaying fun.", "timestamp_created": 1519765157, "timestamp_updated": 1519765157, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40435682": {"recommendationid": "40435682", "author": {"steamid": "76561198810329538", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 539, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 18, "last_played": 1520590590}, "language": "english", "review": "it keep crashing :C", "timestamp_created": 1519730436, "timestamp_updated": 1519730436, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40417497": {"recommendationid": "40417497", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015840044", "num_games_owned": 152, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 419, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519412984}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a fun little time waster. The sword play is really exhilarating and it makes the challenges quite fun. The meat of the game is in its Endless Mode, Challenges, and Community Workshop levels. Their is a story mode but its only 3 chapters and takes about maybe 1.5hrs to finish depending on your skill. It is a fun little story so I'm looking forward to additional chapters being added in the future by the developer (who streams himself building/tweaking the game quite often). Some goofy charachters make the intense fighting more enjoyable as they comment/mock your every move. Overall its a pretty good buy if you can get it on sale as I feel the full price is maybe a bit much considering the content included but I go by a \"$1/hr\" mentality and so far I've kinda burnt myself out on this after about 6hrs or so, but it'll be something I come back to time and again when I only have 30mins or so to kill. \n\nIf you can find it on sale, git it a shot for sure.", "timestamp_created": 1519659933, "timestamp_updated": 1519659933, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40412042": {"recommendationid": "40412042", "author": {"steamid": "76561198320161913", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 276, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519800450}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is A LOT OF FUN.

For example, he live streams his progress with the game and takes player suggestions seriously.\n- Steam Workshop content (playable maps for endless mod and challenges).\n- A fun little story, currently in chapter 3 at the time of this review (more is being worked on as the game progresses).\n- A fleshed out Tech tree that is continuing to grow.\n- Smooth combat that rewards planning before attacking.\n- Voice acted robot commentators (a personal pro)\n- Easy to run on most PC's (Another personal pro)\n- Development of multiplayer (anyone can help test out multiplayer but it is in very early stages).\n- Twitch stream command integration so viewers can interact with the player playing (I haven't seen this before but it is an awesome feature).\n\nCons:\n- Not that much content lacks replay value if you are not a completionist.\n- Still some bugs and issues.\n- Some may consider the price to be too high (though $15 is definitely not the worst price)\n\nOverall, I would really recommend this game to anyone if they asked me about it. The gameplay is fun, the characters are quirky, and it is an overall memorable game.

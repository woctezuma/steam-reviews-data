OK for the price but too mediocre to be worth much time or effort. And what does the name of this game even mean? I don't think it matters and that's not even the worst of it.\n\nThis game is a top-down view schmup arcade style game except instead of getting to control a nifty, futuristic fighter craft or airplane, you get to control a weird little flying, vampire girl with little flapping wings who wears a miniskirt and gets followed around by dragons (which are really her best weapon because they auto aim). Worse, the game's menu music sounds, laughably, like some sort of crappy rip-off of the Exorcist and that's the best music this game has to offer. I shit you not.\n\nSo far as I can tell, this game's story is that various vampire girls are competing in a to-the-death tournament to see who among them gets to become a \"cardinal lord\" though what that really is not well explained. The one who becomes a \"Cardinal Lord\" would then get to compete in yet another tournament (which, I guess, might be the sequel to this game). Unfortunately, all of the dialogue is spoken in Japanese but subtitles are only available for certain parts (though probably the more important parts). Dialogue spoken during the actual battles have no subtitles.\n\nIn this game, the boss battles are the focus of the game and they can be fairly exciting. Each level is really just a lead-up to the next boss battle as lesser enemies tend to be repetitive and boring. The key to winning, so far as I can tell from playing on easy difficulty, is to let your little dragon friends do most of the aiming for you automatically while you focus mostly on using super-powers at the right times (as often as possible) and focus on dodging enemy projectiles. The game can seem hard at first, even on the easiest difficulty level but if you just focus on not getting hit you will eventually win, at least on easy difficulty.\n\n+Okay voice acting I guess.\n+Responsive controls\n+No major bugs\n\n+/- Boss battles are the focus of this game. Lesser enemies tend to get boring and repetitive fast. Boss shot patterns do to tend to be interesting.\n+/-Great sense of speed but the backgrounds racing by are, for the most part, highly repetitive and boring.\n\n-Your character's abilities get boring fast and there is only one character to play with. Each boss you defeat should ideally have unlocked a potentially playable character but oddly, this doesn't happen. You can only play one character.\n-Lots of stupid \"fan-service\" panty shots of no practical use to anyone as they are not even hot hot hot enough to actually be interesting. Mostly, they just seemed boring and obvious.\n-Bad music (or mediocre at best) and mediocre sound.\n-While this game is capable of being played in full-screen mode it can only play at a lowly full-screen resolution of 640 by 480.\n\nMostly, this game just plays and feels mediocre. If you collect schmups, get this game on a big steam sale. It's still really hard to ever be too disappointed in a game that costs 6 dollars when not on sale and probably costs about 2 dollars when it is on sale no matter how mediocre it is.

\n[b]Should you get this?[/b] Yes if you like danmaku (bullet hell) or would like to give the subgenre a try. No if you don't like the genre, moe-ish art, or games that go straight to gameplay without much lore, exposition, etc.\n\nIt has a very interesting way to provide challenge when it comes to patterns: Unlike touhou, which relies heavily on pure dodging/zoning, and on understanding boss-specific mechanics, eXceed 3rd attempts most of the time to scare or impress the player with the illusion of danger, rather than relying on pure execution on the player's part. A lot of patterns will look very tricky at first, but become really smooth to adapt to as they unravel, providing sudden, wide openings.\nLess pixel-tight, grazing-heavy gameplay, and more observation and planning in general, compared to touhou.\n\n+ Good soundtrack, not groundbreaking (using chord progressions that are popular in japanese osts and compos, without straying too far) but gives a really enjoyable and fitting ambience to the game\n+ Decent and evolutive level design (the difficulty curve is really smooth, unlike touhou which often provides one with bosses that are too difficult or easy for their stage)\n+ Really simple to understand and get used to, making it perfect for beginners who would like to get into bullet hell shmups without getting curbstomped by irregular difficulty curves and complex or unclear mechanics\n+ Enjoyable feedback (depending on whether one will find the ridiculous amount of bonus pellets dropped by enemies a bothering eyesore, or a constant, positive stimulus)\n+ Light fanservice, OK voice-acting\n+ Replayability.

At least it doesn't reach ZUN-levels of bad\n- Character design is often quite bland\n- Quite short (stages and bosses are in general shorter than what one can find in touhou and the likes), even though the replayability\n", "timestamp_created": 1464217972, "timestamp_updated": 1464217972, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501866", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23204108": {"recommendationid": "23204108", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153532870", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 510, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465396926}, "language": "english", "review": "Not a game for everyone i must say.\nIts only a game for people who are bored or want something for killing time i think.\nNot a real story.U just move forward and kill things up to the end of the game and yea done.\nTheres nothing more.\nIf u want just something new this is for u.

It's a bullet hell, but it's also pretty accessible to people who aren't experienced with the genre.  Nice art and excellent music in the form of an awesome heavy metal soundtrack.  This is actually a remake of eXceed 3rd - Jade Penetrate.  The original had a slightly less snicker-generating title, and largely the same music (both soundtracks can be bought on bandcamp), though it played significantly faster and the gameplay was different other ways as well.\n\nThis game is just a straight-up bullet hell, unlike eXceed 2nd which was a polarity-based bullet hell game.  There are four action buttons: shoot, bomb (clears everything on screen and gets you limited invulnerability), special, and slowdown.  (Five if you count the pause button.)  (Auto-)collect tokens from defeated enemies and graze their bullets (you can hear when it happens) to charge your special meter, and when it's full, release it to do a homing attack.  You also collect attack pods that follow you around, and either shoot forward (when you're not using slow) or do a homing focus fire (when you are doing slow).  Hold down the slow button to move more precisely, and also visualize your hitbox as a bright orange circle at the center of your sprite -- grazing means letting bullets come close to but not touch this!  As you first learn the game, there's also an auto-bomb setting that will basically give you more lives to work with.\n\nThe storyline is simple but amusing and fitting.  You're Rayne Lindwurm, the younger sister of the Lindwurm dragon clan.  Your school is conducting what's basically the local preliminaries to fill the seat of a Cardinal Lord in Pandemonium.  By preliminaries, we mean a magical combat tournament of course.  Five opponents stand in your way, all of whom are horrible jerks (except the stage four boss, she's cool), the most powerful and biggest jerk of which is your own older sister, who just loves rubbing it in that she's better than you.  But this time, you get to kick her ass.\n\nThe game has five stages, each culminating in a multi-phase boss fight.  Oh, and if you manage to beat the game without using contniues or auto-bomb, there's a bonus boss waiting for you.\n\n(Disclosure: I acquired this game as part of the Indie Gala Summertide bundle.)", "timestamp_created": 1462183369, "timestamp_updated": 1462347788, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581830", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22756945": {"recommendationid": "22756945", "author": {"steamid": "76561198200599353", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 204, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462083911}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome bullet hell games \nGood storyline \nGood waifu\nAnd the musics are so epicc, favourite one Intersect Thunderbolt  (all hail S.S.H.)\n\n10/10 eXceeded my expectation", "timestamp_created": 1462170757, "timestamp_updated": 1462170757, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498891", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22755573": {"recommendationid": "22755573", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091331904", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488126964}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u952e\u4f4d\u5e03\u7f6e\u6bd4\u8f83\u5947\u7279\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u8fd8\u884c", "timestamp_created": 1462161079, "timestamp_updated": 1462161079, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22735341": {"recommendationid": "22735341", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141464087", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 73, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 9, "last_played": 1516419864}, "language": "spanish", "review": "fucking lolis <3", "timestamp_created": 1462073329, "timestamp_updated": 1462073329, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22732970": {"recommendationid": "22732970", "author": {"steamid": "76561198217227504", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501640820}, "language": "english", "review": "I got this game as i was listening to touhou music and the soundtrack for this game is the best", "timestamp_created": 1462060301, "timestamp_updated": 1462060301, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22722031": {"recommendationid": "22722031", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063055435", "num_games_owned": 154, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 294, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510855738}, "language": "english", "review": "Best music ins this game, Thx S.S.H. for this masterpiece!", "timestamp_created": 1462019595, "timestamp_updated": 1462019595, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22721799": {"recommendationid": "22721799", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047009974", "num_games_owned": 392, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 317, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471119710}, "language": "english", "review": "may contain bullets", "timestamp_created": 1462018604, "timestamp_updated": 1462018604, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21996964": {"recommendationid": "21996964", "author": {"steamid": "76561198250240500", "num_games_owned": 377, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 3144, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7, "last_played": 1515807426}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has the perfect formula for making you come back again and again.

From 2 it does away with the polarity system, instead adding a very welcome slow down key that also focuses your shooting, actual bombs (tho it retains the mana bombs) and power ups.\n\nIf you were to compare it to anything it'd be to touhou or seihou since the mechanics are very similar where shooting, power ups, grazing and so on are concerned. The difference with those games are in the addition of mana bombs, in stage length, where these ones are generally shorter and more hectic and in the voice acting - not only from the dialogue with bosses but also while playing normally, such as when you use a mana bomb, regular bomb, meet a mini boss and so on. It makes the characters more alive despite not really understanding what they're saying, althought you can guess the intent from the tone.\n\nAs far as difficulty is concerned this is probably easier than most touhou games, your hitbox is more forgiving and enemy patterns are generally not terribly arcane with a few exceptions. The comparison breaks down where the extra stage is concerned however, since it's not really a separate mode like in touhou and seihou but instead demands you to pass through the whole game first before attempting it.\n\nThe music is top notch, the stages are not as linked to it as in touhou perhaps (where you'd see a huge wave of enemies or the appearance of a midboss coinciding with a crescendo or a beat drop in the music) but it doesn't take away from how brilliant it is. It has rather clear rock/metal vibe as well, which you can tell in the final boss' theme, \"Intersect Thunderbolt\" if you would like to listen to a track first.\n\nVisually there are no issues, all the enemies are clear, the shots are very distinct from the background (without the usual problem of a bunch of small red shots over a red background we've all suffered in other bullet hells) and your character has a clearly defined hitbox in her center. Item drops do not interfere either, since they are instantly grabbed as soon as they spawn, minimizing the problems of confusing or straight up covering stray bullets. \nAn issue however is with the power up system, as you grab power ups small dragons appear and follow you around, complementing your shooting. Sometimes you might confuse them with your character, especially in full screen mode.\n\nAnd finally as far as the plot goes they rebooted the series and turned it into some sort of school war where the top students fight for a chance to compete in a tournament for a chance to become some monster big shot or other. It's not nearly as dramatic as the last two games and in my opinion it's a step down from the pseudo evangelion thing they had going on in the last two games, but the characters are still very distinct and charming at least.\n\nOverall if you want a bullet hell and you don't have this game, you want this game.

You have bombs to clear the screen and a special meter that seems to build up as you deal damage. The special attack doesn't clear the screen of bullets but it deals pretty good damage to the enemies on screen. You clear waves of enemies and then face a multi-phase boss at the end of the level. Sometimes you get powerup drops (like more bombs and mini-tiamats which serve as automated turrets that attack their own targets while you fire).\n\nAs for story, I don't think it relates to the previous games. You just fight challengers in the tournament to represent your region(?) and then it ends teasing that there are harder challenges ahead as representative.\n\nWhat's nice in this game (and not in 1 or 2) is that there's a dot marker on your character to see exactly what part of your character needs to dodge the bullets. I played on easy and it felt pretty generous with the hurtbox (I'm pretty sure I didn't avoid everything weaving left and right between bullets). Also, your speed is significantly slower while firing. The slow speed is sometimes nice for weaving through some bullets but there are also times you need the speed to cross the screen quickly (like to change targets avoid certain bullet patterns). There is a separate slow button to slow you down without firing but I don't understand when I wouldn't just use the attack button instead.\n\nHowever, unlike 2, boss fights don't show life meters (with more bars for more phases) so you don't know how long the boss fight will last unless you memorize how many phases they have. Also, it doesn't bring the polarity mechanic from 2 which I thought was pretty fun.\n\nI'm not really into bullet hells, but I played this on easy and had a fun enough time playing through.

Who is Jade and who penetrated her black package? That is something we may never know. Moving on from that very weird name, Exceed 3 is a reboot of the series and is set in a different dimension. Only one of the previous characters briefly show up and everyone else are new characters. We play as Rayne Lindwurm who is in a fight to the death tournament with other mages to decide who will become one of the 7 Lords of the realm. It all sounds very exciting but in reality it is a pretty boring story and thankfully we still have the option to turn off dialogue. This has the same issue as the last game in that it has the subtitles broken if you are play in fullscreen, which is kind of unforgivable to make that mistake yet again when one your selling points is a \u201cCutscene-driven story-telling\u201d experience. \n\nWe are given the choice to either play Arcade or Practice mode. Practice mode is supposed to let you choose any level but it is broken and only allows you to choose the first level making the mode utterly useless. One of the first things that you will notice is that the graphics are much improved . They are not impressive by any means but it is a big step forward from the last game. Our character does not have the ability to switch magic types and absorb bullet types which is unfortunate since that was a really cool feature. In it's stead we have a fews bombs per life and the ability to make your character move slower. It's nothing unique and felt like a step down from the previous entry. Bombs let you clear all the projectiles on the screen and has a small zone that can damage enemies while slowing down also allows you to narrow your shots and target a specific enemy. You also have a  special attack which fires homing beams at an enemy and is recharged by avoiding projectiles when they are very close to hitting you. \n\n Powerups are also included into this entry. We have one where you someone a familiar for extra fire power and another that gives you an extra bomb. Your familiars are very handy and is the only way target enemies when you slow down. If you die they revert to their powerup form and bounce around the screen until you collect them again. There are three diffculty modes and if you are finding the game too hard you can enable the auto-bomb setting which will detonate a bomb every time you get hit effectively tripling your lives. Which may be a wise choice for new players since Exceed 3 wastes no time showering you with tons of projectiles. There are still red and blue projectiles but their color doesn't really matter this time as they will both kill you in one shot. Controller support isn't listed but it still works perfectly with a controller and has rebindable keys. It does not feature dpad support sadly. Also the escape key still closes the whole game instead of pausing. \n\nMini bosses have also been added in between levels but they are the same robot each level so fighting them gets a bit boring. There are 6 bosses in the game and it takes quite a while to defeat them since they have like five forms of fighting that will refill their health five times but change how projectiles are shot at you. In the last game they had three forms but changed appearance or had some kind of flashy animation when they switched but in this they just switch projectile patterns making the fights feel a bit too dragged out. Remember to use the slow down feature when fighting bosses as the narrow shots will defeat them a lot faster than your spread shots. Bombs are also very effective against bosses if you can get in close enough to actually harm them with it and may be a better used as weapons when a boss form is too difficult for you as they will cause massive damage causing them to switch to a different form.\n\nExceed 3 feels like a straight bullet hell game as it no longer requires any of the strategy of the 2nd and does not reach the heights of the previous game in my opinion. It is by no means a bad game though and is far far better than the first Exceed game. It would actually be one of Steam's best bullet hells if practice mode worked, full screen subtitles worked and if bosses showed some signs of being worn down or angered throughout the fight. As it stands it is an inferior sequel with all the same technical problems of the 2nd that have not been fixed for some reason and introduces some new ones including a whole broken mode. Most of the problems with Exceed 3 are due to technical issues and not the actual game itself. Our character is less fun to play as this time around and Exceed 3 has nothing to do with the previous games but it is still a very fun fast paced bullet hell that will keep any fan of the genre entertained.", "timestamp_created": 1435514202, "timestamp_updated": 1435514202, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539946", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16753763": {"recommendationid": "16753763", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076518837", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470835321}, "language": "schinese", "review": "_(:3\u597d\u6e38\u620f\n\n\u7136\u800c\u6839\u672c\u6253\u4e0d\u8fc7", "timestamp_created": 1435467362, "timestamp_updated": 1435467362, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16738968": {"recommendationid": "16738968", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050933924", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 147, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1435407367}, "language": "english", "review": "waifus and something about dragons and pretty colours. whats not to love?", "timestamp_created": 1435408214, "timestamp_updated": 1435408214, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16738118": {"recommendationid": "16738118", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044359627", "num_games_owned": 1006, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 207471, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498356401}, "language": "english", "review": "+++++ Ultra fun \nThe fun never ends.\n", "timestamp_created": 1435404551, "timestamp_updated": 1435404551, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499165", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16702951": {"recommendationid": "16702951", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981745105", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 343, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503751251}, "language": "german", "review": "Gemessen am Genre sehr einsteigerfreundlich.

The point multiplier system is relatively simple, and will increase the faster you destroy enemies. This is the only real thing you need to think about when doing high score runs: where to use your laser attack so that it will destroy the most enemies. It puts all the focus on dodging bullets.\n\nThe bullet patterns and stages themselves are fast and furious. While the focus is mainly on speed, there are a few slow-moving attacks thrown in the mix to really get your blood pumping. Add that to the completely terrific soundtrack by S.S.H. and this game is a keeper.\n\neXceed 3rd may be on the easy side for bullet hell experts; hard mode offers a decent challenge, but it's certainly not on the same level as, say, CAVE games, so it won't take nearly as much time to clear the game. If you're a more casual player, definitely give this a shot whether you're new to the genre or not.

major stepback in series compared to the previous installment.\n\nAbandondment of the mode system removed probably the most prominent and exciting feature.\nWhile the graphics was somewhat enhanced, and bullet patterns became more complex and interesting, I simply can not feel the hitbox. Boss fights are way too long. The music is not looped properly; it would end the track fading it into silence then start it again, which feels disturbing.\n\nI vote 'No' because I think the game should be about having fun, and I didn't really have fun with this game. May be later, when I find it in myself to play more, I will like the game more, than I'll change my opinion, but as of now, I don't really like this game.

Although Jade Penetrate doesn't quite live up to the standards set by the last game, still does an excellent job of providing a satisfying bullet hell experience, complete with a cast of characters that look like they've walked straight out of a NIS game.\n\nDespite the implication in the game's title that eXceed 3rd is a direct sequel to eXceed 2nd, one doesn't in fact need any prior experience with either of the previous eXceed games in order to understand the happenings of the game's plot.  eXceed 3rd follows the young half-dragon, half-demon wizard Rayne Lindwurm as she enters the tournament for the chance to win the title of 'Demon Lord' and become ruler of the realm. As with most shumps, Lindwurm's motivations and reasons for joining the tournament take a backseat role to make room for the action. The most exposure the plot gets comes primarily from the short conversations that manifest just before each boss encounter in which Lindwurm and her opponent exchange a few words before going at it. All of these scenes are fully-voiced in Japanese with English subtitles and do a nice job of breaking up the action without dragging on for too long. The story itself isn't particularly interesting, and almost all of the characters; including Lindwurm herself; are anime/JRPG archetypes, but this isn't a major issue given that eXceed has always been more about gunning down waves of demons and less about trying to figure out how many of its characters were cut straight from a narrative template.\n\nAcross each of the game's five stages, the player guides Lindwurm as she tears through scores of lesser demons summoned by the other contestants. At the player's disposal is the bog-standard, forward-firing attack with a wide spread, a variation of the said attack that can be directed toward a single enemy while remaining mobile and a powerful homing attack that needs to be charged up by collecting the items left behind by fallen foes. Acquiring a specific type of power-up also grants the player the aid of Lindwurm's familiars - dragon-like creatures who follow our protagonist in formation whilst adding to her firepower. Knowing when and where to use each of these is crucial to mastering each stage and conserving one's supply of lives. When the going gets tough, you can rely on the ever-helpful bombs to bail you out of trouble with their screen-clearing explosions that wipe the field clean of bullets and enemies alike.\n\nWhile the game is indeed very short, eXceed's main appeal comes from attempting to clear the entire game on a single credit, and eventually a single life. Replaying stages over in the Training mode allows one to become familiar with what awaits them in each level, before choosing to tackle every stage in sequence to watch your time spent practice pay off yields a sense of great accomplishment and satisfaction. There's nothing quite like playing a stage a few times over while memorizing bullet patterns and the positions of enemies before heading into the main game and clearing the same stage without losing so much as a single life.\n\nThe game is easily the most graphically advanced entry in the series to date and boasts a visceral soundtrack that accompanies the on-screen action. eXceed 3rd Jade Penetrate Black Package may fall short of reaching the standards set by its predecessor, but it's still a game well worth playing. At the price tag of \u00a33, there aren't many reasons not to take eXceed for a spin.", "timestamp_created": 1404616508, "timestamp_updated": 1422797324, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11090762": {"recommendationid": "11090762", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971645460", "num_games_owned": 194, "num_reviews": 80, "playtime_forever": 165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457924156}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has the worst name, lol.

That said, it's pretty easy on the lower difficulties. I comfortably cleared it on easy on my first playthrough, so I would recommend ramping 'er up to at least normal on your first run unless you're completely new to the genre. Unlike the previous game, Vampire, Jade Penetrate uses a more traditional mechanic of either spread fire (with fast movement) or focused fire (with slow movement to avoid projectiles and a homing weapon). You have bombs to avoid dying and you also power up your special weapon by \"grazing\" enemy bullets. While usually a more advanced technique, in Jade Penetrate this mechanic is used in quite possibly the best way I've ever seen it done - many of the shot patterns include very cool circular walls of bullets that you graze as they spin, quickly powering up your special attack to decimate the opponents you face. The visuals are also outstanding, colorful explosions and huge walls of enemy fire - it's just what you'd want from a game like this. Different colored (yet easily distinguishable) shots, score tokens that are collected automatically, and bullets that you absorb upon an enemy's death to rack up that high score. That said, the frame rate can suffer a little bit with so many sprites on the screen; however, in games like this the lagging frames may turn out to be an answered prayer, as dodging enemy fire is much easier.\n\nPowering up your weapons is this game is also quite neat, instead of making your main attack stronger, as many shmups do, in Jade Penetrate you collect \"D\" tokens which give you little dragon familiars that attack for you. They're actually your homing attacks too, so as the game advances and you face harder enemies that you have to dodge more against, your weapon that always hits (as long as you're focus firing) gets powered up!\n\nI really enjoyed this game, short as it was. As I said, I beat it on easy right away, but playing it on hard proved a worthy challenge and I can see myself coming back to this game time and time again to get my bullet-hell fix. Easily the best in the series (unless you really love the polarity swapping from Vampire), Jade Penetrate is a fast and fun shooter that will test your skill, coordination, and leave you begging for more.\n\nPros:\n\nBullet-hell (true curtain fire on hard) action!\nSatisfactory controller support\nGreat visuals\nGreat gameplay and mechanics\nFun, fair, and challenging\nNoob-friendly features like autobomb\nAuto-slow function (hold fire to focus fire) nice addition\n\nCons:\n\nNo leaderboard support (just high scores which glitched for me and didn't save)\nReplay function also glitched for me...\nFramerate slowdown (nostalgic of the older bullet-hell games, but come on)\nA little short, no unlockables or secondary characters, only high score running\n\nWhile the music wasn't *as* good as Vampire's soundtrack, Jade Penetrate is a worthy bullet-hell shooter for any shmup fan's collection. I'd recommend it to old and new fans of the genre any day of the week. Although it's a little short and there aren't any unlockable modes or characters if you're looking for a high score run, bullet-hell, fast and fun action game you've come to the right place. This game does what it sets out to do very, very well. If it had better controller support, leaderboards, and a few more unlockable options Jade Penetrate would be spectacular.

bullet grazing system that charges your special attack. Said special attack is useful to clear the screen of the weaker enemies, which in turn increases your score multiplier which gives you more lives. In short, a fast paced game that rewards boldness and skill.\n\nOf special note is how freaking awesome the bosses are. They scream crazy japanese nonsense throughout the entire fight to the sound of rad tunes all the while insane bullet patterns dance all around the screen.\n\nDefinitely give this one a try if you like bullet hell shmups.

While there have been some recent additions like Ikaruga and Danmaku Unlimited 2, the selection isn't anywhere near what I'd call satisfactory. Thanks(?) to the lack of releases I find myself spending a little time with Jade....Penetrate...Black...Package....uh..okay then.\n\nThe storyline is about what you'd expect from a shmup, absolute swill. You're playing these games to dodge bullets and get high-scores anyway. There are multiple stages with bosses at the end of each. These bosses have several forms and numerous bullet patterns to fling at you. Like most doujin shooters, the bullet patterns are immense in their density but don't move very quickly. You don't have to be a veteran of the genre to get far in this game. The scoring system revolves around medal-chaining and multipliers. It's not quite as deep as an arcade shooter but it does the job. \n\nAs far as I'm concerned eXceed 3rd is the only game in the series worth playing. This is because rather than being completely inept & frustrating (eXceed 1) or a poor man's Ikaruga (eXceed 2), this game focuses on what makes doujin bullet-hells work. Pick it up, play it, enjoy it. \n\nWhile we'd all love to make more jokes about black packages, it should be mentioned that originally this game was just Jade Penetrate. It's an earlier version that's very different, and it is more difficult with faster bullet patterns. The \"Black Package\" is akin to Cave and their habit of adding \"Black Label\" to different versions of their games. Unfortunately you'll have to look outside Steam if you want to play the original eXceed 3rd. It's more likely to be an overall better game if you're looking for a challenge. I guess most of Black Package's difficulty comes from the scoring system, I cleared the game on my first attempt(and by cleared I mean without using continues).\n\nOverall though JDBP isn't too bad a game.

The main gist is that you are thrown ridiculous amounts of bullets, usually supposedly in an aesthetic formation that might take a go or two to learn how to best avoid the bullets. Thankfully, while the character sprite is rather large on the screen, the actual hit box that registers the bullet hits is very small - and shown on the screen.\n\nOther than the movement controls, there are four buttons: \"slow\" (which makes the trailing helpers aim at a target and make you move much slower - very useful), \"shoot\" (of course), \"bomb\" (which clears the screen of bullets and most minor enemies) and \"special\", a button to launch a special attack that eventually reloads.\n\nThis game ditches the Ikaruga-style bullet colour coding from eXceed 2nd. Compared to, say, the Touhou series, this isn't as difficult a game; I'd call it far easier than even Imperishable Night. It has voice acting (in Japanese) and static image cutscenes (subtitled in English) that go with it, but the latter can be set to be skipped altogether and the voice volume set to 0 in the options menu.\n\nTo my knowledge, there are no alternate chararacters (with different attacks) like in eXceed - Gun Bullet Children, noticeably limiting the replayability.\n\nThere aren't all that many danmaku on Steam, and of the three games in the eXceed trilogy, I'd call this the best.

It takes too much time in between levels.\n\nThis is probably the most unique and strategic of the three eXceed games. Instead of sticking with the bullet abosrbing idea from the second game, eXceed 3rd goes back to using bullet grazing to fill your special meter. But it adds a couple new mechanics to make the game more interesting. Killing certain enemies gives you a Tiamat, which follows you around and shoots at the enemy. Generally, these Tiamats shoot straight ahead. However, when you push the button that slows your movement, it also changes your shooting style. Your main gun becomes more narrow, and seems to do more damage, and the Tiamats lock on to an enemy and fire lazers directly at that enemy until it is dead. This is especially handy during boss fights. Slow movement helps you dodge bullets, and you deal damage faster if you can get your narrow beam on the boss.\n\n\nA possible con is the length of the boss fights. In previous games, bosses had about 3 life meters. The boss would change their shooting style whenever their health was depleted. In this game, bosses seem to have around 6 life meters, each with different bullet patterns.

From the outrageous number of bullets that fill the screen, to the cute girls wearing compromising clothing, it knows what it is and who it's targeted to, and that is actually a good thing.\n\nOpting to refine not redefine it's basic gameplay, eXceed 3rd ditches the 2nd game's color swapping mechanic in favor of simple raw shoot-em-up action. There is some depth to be found in utilizing a lock on move that cuts down your movement speed, but generally speaking you'll be holding down the shoot button and just trying to stay alive through the torrent of blue and read particles blowing up around you.\n\nDespite being simpler than its immediate predecessor, this is easily the most enjoyable and satisfying of the series. The overly dramatic story proves unintentionally hilarious, the graphics 16-bit eye candy, and the soundtrack once again setting the bar for games in this genre (really, it's incredible). The one downside is that it's quite short even for a bullet-hell game, but given the high difficulty even on easy, there's the potential for lots of replayability as you improve and take on the higher levels.\n\nIf you've enjoyed either of the prior eXceed games, or just like bullet-hell shooters in general you can't go wrong with Jade. This is the culmination of everything the developer has worked toward with the eXceed games, and as far as I'm concerned the best of the lot. It might be traditional in design, and perhaps even exploitative in nature, but taken for what it is I'd find it hard not to recommend it for fans.

There are 4 difficulty levels, an auto-bomb feature (which you can turn on and off), and an extra stage on Normal diffuculty and higher.\n\nSound in the game is very well done. All dialogue is Japanese, but spoken by professional voice actresses. All story text is translated into English, however, and can be turned off in the options if you want get straight to the action. The soundtrack, a mix of techno and metal, is one of my favorites in the genre; I've dowloaded it from the Nyu Media website and listen to it regularly.\n\nThe gameplay is very solid for a bullet-hell game, with many variety of bullet attack patterns to dodge. The boss fights are well balanced once you understand how to approach all the fights (Celestia is one that will likely take a lot of practice to get all the \"tricks\"). \n\nThe main scoring mechanic in this game is speed-killing. The faster you kill enemies consecutively, the higher a score multiplier rises (up to 64x). Reaching the higher multipliers is difficult, however, so careful planning and practice is needed for score-running. Survival is aided by both the aformentioned auto-bomb and a \"deathbomb\" that can be activated within a split-second of getting hit by a bullet. The deathbomb is not as powerful as a regular bomb, and is more to be used when you see a bullet at the last possible moment than as a reaction to getting hit.\n\nMy only complaint is that the extra stage takes place after the first 5, rather than being its own separate \"mode\". It's really a minor complaint though.\n\nOverall if you have any interest in getting into the shmup genre, this is a very, very good choice to start off with. The price is very nice for a game of this quality and polish.

That said, it's pretty easy on the lower difficulties.  I comfortably cleared it on easy on my first playthrough, so I would recommend ramping 'er up to at least normal on your first run unless you're completely new to the genre.  Unlike the previous game, Vampire, Jade Penetrate uses a more traditional mechanic of either spread fire (with fast movement) or focused fire (with slow movement to avoid projectiles and a homing weapon).  You have bombs to avoid dying and you also power up your special weapon by \"grazing\" enemy bullets.  While usually a more advanced technique, in Jade Penetrate this mechanic is used in quite possibly the best way I've ever seen it done - many of the shot patterns include very cool circular walls of bullets that you graze as they spin, quickly powering up your special attack to decimate the opponents you face.  The visuals are also outstanding, colorful explosions and huge walls of enemy fire - it's just what you'd want from a game like this.  Different colored (yet easily distinguishable) shots, score tokens that are collected automatically, and bullets that you absorb upon an enemy's death to rack up that high score.  That said, the frame rate can suffer a little bit with so many sprites on the screen; however, in games like this the lagging frames may turn out to be an answered prayer, as dodging enemy fire is much easier.\n\nPowering up your weapons is this game is also quite neat, instead of making your main attack stronger, as many shmups do, in Jade Penetrate you collect \"D\" tokens which give you little dragon familiars that attack for you.  They're actually your homing attacks too, so as the game advances and you face harder enemies that you have to dodge more against, your weapon that always hits (as long as you're focus firing) gets powered up!\n\nI really enjoyed this game, short as it was.  As I said, I beat it on easy right away, but playing it on hard proved a worthy challenge and I can see myself coming back to this game time and time again to get my bullet-hell fix.  Easily the best in the series (unless you really love the polarity swapping from Vampire), Jade Penetrate is a fast and fun shooter that will test your skill, coordination, and leave you begging for more.\n\nPros:\n\nBullet-hell (true curtain fire on hard) action!\nSatisfactory controller support\nGreat visuals\nGreat gameplay and mechanics\nFun, fair, and challenging\nNoob-friendly features like autobomb\nAuto-slow function (hold fire to focus fire) nice addition\n\nCons:\n\nNo leaderboard support (just high scores which glitched for me and didn't save)\nReplay function also glitched for me...\nFramerate slowdown (nostalgic of the older bullet-hell games, but come on)\nA little short, no unlockables or secondary characters, only high score running\n\nWhile the music wasn't *as* good as Vampire's soundtrack, Jade Penetrate is a worthy bullet-hell shooter for any shmup fan's collection.  I'd recommend it to old and new fans of the genre any day of the week.  Although it's a little short and there aren't any unlockable modes or characters if you're looking for a high score run, bullet-hell, fast and fun action game you've come to the right place.  This game does what it sets out to do very, very well.  If it had better controller support, leaderboards, and a few more unlockable options Jade Penetrate would be spectacular.

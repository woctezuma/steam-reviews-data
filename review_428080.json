On paper this sounds like it would add to the fun of the game but it's really just a huge pain and a burden on the gameplay.\nPulsating color pallet. The colors move to the music. Also sounds like it would be good for the game, but it's distracting. \nThe colors are also the same(very similar) as the ball that you are trying to keep your eye on so you can lose it while it's sliding around the wall, then it just comes right back at you.\nThe Lanes that pull the ball up to you in slow motion are now on a charge. meh. If this was the only thing that changed in 2.0 I wouldn't complain, but still kinda crappy.\n\nThe game before 2.0 was amazing and where I put my ~30 hours in. I played for several hours at a time taking a break sweating and panting, going for a gatorade, then going right back. After the update, I have played about 20 minutes and uninstalled.\n\nThe original had a Tron-type feel to it. Simple but very difficult.

Multiplayer is great fun, although the rematch button doesn't seem to work correctly atm.\n\nPlaying this on the RIft but with 3 sensors, there's a lot of turning around so if you're on 2 sensors you might run into issues, but running 3 sensors the tracking's great of course.\n\nAdvisable to have some room when playing this, particuarly when swinning arm, i've hit the table a couple of times, plus a chair!  Top tip, stick a couple of cushions on top of the table, that way if you do hit the table then you're at leat not doing any damage.\n\nSo what do you do in this? Basically you hit a ball against a 360 degree wall whilst trying to hit the right coloured spaces, your health goes down over time unless you hit health things, it can also go down if you hit little alien things, that's after 2 levels,\n\n I'm sure there's more stuff later but that's as far as i've got so far.  The walls arent always flat either, which can make it tricky to get some shots.  There's more to it than that though as your paddle thing can get power ups, also the ball can travell along the wall aswell if hit hard enough.\n\nThe only thing I don't like about it is the option to pull the ball near you with a beam,  I can understand why it's in there but I still don't really like that feature, not a big deal but wish it wasn't in there.\n\nLove the menu for settings with dials to adjust sound etc, looks really nice and shows how much attention has gone into things.\n\nGreat VR title highly reccoment it.", "timestamp_created": 1510251477, "timestamp_updated": 1510252731, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528234", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36350286": {"recommendationid": "36350286", "author": {"steamid": "76561198196668111", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 194, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511321596}, "language": "english", "review": "I initially thought this might be a fun little time waster, but now I think this is going to get an old, fat guy into better shape.\n\nI've always enjoyed tennis, both watching and playing on my Xbox, but was never able to play in real life because I'm fat and have shitty knees and joints.  I used to occasionally play racquetball at the gym, but worsening joints, arthritis, bad feet, etc., etc. had me stop that a while ago.  I missed it.\n\nSo, imagine how happy I was to find that this game simulates the feel of racket sports without the jarring body motion of trying to run back and forth on a court, turning on a dime.  You still get body motion since the ball and targets move all around you, but it's contained within the couple yards of your play space so it's never too far out of your reach.\n\nI picked this up on a sale for $12, but I would be happy if I had paid the full $20, I think.\n\nSince it is early access (as of the time of this writing), there are things that could be improved and added upon, but it's pretty solid at the moment (full disclosure, I spent nearly all my time in \"Zen Mode\" with no timer, penalties, or anything else.  Just targets and fun.) \n\nA couple of things that *I* think could be improved:\nBall control seems a bit loose, but that could be my skill level and lack of stamina\nI would love to see the ability to slow down the action in Zen mode.  If I could open the pause menu and decrease the ball speed by 10%-50%, that would be great!  It would allow for a much more \"zen\" experience for the old people who don't move as fast as we used to (it would also make for an easy accessibility feature)\nGive the user a glass dome and put the dome in some fantastic locations (under the ocean with fish and stuff, on an alien planet in town square, center court WImbledon, etc.)\nAdd in a skills mode that forces the user to hit targets with only a forehand, or only a backhand, or only left-handed, etc.  These modes could also be used as game modifiers in multiplayer and solo games by adding pickups that occasionally spawn around the arena (smaller targets so some skill is required to hit them)\n\nAll in all, I think this game will be a good step towards turning an old, fat guy into an old, less-fat guy because it's fun, engaging, active, and has that all-important feel of \"just one more level\".

The game looks great, and has a clean UI and menus. What I don't care for however is the execution (not the idea) of the energy system. Most of the times where I find myself able to line up a bunch of energy I'm already at 100%. I really don't like how the skulls (negative energy) are placed in areas were goals arn't. I don't feel I should have to worry about hitting bad spots while just repositioning the ball. I feel empty areas should be... welll empty. I feel like I'm hitting more plus signs that skulls but I just hit the skulls at bad times. If I get low on energy, I find myself dying just trying to reposition the ball because it hits some random skull I didn't even see. That is another thing. FoV is pretty low in VR, and this is the kind of game where that REALLY hurts you. The game also requires you to spin a lot which makes the cord wrap around my legs. The cord combined with FoV issues really exacerbate the problem I have with skulls being placed in open random areas because the ball often strikes them when I'm trying to untangle myself or reposition the ball by using open walls that I don't have a good visual on. In other words... it feels very bad to lose. It feels like I got unlucky rather than me messing up.\n\nMy proposal would be to not have skulls in open areas and to increase the power of the pull back mechanic that uses energy. It would make it a better tool for repositioning the ball, and it would allow you to pull it away from skulls. \n\nI'm sorry if my thoughts seem a bit scattered, but I'd like to list more positives. The portals are a great mechanic for repositioning which is the area I think the game needs the most work. I would like to have a better tell of where the balls are comming out though. Maybe the exit portal could light up so you can find it faster while turning around (this would help alleviate FoV visiability issues). Another great thing is the rolling mechanic. I absolutely love it, and it adds a whole layer of depth to the game. It is very creative. I think it can be improved though. Currently, if I hit the ball medium hard it has just as much speed as if I did if I hit it extremely hard. I'd like to see the ball's cap for speed raised. I want to be able to take a risk by hitting the ball very hard. I'm not sure if this is a technological limitation or an intentional limitation, but it feels jarring to me that there isn't a different between hitting the ball twice as hard once it reaches a certain point.\n\nI'd like to thank the devs for working on a game like this for VR. This is the perfect kind of game for VR as it is now. \n\nIt is something that could only be done in VR.\n\nIt takes a familiar feel of real life sports and takes the fantasy to the next level.\n\nIt isn't overly ambitious for its medium (too many games feel like tech demos rather than games because they try to make games that are heavily hindered by VRs limitations and end up feeling incomplete)\n\n\nThe VR scene would be far far better if more developers had the vision of Racket NX rather than trying to copy normal AAA titles in ways that make games feel more like the husk of something else.

Like many of you hesitant to buy a true esport game due to EA as well as spending money on something with low replayability value thus cringing your money short.\n\nTruth be told, at the beginning, I almost believed that was true but even in EA one, Racket:NX shines its magnificent primier of what TRUE ESPORTS can do for you. True Esports is one without seating, where your arena is room scale and you sweat and grind for glory, PHYSICALLY. (On  the one hand, being a fan of esports, I cringe the day MOBAs die off being replaced by VR competitive sports but boy am I glad VR took a healthy active turn for the better)\n\nRacket NX feels bland at first and as though the racket, ball, and shiny glowy things are just for show and you keep hitting it like its a toy. Your shots are going wide, your wondering whether your controller is fucked or development was stupid. Then, you start noticing sounds coming from different locations and your headphones actually can produce surround quality effects. You realise the ball itself emits a sound and so do the wormholes to indicate where the ball is coming from. After you score some finished sets, you begin to realise you are actually getting better not through mental training but literally both mental and physical training. The ball no longer feels like a toy, it becomes heavy and every location it is in VR IS EXTREMELY VITAL INFORMATION.\n\nYour shots start being accurate for once and you realize what happens when you hit the ball too early or too late because even that minute detail...MATTERS. Suddenly you got angry and saw a confident shot, you BLAM the ball in the best position and you realize the white smash speed trail that runs across the wall gaining you multiple hits. Before long, the smash starts becoming a spin. Yes...racket NX turned Tennis, Table, Tennis, Squash and Badminton sideways and puked on all of them by giving players the ability to SPIN!! \n\nSummary:\n\nSeeing a curving smashed ball clearing a score plate finishing a set? Priceless. What I'm trying to get at is the game's ability to play with physical elements of your body, essentially 'upgrading' your character manually...through YOU, physically, like natural sports. You actually progress through the game by actually being better, physically, no need for ultimates, abilities or mana, your stamina IS YOUR MANA. The cream on top for an esport EA 1? Multiplayer sets! where they essentially took the table tennis, squash doubles play and slam it in this high action impact sports but unlike any sport (since there is no dome arena except in cycling), you can 'snooker' your enemy by giving him a hard ball in the cleared section, which means you need to learn reverse racketing as well.\n\nThere are many things that you will learn to do while playing this game, and you will never stop learning based on the game's ability to instill natural guides, that is your senses, into every playmaker move you make and that answers its replayability value. The game will make you learn more, its only natural and you will improve no matter how bad you are, that is another reason why I recommend this game as its progression is based on you and it will show you how naturally, you will know how you improve because the reward is instant the moment you feel the haptic feedback as the slow mo edge of your racket swings into vision and that aced smash ball zoning into that score plate breaking the glass of the dome, finishing the set.\n\nGood luck to you all racketeers\n\n10/10 would have a heart attack again flinging my touch into space for that sweet shot", "timestamp_created": 1490004465, "timestamp_updated": 1490004465, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30575810": {"recommendationid": "30575810", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026769094", "num_games_owned": 195, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 453, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513231983}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game.

The graphics are outstanding, the mechanics and physics of hitting the ball are superior to other games I've played.  It's a lot of fun and gets the blood pumping.  \n\nUnfortunately there are more things that I disliked about the game than things I did.  For starters, there's almost nothing that tells you what you need to do to play.  I know, I know. Hit ball with racket, right?  Except there are the times and how fast you hit the ball determines a lot of things.  The learning curve is steep, and it took playing through a few times to understand what I was even supposed to be doing.  \n\nThen there's the portals.  The devs seem to REALLY love those portals.  Unfortunately they destroy the flow of the game play.  \"Oh here! You have to hit this tile.  Let me surround it with portals that spit the ball back out from another location!\"  As the difficulty increases, the game uses the portals to an absurd degree.  Which, maybe some people like, but it leads to the next issue I have.\n\nThe game favors very slow accurate shots rather than allowing you to really get the ball going around the court.  Because of the aforementioned portals, it becomes nearly impossible later in the game to play fast.  Instead, hitting with any sort of accuracy to avoid the portals means taking single, slow shots, which becomes boring.  I get that the portals are meant to make the game more challenging, but instead they just make it more frustrating by forcing you to play a specific way.  \n\nI'm not sure whether to recommend this or not.  I'm just not sure it's worth $20 at this point.  I know it's early access, but honestly I think I'd recommend waiting until they've made some changes.\n\n***Update to Review***\n\nBecause of the passion with which the Devs, who reached out to me after I posted my review, and the Racket:NX community have shown, I continued playing and have 12 hours of gameplay in at this point.  One of the developers suggested that it would take 12 to 18 hours just to master the basics.  Unfortunately, further time playing hasn't changed my mind. And, in fact, only reinforces my belief that the learning curve and increase in difficulty are simply too steep for the majority of players.  While I enjoy a challenge and find many aspects of this game enjoyable, I believe the 12-18 hours required to simply pick up the basics is more than most casual players will want to invest.  I think this game absolutely will appeal to those who want to spend 4-5 hours a day practicing to get to the necessary skill level, but for someone like me who just wants to play a game a couple of times a day as a way to break up my work, it's simply frustrating. As it is an Early Access game, I'll check in with it periodically to see if any changes have been made.\n\n***Second Update***\n\nI'm changing my recommendation from No to Yes because of the most recent update which improved the physics and, more importantly, added a Zen mode which allows new players to practice without the timer.  I still believe the level progression is too steep, but this is a fun, polished, and addictive game, and with the new features I think it's much more welcoming to new players.", "timestamp_created": 1488487827, "timestamp_updated": 1490566138, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541985", "comment_count": "13", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30281904": {"recommendationid": "30281904", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040877531", "num_games_owned": 283, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488471539}, "language": "english", "review": "I wanted to like this game, but after playing for a bit I just couldn't get into it.

Well it's my turn now.\nAs VR users know, most content right now relies on the \"WOW!\" factor to be appealing, and games that are still actually fun once the VR magic fades are few and far in between. Racket: Nx is one of the only VR games I played (my VR collection has ~40 games) that is genuinely fun.\n\nIMO, this is largely due to the \"power shot\" mechanics. By hitting the ball hard, it is possible to hit many tiles in a line, while the direction of that line depends on the shot's angle and spin. The concept is simple, but being able to hit hard while controlling both aim and spin requires a lot of practice. Very few VR games require any skill from the player, but this element of skill/mastery is what makes most games fun: sports, FPS, RTS, they all get more fun as you play and become better at them.\n\nHowever, because of that, it might not suit everyone's taste. Fortunately there's a demo, so you can see exactly what the game is like.

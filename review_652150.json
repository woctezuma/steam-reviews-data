Some clear The Terminator influence which is fine by me! The movie is 30+ years old! I've always wanted to see more of the underground humanity horror from the original film. The filthy food, the radios and crying people in the sound design, general despair. I really support what Oats Studios is trying to achieve here. I hope that this new model of filmmaking can open avenues for both Blomkamp and the Oats team, as well as other filmmakers who may attempt to start similar companies in the future. Best of luck Oats!\n \nFIREBASE UPDATE: This was just awesome. Rakka was cool... but I enjoyed Firebase on another level. The mixture/merger of supernatural and science fiction in regards to Rivergods powers was really cool. While it had some clear influences (what doesn't? And I suppose anything set in a jungle with sci fi will have Predator'ish vibes) this felt original and fresh. The visual effects, body horror, and Rivergod himself as a villian were badass. This one felt like a homerun. I'd want to see this as a feature film. \n\n(It was hard to get a review written for this because of the 5 minute minimum playtime rule.

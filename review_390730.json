you would see and the game pace is faster than most usual bullet hell games.\n\nThe gameplay is amazing, each stage is unique from the others (you get different enemies that do completely different stuff) and it is also very fast-paced.\nFor the difficulty, the game itself is relatively difficult as it features different mechanics most other bullet hell games has, but it gets easier once you get the hang of the controls.\nYou get simple rewards (additional weapons) just by playing (even if you fail).\nThe soundtrack itself is also good and suiting.\nFinally, the graphics and design itself is simply suiting to the theme too.\n\n>Finally, you get Military Sora character in 100% Orange Juice.\n\n10/10 would recommend if you love bullet hell games.", "timestamp_created": 1515087582,

I LOVED them.\nThe game seems pretty hard, and, it is. But once you start having more control of the Dash, knowing how and when to use the weapons, and start to know the bosses patterns, it becomes more easy.\nYou have a lot of weapons, which can make levels more or less easy. A lot of the time you will only use the basic weapons or change one or two, but I think that all of them makes a lot of situations and have a lot of possibilities to use. \nThe principal thing you need to master is the Dash. I loved a lot the Dash, because, it doesn't feel bad to use it in a keyboard, so you don't need to buy a Gamepad (and I think it would even be harder to use in a Gamepad). It's confortable and simple, so you only have to put it in a good key to reach and GG. My keybinding was: Z: 1st Weapon , X: 2nd weapon , A: 3rd weapon , Space: Ults , Left Ctrl: Dash , and I recommend it. \nThe bosses are pretty unique. Every one have a reason to fight, even if it's a bit hidden (like Alte's husband. You can say that she was an explosive girl). \nAll the stages give you a little sub-boss which probably will annoy you a bit, but practice is all you need.\nThe soundtrack is magnificent, and some helps you to empathize with Sora in some stages.\nTo summarize, I think that Sora is a very good game, with a good design, bosses, stages, and good (in my opinion) controls, and an OST I'll hear ALL the day, and I higly reccomend it if you like bullet hell games.", "timestamp_created": 1508097453, "timestamp_updated": 1508097453, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35383030": {"recommendationid": "35383030", "author": {"steamid": "76561198273320030", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 573, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502625821}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0413\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0437\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043b\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043b\u043a\u0430-\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043b\u044f\u043b\u043a\u0430.\n\u0414\u0443\u043c\u0430\u044e \u043c\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430 Touhou Project, Suguri  \u0438 \u043f\u0440. \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u044f\u0442.\n\u041b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e \u044f \u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u044b\u0439 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0436\u0430\u043d\u0440\u0430 (\u0442\u0440\u044f\u0441\u0443\u0449\u0438\u0435\u0441\u044f \u0440\u0443\u043a\u0438 \u0438 \u0442\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b \u0436\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0431 \u0432 \u0441\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0435 \"\u042f \u0441\u0435\u0439\u0447\u0430\u0441 \u0441 \u0443\u043c\u0430 \u0441\u043e\u0439\u0434\u0443, \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u044d\u043a\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0443\u043b\u044f\u043c\u0438!\". \u0418 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0436\u0435 \u044d\u0442\u0443 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443 \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u043b \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043b (\u0441 \u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043a\u0430\u043c\u0438).\n\u0427\u0442\u043e \u0436\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u0437\u0430\u0446\u0435\u043f\u0438\u043b\u043e? \u041e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442 - \u043c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430.\n\u0423\u0436\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0430 \u0442\u0438\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u0443 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u044c \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0448\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0447\u0443\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430. \u0421 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043d\u044b - \"\u0423\u043a\u0443\u0441\u0438 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u043f\u0447\u0435\u043b\u0430, \u043e\u043f\u044f\u0442\u044c \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0442 \u0430\u0434 \u0438\u0437 \u043f\u0443\u043b\u044c?!\", \u043d\u043e \u0441 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u043e\u0439 - \"\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0442 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u044c\u043c\u0438, \u0430 \u0441\u0430\u0443\u043d\u0434\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043a \u0442\u043e \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448!\". \u0418 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043e\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e.\n\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0436\u0443\u0442\u043a\u043e \u043d\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447\u043a\u043e\u0432.

Almost. The story's great, I love the characters (if not a bit too much), and there's options for which weapons you want to use to bring variety to the game. However...\n\nIt's not very fun to play.\n\nIt [i]was[/i] fun at first; I accepted how challenging it was. But then, as the game progressed, it just got worse and worse; rather than feeling like a battle of self-improvement to conquer the game, it felt like a constant battle of attrition to just get by. It's very rare for a game to stay in that perfect balance between \"Very difficult\" and \"enjoyable to play\". However, it is entirely possible for a game to be extremely difficult yet still feel like an enjoyable experience throughout the entire game; titles like Furi, Risk of Rain, Crypt of the Necrodancer and Hotline Miami did it for me, for example. When playing other \"hard\" games, it feels like I can always improve upon something, learn from the previous attempt, or at least have some motivation to continue. Sora starts out with those qualities, but loses them as you progress through the game. Whether or not I manage to make it just a bit farther in each level feels like luck more than skill after a while.\n\nIronically enough, the weapons the game starts you out with are the most viable, and the 'meta' way of playing is to abuse the dash mechanic to maximize DPS while keeping your heat maxed out at 300% (meaning you'll die super fast if you make any mistakes). However, the dash is difficult to control (especially if playing with a controller) and the game's fast-paced enough as-is. Also, ironically, the tutorial hints towards avoiding this kind of play. I think if the game was slowed down just a bit (at least on easy mode), it'd be a lot more enjoyable as you could actually react to the things on screen; that's part of what makes bullet hell games manageable to play.\n\nI did manage to beat the game, but I don't feel very accomplished about it. It wasn't quite a waste of time, but there are far better titles that you can invest your time in to \"git gud\" at. I'd only recommend this game if you're a masochist, play regular bullet hell games at 1.5x speed, want the 100% Orange Juice DLC character, or a combination thereof.", "timestamp_created": 1489999160,

localized by Fruitbat Factory. The player controls Sora, a girl with extraordinary powers fighting during the time of war, following her desire to protect innocents and once again see the clear sky.\n\nGraphically, the game is... well okay. The backgrounds are generally mostly static and one-color, occassionally giving some actual land to look at, with most of the characters portrayed as sprites, small and sufficient. Portraits during cutscenes do a good job of showing off details and conveying emotions of each character, but that's not much to make up for the rest. The bullets are bright and colorful, just like in most bullet hell shmups, except for live ammo types for obvious reasons.\n\nSound-design, it's mostly just techno that doesn't stand out. Basic sound effects do what they're supposed to, I guess.\n\nGameplay-wise, that's where this becomes interesting. The stages have the usual layout of going through a gauntlet of enemies with a midboss in the middle before the end-stage boss. Unlike most standard bullet hell shmups, you get a lot of freedom of movement - Sora possesses a dash ability that lets her jet around and graze beam weapons taking no damage. However it increases her Heat level, which increases damage taken should she get hit before it falls down. Also, besides beam weapons there is live ammo which is slower, but more powerful and ungrazeable via dash. Controlling Sora while she's dashing can be difficult, and it's often easy to, in the heat of battle, just bump into live ammo and suffer a solid amount of damage.\nYou get to bring three weapons with yourself, two normal ones which can be either beam or live ammo (former being faster, latter being stronger) and one special - a melee weapon of choice, dealing a lot of damage but having short range. Using any of them forces you to stand still for a moment, which leaves you vulnerable to fire. Choosing your time to attack is key to survival.\n\nAs much as I'd like to talk about the story, which after the rather amazing intro I feel would be deep and touching, I can't get very far into the game.\n\nThis is a major issue with the game, which unfortunately kills the whole experience for me.\nThis game is hard.\n\nNow I don't have anything against hard games or bullet hell shmups, in fact I've been enjoying [i]Touhou[/i] games for years now, experience with those does not help much in trying to play through Sora. The gameplay is just too different. Still, I see that beating the game on Easy would certainly be possible.\n\nExcept it's hard for the [i]wrong[/i] reasons.\nNo health pickups. No extra lives. No continues.\nIf you die during a stage, you are kicked back to stage select screen, and you get nothing to your name. Even on Easy, by the time I reach the boss I'm all beat up due to taking damage all throughout and having basically no way to recover it, and I don't get much time to practice the boss' patterns before I inevitably die in a couple hits and have to start over. This is a textbook example of Check Point Starvation aspect of Fake Difficulty right there - the only real way to \"save\" your progress and refill your health is to beat a stage, and for someone who's just starting out, those stages, especially when you get no health pickups or extra lives whatsoever, are marathons in the war of attrition. Your only real hope of progressing further is to play this game like you're walking on a tightrope, until via sheer trial and error you inevitably get good enough to somehow go through the stage, and then repeat the same process with the next one.

The story has some sad moments, especially is you are able sympathise with characters, keeping it spoiler free i will just say i was sad at both my meeting with Sham and the end battle with Star breaker (the ending is great though!) \n\nThe soundtrack is brilliant, i never really buy the ost for games as whilst some are good i feel i will never actually get my money worth but in this case i just kind of wanted the ost, from the great electro background musics to the even vocalled track, i just wanted it. It really is great for creating a setting, the bgm for the stages is commonly quite catchy and works well considering your struggle against the mobs whilst the vocals for the bosses are really mood setting. \n\nIf you enjoy bullet hell games i strongly suggest trying Sora, i enjoyed Suguri and QP shooting dangerous and now can say this takes my favourite of them.\n\nAdditionally, if you play 100% Orange juice, you get a free extra character (Sora Military), i brought the game a while back mainly for the character extra (i did plan to play it eventually), but now i know i got a great game and the character extra was a awesome bonus. \n\nSeriously, it is worth a try if this is your style game.

It's challenging and fun. Some may say it's unfair, but once you get the hang of it, everything becomes a breeze.\n\nYou have three weapons at your disposal, the main gun, a secondary and a melee, each weapon does a unique attack whenever you attack after a dash.\n\nThere's two unique mechanic that are called Heat Gauge and Dash, the first basically serves as a balance to punish you from getting ahead of yourself with dashing by taking more damage as more heat rises, heat gauge increases from taking damage, dashing and from some certain bosses' attacks.\n\nDashing is self-explanatory, it's your main ability to dodge and go through enemy's projectiles (That are hopefully not live shells as those will still hit you), however the long you dash the faster your heat gauge rises, controlling this is hard and takes time to get the hang of it's manuevers.\n\nNow, there's two kinds of enemy attacks, a projectile and live shell, the first one you can dash through, the second one you cannot, the former doesn't block your secondary attacks, but the latter can block your secondary and melee attacks. Keep that in mind.\n\nAnd finally there's this special attacks called Hyper, you have a gauge over on the left side of it, and can hold up to 3 charges, it gets fueled by dashing through enemy attacks and or attacking the enemy themselves. It is very helpful and crucial at times, as it gives you a few second shield that negates any kind of damage. Each weapons has different Hyper attacks, so test them all out to know what to use at the right time.\n\n==[b] Setting [/b]==\n\nNow, the gameplay aspects aside. The setting, story, characters and music are pretty well-done. \nSora may come off as your generic \"wants to save the world\"-protagonist, but this is because she doesn't know her purpose but to fight. And as you go through the game she develops more character to reflect on the things she've done and the things she've seen.\n\nThe music is trance-melody-ish, a few scores have songs in them which are nice and gives an emotional feeling to it while you listen, it suits and fits the setting of the game and the gameplay of \"sora\". I'd say it's one of the best underrated soundtracks I've heard in games in my opinion.\n\n==[b] Performance [/b]==\n\nIt's a pretty small game, around 500mb download and you can experience good trance bullet hell, it's a 2D side-bullet hell shooter so it shouldn't need that much in terms of system, a laptop can even run it. Just beware that on higher difficulties, means more particles to handle however.\nThe controls are comfortable, arrow keys for movement, Z for the main gun/confirmation, X for the secondary/cancel, C for Hyper, V for dashing, A for the melee, and S to lock on or disable lock-on/fast forward dialogues. And if you want, you can play it with a controller too!\n\n==[b] Conclusion [/b]==\n\nA nifty underrated gem of a game, \"sora\" is a must to play even if you are not a fan of bullet hell shooters, the gameplay is fun and challenging, and the story is pretty good. It is the prequel of Suguri [spoiler] also technically the sequel of Suguri due to Stage EX [/spoiler] which means you can play this before playing Suguri, or vice versa.\n\nNow go on and save the world!\n\n\nThat's all!

Being a prequel to the first two games in Suguri series, Sora is based on the mechanic of dodging some type of attacks and dashing through other types to absorb them; Sora is probably the best game to start the series due to both the tutorial and an easy difficulty option (which is still pretty hard for a beginner, but doesn't require too many retries to get a feeling of how to play the level right).\n\nThe quite engaging plot, which can be summarized as \"it's hard to be a beautiful peace-loving girl when you're a flying killer cyborg\", allows the game to shift from lighthearted moments to sad and grim ones fast, and we can finally fully understand it, since this is a proper localization.", "timestamp_created": 1479939261, "timestamp_updated": 1479939261, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532584", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26915501": {"recommendationid": "26915501", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019438998", "num_games_owned": 219, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 234, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480279147}, "language": "english", "review": "The best", "timestamp_created": 1479939157, "timestamp_updated": 1479939157, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26897239": {"recommendationid": "26897239", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020440280", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1811, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514793063}, "language": "english", "review": "Sora is an amazing, fast paced, challenging, shoot 'em up where you play as a girl named Sora (Japanese for \"Sky\") who was born as the ultimate weapon to fight in a war. \n\nLet me just skip to the end here and say: Sora is a great game and despite everything I say about it, it is most certainly worth your time, so check it out!\n\nPlot:\n******\n[spoiler]Sora was born as the ultimate weapon to fight in a war that had been going on for ages. After her first battle in the gloomy, grey sky she glimpses the beautiful blue sky through the clouds before losing consciousness. When she wakes a man tells her of his dream to \"clean up the sky\" and make the planet a beautiful place to live again. The memory of what Sora saw beyond the grey hued clouds moves her heart and she asks if there is any way she can help. After that she fights a war of protection to defend those who wish to put an end to the war and save the planet from \"dying\".  [/spoiler]\n\nGameplay:\n************\nSora is a fast paced bullet hell, shoot 'em up and at times can be quite challenging. Sometimes the screen is so filled with projectiles it can be hard to tell where you actually are and where enemies are (especially on higher difficulties). The weapon system is quite good: Beam weapons can be passed through by dashing to charge the hyper gauge and recover health, while \"Live-Ammo\" projectiles cannot be dashed through, but tend to move slower and do more damage. The dash is also worked into gameplay quite well, allowing quick maneuvers to deal damage without taking to much yourself.\n\nPros vs. Cons:\n****************\nPros:\n- Very fun, but still challenging gameplay.\n- Amazing story and characters (They will stay with you long after you finish the game).\n- Huge variety of weapons and weapon combinations.\n- Incredible Soundtrack.\n- Different playable modes such as arcade mode (All levels back to back) and match mode (Boss Rush).\n- Record you best runs and watch the replays.\n- Anime art style.\n\n\nCons:\n- Story is a little too short and although very good, could have been developed further.\n- Some weapons have very limited applications and are never used.\n- Replays don't record certain parts of some levels (such as Credits and Cutscenes) meaning you have to replay levels to see them again.\n- The game can be brutally difficult at times.\n- Voice acting is absent from almost the entire game, except the end of the second-to-last level and the last level making it feel weird and out of place. ([spoiler]It is absent again in the secret \"Bonus\" level[/spoiler])\n\nFinal Words:\n**************\nAs I said at the beginning of this review, Sora is a great game, and is most certainly worth your time. I have had more fun playing Sora than I have in a long time with most other games, and I game alot.

Blasphemy!?\n\nAnyways... Sora, like Suguri, is a bullet hell style shoot 'em up with unique mechanics. We follow our protagonist Sora, a war machine created solely to end said war, fighting back against those who choose to disturb the peace and continue fighting, meeting some familiar faces along the way. The game consists of 7 regular stages and a bonus stage, which may seem small but more than makes up for it in both the difficulty and replayability value.\n\nSora is in no way as hard as Suguri, however there were some fairly major tweaks in the gameplay to stop the more cheesy strats, such as adding heat penalties for constantly dashing to turn sharply and cancelling delays after shooting. This said, however, the game can be very challenging to those who seek such a challenge with the hard and special difficulties, as well as having a moderate challenge for those like myself who were apparently just never given those bullet hell genes.\n\n\nThe game in general runs smoothly with fairly little lag even on awful laptops such as mine, and the animations are very fluid. The game looks beautiful when we get half a second to look at it, and each little area seems unique, from a snowy alpine region to a barren desert to a gloomy city, never seeming bland or unimaginative to me in the least. The character designs are also very interesting to me, genuinely making me want to get to know these characters more and what caused them to do the things they did.\n\nThe game also has it's own little way of teaching you the game mechanics without really teaching you at all. The bosses seem to serve as tutorials, forcing you to get to grips with a certain mechanic and punishing hard if you fail to do so. For example in the first boss battle, the boss uses many fast energy based attacks to force you to learn dashing, whilst the second teaches you how to deal with projectiles that cannot be dashed through and melee attacks. I always find it charming when games like this don't just pop up a little text box, and instead teach you the mechanics through many many tears fighting that one boss over and over until you finally get it... Gotta love it...\n\nThe gameplay itself is extremely intuitive, as someone who didn't own a controller for a while, I managed to beat the whole game with keyboard. There aren't a whole lot of buttons to have to learn, there's no having to press 15 buttons at the same time to pull off a super secret special mega ultra attack, just a select few, and that's really all the game needs. The game forces you to make quick decisions but instead of forcing you to fit in a tiny gap between bullets, there are several ways to dodge attacks or beat a boss. The starting weapons are actually pretty good in my opinion, the game doesn't force you to grind in order to get better weapons, instead encourages you to try with what you have, and if that doesn't work, well tough, you just need to get better. By the end of the game, you'll probably have unlocked the majority if not all of the weapons, so it's nice to just go back, play through the stages again and wonder 'what if I used this', or 'what if I did this differently', making the game very enjoyable to play through again.\n\nAnd if, after playing the game through once, you're thinking 'IF I HAVE TO FIGHT THAT STUPID STAGE 3 MINIBOSS ONE MORE TIME TABLES WILL BE FLIPPED', well you're in luck. The boss battle mode makes for a nice, stressful time, especially on special difficulty, but it's definitely nice to not have to do the whole stage again just to practice the end boss if you're trying on a higher difficulty.\n\nBut I mean one good thing in playing the stages over and over and dying over and over is being able to experience the amazing soundtrack Sora has to offer. Honestly in my first playthrough I was too stressed to pay attention, it took a friend pointing out certain tracks for me to realise how wonderful they were, and oh my are they wonderful. After buying the soundtrack I honestly can't name a single track I dislike, even the main menu theme... And that's saying something after you've finished one of the two songs with lyrincs in them, both of which are a nice touch, and not grating as I understand lyrical tracks can be sometimes in games. Honestly I'd buy this game just to listen to the soundtrack, it's just that wonderful.\n\nIn conclusion, Sora is a wonderful addition to the bullet hell genre, subverting the norm of 'just shoot and try to fit yourself into these tiny gaps' and improving very much over the original, Suguri, which is also a great game in it's own right. With a great atmosphere, great graphics and a much greater soundtrack, Sora has probably become my favourite bullet hell I've ever played, having probably the 3rd or 4th spot in my favourite OSTs list. I'd recommend buying this dut to all these reasons, and it being fairly cheap certainly helps.", "timestamp_created": 1473895822, "timestamp_updated": 1473895822, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536083", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25481303": {"recommendationid": "25481303", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135640131", "num_games_owned": 109, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 483, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500118663}, "language": "schinese", "review": "[spoiler]\u82b1\u4e86\u6211\u4e00\u4e2a\u534a\u5c0f\u65f6\u63a8\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5173\uff0c\u6211\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u6ca1\u6551\u4e86[/spoiler]\n[h1]\u4e00\u4e2a\u795e\u5947\u7684\u6e38\u620f[/h1]\nsteam\u665a\u4e86\u5feb\u5341\u5e74\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u8fd8\u6ca1\u6709\u539f\u6765\u7684\u754c\u9762\uff0c\u4e0d\u723d\n\u4f46\u662f\u6709\u6bd2\u505c\u4e0d\u4e0b\u6765\nMUSIC 1/1\nDIFFICULTY \u2192\u221e\nADDICTION 1/1\n\u539f\u58f0\u5e26\u4e0d\u9519\n", "timestamp_created": 1473698788, "timestamp_updated": 1473698788, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25377146": {"recommendationid": "25377146", "author": {"steamid": "76561198318454441", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473149250}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u786e\u5b9e\u597d\u73a9\u554a\uff01\u6bd4\u4e1c\u65b9\u5f39\u5e55\u6e38\u620f\u7b80\u5355\u591a\u4e86~\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u80fd\u4e0d\u80fd\u518d\u7b80\u5355\u4e00\u70b9\uff1f\u8ba9\u6211\u80fd\u591f\u628a\u7b2c\u4e00\u5173\u7ed9\u901a\u4e86\uff1f", "timestamp_created": 1473149420, "timestamp_updated": 1473149420, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25337902": {"recommendationid": "25337902", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046968420", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 4077, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513910546}, "language": "english", "review": "As challenging as the game is, the story is powerful and the characters are each unique in their own way.

Some of the in game achievements are quite crazy that involve defeating boss in a certain way....\n\nIf you get killed a lot by alte on first stage.. stay calm and keep on trying.. once you complete her you will unlock one of the best weapon .. machine gun which you can move and shoot to make a lot stage a lot simpler.. And one more tip.. sometime it's best to shoot in the general direction of the enemy instead of locking on...\n\nI know i will leave this game as barely finished but I won't spend too much time to learn the pattern 100% to get all the achievements for this game...\n\n8/10.. enjoy for any bullet hell fan and 100% OJ fan must play it to learn some interesting background and character connections.", "timestamp_created": 1470232740, "timestamp_updated": 1508481149, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583160", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24614283": {"recommendationid": "24614283", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055272138", "num_games_owned": 315, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 545, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452724609}, "language": "german", "review": "Sora ist ein horizontaler Shoot \u2018em Up von OrangeJuice, den Machern von Spielen wie \u201eQP Shooting \u2013 Dangerous\u201c und \u201e100% Orange Juice\u201c (welches fr\u00fcher oder sp\u00e4ter wohl auch eine Rezension von mir erhalten wird).\nDieses Spiel ist ein Teil der Suguri Reihe und erz\u00e4hlt die Geschehnisse vor dem ersten Suguri Spiel. Die Originale Version von Sora erschien 2010, wobei eine verbesserte HD Version von Sora Januar 2016 auf Steam erschienen ist.\n\n[h1]Handlung[/h1]\nDie Welt ist zerr\u00fcttet von Krieg. Menschen bek\u00e4mpfen sich seit Ewigkeiten gegeneinander, solange schon, dass niemand \u00fcberhaupt mehr die Ursache des Krieges kennt. Eines jedoch ist gewiss: keine der beiden Seiten wird sich die Bl\u00f6\u00dfe geben und den Kampf ohne Sieg beenden.\nSomit kommt Sora ins Spiel. Ihr K\u00f6rper konnte auf eine besondere Wei\u00dfe verst\u00e4rkt werden, wodurch sie den Sieg in diesem Krieg erbringen soll. Nun ist es Soras Aufgabe, ihrer Bestimmung zu folgen, ob sie es will, oder nicht.\n\nDa dieses Spiel ein Shoot \u2018em Up ist, ist die Handlung nicht besonders tief; am Ende jedes Levels trifft man auf einen Boss Charakter, es werden ein paar Worte ausgetauscht, und schon folgt ein Kampf. Aber trotzdem schafft das Spiel es, einige wiedererkennbare und sympathische Charaktere zu schaffen, und am Ende des Spiels hofft man, dass Sora ein gutes Ende f\u00fcr ihre Welt herbeibringen kann. \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nSora ist ein horizontaler Shoot \u2018em Up des Bullet Hell Subgenres. Jedoch anstatt sich haupts\u00e4chlich auf das Ausweichen von Projektilen zu konzentrieren, besitzt Sora, so wie die Vorg\u00e4ngerspiele in der Suguri-Reihe, einen gro\u00dfen Fokus auf das Timing von Angriffen.\nIm Gegensatz zu anderen Shoot \u2018em Ups kann man in Sora nicht einfach dauerhaft Projektile auf Gegner feuern, da Sora bei jedem Schuss auf ihrer derzeitigen Position stehen bleibt und somit ein leichtes Ziel f\u00fcr gegnerische Projektile wird.\n\nEs gibt drei Arten von Projektilen: \n\u2022 Laser, welche in der Regel schnell gefeuert werden k\u00f6nnen, jedoch weniger Schaden machen und, sofern sie von den Gegnern kommen, von Sora mithilfe der Dash-F\u00e4higkeit unbeschadet durchquert werden k\u00f6nnen, \n\u2022 ballistische Projektile, wie Raketen, welche am meisten Schaden machen, daf\u00fcr Sora aber l\u00e4nger am Platz halten, und \n\u2022 Nahkampfwaffen, welche Sora zwingen, nahe an die Gegner und somit an unerwarteten Projektile heranzur\u00fccken.\nSomit sind nicht nur Reflexe und Einpr\u00e4gung der Geschossmuster die einzigen Gewinnfaktoren, sondern auch der richtige Einsatz der Waffen, was das Spiel so besonders macht.\nSora kann zu jeder Zeit eine Waffe jedes Waffentyps besitzen, wobei weitere Waffen dieser Typen im Laufe des Spiels freigeschaltet werden k\u00f6nnen, um dem Spieler mehr Individualisierungsm\u00f6glichkeiten zu geben. Man kann das Spiel aber auch sehr gut mit den Standardwaffen durchspielen, welche sogar meine pers\u00f6nlichen Lieblingswaffen sind.\n\nJedes Level besitzt zwei Teile: Im ersten k\u00e4mpft man gegen eine Reihe von verschiedenen kleineren Gegnern, und im zweiten Teil bek\u00e4mpft man einen dreiphasigen Boss.\nIm ersten Teil des Levels wird ein gro\u00dfer Fokus darauf gelegt, herauszufinden, welche Waffe am besten bei welchem Gegner wirkt, w\u00e4hrend bei den Bossk\u00e4mpfen eher das traditionelle Ausweichen von Projektilen im Fokus steht, wodurch, bei den gleichen Spielmechaniken, ein Wandel der ben\u00f6tigten F\u00e4higkeiten stattfindet, was das Spiel interessant h\u00e4lt, selbst wenn man nur ein Level am St\u00fcck spielt.\n\nSora ist recht herausfordernd, selbst auf der einfachsten Schwierigkeitsstufe, und das auch f\u00fcr Shoot \u2018em Up Fans. Sobald man sich aber an die Waffenmechanik gew\u00f6hnt hat, wird das Spiel wesentlich einfacher.\n\n[h1]Pr\u00e4sentation[/h1]\nDas Spiel verwendet einen Mix aus 2D Sprites f\u00fcr die Charaktere und Objekte, und 3D Hintergrundgrafiken, und ist in einem Anime-haften Kunststil gehalten. Alles in allem sieht das Spiel ganz gut aus.\nWer hofft, in diesem Spiel sch\u00f6ne Projektilmuster (wie z.B. in den Touhou Spielen) zu sehen, wird leider entt\u00e4uscht werden. Dieses Spiel ist generell nicht so farbenfroh wie man es von Anime Shoot \u2018em Ups erwarten k\u00f6nnte. Daf\u00fcr gibt es aber einige gute Lichteffekte, die etwas mehr Kontrast in das Spiel bringen.\nWas Sora an Farbe fehlt, gleicht es mit einem \u00fcberaus mitrei\u00dfenden Trance-Soundtrack wieder aus. Die Lieder passen sehr gut zu diesem Spiel, und obwohl ich Trance eher weniger mag, bin ich trotzdem richtig begeistert von dem Soundtrack. \nDer OST kann im Bundle zusammen mit dem Spiel (oder auch separat als DLC) gekauft werden.\n\n\n[h1]Fazit[/h1]\nSora ist ein sehr gutes Shoot \u2018em Up Spiel mit einer etwas anderen, aber bei weitem nicht schlechten Spielmechanik. Fans von (Anime) Shoot \u2018em Ups sollten sich dieses Spiel auf jeden Fall holen.\nF\u00fcr Personen, die keine Spiele m\u00f6gen, bei denen man sehr schnelle Reflexe ben\u00f6tigt, sollten jedoch lieber die Finger von diesem Spiel lassen.\n\nSora bekommt von mir 4 von 5 Orangen.", "timestamp_created": 1469883280, "timestamp_updated": 1469883280, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24528953": {"recommendationid": "24528953", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128718260", "num_games_owned": 264, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 284, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472033328}, "language": "english", "review": "Really good shoot em up ganeplay.\nThe soundtrack is beautiful and the fighting is well made.", "timestamp_created": 1469496603, "timestamp_updated": 1469496603, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24212345": {"recommendationid": "24212345", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027804983", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468246274}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely amazing!

On the surface I loved the look of this game and I love me some anime stuff as much as the next guy. Call me dumb but i partially bought this game for the story (probably a mistake) but also you know, I have played a few of this shoot 'em up like games (well maybe only one I can remember) but still I really wanted to see what this game was like.\n\nSo... I play the tutorial, okay seems striaghtforward enough, after that I am flung into what i assume is level one after some cut scenes backstory etc.,a and I manage to scrape my way through level 1 (I think?) which its fair im just picking this up I dont expect to master this game in 10 minutes, but hey at least I am progressing. After that im sent back to the now existant start menu after another little cutscene. Okay! i guess this means I can continue the story so i go to story mode, only to find the only levels I can play are the tutorial and the level I JUST BEAT. I then Think to myself alright maybe I just gotta beat this level once more to get this rolling.\n\n I load it up it asks for difficulty level I think okay, Normal seems like a fair place even though it states its for people who are \"used to the game\"  whatever that means? Well that is where the fun stops the level I just beat, cant beat it again... I tried at least 8 times or so and COULD NOT even get close to beating it. I really believe in a challenging games but playing the first level over and over and over again just aint fun. It is honestly quite demoralizing I am I terrible at this game or something?\n\nIs this what is meant by bullet hell? Forced to relive your death on the first level of a game over and over unable to even experience the core of a game? Feeling despair knowing you will not clear the level when only halfway through? I dont know, all I know is in my opinion playing a game on normal difficulty should be a challenging but doable experience when playing this game I feel this game does not neccessarily fit that so well...\n\nI am not sure if there is something I am missing but I just find myself frustrated, and I personally refuse to lower a game to \"easy\" difficulty as it honestly just feels like cheating to me, but hey maybe I am just flawed in my ways.\n\nFrom what I can actually experience this game looks great love the whole vibe of it, and I really wanted to experience the story (I cant really comment on whether it is good or not as i cannot readily experience it) It seems like it may be fairly priced but again not sure how much content is really in here. I found this game very frustrating and not very fun as apparently im not even good enough at it to actually play it...  If you dont mind being frustrated i guess take a whack at it if you wish... But I really would not recommend this unless your really into this genre.", "timestamp_created": 1465072600, "timestamp_updated": 1465072600, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

=[/h1]\n\nBefore I get to the review I will admittedly say that I pre-ordered this game and it's soundtrack on the premise of getting the free character \"Sora (Military)\" for \"100% Orange Juice\" and to just have some extra music to listen to.\n\nI booted the game up just over 6 months (yesterday) after it's release on a whim to see if it would provide a good break from the usual titles I had been playing and it instantly became a title I'm going to remember for a long time.\n\n[h1]= Review =[/h1]\n\n- Initial experience with gameplay -\n\nIt's been about a year since I last played a bullet hell shooter so I was basically coming in as good as the general noob and I have to say it was an interesting experience to get thrashed as hard as I did on easy.\n\n11 hours in and I finaly beat easy (minus the extra and boss rush) but I realised something as I went through the story mode.\n\nMuch like 'getting good' in the popular \"Dark Souls\" I stopped over analyzing things and began the trend of analyzing how I died and then remembered what caught me off guard.\n\nThe game had soon turned from a screen filled torrent of death to an intricate maze of paterns.\n\nI realize that this is common hat for the geanre but I found \"Sora\" more forgiving than other giants such as \"Touhou\" and more challenging than something like \"Trouble Witches NEO\".\n\nIt was refreshing to know that I was able to grasp victory eventually.\n\nThe boss that gave me the biggest headache to beat was Lv 3's boss with 28 attempts to show how terrible I was at the beginning.\n\nEvery other boss in the game thus far for me has been under 10 attempts.\n\n- Gameplay Features -\n\nAnother interesting facet that I found in this game that I hadn't seen before was the Dash/Heat feature and the Weapon System.\n\nThe Dash and Heat features in the game provide a nice ease of use and risk/reward set-up. where dashing lets you pass through 80% of the attacks comming at you but using it increases the damage you take coming out of it.\n\nIt was an interesting mechanic that let my noob self get accustomed to the enemies and my skilled self work on getting the fastest times possible with not a single hit. \n\nWith the weapon set-up the game outright presented itself as one who can be solved with no one key combination.\n\nI found myself experimenting with different weapons to see how I could manage the levels and while I can say I royally flopped with some I can clearly see their usefullness to some one more skilled or of a different mind-set.\n\nI would also like to note that almost all the weapons are unlocked on attempt count wrather than level completion count.\n\nThat alone let me quickly adapt and grow with the weapons that I loved and compare them with other unique weapons.\n\nWhich is great for people who are wanting to experiment early on or are frustrated with certain bosses.\n\n- Presentation -\n\nI decided to read up on the development blog post made by the devs at Orange Juice and I have to say I appreciate everything that this game is asthetically.\n\nEverything about the geanre of Danmaku and Bullet Hells is supposed to feel nostalgic no mater the rendering.\n\nLike an old arcade title you toss coins into, this game has out-and-in gameplay done wonderfully.\n\nI can count at most 6 seconds going from a death anywhere in the game to booting the level back up and beginning my next attempt. \n\n- Characters and Story -\n\nI've played both 100% Orange Juice and 200% Mixed Juice extensively so I've always wondered what the character's source material from all the OJ games were about.\n\nI was surprised that Sora's story was as interesting as it was.\n\nThere isn't much dialouge in the game and only a couple of scenes are voiced but the dialouge that does happen gives all the info you need on the characters and the conflict.\n\nThe dialouge is a little rough on the translation side and the wording is quite simple but I will say that I found the story quite gripping despite that.\n\n- Visual Asthetics -\n\nThe're is an odd simplicity to the graphics and yet the high resolution brings out so much in it's environment.\n\nThe levels and stages were quite stunning to have as backdrops to the on screen action as the break-up points in combat always lead to some sort of transformation in the background to warn you of the imposing doom or to show your movement through the world.\n\nThe Menu and UI are also clean and crisp to give a perfect ci-fi tone.\n\nI believe it's one of the best I've seen.\n\n- Audio -\n\nThe game has a stunning Trance soundtrack that I'm happy was released for sale.\n\nThe high speed and mixture of light and dark atmospheres in the game are perfectly matched to the level themes.\n\nTwo of the boss songs even have vocal which caught me off guard.\n\n[h1]= The Final Verdict =[/h1]\n\nWhile my play time hasn't been massive as of now I know quite well it will be.\n\nThis game has instantly gripped me both in it's asthetic and wildly fun gameplay that is more immediately forgiving than other bigger bullet hell series.\n\nIt invoked nostalgia in me even though I'm someone who has not played a lot of this geanre and generally unfamilliar with the developers material.\n\nThe big thing that made me fall in love with the game was it's match of visual and sound.\n\nI will be looking to this game if anyone ever asks me what an asthetically correct game looks like.\n\nI'm dissapointed in myself for not trying this game sooner and will be brushing off the dust on un-played titles more often.\n\nI will ultimately give this game a [b]9 / 10[/b] for it's approachability and solid design as the dialouge is really the only big flaw I can give it.\n\nThanks Orange Juice and Fruite Bat Factory for this title that will inspire my own game design.", "timestamp_created": 1464199804, "timestamp_updated": 1464199868, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

I really hate Steam's binary rating system.)\n\nFor more reviews, and a short gameplay video, check out probablysanny.wordpress.com !\n\nI was quickly frustrated when I started playing Sora. The game isn't unfair, it just does an incredibly poor job of communicating it's boss mechanics. You'll have no idea what you're supposed to be doing the first time in a fight, maybe even the second and third. Sora expects you to figure things out on your own, which can be extremely frustrating. If you're interested in playing this game, I suggest patience. If you persist, it's quite enjoyable.\n\nUnlike other shmups, in Sora, you can't just hold down the fire button. When you attack, you are forced to stand still for a brief period, and are left vulnerable. You can cancel out of these attacks, but I found the sudden change in momentum jarring at first. It takes a while to get used to if you've played other shmups before. But, I think this unique mechanic is the only real edge Sora has.\n\nYou can equip 3 weapons before each stage. Generally, a rifle, a rocket and a melee weapon, although there are some exceptions, such as mines. The melee weapons are very high risk/reward and add a bit more variety to the combat.\n\nI'm not a big fan of Sora's artstyle, but it isn't objectively bad. I think the hand-drawn characters have a certain cute charm to them, even if I don't really appreciate it. However, The combination of the playable character and bosses as 2-D sprites with the 3-D enemies and backgrounds certainly put me off. They don't feel like they belong in the same game, but the problem is mostly ignorable after the first few minutes of gameplay.\n\nThe music isn't as great as other soundtracks I've heard recently, but I still enjoyed it. I especially liked the track that plays in Stage 7, however ironically. The Engrish vocals are just too good for me to ignore, I smile every time.\n\nSora lacks an overall level of polish. The visuals look a bit off, the gameplay isn't as smooth as it should be, and there are a lot strange design choices. I have no idea how the weapon unlock system works, they seem to randomly appear after stages every now and then, regardless of how well I performed. Is it simply tied to how many stages I've played? Are there secret tasks you have to perform? I have no idea.\n\nI don't think Sora is a brilliant example of bullet-hells, and I don't feel like I'm really in the intended audience, but I still had a lot of fun with it. It's interesting enough to set it apart from it's competition, so if you're really itching for something new, I'd recommend picking it up. There are probably better options out there to sate your bullet-hell fix, but I wouldn't ignore Sora entirely.", "timestamp_created": 1456203216, "timestamp_updated": 1456203216, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.429586", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21380977": {"recommendationid": "21380977", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104849521", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453034563}, "language": "english", "review": "Best Game of Bullet Hell i`ve ever played\nwith cute characters and nice graphics this game is worth to buy", "timestamp_created": 1456124055, "timestamp_updated": 1456124055, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539474", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21336924": {"recommendationid": "21336924", "author": {"steamid": "76561198194489754", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456543758}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u6b3e\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\u6e38\u620f\n\u559c\u6b22\u5979\u7684BGM\uff0c\u80cc\u666f\u4ee5\u53ca\u4eba\u8bbe\uff08\u597d\u50cf\u6ca1\u591a\u5c11\u5427\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6bd4\u8f83\u96be\u4e0a\u624b\n\u6bd5\u7adf\u6211\u4e60\u60ef\u4e86\u7eb5\u7248\u7684\u5f39\u5e55\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u4e00\u5f00\u59cb\u73a9\u771f\u7684\u614c\u4e86\u3002\u3002\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1455964841, "timestamp_updated": 1455964841, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21224934": {"recommendationid": "21224934", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996036318", "num_games_owned": 514, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 911, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455492134}, "language": "english", "review": "For those who know Suguri: it's like Suguri, but with a humanly possible difficulty.\n\nFor those who don't know Suguri: it's a shmup that allows you to dash through (some) bullets harmlessly.

Orange Juice had subverted most of these tropes in Suguri, and continue to polish their style of danmaku gameplay in the sequel Sora.\n\nThe main nuance to this series is that instead of the standard focused movement, you can perform a dash that sends you flying quickly across the screen. This dash allows you to phase through bullets and standard lasers, but you are still susceptible to physical obstacles such as rockets, dashing also builds up your heat gauge which makes you take even more damage (up to 3 times more damage at 300%). This along with the dashing being used to cancel out shot inputs makes most of the depth in this game, as fighting becomes a visceral mix of shooting and dashing around enemy bullets and rockets, as you try to destroy everything as fast as possible. The potential of these mechanics are realized as each boss plays differently and demand different skills and understanding of mechanics from the player. For example, Tsih can temporarily go invisible meaning that you cannot lock-on to them during this time and you will have to use melee attacks against them, whereas Sham surrounds you with smaller swarming enemies which require switching your lock-on frequently.\n\nAlthough you can phase through most projectiles, this game is in no way easy. If you are new or relatively new to the series like I was when starting this game, it will take you a while to get used to the fast pace of enemy attacks and the sheer density of projectiles at certain points. The game has quite a steep learning curve that will challenge those experienced with bullet hells along with a grading system at the end of each stage which makes the act of playing Sora feel rewarding and addictive. \n\nLike its predecessor, Sora oftentimes feels like a blend between a fighting game and a shmup, especially due to the addition of swords and other melee weapons that you can use. The scoring system capitalises on this, as it rewards players who can play aggressively and take out hordes of enemies swiftly without taking damage. The addictive mechanics are topped off with an improved visual presentation from Suguri and a great trance-style soundtrack that succeeds in giving each boss a lasting impression.\n\nAll in all, Sora feels like an ideal sequel to suguri, as it further expands on the innovations made by suguri with new weapons, abilities, boss fights and certain balance changes. If you are at all a fan of the doujin circle Orange_Juice you would be doing yourself a great disservice by missing out on Sora.", "timestamp_created": 1453506656, "timestamp_updated": 1453506726, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.640370", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20670402": {"recommendationid": "20670402", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155726313", "num_games_owned": 731, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 1206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481434109}, "language": "english", "review": "I honestly never would have thought this game would come to steam.\n\nThis game, Sora, is the sequel to the game Suguri, which was published by Rockin' Android. You are Sora, an enhanced, basically mechanized superhuman fighting in a neverending war that seems to encompass all of Earth, and your goal is to make people stop fighting... by shooting rockets into their faces. Nobody said peacekeeping was easy!\n\nAnyway, this is actually the second time the game has been localized. The first time was done by--I guess you can call them a person--called OmegaTH, who, bluntly speaking, screwed the pooch in localizing it. Horrific translations, Pointless name changes, terrible bugs, missing music I believe, game breaking DRM, the improper use of the word \"Reploid\" were just a few of the things that you could have expected from that localization. \n\nIt seemed the game was doomed to be stuck in a kind of limbo where it was basically as good as never released in the US. \n\nAt least until Fruitbat factory came outta nowhere and decided through the darkest of magic rituals to obtain the license to the game and give it the release it deserved.\n\nThe game has none of the aforementioned problems of the previous localization, integrates with the steam overlay without any flaws, seems to control flawlessly (I've read it \"feels\" off compared to the Japanese version, though I cannot confirm that), and just exudes a lot of the love and care put into it to make it a fine release.

The people on earth have been fighting with each other for whatever reason. So basically you are a war asset and other things which I won't mention due to spoilers.\n\nGameplay\n--------------\nThe game is very very challenging. It's not as difficult as Suguri (The first game, Sora is the Prequel) but still not that easy. Mission 1 took me 1 try, Mission 2 took me 2 tries but Mission 3... Took me 15 and the scale gets higher until I reached Mission 5 Where I beat it on my first but the rest soon took longer to finish. So yeah, not too easy and not too difficult but for most I think they'd say its hard. Enough about difficulty, tiem for the gametype, It's a Bullet-Hell. But instead of moving around the energy bullets you can pass through them if you were to Use your \"Dash\" ability. However, you cannot dash through live ammunition (Eg. Missiles) and as you dash, you gain Heat. Heat can reach up to 300% and that would mean if you were to get hit... You will take much more damage. Heat would take about 8 seconds to settle *But you need to keep dodging too* so it's really bad if you are careless.In each mission, there are enemies which pop up throughout the mission (henchmen?), followed by a mid-stage boss which is there to prepare you for the true boss and at the end, the actual boss with a name and health bar. As I said before, You unlock even more weapons as you progress so you can ditch your sword for an even bigger sword *After dying 100 Times* I really like arcade games so this was a treat for me. If you don't like Bullet-hell games then you should just ignore this game.\n\nArt\n-----\nSora is such a freakin adorable character <3 (and some others too but no one can beat Sora imo)\nThe character sprites are really well done and pretty (Atleast to my taste). The level design is like it's from a ps2 era game so nothing special. The missiles and lasers you blast out (and or shot at you) are also well animated which givest he game more life. \n\nThat's about the only thing I can think to describe this nice and wonderful game.

So gameplay wise, if you enjoyed Suguri you'll definitely like Sora, especially with the latter's refinements over the original. For example, dash spamming has been nerfed in general--initiating a dash will boost your Heat by about 30%, thus making it more risky to turn on a dime. You also gain Heat from attack cancelling, making that riskier as well. The difficulty curve also feels less abrupt than in Suguri (I still have PTSD from that Kae fight), and scales more linearly. Furthermore, the weapons have been rebalanced making most of the worse weapons from Suguri more viable.\n\nIn terms of length, it took me around 9 hours or so to beat story mode (stages 1-7) on easy, so there's quite a bit of content, along with the fantastic OST.

Which makes destroying projectiles guessing games at best.\nBeam attacks are stupidly random, where certain beam attacks cannot be dashed past, but then they teach you you're supposed to dash vs beam attacks? Why even...?\n\nMelee weapons are incredibly useless, their damage is laughable at best and only promote the idea of staying long range and keeping the highest priority to dodge stuff.\nThere's no reward for being risky with a melee weapon, and in various instances beam weapons seem to easily outdps projectile and melee attacks.\n\nThere are no base attack values or any form of attack damage calculations or functions which teach you in the game and makes the training stages tips about knowing the damage you inflict with weapons completely negligible \n\nBeam attacks have a very... VERY slow rate of fire and usually promote animation cancelling as a way of life, instead of a quirky reward for being quick on controls.\n\nRocket Launchers are the same thing, however you're also inclined to suffer through their poor projectile speed which is so lazy any idea of even thinking their a threat to dodge is a joke. It makes the idea of simply destroying the projectiles as a strategy of minimizing threat a smart idea, but without any form of control/targetting onto missiles, the idea is hastily culled.\n\nThe last thing I want to mention is the boss design. They're all the same\nThey all have this rather lazy blink around, \"ha you cant target me! wait until my boring invicibility frame has ended while I charge my ultimate attack!?!\"\nAnd well... it's pretty dull XD\nThough it doesn't really impede on the game THAT much... the strategies used to fight bosses only differ around the idea of survivability which is one thing I do like. However the blink factor is hella annoying!\nThe other thing I don't like is that there are no... not so obvious weaknesses from bosses that you can exploit or use as a way to optimize the boss fight for fast times and quickest possible kills\nIt's just, shoot, dodge their stuff, shoot again.  The weapons you acquire don't give you a dynamic advantage against bosses or enemies... they're just weapons.\nIf there was weaknesses, resistances which punish you for your weapon choices and demand you change things around, where you have to use your melee, missile or beam attacks specifically. This would be an awesome touch to the game!\n\nIf I had to suggest any solution to the above, i'd state the following:\n1) Make missile projectiles much faster, so dodging them is an actual challenge.\nThis works both ways, for Sora's attacks and for enemy attacks.\n\n2) Either nerf beam attack power and increase their rate of fire. Or set a more dynamic difference between beam and missile attacks. Missiles either have the faster rate of fire but with projectile travel distance & time in mind.\nOr make beam attack rates faster and make beams designed to be weak & fast for rapid fire design or design beam rifles so you can fire and move simutaneously with weaker damage and more heat gain\n\n3) Make melees stronger and more dynamic,\nThere needs to be a substancial reward in going close range. Especially when 99% of enemies simutaneously fire missiles and beam attacks at the same time.\nAlso design SOME melee enemies. To create more unpredictability and interesting encounters, it doesn't do justice when every boss attacks that fall under the condition of \"Melee\" are all long range attacks that you're just forced to dodge and survive from\n\n4) Animation cancelling should not be a necessity\nThis kind of annoys me but at the same time, it's a live and learn kind of thing.\nI just think the game design makes you rely heavily on the idea of this mechanic, and in some places would be hilarious if they made a boss where it punishes you for doing it, instead of just a bucket of rewards, and your only route to fast rate of fire.\n\n5) Make bosses physically move around, instead of blinking lazily to 1 corner of the screen\nThe bosses are incredibly immobile, and half the time the blink function that they use simply makes the boss fight tedious instead of challenging.\nwhen they're stationary for such a long time before they blink, it makes targetting/attacking them so easy, and it forces a routine of simply shoot, dodge, shoot dodge. \nPerhaps things will get harder in a sequel or something, but i think its worth considering.\n\nWhat I love about this game?\n\nIt's simple for starters, and that's something I appreciate!\nI'm tired of all these graphic whores of games where it's so easy to just read where the majority of development spent there time.\nThis game is easy on the eyes, with a niche anime touch to it, which actually makes it pleasant to look at, instead of eye blinding.\n\nTrial and error feel\nI love this a lot! Theres a trial and error theme to this game, where perfection is the main objective.\nTrying to complete a level without taking damage is a hell of a fun challenge which demands a good memory, reactions and a strong learning attitude.\nIf you're into games with trial and error factors, this game will definately be a good one for you\n\nSora is adorable\nNuff sed! I want Sora plush-dolls <3\n\nDecent weapon variety\nOk i'll admit I'm kind of on the fence with this one. And this is probably a major point which mitigates my rant about the weapon designs.\nThe weapon variety is cool. don't get me wrong. and its nice to have a lot of stuff to try out, and a slight explorational grind where completing one level multiple times in hopes for more weapons is a viable thing to do.\nBut it's the base design of the weapons which I feel makes it suck. They all have the same weaknesses. And the enemies dont exploits the weapon flaws in ways you can, which makes for a rather linear experience.\n\nStages are short and sweet, but full of action\nThere's rarely a dull moment during a stage, especially if you run with arcade mode.\nIt has a great flow to it, and it's very smooth with nice music to keep you tied to the game, and have a good time!\nI love the soundtracks, they definately make the experience twice as fun.\n\nPlot and expansion potential\nThere's a lot of potential for this game, such as expansion and sequels.\nI really hope they make a sequel to this game, or it's at least considered. This is a game where simply adding more stages, weapons and whatnot, would definately go a long way.\nEven the idea of a stage creator/weapon creator so fans can make their own input would be beyond amazing and I think it would create a lot of community based input, where players can download add-ons\n\nI would definately recommend this game.\nIt's fun, it's simple, and it has a great flow to the

Also note that I initially bought another version of this game on GamersGate a year ago which explains how I was able to beat it so easily. The game (on GG) is unpurchasable as far as I know. Of course, this version easily takes that juicy cake.  \n\nTo begin with, Sora is basically a unique 2D side-scrolling bullet hell game similar to Suguri from the same company that made the popular board game 100% Orange Juice where you play as a young biogenetically enhanced/engineered human girl and defected soldier named Sora through 9 stages (including tutorial and extra stage) in the Suguri/Sora universe and let me warn you, this thing is shit hard even on easy. I only managed to beat it because of the countless hours I spent on the \u03a9th\u2019s version.\n\nNow what makes this one different from the \u03a9th\u2019s is that now it has better translation, window/fullscreen/borderless mode support, better visual quality and all that other fancy smancy stuff.\n\nTo the actual review:\n\n[h1]Storyline[/h1] I am quite familiar with the Suguri/Sora universe and thus I could absorbed some of the scenes and reference they made. I don\u2019t believe you need to pick up Suguri first if you haven\u2019t yet since there are little said scenes in these 9 stages. Though if you did get Suguri first then you\u2019ll probably able to piece the timeline together. *cough* [spoiler] Sora is a prequel of Suguri [/spoiler] *cough*\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1] One word: \u201crepetitive\u201d. Since even on easy you\u2019ll get rained on by a lot and I mean A LOT of shitstorms coming for Sora\u2019s head, you will inevitably die from turning to a wrong corner. Expect much rage on this one. Heck I even screamed because some boss had a speck of health left and turned fucking Rambo before I had time to shield up. Though by reaching a certain milestone, you can unlock different weapons.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1] Can even run on a potato-powered toaster(not really) and looks better than Suguri. The colorful sparks and light effects from beams and explosions are also enjoyable to watch and add to the fast-paced and intensity of any battle. [b] Epileptics be warned. Also for those who played on a potato-powered toaster, things may get clunky if you have too much bullets filling up your screen. [/b]\n\n[h1]Music[/h1] There are tracks that I am not fond of and there are tracks that are one of my most favorite track of all time. Sometimes you just don\u2019t pay attention to the music at all since the high paced gameplay gives you no room to enjoy them. If you get the chance, try to listen to some of them [spoiler] it\u2019s possible to rip them off from the .dat file but don\u2019t ask me how[/spoiler]. There are music tracks with English vocals too. For me those are a nice touch.\n\n[h1]Voice[/h1] There are Japanese voice acting but limited only in the final boss fight. This is just frostings on the cake but you\u2019ll get to hear what the deadpan Sora sounds like. Easily 10/10 out of me\n\n[h1]Controls[/h1] You can play it on a keyboard or a standard XInput controller or even a DirectInput controller. I used the latter (I live in the Stone Age I know). I recommend playing it on a controller. It allows for easier controls and may reduce difficulty significantly for most people since you\u2019ll become more nimble. Keyboard works\u2026 but stupid. Just stop\u2026 please.\n\nMy Verdict  (8.5/10)\nA fast-paced bullet hell game that will guarantee you some sort of rage if you don\u2019t have what it takes to dodge any sort of projectile coming towards you. Also requires a lot of reflexes and hand eye-coordination skillz. The game is enjoyable for a few hours and the repetitiveness will get to you eventually except for those who enjoy unlocking new weapons and achieving high scores or just enjoy spending time with Sora in general. *cough* [spoiler] like me [/spoiler] *cough*\nMinus one because of a certain bug involving the big ass sword and half a one for repetitiveness.\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anonymous_Neko/images/]Check out my nifty Sora-related artworks over at my profile gallery[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1452101889, "timestamp_updated": 1452101991, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.670571", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20355439": {"recommendationid": "20355439", "author": {"steamid": "76561198263110717", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452101057}, "language": "english", "review": "I've never played Suguri (because I already had this and it sounded better), but I had a copy of Sora before it was on Steam and fell in love with it.

[/i]\n\n[u] Summary: [/u]\nLike extremely difficult games? Sora is right up your alley then. But for me, Sora provided an experience that immediately overloaded my frustration meter. A good amount of it comes down to the design of the game. While the heat and dodge mechanics are interesting and work at their core level, the level design leads to TOO much chaos on screen, that happens in an unpredicatable way at times. The game despite having a cancel system to counteract it, asks for reaction times that are way too small, and this is complemented by some unfair elements such as getting hit off screen, or asking too much of the player (by having hints of where boulders are coming in such a light hue of color that you're literally squinting to see it). It's a game that falls apart when it comes together, as while some elements definitely could work on their own with the aesthetic and the music, they don't combine together very well and don't complement each other in terms of gameplay. If you have a high frustration limit, then Sora's core combat will intrigue you. But if you don't, all you'll be doing is cursing. \n\n[b]  Video Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fgu0_Bw-xec[/b]\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]+:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Core concept and gameplay works, in particular with the dodge/heat mechanic. Risk/reward element in that case works, as there's reasons to dodge and reasons NOT to dodge at certain times. \n[*] Cancel mechanic interesting on the surface, allowing for more tactics and keeping the action up. Again, good reasons to use and not use at certain times.\n[*] Like the fact in particular that just MOVING makes sense at times, as opposed to dodging. For some games, it becomes too reliant on those dodge mechanics.\n[*] Controls work for the most part. Dodging may be too fast, but good control.\n[*] Trance music soundtrack works to complement the action very well.\n[/list]\n\n[b]-:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]  Elements of unfair difficulty. Get regularly hit by things off screen or asking way too much of a player to react to.  \n[*]  Some games are a sum of their parts, but that's not Sora. Elements feel like that don't connect very well together, like different teams were working on \n[*]  Aesthetic clashes with gameplay. Hard to see live ammo makes dodging it rather difficult, and too much happening on screen can lead to your eyes straining at the smallest thing.\n[*] Felt like the dodging mechanic could have done better with a more open level design. The speed at which you dodge and the amount of space to work with don't seem to complement very well.\n[*] Lock on can get really annoying at times, due to the having to turn it off in certain cases.

Under-performing weapons have been sharpened, and those that bordered on overkill have been dialled down a bit. There\u2019s a greater sense of punishment for dash abusers, and a refining of the oft-fuzzy visuals. Scoring chains are also a bit more reasonable, no longer punishing you unfairly for pauses in between the action. But it\u2019s that distinction between the girl soldiers and the pedestrian weapons of war that remains the game\u2019s highest selling point. Most missions see you take on the obligatory weapon platforms, massive tanks or attack crafts, but end-of-level bosses match you against a girl with similar talents, forcing you to unlearn a lot of the scrolling shooter tropes that have been drilled into your head.\n\nFull Review // http://www.honestgamers.com/12813/pc/sora/review.html", "timestamp_created": 1452017150, "timestamp_updated": 1452017150, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518485", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20329211": {"recommendationid": "20329211", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154545285", "num_games_owned": 314, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 3742, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477424145}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1][b]Intorduction[/b][/h1]\nI have never been a fan of bullet hell games reason being is that I always can\u2019t keep up with the action that is going on the screen and I usually give up if it is too hard but as for Sora I liked it in fact I loved it and it is quite addictive, because it is manageable for me and I could say I did have a great time playing Sora. Sora tells the story of its namesake: the lone enhanced human, Sora, and her struggle to protect a fading world. Enjoy breathtakingly fast-paced combat in the Suguri universe, with improved game system and graphics along with original trance music by DEKU.\n\n[h1][b]Gameplay Elements[/b][/h1]\nOnto the gameplay elements, I absolutely adore the \u201ccustomization\u201d that you can bring in 3 weapons of your choice which could be unlocked by progressing in the game which will be stronger than the stock weapons that is provided when you start out, and you can either use the unlocked weapons or just use the stock weapons to make the game more challenging.\n\nIn Sora sometimes you may find yourself using a sword or a melee attack which at first glance seems dangerous but it is a high risk high reward type of attack because when the attack connects, a short term and small barrier is formed that blocks off incoming attacks and that is what made the melee attack useful and usable.\n\n[h1][b]Controls[/b][/h1]\nI am playing Sora on PC with a keyboard and the controls are good. The default settings are are well thought out and it can be fully customize allowing you to bind any buttons you want on the keyboard. [no cramping of 2 hands onto 1 side of the keyboard] I think having a good controls are very important because who wants to play a game with 2 hands overlapping each other? That would be pure discomfort and a hassle to play.\n\nA element you will take notice off is the soundtracks, the soundtracks are really great they fit into the battle that is happening in your screen it just makes the whole game feel more immersive and \u201ccool\u201d like you are really part of the fight, I absolutely love the soundtracks.\n\n[h1][b]Do I recommend this game?[/b][/h1]\nDo i recommend Sora? Yes, I definitely recommend you to pick it up if you are a fan off bullet hell and great soundtracks.\nIn addition, everyone who owns Sora will receive a free bonus character in 100% Orange Juice on Steam.\n\n[url=https://azusantiara.wordpress.com/2016/01/04/sora-review/]Click here for the full review there is videos and images[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1452017033, "timestamp_updated": 1452017063, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 59, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.774370", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39555234": {"recommendationid": "39555234", "author": {"steamid": "76561198381627305", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 131, "last_played": 1515836654}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u30c0\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u304c\u6700\u9ad8\u306b\u723d\u5feb\n\u8133\u6c41\u5782\u308c\u6d41\u3057\u306b\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059", "timestamp_created": 1516709103, "timestamp_updated": 1516709103, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 201, "total_negative": 13, "total_reviews": 214}}

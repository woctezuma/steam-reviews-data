It has the perfect balance of early ease of play, along with simple, yet deceptively complex game mechanics that are easily honed over time to keep the game intresting and playable.  \n\nUnlike other FP fighting games, especially stuff with swords, while you can wave your controller around and kill enemies, more specific attack-like postures will do the most damage.   It really does feel like fighting as opposed to flailing.  The melee implementation is far superior to other games IMO.  It's not super-complex, but it works well.\n\nThe spell casting aspect could use a bit of tuning.  It's not always easy to cast, select or pick up spells.  You can only carry one, which isn't obvious so you'll always see newbies waste a bunch of time trying to pick up more than one scroll.   I still am not sure how the healing stuff works either.\n\nThe procedurally generated landscape is breath-taking.  It would be nice to have more variety, and I hope the game will continue to be updated with more content.  \n\nThe same goes for the array of different monsters and their characteristics and abilities.  It's a lot of fun and can be quite challenging.  And using the terrain to your advantage, as well as switching back and forth between weapons, makes combat fast paces and exciting.\n\nMulti-player is also tons of fun and well implemented.  The only exception is, whoever is the party lader, if they drop out, the entire instance shuts down.  That should be changed.

I love that it's co-op and I like how easy it is to join a game. Was looking for a dungeon crawler type of game (I am enthusiastically waiting for a story rich-co-op game to come out.) This one is very fun and and gets even more fun with more people. I haven't had a hard time finding friends to play with but I also know at least four people with an htc vive. The locomotion is great and you  have lots of choices(dual stick FTW) The graphics are simple and quite pretty. The NPC enemy are a bit simplistic...the Bosses are fun to beat and you definitly will have a hard time without a band of brothers/sisters. As you play the game you unlock different styles of weapons and it's great because you can play how you want to...I love the power ups and  I like how you can upgrade your chosen weapons quite a lot and while it isn't easy it's not to hard either. \nThere are a few bugs, sometimes I get stuck in the graphics or locomotion just wont work. Sometimes when you spawn back into the lounge the graphics will disappear. Sometimes you can't pick up your weapons. Sometimes the spell scrolls just keep spitting out at you when you try to grab the one off your belt...Things like that. Usually restarting the game fixes it. \nOne thing i've noticted is that those that use teleport are WAY faster at moving around the maps and if you want to keep up you have to teleport as well. But this seems to be a problem across most of the co-op games I play. \nI like to use the whirlwind dual swords...Blocking arrows/axes and spells is FUN I like that alot.

Especially at this price, this game is a steal!!! More promise than prom pussy! The developer is very responsive and I love being able to give input as it grows.. Absolutely worth the price tag! \n\nThe movement controls are extremely customizable! You can teleport, you can run around free. And much more fine tuning to find that zen zone for your brute bashing. Only note on that is whatever effects are in place for motion sickness are not helping me. If I would only use teleport I think it would be  better on the ms.\n\nVisually this game is pretty but simple. Nothing is fancy but given the early acess and amazing time and effort put into the weapon mechnics and way everything works together.. I cannot complain. I would rather thus type of game be functionally satisfying over visual pleasing. \n\nReally looking forward to playing online!

I can sprint around with one vive touchpad and use the other to turn either a set amount of continuously like a thumbstick (which does invoke a bit of motion sickness in me, but its well worth it for being able to fine tune the direction you're running in without having to turn your body if you're limited for space like me) but then i use the teleport as a form of quick dash to escape enemies closing in on me.\n\nEach weapon has a special ability which you charge up by doing damage, you can have 2 in your loadout. the dual crossbows is my favourite by far and the reloading feels amazingly satisfying. In fact the weapons in general are amazingly satisfying, an upward swing to the chin with a sword will send most unarmored enemies flying after a perfectly timed block. Alternatively, you could just stand in front of an enemy with your shield up and just wiggle your sword in their face for cheap shots.\n\nDid i mention enemies are armored? and its not just a visual thing, you need to swing at their fleshy parts if you want to use a sword. if youre a bow user and they have a helmet, then its really satisfying getting that headshot through the gap in their faceplates.\n\nThrowing weapons are a thing, you get an infinite amount with a cooldown like a special ability. my favourite are the 3 throwing knives positioned at the front of your waist as if tucked into a belt. you throw all 3 at once in a fan shape and it makes me feel like a rogue/assassin. I've also seen a magic bomb/potion type thing on another player but i havent unlocked it myself yet. It looks fun though.\n\nGraphically, i love the style of it, and supersampling keeps it really sharp and clean to look at at, even distant objects.\n\nThe levels are technically randomly selected rather than \"generated\". Each level has specific tilesets that are chosen at random and connected together differently each time you load a level, a bit like the levels in warframe for example.\n\nThe difficulty seems pretty balanced so far, Some levels harder than others because the difficulty is level based rather than a single setting you pick at the beginning of the game.\nEach difficulty make the enemies tougher and i think spawning more of them. This difficulty is then scaled further when you have more people playing together like in Diablo.\n\nThere are unique boss type enemies which, unlike normal grunts that only... grunt, the bosses will talk shit and be all intimidating which is amusing to hear at a distance when you're closing in on them and killing all their minions.\n\nI can't speak too much for multiplayer, the most expirience i've had with that was when i was playing solo and some guy joined me halfway through a level and stuck around for a few more. He had unlocked more weapons than me and was clearly more experienced, however it doesn't throw off game balance at all as theres no leveling system that im aware of. he may have had different weapons but in terms of damage output, he was equally as useful as i was, making the combat more skill based than just being overpowered and destroying everything. \n\nReviving dead teammates in multiplayer is a pretty tough thing. If you die mid-fight then you're probably dead for the rest of that encounter. You revive by holding your trigger over the teammates body and it fills up a meter. Which is pretty tough to do if you're being rushed by enemies. However, i have managed to do it when fighting against only archers. You just hide behind your shield blocking all arrows and revive them that way. \nSide note: the bar doesn't decay or lose progress at all if you stop reviving so the skilled player could probably run circles around the enemy, leading them away, then coming back to revive, then leading them away, then coming back to finish the revive. It doesn't take long at all to revive someone, but the enemy move surprisingly fast.\n\n\n\nThe only issue i've encountered so far, are the various Ballistas generated in the world. Sometimes they're in good positinos, other times not so much. Also, aiming them is a bitch to deal with if you're playing in a small standing area like me, even with thumbstick like movements available. I decided to just give up and run circles around the enemies firing my crossbows at them instead for the first \"defend the area\" type section.\n\n\n\nOverall it's a solid underrated dungeon crawler, most VR games i feel are too expensive, with barely enough content to make your money worthwhile (the whole \u00a31/$1 per hour of fun thing), But with this game being only \u00a310, in theory that's 10 hours of fun, but im certain im going to play this for many many more, especially for the amount of content in it, especially since they're still updating it and adding more.", "timestamp_created": 1500461042, "timestamp_updated": 1500461703, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566116", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33584139": {"recommendationid": "33584139", "author": {"steamid": "76561198398185956", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 617, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500219298}, "language": "english", "review": "Great stuff.

Full disclosure I have not made it all the way through the various worlds the game has to offer.\n\nAlso this game is in Early Access so all the issues I have could be fixed in due time.\n\n[b]UPDATE[/b]\nI had no intentions of revisiting this game any time soon, however the Developers of Trickster VR reached out to me and wanted me to again. I find this absolutely incredible and it made me really want to love this game. I feel with some work this game will be fantastic and a must own for all Vive owners.\n\n[h1]TL:DR[/h1]\n[b]After revisiting the game after multiple updates and request by the developers, I found the game greatly improved. Enough so that I do recommend Trickster VR. [/b]\n\n[h1]PROS[/h1]\n- [b]Incredible Developers![/b] Something that I can not over look is the passion that these developers have to make the best game possible. Something that I respect no matter the state of the game.\n\n- [b]It looks great![/b] Stylized and interesting the game the game looks great.\n\n- [b]There is a lot of content![/b] This game is not only replayable but has a lot of content to play through in the first place. Alongside the procedurally generated levels there are many choices of weapons as well as multiple enemy types that you have to deal with. Meaning that in theory you can play several times with different weapons and have a very different experience each time around. Not only that but with incredibly active developers there is much more to anticipate from this game.\n\n- [b]Multiplayer![/b] There's a freaking multiplayer! While it could use some work that statement alone is fantastic. Most games become instantly more fun when you can play with friends, the developers of Trickster VR know that and added it to their game. My main problem with the multiplayer as of right now, is that there isn't a whole lot of reason to work together. I think something as simple as enemies aggro on players with melee weapons out or balancing the dual crossbows would make the multiplayer experience tremendous.\n\n[h1] Cons [/h1]\n- [b]Combat.[/b] While it is certainly more satisfying than it was, it can still feel more like an arm flailing simulator than anything. My main issue is often that there is little reason to use most of the weapons. The dual crossbows specifically are often used in multiplayer as a primary way to remove enemies, with a bit of balancing I feel more variety would be much more ideal and fun.\n\nWith tons of enemies to fight at a time, combat feels a lot less personal. Something I dislike, though slaughtering hordes is often a favorite part of games for some people, so that's just me.\n\n- [b]Level design.[/b] The level design has indefinitely improved and with a large increase in enemies they definitely feel less empty. Though it seems like it was over done a tad, as on more than one occasion I find myself swarmed with enemies, with fireballs, arrows and axes flying at me I can't quite feel anything other than overwhelmed.\n\nAlso I feel like small details implemented in the level design would make the game much more charming. Like being able to pick up the spears that you'll find stuck in the ground or being able to destroy barrels and boxes to gain loot. As well as hidden rewards for exploring the randomly generated landscape, although without any use for gold or money this would be somewhat pointless. \n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nIt's not my cup of tea. Not yet atleast. I feel like Trickster VR is set up for greatness and can only improve at this point. There are certain parts of this game that are built into the core mechanics that aren't for me, but that doesn't mean it isn't fun. With a bit of work the game will be more than worth it's current price. \n\nThough the main reason I recommend this game is less the actual mechanics itself, but rather the incredibly passionate developers who actually asked me to try the game again after a couple updates which swayed me to rewrite my originally negative review.

Ich versuche in diesem Review dazulegen wieso Trickster dennoch sein Geld wert ist und warum es mich \u00fcberzeugt hat.\n\n\n\n[H1]Negativ[/H1]\n\n- Keine H\u00e4nde: Leider kann man nur zwischen Waffen wechseln aber nicht zwischen Waffe und Hand. Die Bedienung des Userinterface und einiger anderer Komponenten im Spiel wird dadurch erschwert.\n\n- Die Monster buggen im Kampf: Manchmal unterbrechen die Monster abrupt ihre Aktion und bleiben einfach stehen.\n\n- Eine wirklich nervige Sache ist, dass die Monster st\u00e4ndig in einen hinein laufen\n\n- Das Spiel wird sehr schnell sehr fordernd und das kann unter Umst\u00e4nden frustrierend werden (wenn die Level nicht geschafft werden oder einfach viel zu absurd gro\u00dfe Monstergruppen spawnen)\n\n- Low Quali Texturen: Auf den Screenshots und in den Videos schien gerade die grafische Komponente sehr beeindruckend zu sein aber beim genaueren hinsehen in VR wird dann gleich wieder klar dass die Objekte entweder aus gekauften Assets stammen oder die Objekte schlichtweg nicht f\u00fcr VR optimiert wurden. Die Welt sieht dank toller beleuchtung und passender Atmosp\u00e4hre dennoch super aus! Gerade bei den Monster-Texturen merkt man dann aber dass das wirklich h\u00e4tte besser gemacht werden k\u00f6nnen.\n\n- Gl\u00e4ser, F\u00e4sser, Truhen etc. k\u00f6nnen nicht zerst\u00f6rt werden: Leider gibt es in dem Spiel keine einzige bemerkenswerte Physik\n\n- Der Kampf im einzelenen ist wirklich mangelhaft umgesetzt: Trickster macht das aber nichts aus, denn der Kampf ist nicht f\u00fcr 1on1 ausgelegt sondern eher 10 gegen 1. Es ist sehr viel mehr ein Schnetzeln durch viele Monster als ein defensiver Kampf (wie bei Vanishing Realms). Das ganze ist Ansichtssache. Mir gef\u00e4llt beides aber im Einzelkampf (zumindestens gegen normale Monster) hat Trickster hier leider etwas geschlampt.\n\n- Mal wieder keine Steam Erfolge: Ich finde es wirklich schade das Indie VR Entwickler sich nicht die Zeit nehmen um ihrem Spiel Errungenschaften hinzuzuf\u00fcgen. So k\u00f6nnen wir Steam Spieler unsere Accounts nicht aufleveln oder Steam-Erfolge jagen. Beide Seiten w\u00fcrden profitieren wenn das ge\u00e4ndert wird.\n\n\n\n[H1]Positiv[/H1]\n\nTrickster bringt zwar einige negaive Aspekte mit sich aber die positiven Eigenschaften \u00fcberragen mit einem riesiegen Vorsprung:\n\n- Eine lebendige Atmosp\u00e4hre: Sch\u00f6ne Musik mit passenden Soundeffekten, Tiere und eine sich stets ver\u00e4nderernde Welt.\n\n- Spannende Bossk\u00e4mpfe die man mit Strategie oder starker Offensive gewinnen kann.\n\n- Herausforderung: Du wirst im Spiel sterben, garantiert!\n\n- Mehrere Spielweisen: Man kann eine Quest Reihe durchspielen oder sich im Waveshooter beweisen\n\n- Questbelohnung\n\n- Verschiedene Arten sich fortzubewegen (Teleport und diverste Variante vom Touchpad-Walking)\n\n- Viele tolle Waffen mit jeweils einer eigenen Spezialf\u00e4higkeit (10/10 daf\u00fcr!)\n\n- Genug Content f\u00fcr viele Stunden\n\n- Aktive Entwicklungsarbeit (Bugs und Content (auch Multiplayer in arbeit))\n\n- Einen sehr hohen Wiederspielwert!\n\n\n\n\n[H1]Fazit[/H1]\n\nIm allgemeinen kann man VR Spiele wohl recht einfach bewerten: W\u00fcrde ich das Spiel, nachdem ich es zum allererten mal gespielt habe, am n\u00e4chsten Tag wieder starten? JA!

They fixed my major complaints with movement. I didn't get stuck on geometry or teleport weirdly this time. Movement relative to facing direction is a huge improvement. There is now a teleportation icon, though it is a little awkward to do a stick click to use it. Now I can move around comfortably.\n\nAs for gameplay, still a little shallow, but if you were just looking for an archery simulator with a little bit of movement, this is great. Though honestly, given how simple it is, a 12 dollar price tag is a little high. The approach of this game is more on the side is allot of playable content instead of a little exceptional content. \n\nNow the gameplay is still a little shallow, especially the sword play, but fixing that would be extremely difficult, as in the only obvious way to do it requires better hardware. As in, an omni directonal treadmill, a real sword and walls for resistance.\n\n\n\nFor reference, the original review below.\n\nIts poor navigation mechanics stifle what might otherwise be an enjoyable game.\n\nFirst, I like that you tried to use the vignette feature, but you don't seem to understand why you use the vignette feature. Yes, for one it is to get rid of your peripheral vision, but that is not the MAIN point. the main point is to prevent you from seeing things moving past too quickly. Look at eagle flight. That always darkens when your turning, which is good since turning is uncomfortable. But it also darkens when you're next to something. So if some one walks sideways, you should actually shift the part you can see toward the direction your moving. That is, you should darken forward too.\n\nAlso, maybe provide some smoother vignettes, so they are less noticable. In fact, if you could make it adapt to how close the scene is, that would be even better.\n\nNext, you don't seem to understand why we use teleport mechanics. The teleport should be a teleport, not a quick acceleration forward, then a quick acceleration to a stop. Thats actually more uncomfortable then smooth movement. Look at how robo-recall and farlands handle teleportation. That is how it should feel. Also, teleporting based on which direction our hands are facing is disorienting without an icon to indicate where we will teleport.\n\nTwin stick movement, where to begin. First, its buggy. With oculus touch, try walking forward then touching your face. If its like my experience, you will suddenly rush backward. Similarly, if you pount your right hand at your left while walking you rush back and left. This movement is fast enough it warps me under stairs. Not being able to walk while your shield is up seems weird as well.\n\nI don't know how that code is working, but it should be independant of hand motion. Walking should depend only on gaze direction, so this bug is baffling to me.\n\nYour twin stick movement also has a tendency to get stuck on rocks, so I have to physically walk to keep moving. If I never turn, this happens less, but obviously I want to turn. Your walking also is not as smooth as I would like. I would advise trying out windlands. Windlands has a fantastic walking mechanics. Take a lesson from them.\n\nLook, I like your premise, but the game is really hard to play without a comfortable movement mechanic.", "timestamp_created": 1490481974, "timestamp_updated": 1502420172, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497571", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1490652830, "developer_response": "Hello Jac - thank you for taking the time to write your feedback.\n\nOf course there is a Blink Teleport in the game - I don't forget about the weaker VR stomachs - I was one for long time.

You'll likely find a movement style that suits you. Second is the choice of weapons, as you progress through the game you'll work up to a pretty sizeable selection of weapons. Again, quite likely you'll find a comfortable choice of the lot. And while it's probably not encouraged, you could get through any situation with one loadout the whole time.

enemies Imore below)\n\nSuggestions for the dev:\nMelee combat - I want to be able to block with my sword, and have the enemies react accordingly. \nBoss battles - (not the blue guys, but the commanders), have less enemies and enhance the boss's melee abilities, such that you can react and have to skillfully beat him.", "timestamp_created": 1489867756, "timestamp_updated": 1489867792,

1505516023}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is wonderful, I'll start by saying that\nIts exactly what you'd hope for in a VR fantasy game, and it's still in early access, \nthe devs are doing a great job and I really have only praise for this game but I'll try and be as critical as I can to give a balanced view for those questioning wether to buy\n\nSo I'm using a HTC VIVE, not sure how it is on the rift but I'd assume much the same\n\nPros:\nIntuitive controls, the combat really feels natural and immersive, the enemys react great to different motions of the sword or where you hit them with an arrow\n\nThe vibrations of the vive motion controllers when you use a bow or your sheild is struck really make you feel immersed in the combat\n\nGreat sound design, doesnt feel repetative or out of place, each aroow loose and sword swung feels and sounds genuinely good\n\nGood dialog, really reminded me of the early WoW games with the orc workers, good balance of humour in there, as with most things the only thing I would ask for is more of the same\n\nMusic is on point, the right level of epicness, with the soundtrack changing for combat etc\n\nI really like the visual stye of the game, often when developers set out to make VR games they lean too heavily towards realism, but the playful style of the aesthetics makes this game feel fun and interconnected, theres nothing nearly real about it which often pulls me out of the immersion in other games\n\nThe progression is challenging, each new unlocked level has increased difficulty that provides thoughtful gameplay\n\nThe unlockables allow you to customise how you play, with different weapons or belt attachments, you can taylor your fighting style, I personally recommend the crossbow guns, they kick ass\n\nThe enemies each provide different challanges, how you approach and fight depends on what youre fighting and how many of them there are, archers arent tricky unless in large groups, sorcerer orcs provide sheilds for others etc\n\nThe movement feels natural, you can adjust position by walking or teleporting, neither of which gave me motion sickness thanks to the comfort settings vignette that clouds the screen as you move, the movement is easy to get to grips with and allows for movement while in combat which is awesome\n\nCons\n\nCan become slightly repetative, the quests soon crop up multiple times, you get used to them, but each level is laid out differently and the fun is in the combat more then the specific quests, and it is early access so you cant expect too much at this point\n\nThe ballistas are hard to use, i found it difficult to angle them and see where I'm firing, plus the way you control, fire and reload can be a bit hit and miss, not great in high pressure situations, I tend to avoid using them at all now, perhaps a solution would be to have the player sat on the ballista, and they simply turn on the spot to rotate the ballista?\n\nTheres an occasional issue on the wave mode where the final orc doesnt come out, so you have to wait a little while, not a big deal just thought I'd mention it \n\nThings I think would be cool:\n\nI have by no means unlocked all this game has to offer so theres a chance some or all of these things are in there somewhere but I thought I'd pop them down anyway\n\nThrowables, potions etc that have different effects on the orcs such as freezing or fleeing, maybe having them turn to your side temporarily?\n\nPotions for yourself with differing effects, potions that make you giant or slow time, maybe just one that sets you on fire so as to harm orcs that attack you\n\nI love the special power of the ranged weapons and how it differs between each one, maybe something like that for the sword and shield would be cool, unless thats considered overkill\n\nOptions to customise the floating isle base that serves as the menu and where your gear up, nothing drastic just a few options to make it your own would be cool\n\nMore environmental weapons to interact with, boulders to knock over or mounted weaponry to use, the ballistas are a cool concept but more stuff to play with would be awesome\n-\n\nOverall this is a great game worth your money, I think it has a lot of replay value which is something lacking in a lot of VR games at the minute, if you're on the fence I really do recommend that you get it, it's a lot of fun, perhaps my favourite VR game out at the minute\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1489333838, "timestamp_updated": 1489333838, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0,

Audio is decent for music albeit a bit choppy with some of the sound effects for some reason. The AI is buggy and will occasionally either get stuck trying to get to you or mysteriously de-spawn during waves. Missile weapons like the bow and crossbow function about as they should although certain things like quaffing a potion and the shield are a little awkward and somewhat unnecessary if you opt to dodge and retreat instead (your health regenerates outside of combat). Also the energy crystal objectives are a huge pain in the ass due to the fact that the crystals have a fast moving hitscan attack that targets you the moment you\u2019re in range. \n\nOverall, the experience is par for VR gaming and worth trying for a few hours albeit it does get really repetitive after a few missions.

Completely emersive and unique VR setting, incredible combat mechanics and a great deal of all round fun. The game currently in early access, symultaneously infuses the player with the sense that they are a one person orc killing machine and also provides a robust challenge on some of the later levels.  \n\nThe weapon mechanics are intuitive and offer a range of tactical approaches. The orcs themselves have a range of different skill sets that one has to adjust to, and one has to constantly work with the procedurally generated environments on the fly to gain the tactical advantage. I have found myself sprinting for higher ground to spring an ambush on some approaching orcs, 'hiding' in some tall grass near the bottom of some stairs and picking off orcs or throwing myself into battle with axe swinging wildly. All of it sweaty, triumphant unbelievable fun.\n\nIt ticks a couple of boxes as a VR game. There is a compelling adventure element, where the emersion in VR gives a profound sense of presence on the surreal floating landscapes. The ranged combat is slick and easy to learn, slightly more challenging to master, and up close melee is satisfyingly chaotic and exhillerating. The game's RPG elements are growing and I look forward to future developments.\n\nA couple of humble suggestions: It would be next level awesomeness to possibly have items or clothes that adjust movement tactics: shoes that allow a character to dash larger distances into the thick of battle to do wreak havok and then escape (alla Sairento's leap). Clothes that limit movement a little more but give extra protection or offer up extra powers and features. Would be amazing to tweak your character into a DPS assassin, rumbling tank or powered up mage. Upgrade to the current weapons (via gems or shards) would potentially give further control to the player to tweak and personalize their build and their tactics. Would also help alot with replayability. And of course more variety of bad guys.

Another repetitive gameplay? Where are the map exploring survival/open world/crafting/action/adventure fallout 4/skyrim based gameplay I have come to know and love? I mean procedural dungeon crawler? If I gave a nickel everytime I heard that, I'd probably be pist poor enough to be unable to buy this game but as it turns out....\n\nWell as a Rifter since release, owning quite a few VR games already from both Oculus and Steam (List Below), I can safely say this is the closest I've felt in true action FPS RPG compared to any other game on the market for Rift, including Raw Data, which comes in second. Where Raw Data fails, Trickster thrives with its namesake, 'Procedural generated maps' with procedural generated quests. Where Raw Data is static map with incoming waves,Trickster has adventure and waves.\n\nThe only thing that of course will be its downfall is again its name...procedural generated relies completely on its base foundation...if the seed does not give enough complex variables, most often you will feel repetition (ie. No Man's Sky), however considering the many VR games out there (Vanishing Realms excluded for Rift), it still one up's my 2nd best VR game, Raw Data because the variables still expand more from the original game play thus giving me more to feel and embrace from your typical VR gaming experience\n\nThe weapon switching gives a small but arguably more progressive approach toward Action Adventure where inventory slots are concerned thus at least achieving the feel of items with light/latern in dark maps. You will have not two but three weapons at your disposal, executing all three weapons whilst moving? Priceless, indeed you will definitely feel like a badass but in this mode you will start to realise the God-like potential of what is to come...Triple A Fantasy Action Adventure FPS RPG. You will notice it when you start to flow with your items, how you skillfully weave weapon switches from bow to arrow killing with both strikes...we havent even involve magics yet...\n\nThe motion sickness problem is solved for the RPG genre thanks to trickster, indeed, it played a trick with our mind and vision with ingenius smooth turning and twin sticks with a slap of teleport, they might have set the stage for all the VR RPG of the future.

Since then it has undergone massive massive overhaul, which shows the game is in active development. There are some good things about this game, and many bad. However, I have high hopes and will check back some time in the future, as I am sure the issues will be addressed.\n\nIn my opinion, this game is more of an action game than a dungeon crawler, due to the frequency of enemies and lack or real exploring. This may or may not be your thing, so I suggest trying the game for an hour and refunding if you don't like it. \n\npros: \n- there is a variety of weapons which all function very differently from one another. It encourages varied combat and allows for more tools to defeat the different types of enemies that have weaknesses to certain types and directions of attack.\n\n-there are a lot of options for VR comfort, so it is possible to minimize nausea. \n\n-The game runs well on my computer, which  has a GTX 1080. You would think this wouldn't need to be said, but some VR games stutter and lag and frame drop regardless of your hardware. \n\n-exploration is encouraged via the changing objectives and waypoints\n\n-the art style is consistent and feels like a fantasy world\n\n-the music is enjoyable.\n\ncons:\n-the music is out of place contextually. It will be playing super epic music when I am just backtracking and nothing is happening. It makes it feel silly sometimes.\n\n-there are too few terrain pieces which the game chooses from. I found myself becoming lost because I couldn't tell whether this identical gate->grassy area->large curved cliff was one of the 4 others exactly like it or a new one. \n\n-There are too few poses for the enemies. They will teleport if they run over a ledge or drop down from their airship. They will go from standing in front of you to having hit you with what seems like jerky and unnatural body movements\n\n-Enemies will literally go inside you and just cheese you to death. This was a problem in the original release as well. It was the primary reason I didn't have fun in the combat. That being said, the trolls are far less agressive, and will only sometimes go inside you. The AI of the enemy is fairly broken, since they will just charge at you one by one, often with pathfinding glitches, and BS shots that shouldn't be possible. \n\n-The collision detection with  weapons and shields seems very inconsistent, with trolls blocking hits they shouldn't, and landing blows they shouldn't.\n\n-The combat feels weak and unresponsive. Due to the aforementioned hit detection issues, the combat feels like you are swinging a butter knife in front of you with enemies sometimes dying and sometimes not. \n\n-The multi shot crossbow is far too  inconsistent. It feels like it only shoots straight half the time. That being said it is still super fun to shoot with against several orcs/trolls coming at you. Sometimes the reload twists won't register.\n\n-The world hub is confusing. I don't know what the color scheme of the boxes is supposed to mean.\n\n-Quests lack meaning and feel arbitrary. Mainly due to the fact that the environments feel so similar to one another, the one-quest-per-world makes exploring the world unrewarding. I only did two quests, so this could change in later quests. \n\n-The constant epic music and stream of enemies makes there be no contrast. It gets tiring and makes something that should be exciting become boring. \n\n-In the two missions I did, there was no variety in game mechanics. The missions functioned identically to one another. Go there, kill stuff, go home. \n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\n\nThere are some great aspects, like the variety of weapons and the promise of finding new equipment, and then there are some bad aspects, like the terrible sword combat.

Anything I say from now to the end of this mini review should be taken with a pinch of salt because none of it is damning, especially for a game which hasn't made it out of Early Access as yet. This game is a lot of fun, has good drum beat music that switches you into battle mode and what sound design there is impresses (I would have liked it if beating the shield madesome kind of sound but hey ho).\n\nOrc AI could do with some work. Sometimes the orcs come to fight you, sometimes they just derp and stand stock-still for an easy kill. There have been occasions where an orc ran away from me only to then confront me again and I can't work out if that's him being all fearful like and trying to save his own skin (because he saw how many of his brethren I had slaughtered) or if it was AI not knowing what it should do. Orcs do get stuck in geometry and in falling states if they come in via balloon and happen to drop down onto the wrong spot. This one time I watched in awe as an orc landed on a bridge only to charge forward (and down) into the void below, so it's safe to say their pathfinding ability is like their IQs, on the low side.\n\nEvery now and then I'll teleport too close to orcs then I'll find that I can't hit them, which is fair enough.I imagine that by playing in walk mode you can avoid getting too close to orcs altogether. I've had situations where I teleported a short distance away from orcs and all the ones I could see a moment ago had apparently despawned (and none of them had been killed).\n\nTeleporting behind myself and wherever else I could escape to has gotten me out of harm's way many times but I think there have been just as many times where I was hit in the crossfire \nand took unavoidable damage. What I'll have to try and do is teleport more intelligently by\nducking before teleporting or otherwise taking cover behind rocks and trees and architecture\nwhile also laying down covering fire.\n\nWhen it comes down to it though, this is also a numbers game. \nIf there are too many orcs in an area, they will probably overwhelm you because 5 archers \nfiring on you in an area just teleported to is something only Neo could counter.\nI might git gud but at the moment it's fun to kill in inventive ways. \nBlind use of the ballista immediately springs to mind as one of the more satisfying ways \nyou can slay an orc in Trickster although the only limit on how fast you can kill orcs\nis the speed you nock an arrow at and the haste with whichyou throw knives from your waist.\n\nThe weaponry is a good selection that makes it so that you're never totally between a rock and a hard place. If all else fails, then a quick flick of the throwing knives at your belt will usually mess them up. I'm still getting used to the first badass weapon pair that you unlock. Nailing the berserker orcs with a ranged weapon special attack is always a highlight.\nEnemy ragdolling is pretty funny when it happens and the enemy variety is about what I would expect for the levels I've gone through (only the first few btw). You can see an orc in one of the trailers have his head shot through a pillar, which isn't a bad thing per se but it could detract from your immersion, I don't know. I've scored headshots I shouldn't have been able to in this way. When my Dad played, he accidentally kept switching weapons and made it look as though he beat an orc to death with a bow+arrow rather than sword+board which was kinda funny.\n\nThat's my two penn'orth and I actually put my money where my mouth is so hopefully you come to some sort of conclusion what to do with your dinero based on what I said here or a video review or something and decide to help these devs out with your hardearned cash.", "timestamp_created": 1485114701, "timestamp_updated": 1485115147, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29422425": {"recommendationid": "29422425", "author": {"steamid": "76561198175632650", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 456, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487192953}, "language": "english", "review": "For the money its extremely good fun!

Even in it's early access stages, it's the first VR title I've purchased that feels like a fully fleshed out game instead of just a tech demo or \"a look into what VR is capable of\" and the devs are actively working to improve the game with hotfixes and content updates.\n\nThe meat of the game is the adventure mode in which you traverse through procedurally generated dungeons to complete objectives while fighting through a horde of angry orcs. There's a good variety to the enemies in the game, each with their own strengths, and as you progress through the campaign you unlock new weapons to kill them with.\n\nThe other game mode is a wave defense where you protect your portal from an onslaught of orcs and shoot for the high score.\n\nWhere I think the game excels above other titles though is how it controls. They have several movement options:\n[list]\n[*]Teleport - Hold the button, point where you want to go and appear there.\n[*]Point and Move - Press up on the right hand track pad to move where the controller is pointing.\n[*]Single Stick - Use the right trackpad to move forward and back based on where you're looking.\n[*]Dual Stick - Use the left trackpad to move forward/back, strafe left/right and the right trackpad to turn left and right.\n[/list]\nThe dual stick is my personal favorite and feels the most immersive, allowing me to move freely while fighting. I feel more titles should adopt this system as I find the current standard of teleporting in most titles disorienting. The combat controls are also well done. Drawing the bow feels great and wading into orcs with my sword and shield is incredibly satisfying.\n\nAll that said, while the player controls are tight, the enemy AI could use a little bit of work. I've found on a few occasions that I can confuse the AI into a walking loop by dropping off a short ledge, allowing me to pick them off without much difficulty. Another problem I've encountered is that when walking around some of the more cluttered areas, I will clip on objects and end up getting stuck for a few moments while I navigate my way out of a pillar or a barrel.\n\nAll in all though I've had a fantastic time playing so far and look forward to what new content the devs are gonna add to the game.

I am almost completly immune to motion sickness and as such I can't really tell how good/bad it is but I think it is way better than other games at the moment.\n\nThe enemy response is almost as good as in non-VR games and it really feels like you stab and slash your enemies. If you hit them from below with an upward-move you can send them flying, stabbing them in the head kills them instantly (with some exceptions, the Balrog wouldn't go down after one blow either). There are some quirks every now and then but I never encountered anything game breaking. Sometimes an enemy gets stuck inside a rock, but hey, that's where those pesky orcs belong! \n\nThe weapon arsenal is fun to explore and try out.

I've not played for long but fully intend to continue!\n\nThe archery is almost exactly as I'd want. It may be exactly what I want, but learning to adjust between how archery is done between different games is a big part of VR right now. There were some invisible walls/sections which arrows wouldn't go through on some levels, but otherwise fine.\n\nSword and shield, it works alright. To be honest I don't know enough to know how it could best be improved. The shield does block effectively, but it's way too easy to just waggle your sword in front of you and pick every enemy very fast.\n\nThrowing knives, the only thing I think needs real improvement (other than my aim) is the ease at which you can grab them to throw. I found it wasn't worth trying to reach down to my waist for them (even before my poor aim).\n\nThere's a good selection of enemies. Archers, mages, some with battleaxes, swords/shields, some cast magic shields around other enemies making them invulnerable. The AI could do with a little improvement. They do sometimes get stuck or think they can see you to hit you when they're ever so slightly just around the corner meaning they only hit the wall/pillar.\n\nMap generation is very cool. I really hope the developer intends to do some missions in actual dungeons. The dark, claustrophobic environment would be very intense! But some of the darker levels, despite their place on floating islands, do offer a similar experience.\n\nThere's only a couple of notable issues I've come across so far:\n1. Weapon selection in the starting area sometimes goes a bit mad. When selecting a newly unlocked bow, it selected it on top of my existing bow. I was holding two bows, neither of which I could fire, and I could no longer move around unless I was holding the weapon select button. I solved by restarting the game and reselecting the new bow.\n2. The blink effect while teleporting is a bit too extreme for me. The field of view while moving is made way too small, and by not having anything visible in the peripheral, it was just as, if not more disorientating than turning it off. Perhaps look at Google Earth VR. It may not suit Trickster VR perfectly, but having an indication of where the floor is when teleporting, and perhaps being able to adjust the field of view while blinking would make it that bit better.\n\nTLDR; buy it.", "timestamp_created": 1483477521, "timestamp_updated": 1483477521, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500250", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28986422": {"recommendationid": "28986422", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116238889", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483374475}, "language": "english", "review": "Jou\u00e9 9 minute me plaie pas", "timestamp_created": 1483474215, "timestamp_updated": 1483474215, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28961509": {"recommendationid": "28961509", "author": {"steamid": "76561198355988694", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 274, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483475723}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a showcase of what fantasy vr game can be.

This game is not without it's issues but switching to the experimental branch has helped somewhat (really should be the other way around though).

The range combat is generally far more enjoyable and solid than the melee though. At first I would switch to melee weapons whenever the orcs closed but honestly it's easier and more enjoyable to stick with range weapons and just shoot things point blank. Which makes it a bit of a shame that there are a variety of melee weapons to unlock, more variety in bows with different special attacks would be more appropriate for this games strengths.\nI found myself sticking with the second proper bow to unluck and occasionally messing around with the duel crossbows.

After a series of rapid respawns, the game will either dump you back in the hub world with the level completed, dump you back in the hub world without the level completed, or dump you back in the level with glitchy weapons. All three have happened regardless of whether I've died or completed the level.\n\nMelee weapons also need far more oomph. It feels like I'm swinging at air. I have no idea if my swings are doing damage. Adding significantly more enemy knockback would fix this.\n\nAlso, using the grip for weapon switching causes accidental weapon switching when swinging a weapon.\n\nThis game does a lot of things right, good graphics, procedural levels, great bow controls, hand based movement instead of head based movement, and properly using the playspace for dodging and cover.

The reload mechanic is simple enough; simply rotate/flick the controllers to the sides. You can do this as you're using touchpad walk, and can even shoot while using touchpad walk. This grants players the option to stay mobile and to conitnue having some form of offense while respositioning. \n\nThere are either six or 7 enemy models currently.

Trickster VR is definitely one of the top 5-games for HTC Vive so far! Here is my first 40 minutes of gameplay in MIXED REALITY VR view, and first impressions:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--CiclmVUNE\n\nSo, why is Trickster VR so good? Well, first of all, the graphics! Its just... beautiful! \n\nI can\u00b4t find words for it, but I gotta say that the level of environmental detail, the colorful sceneries, the well-made Orcs and creatures just looks lovely and really adds something special to the overall mood in this game, and to the immersion and feeling in VR. \n\nIts kind of a cartoonish style of graphics, but at the same time so realistic! You really feel yourself present in this fantasy world, and you kind of get on the right mood after a few seconds. Its impossible to describe in words, this game must be experienced for real in VR to understand my point here!\n\nThe in-game combat is great, especially with the sword and shield, but the bow works and feels perfect - actually much better than in Longbow in The Lab. \n\nSoundtrack and sound effects are amazing, the music soundtrack gives you a Bravehart-feeling, and it fits perfect into this game. The orcs sounds like orcs, and you gotta love the sound of the sword hitting your opponents.\n\nAnd then the locomotion system - YES, it has support for touchpad-walking, so you can walk around freely during exploration and combat. Even when playing the wave-game mode, you still can move freely around - thats something I miss in most other games!The adventure mode is awesome, but the wave-game mode is very entertaining as well.\n\nAnother thing is that the developers are constantly working to improve and update this game - so you get so much content for free once you buy this. And also, the price, well this game could have costed 20 or 30 bucks and still be worth it. For around 10 bucks this is really a MUST-HAVE game in your VR library. I promise you guys, you wont regret it!\n\n...and did I mention the graphics, btw? :) \n\nWow, I can really recommend Trickster VR for you all, as its both a great game and also a beautiful VR experience. Definitely one of the best show-off VR games available as well, that you can show to your friends while introducing them to Virtual Reality. \n\nPS: Big thanks to the developers for adding VR Mixed Reality support to this game!\n\nJust get it, enjoy it, and you will love it!\nCheers\nSweViver", "timestamp_created": 1480771369, "timestamp_updated": 1480771369, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.445031", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28114335": {"recommendationid": "28114335", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970488092", "num_games_owned": 437, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 237, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502434577}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 stars considering it is EA and not feature-complete.\n\nThis game is amazing.

Its a great mix between realistic and arcade. Coming from vanishing realms, where you have one or two enemies charging at you at a time, it feels much more chaotic, but in a good way. You can play defensively by taking your shots and blocking / parrying every attack, but I found it more fun just to dive head first into the enemies and slash and hack with my sword and shield like a mad man. It can get pretty difficult though, when each of the orcs throws their magic gimmic at you and you have to figure out what exactly is eating away your health and how to avoid it. Not exactly Dark Souls, but not a walk in the park either.\n\nThe graphics are simple, but well done. The bright colors and color palette realy matches the mood of the game. Sound is just what is should be, with some epic music tracks thrown in the mix. \n\nThe strongly advertised procedural levels actually work pretty good. You start to see some repeating tiles after a few hrs, but every level is very different from another and with 3 or 4 weather settings (green, snow, desert + day/night cycle) you never know what's around the corner. High replayability value here.\n\nAnd, you also get the typical wave attack game mode with this one as well if you're into those. I like the procedural levels more, but its still pretty well done. More interesting and dynamic with all the islands flying in/out than most similar titles ive played. \n\nGet it.

Game now costs its money and it is good for one who like dungeon crawler type of games. It is brainless slasher and that's all. But it's still boring and misses something important for me, but I can not say what... >.<\n\n1. COMBAT SYSTEM\n\nNow Combat system is responsive and has some haptic feedback. And it is good! \n\nYou can parry arrows with a sword, but I couldn't block another sword hit from orc with my sword. I tried several times, but could not. Was it a bad luck or just feature of the game - I don't know.\n\nCombat system is still have an issue for a good combat feeling. I will describe it in the next paragraph.\n\n2. AI\n\nOk, AI is still stupid as hell. They run towards you, when they in the distance to hit you, they will try to do so. They do not try to run around you to shoot you in the back, they do not move in front of you to land a flank hit. No! Just run towards you, stack in front of you, try to kill you, ???, PROFIT! \n\nThe MAIN PROBLEM in AI and combat system is that when the orc is too close to you, you can not block its hits. You have to move a little bit backward and then you can block some hits again, but orc will come close in some time and you can not block again...\n\nThe second problem is that AI can spawn behind your back where you were before, right in front of you in the air. And so on... Not a good thing. It's stange that you moved 10 meters from the spawn portal, kill all orcs in front of you, move 5 more meters and some orcs are already running from behind from spawn portal direction.\n\n3. GENERATED LEVELS\n\nNow I don't get any collisions. But levels are all the same. They are different because they were generated but in the same time they are all the same because they are generated from the small amount of templates. \n\n4. DEVELOPERS\n\nThat's the main reason why I recommend this game. I appreciate the fact that developers of this game try to do their best, they communicate with the comunity to make the game better, they support and keep updating their game. That's wonderful! Respect, TricksterDevs!\n\n--------------------------\nREVIEW (nov 2016):\n--------------------------\nWell, this game is impossible to play if you have played Vanishing Realms before.\n\n- Poor combat system. I couldn't understand when I landed an attack and when not, when I was hit and was not...\n- Stupid AI. They just run towards you and attack you with one template. That's all.\n- Buggy level generation system. I had to go through a wall to cointinue progress on level.\nAnd so on...\n\nP.S. English isn't my native language.

I do have one piece of feedback though. Of the two bow options. I would hands down choose the piercer but as it fires differently to normal arrows, it's impossible to aim.

You start in your hub / home fortress and use the portal to venture on missions in different zones. The combat is pretty arcadey with all the spells and hit effects flying around, but has a very satysfying feel. The procedural levels really add to replayability. A great break from the wave shooters out there.\n\nThe Gameplay.\nThe game takes place on procedural levels, where you punch your way through groups of enemies to reach your goal. There are four quests types available, with very different mechanics and skills needed to complete them. And whats most important - they are actually fun! Running from a flying crystal shooting death rays, ending a crow infestation or taking on an orc general - feels great. That gives great hope for the future content, but at the moment is a little repetitive after your first 10 or so levels. Looking forward for future updates.\n\nThe Visuals\nThe game is not realistic, by any means, but it has a very consistent, kinda toon art style. It fits well with the setting of the game. The floating islands are great to look at and you'll definitely find some epic vistas. Some FX look a little too flat up close and could be improved, but its not going to bother you in the middle of the combat.\n\nThe Enemies.\nSimply put - well designed and fun to fight. The orcs vary vastly in terms of what they can do, while their designs make it easy make out squishies in the group. Some will shield others with their magic, some will perform some crazy jump attacks at you and there is that one that creates floating, life-sucking area denial orbs that you'll learn to avoid really quickly. While the animations in general look very fluid, the lack of ragdoll whatsover leaves bodies stuck in terrain if they died on a steep slope. Also, I want to be able to stab a dead orc. I need it in my life.\n\nThe development.\nThe developer is definitely a strong point here. Engaged with the community, sounds like a guy with a vision and pushes the updates consistently. Carry on like this and the game may just become one of the best fantasy games on vive.\n\nWorth it? Ow yeah!\nOverall, its a really fun title, well worth the 10$.

You have to protect your portal. You have a bow (good) and [secondary throwing knives (good) and/or a sword (meh not so good)] to start off using. The bow has a powerup feature that will let you shoot multiple arrows every so often (activate with trackpad then shoot). You can hit multiple targets with the triple shot arrow and the 3 throwing knives. Close combat is deadly. The mobs increase in number as you reach each wave and harder mobs come also that have different attacks to damage you. There are some champion type mobs that come that take many hits to kill and if they get close they do lots of damage to you and your portal. Over all a decent wave shooter if you like the bow and knives. The dev will be adding a different mode that has objectives and we will be able to move from island to island. I am waiting for that. Wave shooters are not really my thing anymore and maybe never were. Overall, I found using all the weapons fairly easy and do recommend this game.

Maybe they're just bad against hunter / bow orcs? using the shotgun-like ability is fun though.

And i haven't been able to actually use the settings mode to change to right handed as it's unresponsive to my laser. (I'm ambidextrous, But prefer to use my left hand for stuff like bows, and having to hold the bow in an awkward position to aim with anything resembling accuracy isn't comfortable after awhile.) \n\nUltimately this is a pretty good game, Can't wait to see what the future has in store. \n(also i'd recommened the player take damage if the try to go through / slash the healing orcs shield. As it's pretty weird to be able to switch to sword and board and just roflstomp your way through a bubble shielded orc completely ignoring mr glowy blue shield orcs purpose in life)\n\n[h1]old review below for fun history purposes. Some points still valid but take with your favorite brand of table salt[/h1] \n\n+Different orcs require different strategies to fight (flank shield orcs, Dodge mage orcs magic etc)\n+Bow triple shot powerup feels really satisfying to land on 3 powerful orcs\n+Can swap glowy sword for throwing knives and vice versa mid game\n+You can teleport through orcs with your sword pointed at them to dash stab the orcs. \n+Wave shooter where you can teleport anywhere on your floating island\n+Melee combat\n+Glowy Sword that you can throw at the enemy\n+Price\n\n-You can't teleport on the orcs floating islands\n-\"Being a showoff\" isn't that badass yet. The game counts your headshots in a row though. \n-Teleporting can be very disorienting and nausiaiting at first. Took me about 10-15 minutes to get used to it. \n-Melee combat is just hitboxes right now. Physics or being able to dodge orc melee attacks would be sweet (You can \"dodge\" by teleporting away from the orcs. But not what i mean.)\n-You can't abandon the bow and wield throwing knives and sword. It's either bow + knives Or bow + sword\n\nI like this game a lot, Has a lot of potential. More weapons would be great to keep the game fresh. And maybe some more orcs too. \n\nAlso, Fun thing i like to do is put the bow controller out of my play area and do a sword only run. Really hard and it makes you feel like a knight ^-^", "timestamp_created": 1472172856, "timestamp_updated": 1482056711, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25152562": {"recommendationid": "25152562", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983689849", "num_games_owned": 367, "num_reviews": 102, "playtime_forever": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483447476}, "language": "english", "review": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS60uvO5oS4\n\nA pretty fun little archery wave defense title. Never ending waves of baddies really hate your portal and want to kill is protective floating rocks. You really like putting arrows in their faces. \n\nWhile I did enjoy the title, I'm not sure the 9.99 price tag is appropriate. The demo video is a little misleading with the sword combat as the 'sword' is more a throwing dagger than a melee weapon. \n\nReally the game consists of 4/5 randomly appearing spawn islands floating up to your island and waves of orcs descend on your portal. The action gets fast and really fun but there's not a lot of depth to the game at the moment.\n\nMy final judgement is that if you're a big fan of these games, go ahead and pick it up, you'll probably enjoy yourself.

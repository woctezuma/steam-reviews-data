To me, the best part of TD games is the planning. Planning where to place your towers and how to optimize their interactions. In this game you're in too much of a hurry to do everything.\n\nThe gameplay itself isn't even anything particularly in-depth. You place and upgrade points and help by manually shooting enemies.

By that, I mean that most tower defense games have the fast-attacking tower, the slow-firing AoE tower, the speed-decreasing tower, etc., and the towers are very one-note and samey to all other tower defense games' towers.. In Immortal Defense, however, the towers attack in different literal patterns, sometimes apply different status effects, and all seem to have some use, depending on the map layout.\n\nIn my original review, I mentioned that there were a limited number of each type of tower you can place per level, and that you sometimes get more of the same tower, but there was no way to know if you would get them at all. The developer has been attentive and responded, informing me that most of the towers, upon getting a bunch of kills, will spawn new towers of the same type(s) getting bunches of kills, which you can then place. Also, this information is technically available in and in-game tutorial/information section, but that section was something like 15-19 pages long, somewhat buried and not pointed out as well as it should be. \n\nI think it should have at least been mentioned in one of the early levels quite clearly, since this can be a [i]crucial[/i] strategy for certain players, depending on play-style. I turned many losses and poor victories into very big successes.\n\nTower defense games often give the player something to do since the towers do much of the work. In Sanctum 2, your towers do their thing while you run about in first person, shooting at enemies inside and outside your maze. In Deathtrap, you're killing enemies Diablo-style (action RPG) while your towers do their thing. Unless you build the [i]perfect[/i] maze and/or tower placement, or have incredibly good skills, you won't succeed with only towers or only attacking yourself, but each technique is very good and useful from the beginning of each level to the end. \n\nTo continue that line of thought into less \"hybridized\" tower defense games, you're kept busy in those by upgrading your towers and placing others, keeping the strategy element going strong, often with \"waves\" of enemies with a few seconds in between to give you a breather. There is no breather on each level of Immortal Defense, upgrades are so costly that earning enough cash to buy them was rare for me, and the player interaction after hitting start, for me, solely consists of moving my mouse around pointing at enemies, and firing charged shots on occasion.\n\nThis would be alright, except that enemies' health increases the longer you go in the level, which in my opinion, is a no-no in tower defense games. Why? Imagine you're playing a tower defense where there are very specific enemy types which, at the beginning, you know how much time/how many hits it takes to kill them. If one leaks through, you can quickly go \"Oh, I need one archer tower,\" and place it, or whatever would kill it in time. In Immortal Defense, I'm pulling a number out of the air, but an enemy might have 100HP at the start of the level, but by the last minute, it has thousands of health. You lose the ability to easily gauge how easy/hard each enemy is to kill, which is the kiss of death for dealing with leaks, and this game [i]encourages[/i] you to get as close to leaking as possible.\n\nWhat do I mean by that? Well, in each level, you keep the best cash you had from the previous level, with a modifier based on how many enemies got through. That means that if you build a really good defense, you are losing out on your money for the next level, decreasing your odds of winning and getting better money. So the idea to play the game the \"best\" way is to build the bare minimum you need to succeed, and hope it's enough. \n\nBy the time an enemy leaks through, chances are it's too late to stop it, because it's late-game and you have no quick way of finding out how many hits of the shots from your cursor will kill it, or if you have time to place a new tower near the end and upgrade it, and then there's that hesitation of wondering how much money it's going to cost you to upgrade it enough to kill the baddie, and [i]then[/i] wonder if you spent too much money doing that and if it will make this attempt at the level completely wasted because you spent more money than you did the time before.\n\nThis adds a level of hesitation for me that a game of this pacing simply does not accomodate, and removes that euphoric feeling of knowing you hit the sweet spot on the towers you need, watching for a little while as your towers lay waste to incoming baddies. Instead, I found myself sitting there initially nervous, wondering if my defense was enough, giving me less enjoyment.\n\nHowever, I eventually stopped worrying and just felt bored, shift+tabbing to watch YouTube and talking with a family member in another room while the game played itself. I'd come back, see if I had success or failure, and if the latter, I would just do the same tower setup, pay for one more upgrade, hit start, and walk off again to come back in a few minutes and see how things went, because the cursor shots (player interaction) were so meaningless in my experience after the first couple of levels, even when charged.\n\nAlthough I ended up with a more positive outlook on the game than I did when I initially reviewed it, and I played through to completion of the first of six campaigns this time around, my experience was not a fun one, because I was barely playing the game, with my level of player involvement genuinely being less than a clicker game upon hitting the start button each time.", "timestamp_created": 1500355926, "timestamp_updated": 1501345797, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.705453", "comment_count": "20", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33232413": {"recommendationid": "33232413", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124949540", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488374640}, "language": "english", "review": "Loved the game and the dark story behind it .

It\u2019s delivered with character portraits and text at the beginning of a level. It covers a wide range of different themes including loneliness and finding purpose in life. The villains are as interesting as the protagonist\u2019s own character development and oh boy, do you develop. You see, you were a person once, but a gargantuan invading force became stranded and started to wreak havoc in your space. You sacrificed your humanity to become an immortal \u201cPath Defender\u201d in order to protect your family and planet from all threats by placing towers to interfere with enemy space travel. \n\nOnly after becoming a path defender do we see the kind of toll it takes on an individual and it\u2019s an interesting and long journey to behold. The characters that you meet along the way grow with you and the events that unfold take place on a grand scale. It\u2019s not a Disney movie and aims to be a more thoughtful, sobering experience. It\u2019s like a very long fable. All unlocked story bits are filed under History, just in case some of the longer levels cause you to forget what\u2019s happening. I just wish the writing didn\u2019t keep on driving the point home towards the end after becoming fairly obvious. It felt like the writer was saying, \u201cDo you get it yet? Do you? Well!?\u201d Other than that, it\u2019s probably the best story I\u2019ve experienced for a tower defense game.\n\nI enjoyed the different towers (Points) this game had to offer. Some of them were strange and took some learning to use. Each tower has seven levels and the last one tends to act as an ultimate form which can drastically change its behavior. For example, the Circuit Point draws a line to another Circuit Point which damages enemies that pass over it. They can also connect to your mouse cursor if it\u2019s in range. At level 7, they have virtually infinite range and can attach to each other across entire levels. In addition to that, the medals (Achievements) that you unlock can enhance specific towers or make other changes like a faster charge-up time for the mouse cursor abilities which include bursts of bullets or gathering the bullets of your various Points into a specific enemy cluster. In the Circuit Point\u2019s case, it\u2019ll connect to Love Points for half-damage which can result in deadly laser grids for enemy spaceships.\n\nAs another example, the Limited Point targets the highest HP target available with a rapid fire barrage. The medal you can earn by completing a side-quest causes the projectiles of other Points to home in on targets within the Limited Point\u2019s range. The Courage Point fires a piercing projectile with each level adding another projectile except for the seventh which causes it fire rapidly instead. Its projectiles can also wrap around the screen. These towers make you think about placement differently than other games in the genre which usually results in a fun time and one eye-melting light show.\n\nThe bullets fired from all Points, the mouse cursor, the enemy ships and projectiles, the Path lighting up, and the level being near the end all contribute their visual effects which can make upgrading towers or just seeing what\u2019s going on difficult at times. The pause button takes you to a pause screen instead of letting you look at the map which I didn\u2019t like. Even if you tone down the visual effects, it can still be a mess, but more manageable. Keep that in mind if you\u2019re having trouble seeing what\u2019s going on when there are hundreds of things on the screen.\n\nSince we\u2019re on the topic of settings, did you know the game has an easily adjustable difficulty slider? You can make changes between levels and the game is set to 50% by default which provides a pretty smooth experience for the campaign. I had to make some severe adjustments when I started nearing the end. The last 6-7 levels of the final chapter were very difficult, even with the slider all the way to the left at 0%. Some of the side-quests were also brutally difficult. I had more trouble with those than anything else. On the bright side, there are dozens upon dozens of levels for you to conquer which resulted in around 18-19 hours to beat the game.\n\nFinally, I\u2019d recommend hitting up the Confused? section to read the backstory. There are plenty of helpful tips in there about the game\u2019s mechanics too which is great since some of them aren\u2019t very obvious. I\u2019d definitely give it a look periodically while going through the first chapter. I\u2019d also like to revisit medals and say that I definitely enjoyed the impact they had on gameplay. You can only activate a limited amount of them at a time though which made me sad since I love obtaining obscene amounts of power, but the developer seems to favor \u201cbalance.\u201d Psh, whatever. I should also note that the developer has been making careful updates to the game to make it more balanced and better over time which I appreciate. I was going to mention that the Endless levels were taking so long to resolve that I had to sabotage myself, but then a recent update was pushed out that solved that problem. Very nice.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a non-traditional tower defense experience, Immortal Defense is a strong pick. It\u2019s not a perfect game and the visuals might be an acquired taste, but I enjoyed the wildly different towers and the game\u2019s plot. I hope Saturated Dreamers turns out just as well.\n", "timestamp_created": 1487316201, "timestamp_updated": 1487316201, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.633792", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29856013": {"recommendationid": "29856013", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010180682", "num_games_owned": 475, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 590, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489939988}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Immortal Defense \u00e9 um jogo que eu j\u00e1 comprei 2x na vida.

Es ist auch ein sehr altes Spiel, die erste Version kam 2007 auf den Markt, ich besitze es ca. seit 2010. Die Steamversion kam viel sp\u00e4ter und ist im Grunde genommen eine \u00fcberarbeitete und aufpolierte Version des damaligen Spiels. \nWer das Spiel bereits au\u00dferhalb von Steam erworben hat, hier die wichtigsten Unterschiede:\n-Achievments, welche nicht nur toll aussehen sondern euch auch besondere F\u00e4higkeiten im Spiel verliehen\n-\u00fcberarbeitete Performance und Grafik, das Spiel sieht viel besser aus und l\u00e4uft dabei noch fl\u00fcssiger\n-Bonuskampagnien, die ihr freischaltet wenn ihr in der Hauptkampagnie voranschreitet\n-enorm verbessertes Balance, viele T\u00fcrme wurden im Spiel \u00fcberarbeitet, damit sie n\u00fctzlicher sind\n\n\nNun zum eigentlichen Review. Immortal Defense ist ein Tower Defense Spiel und gleichzeitig ist es keins. Obwohl man es als \"Tower Defense\" Spiel bezeichnen kann, da es die Grundelemente jedes TD Spiels aufweist, rei\u00dft es ebenso alles hernieder, was ein TD Spiel eigentlich ausmacht.\nEs gibt Gegner, die eienn weg entlangwandern und das Ziel erreichen wollen, um euch Lebenspunkte abzuziehen, ihr baut T\u00fcrme um diese abzuwehren. So weit ist noch alles normal. Aber damit enden auch schond ie Gemeinsamkeiten zu klassischen TD Spielen.\nIn ID spielt ihr einen sogenannten Path Defender, einen kosmischen Verteidiger der seinen Planeten vor einer Alieninvasion bewahren muss. Anders als in klassischen TD Spielen startet ihr komplett ohne T\u00fcrme in eurem Arsenal, stattdessen seit ihr selbst, repr\u00e4sentiert durch euren Cursor, die einzige Verteidigung, die euch zur Verf\u00fcgung steht. Euer Cursor feuert automatisch auf nahe gelegene Feinde bis diese vernichtet sind, dann sucht er sich ein anderes Ziel. Sollte ein Gegner das Ende des Pfads erreichen, verliert ihr ein Leben. Gegner in ID kommen endlos nach, die einzige Chance ein level zu beenden ist, wenn der Timer abl\u00e4uft. Dann bricht die Hyperspaceroute, die eure Gegner zum Reisen nutzen, n\u00e4mlich zusammen und alle auf dem Pfad befindlichen Feinde werden zerst\u00f6rt.\nIm Laufe des Spiels erhaltet ihr euren ersten Turm, den sogenannten Fear Point. T\u00fcrme im Spiel werden \"Points\" genannt und sidn Aspekte eurer eigenen Pers\u00f6nlichkeit, sie repr\u00e4sentieren eure Gef\u00fchle und Gedanken. Der Far point entsteht aus der Angst, dass ihr verlieren k\u00f6nntet. Seiner Natur entsprechend ist er schwach und zur\u00fcckhaltent, er kann Gegner kurz stunnen um euch mehr Zeit zum angriff zu lassen, er entfernt au\u00dferdem kurzzeitig die Verteidigung der gegner oder setzt ihre F\u00e4higkeiten au\u00dfer Kraft. Offensiv hat er jedoch wenig zu bieten. Der Courage Point hingegen setzt auf rohe Gewalt, er hat einen langsamen, aber sehr starken Angriff, der mit seinen Speerangriffen mehrere Gegner durchbohrt bevor er verschwindet. Sollte er das Ende des Bildschirms erreichen, weil er die gegner verfehlt hat, taucht er auf der anderen seite wieder auf. So kann er auch den gleichen gegner mehrmals hintereinander treffen, falls dieser zu langsam ist. \nNormale Spielgesetze, die ihr aus anderen TD Spielen kennt, existieren hier also nicht.\n\nWeitere T\u00fcrme die sp\u00e4ter eingef\u00fchrt werden, folgen diesem Rythmus. Es gibt einen Turm der in einer Spirale um sich herum feuert, aber nicht gezielt angreifen kann, es gibt eienn sich bewegenden Turm, der ziellos umherwandert und wil herumfeuert, einen turm, dessen Reichweite bei ejdem Upgarde abnimmt statt zunimmt, ein Turm, der mit jedem Kill st\u00e4rker wird und ein Turm, der sich mit gleichen T\u00fcrmen seiner Art verbindet und so ein Lasernetz bildet, dass durchfliegenden Gegnern schadet. Jeder Turm hat 7 Stufen, wobei die siebte Stufe eine Besonderheit darstellt, in der der Turm sein maximales Potential erh\u00e4lt und meist neue F\u00e4higkeiten erlangt, so beginnt der Fear Point pl\u00f6tzlich panisch auf alle Gegner zu schie\u00dfen und das in einer wahnsinnigen Geschwindigkeit.\n\nAnders als in anderen Tower Defense Spielen k\u00f6nnt ihr nicht beliebig einen Turm bauen solange irh das Geld habt. In jedem level habt ihr eine feste Anzahl von T\u00fcrmen, deren Anzahl zudem jeweils limitiert ist, so k\u00f6nnt ihr beispielsweise 2 Courage points und 3 Fear Points haben. Mehr als diese Anzahl k\u00f6nnt ihr nicht bauen, allerdings k\u00f6nnen eure T\u00fcrme durch das Abschie\u00dfen von Gegnern mehr von ihrer Art erschaffen, die ihr dann platzieren k\u00f6nnt.\nEine weitere Eigenart des Spiels ist es, dass gesammeltes Geld zwischen Leveln fortbesteht. Statt einem festen Guthaben in jedem Level behaltet ihr eurer \u00fcbriges Geld am Ende eines Levels plus einen Bonus f\u00fcr den Abschluss, dies nehmt ihr dann mit zum n\u00e4chsten. Aufgrund dessen wird von der \u00fcblichen Praktik, alles Geld auszugeben, abgeraten, stattdessen sollte man gegen Ende immer einen kleinen Vorrat sich zusammensparen, den man dann mitnimmt.\nDie Gegner in ID starten zuerst wie typische TD Gegner, es gibt einen normalen Gegner ohne F\u00e4higkeiten, einen tankigen mit viel Verteidigung, einen schnellen der durch eure Verteidigungen sprintet usw.\nSp\u00e4ter kommen dann eher untypische Gegner, die anfangen eure Sch\u00fcsse abzublocken oder gar abschie\u00dfen, die eure t\u00fcrme au\u00dfer Kraft setzen, die sich wild hin und her auf dem Pfad herumteleportieren nach jedem Treffer. Insgesamt ist das Design sehr gut gew\u00e4hlt.\n\nGrafisch macht Immortal Defense einen sehr grellen Eindruck. Der Entwickler setzt bei seinem Spiel auf leuchtende Farben, jeder abgefeuerte Schuss strahlt in einem Sprektrum und die grellen Effekte verwischen mit der Zeit ineinander. Dies kann oft dazu f\u00fchren, dass man die \u00dcbersicht verliert, man sieht nicht mehr wo Gegner oder eurer Cursor ist. Zum Gl\u00fcck kann man diese Effekte herunterschrauben oder ganz abschalten, wer jedoch auf die Effekte steht, sollte sie so lassen. Selbst wenn man manchmal die \u00dcbersicht verliert ist das noch kein Untergang, dank Autoschussfunktion trefft ihr eure Gegner immer sofern eure Verteidigungen gut ausgelegt sind.\n\nEines der besten Dinge an Immortal Defense ist der Soundtrack. Ich kann leider nicht gut beschreiben, was ihn so gut macht, also sucht doch einfach mal auf Youtube danach und h\u00f6rt ihn euch selbst an ;-)\n\nImmortal Defense besitzt f\u00fcr ein Tower Defense Spiele ien \u00fcberraschend tiefgr\u00fcndige Geschichte.

I considered about where to put it for a little while before eventually deciding to have it be at the very end. That's because, in my opinion, Immortal Defense is the best tower defense on Steam at the moment.\n\nThe peaceful planet Dukis finds itself under attack by the evil Bavakh empire, a war-faring race of red, devilish aliens. Their armadas are vast, and with no notable army of their own Dukis is no match. However, they have one trick up their sleeve: Subject K, who has volunteered to be a Path Defender, a process that involves separating his soul from his body and sending it up into space. It's unclear whether K represents one of his names, or whether he's the eleventh person they've tried this with. Once up there, K gains the ability to see the Bavakh's ships as they move through Pathspace (basically hyperspace), and the power to attack and destroy them before they reach their destination.\n\nYou control Subject K's essence in the form of the cursor, and bringing it next to an enemy will cause him to shoot at it automatically. You can also hold the right mouse button to charge up a bigger attack. That's all for the first two levels, but then you start getting access to Point's, this game's version of towers. All of them are some aspect of K's self - your first is Fear, for example, which shoots at enemies to reduce their defense and stun them. Simple enough, but that's about the only straightforward Point of the bunch. Courage will spray inaccurate, piercing shots which wrap around the screen; Pride starts off weak, but gains damage as it destroys enemies until it's powerful enough to one shot almost anything. Orthro is inexpensive to upgrade and deals splash damage, but only fires in the cardinal directions. The store description says you haven't seen towers like this in a game before, and that still holds up almost ten years after the game's release. All of them have some use, and in the late-game it feels like you're on the other end of a bullet hell shooter at times.\n\nYour enemies are also unique, and dangerous. Several of them buff others or mess with your Points' shots, requiring you to snipe them personally with your cursor's damage and other abilities. Some levels can be quite difficult thanks to them, but the game has a large difficulty slider; at zero things are pretty easy, while at maximum the levels show everything they're capable of. The game balance is designed to make you use the slider often, as the resources you have on hand to place points persists throughout levels. That's meant to encourage you to find more efficient ways of beating them rather than just spamming points everywhere, but if need be you can set a level lower and come back to it at another point; beating the previous level with higher resources changes the amount you start the next.\n\nImmortal Defense is split into six campaigns, each of which have fifteen stages, and tell a particular period of K's time as a Path Defender. I haven't talked about the stories each game has had in this series much, and that's because they're generally unimportant and not memorable. Immortal Defense's story, meanwhile, is shockingly good. In a lot of other games that premise would just be an excuse for the gameplay, but here it's examined quite thoroughly. Up in Pathspace, K has no-one to communicate with safe for brief messages from his home world, and other Path Defenders. All he knows is destruction, with the knowledge that if he fails, his home may very well be destroyed. What would an existence like that do to someone? Would they be able to stay true to why they came up there to begin with? It asks these questions with simple text at the beginning of each level, and does it well.\n\nIn the audio-visual department, Immortal Defense also excels. While only made in Game Maker, the levels have a lot of special effects and touches to them to really emphasize how otherworldly Pathspace is; the path itself will appear to bend and stretch depending on where you move your cursor, and enemies will appear transparent until you move close. The game's soundtrack is quite varied, from heroic and uplifting to quiet and mournful, and will play randomly in levels, which is neat. Throughout levels your Points will also make commentary when they destroy enemies or get upgraded by you.\n\nWith all the main levels Immortal Defense is quite a substantial game (the store says it's about twenty hours, but I think that's underestimating it quite a bit), and there are also several mini-campaigns featuring your Points which test how familiar you are with their strengths and weaknesses. Those, among many other things, unlock medals, in-game achievements that apply bonuses. Some are minor, while others, such as ones that affect Points, can give you a major advantage. I'm about finished with the game after I went back to redo levels at max difficulty, and I have about ninety hours, so it's quite a good value at ten dollars.\n\nOverall I'd say Immortal Defense is pretty close to perfect. The gameplay is enjoyable, it ties into an engaging story, it looks great despite it's age, and does a lot of unique things. I'm not sure how many people own it, but that number deserves to be much higher.

There are about ten points-- of those, I think that four or five are truly unique among games of this genre.\n\nYour currency carries over from level to level, so you're incentivized to perfect a level with the least possible investment.

For example, you amass the resources you spend to build points by beating stages. When you start a stage, you can decide the difficulty at which you would like to attempt the stage. Increasing the difficulty makes the stage harder, but also increases the amount of resources you earn by completing the stage. Playing the stage at a lower difficulty is useful for advancing the story and unlocking new abilities. There is no strategic disadvantage to playing stages at a lower difficulty, as you can go back after the fact and replay those stages at a higher difficulty. Rewards that you earn will be retroactively applied to your current resources, if they are higher than your previous high score on that stage.\n\nThe game has really interesting visuals, resembling some sort of psychadelic screen saver when all the effects are turned on. The soundtrack is similarly interesting. The background music is mostly a moody and dark orchestral score. The different types of points and enemies have unique sound effects when they interact. The combination of these causes particularly busy stages where you build a lot of points to sound like the product of some mad composer. The story is also compellingly weird, and there were times I found myself motivated to complete stages in order to discover more of the narrative (which trickles in bit by bit at the beginning of each stage).\n\nI don't know if Immortal Defense was a labor of love, but it definitely feels like a lot of time, thought, and effort has been spent on refining it.

If you don't like TD it's still absolutely worth a look.\n\nIt's not only my favourite tower defence game, but it's one of my favourite games, full stop. I loved it back in 2009 when I first played it and this new Steam version comes with a raft of improvements over the original, hence why I'm playing it again. It still holds up beautifully.\n\nIn Immortal Defense, you have given up your world and physical body to become an immortal defender in 'pathspace', a dimension above phasewarp. There, you are but a ghost to the Bavakh, one of the most tyrannical races in the galaxy, who are using hyperspace to attack your home planet Dukis. As a path defender you focus aspects of your will -- fear, love, courage, pride, precision and others -- to form 'points' (the towers of ID) to stop the Bavakh. This is how the game begins, but it's far, far away from where it ends.\n\nSo what makes it special? It's many things. It's the haunting story, the turns it takes and the themes it deals with. It's the hugely inventive and unusual towers. It's the way the mouse pointer is used as its own tower; shooting, charging shots and synergising with other towers in powerful and unexpected ways. It's the kaleidoscopic visuals, the warbling, droning sounds and the crystalline shattering of enemies as they bleed and streak light across the screen. It's the strange enemy designs and their unusual abilities. It's the rousing and understated soundtrack. It's the many challenging levels (and the new challenge stages which restrict what towers you can place, encouraging you to use them more effectively). It's the little things like kill counts per tower so you can gauge how effective your layouts are, or the recycle value of a tower degrading over time so a quick placement mistake won't punish you-- and mass end-of-level-selling won't help. It's your cache rolling over from one level to the next to encourage efficiency. It's the endless simulated assaults bookending each chapter, testing what you've learnt and ultimately determining how much cache you start the next chapter with. It's the level editor and the bundled fan levels, the detailed in-game manual, the leaderboards (if you're into that kind of thing), the ability to slow down time when things get manic (or speed it up if your line's holding)... and more.\n\nAt \u00a36.99, or $10(ish), it's an absolute steal for a game this unique, heartfelt, evocative, clever, challenging and brimming with content.", "timestamp_created": 1442258076, "timestamp_updated": 1472582878, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.564945", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18008224": {"recommendationid": "18008224", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000942568", "num_games_owned": 417, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 445, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448224723}, "language": "english", "review": "Very different than other Tower Defense games that I have played.

How many of them do we really need?\" - you're probably asking yourself at the moment. Why yes, indeed, it IS a tower defense for PC - a platform already chock-full of various games of the kind. You might have already played Defense Grid, spent some evenings grinding Defender's Quest, maybe partied in the co-op mode of Dungeon Defenders with a couple of friends... So, why waste time on yet another game of an exhausted genre?\n\nTo put it shortly - yes, we do need Immortal Defense. Right off the bat - when playing ID, you're not just an omnipresent authority figure (c), you ARE the guy who actually shoots stuff in top-down perspective. That little mouse cursor on screen that lets you build your towers? That's you right there, or rather your soul, personification of your willpower - whichever you prefer. It's the embodiment of a player in the game, and one of the signs of its unorthodox approach - combining the control mechanics with the actual gameplay, making the player a major part of the action while removing any unnecessary medium. Very few games do this (\"Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons\" comes to mind, check it out when you can), and to see this from a \"mere\" tower defense? Not bad, not bad at all.\n\nBut then we move beyond the interface and controls and look at the game itself, and... Geez, is that a plot segment I see in-between the missions? Some kind of a mystic space opera? Why do I even need a plot in a tower defense game? It boils down to shooting unremarkable enemies throughout a hundred of levels anyway, right? Right?... Well, not in this case, it doesn't. From the very beginning the game makes you feel responsible - you are not just a figure behind a computer desk, consolidating some defense force around your planet. You have been chosen to leave everything you knew behind and transcend into a new form of being - the form no one really knows much about. It's the sacrifice you made for your loved ones - and each message from them, received after successful battles, reassures you in the righteousness of your task. To become a god of space between worlds, to be the last hope of your home planet - what's not to like?\n\nAnd yet, the Universe operates on a different level, and not every action has clear consequences. Concentrating your will to create needle-sharp \"points\" - your line of defense against the invading armies - you fail to notice how decades after decades run by. The Universe is engulfed by war, and there's little time for you to think of what the future holds for you when you finally turn homewards. But when you do... will there really be home to return to?\n\nThere are many other beings like you, created with the same mission in mind - to protect, to defend, to repel. And yet, as you soon realize, not everyone can bear the centuries of loneliness. For that matter, can you?..\n\nBut the transcended existence has its own benefits - with each passing day, your memories shatter, but your will gets stronger. Learning more and more advanced techniques, assembling more and more powerful points, you manage to overcome the limitations of spirit once imposed upon you. What lies beyond? Will it be paradise for those who rely on you... or will you only descend deeper into hell?\n\nTo put it shortly, Immortal Defense is not an easy game to review. The controls and mechanis are closely intertwined with gameplay, and the gameplay itself depends heavily on the story. There are no decisions per se, no roads to take, but the final result still doesn't disappoint - in the very end it feels like you walked your own path, made your own choices. Complicated relationships with your family's descendants and the ones who you once thought your enemies only make it harder to progress, and the game itself becomes more and more complex with each mission, never forgetting to introduce yet another enemy pattern or some dimensional trick to keep you off guard. Overcoming those and using every available ability to your advantage - that is the measure of a true Ghost of the Path. And trust me, with the Steam release, the game has obtained a LOT of new shiny toys for you to experiment with, as well as a real sense of an almost RPG-like progression - just take a look at all the bonuses that achievements and medals provide!\n\nI first played ID when it was released years ago, and I still play it to this very day. With each playthrough, I feel as if I learnt something new - not just about the game, but about myself, too. Is there anything else to wish for? Well, maybe some cool graphics effects and nifty tower designs - in which case you'll find those here aplenty. ;) Happy hunting, Great Ghost!

With tons of unique mechanics but still holding together what makes a good tower defense a good tower defense, and on top of that all a great story considering it's a game where you're shooting geometrical shapes flying on a line... Immortal Defense is amazing for what it is.\n\nIn Immortal Defense, you play as a Pathspace Defender whose goal is to defend your home planet by literally becoming a god and shooting invisible hellbeams from another plane of existence at people who are invading you. You do this by what else- placing towers! While the story and gameplay get more complicated than that (and bring all sorts of delightful twists and turns), that is the basic premise to the game.\n\nIf you're new to the game, you might be pleasantly surprised by the gameplay and strange quirks it has. Each tower is more unique than the usual tower defense tower, with every single one having completely original properties and not just \"the splash damage tower\" and \"the one that shoots fast\". Not only that, but you have a stake in the action as well; you use your mouse cursor to charge up attacks and interact with some of the attacks of your nearby towers to efficiently take out harder enemies. The strategic depth of the game gets pretty crazy later on, with enemies you have to pinpoint and \"snipe\" with your cursor or else they'll buff other enemies to the point of being unstoppable. You'll also find that although the story starts out a bit slow it picks up very fast and perfectly placed cliffhangers keep making you want to play more.\n\nIf you're a returning player, why buy the steam version? The non-steam version is currently pay what you want on the site (unless it's been taken down). The steam version has all kinds of great new features, from almost doubling the length of the base game with side missions and campaigns to giving you permanent \"upgrades\" sort of by completing weird challenges to make the notoriously harder levels a tiny bit easier. Not only that but there is a more in depth graphical system (with widescreen support finally) and leaderboards/steam workshop integration so you can play other people's levels that they made with great ease.\n\nSo would I recommend Immortal Defense? With an overwhelming response, yes. It is one of, if not the best and most unique tower defense game I have ever played and the story is also seriously great (even though it can come off as trying too hard a time or two).

It touches on some odd topics for a video game but it sure made me think about things that very few games can manage.\nThe story itself is pretty enjoyable and the game takes awhile to run through. So it is a decent investment on time I found. With six different plot lines that take place over sixteen missions a piece. And a bit of extra content if you can find it. It certainly kept me occupied for awhile.\nIt follows the adventures of an almost unnamed protagonist as he becomes his worlds only defense against an alien menace in what they call \"Path Space\" Which feels a lot like hyperspace, to me. And that's what it plays as, it is a short cut from point A to point B in space. And you are there, looking down at the ships trying to venture through. And this gives you a severe advantage over them. But in this state you are incorporeal, and seperate from your body. Time passes differently. How do you handle this, all the presure of so many lives depending on your constant vigiliance and being seperated from everyone you know and love. The story touches on this in many ways. And also friendship and betrayal as well. But I'll leave those for you to discover.\nIt's also quite atmospheric and charming. I haven't seen any tower defense games where your towers talk to you and have their own personalities. It's very interesting to see what all they have to say as you play the game. And how they respond to the things happening o nthe screen.\n\nOne of the things I like most about Immortal Defense  though is the music, it really draws me in and makes me feel there, in the moment and I think grabbing the soundtrack is worth the price of admission by itself. But that's just me.\nMusic aside, the visuals are another strong trait the game has, falling somewhere between a rave and some sort of bizzare drug trip, they are certainly something to see. Though on higher settings might be a bit much for some people of more frail constitution. But that is easily adjusted on the main screen via slider.\n\nAnyway, This is a game that I absolutely adore and have played through multiple times. Twice for fun and once to get to the secret stuff! Worth the money I spent, way back before it got on steam. And I will be buying it again now, for friends to enjoy!\nOverall, I would say, if you like tower defense games, or games that touch on philisophical things, this would be a very strong buy. The musics and graphics are great, for the games age, and it is really more about the aesthetic amyway, at least that's how I feel!\n\nDisclosure: Studio Eres provided me with an advance copy of the Steam version for the purposes of play testing and review.", "timestamp_created": 1441052532, "timestamp_updated": 1441052532, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586481", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17817310": {"recommendationid": "17817310", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000153336", "num_games_owned": 284, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 66, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457601893}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a very unique and good tower defense game.\n\nThe story is really good, and the towers really are unlike towers in all the other tower defense games I have played.\n\nMy game will seem a bit low because most of what I played was from a older verson that came before the game was put here on steam. \n\nThe game's dev is nice too for giving people who had a older verson of the game a chance to get a steam key if they can find something like their order information or email that shows they did in fact own it before.", "timestamp_created": 1441048428, "timestamp_updated": 1441048428, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500683", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17816325": {"recommendationid": "17816325", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990437197", "num_games_owned": 1918, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501617763}, "language": "english", "review": "This is an absolutely fantastic little tower defence game.\nIt's mechanically sound and the tower interactions (and limitations) lend themselves to requiring interesting strategies on most of the later levels.

I was beginning to gain interest in, \"indie games.\" One of the games that I saw was the most highly acclaimed was Immortal Defense, reborn on Steam after 8 years. \n\nI was never very good at tower defense games, and to be honest I'm still not good at them. Back then I tried to get through as much of the story as I could (on difficulty 00 never the less) but I think my brain stopped being able to handle it around the half way point of chapter 3. The game is difficult and can take a lot of thinking to fully understand. Part of this is because there doesn't seem to be an, \"optimal,\" strategy for each level. There are ways that don't work, but especially later on you can figure out many different ways to beat them. I ended up cheating my way through a lot of the game from that point. Sorry Paul, I did it back then and I might have to do it again. I'm just not clever enough for your later levels.\n\nThe visuals, while simplistic, make up for it in terms of color, style, and how fitting they all are. The game looks really damn nice now. Still simple, but even more juiced up with all kinds of interesting effects.\n\nThe music can range between infectious and grand with some great melodies but you can definitely hear that it was a bit of a budget affair. I spotted some midi bass that seemed out of place.\n\nBut the real thing that makes Immortal Defense so special to me was its story and how it affects the gameplay. You play K, a person who has given up his body to defend his home world from invaders, detacting himself from the physical world to defend it from pathspace. K left all he loves physically - but not mentally. In pathspace, K uses parts of his being, mainly his emotions manifested into towers to destroy enemies in pathspace. They speak out in the middle of the game with character, making the battlefield feel alive.\n\nK's journey is a philsophical one that tackles a lot for a game: what matters to a person, what drives them, what the nature of reality is, what the nature of truth is, how powerful you can become and how it influences others, and how it would be like to live alone, forever in a place away from any mortal eye. \n\nThe writing is very well done. It is never these huge philosophical rants, rather the characters give you information and story through the use of subtle phrases that you can put a lot of thought into.\n\nNot only that, the levels range from abstract to very purposely made symbols that represent what is happening in the game.\n\nThe point is: The story and mood of Immortal Defense seems into every crevice of the game. Every element in the game seeks to bring you into the story of K. His story is a hypothesis on what might it be like if you, the player, were to embark on this grand journey a million years long.\n\nI finished the game long ago in 2007 (2008?) early in the morning. It made me think about my own place in the world, made me feel profound emotions and has given me a quote to live by to this day. Rethinking about the game gives me chills and to this day fills me with the feelings of...I can't really put them into words.\n\nMaybe it was me being naive and being sensitive. I'm a sensitive guy, what can I say? But this is my experience from the game. Even if no one else feels the way I did, this game hit me hard and inspired me in many ways.\n\nWhen you have nothing left, you must create your own reasons for existening. Some people cling to the past, others surround themselves in their own creations. \n\nHere are two quotes that have stayed with me all these years.\n\n\"There's one thing you can rely on in this universe: being as wrong as often as you are right. So whether you're right or wrong -- Be exceptional at it. That's morality.\"\n\nand \n\n\"I love you grandpa.\"\n\nThank you Paul and the rest of the developers behind Immortal Defense.

ID is one of the best Tower Defense style games I have ever played.\n\nOn a mechanical level, the towers are not the formulaic set you find in most other games. You know, the \"weak but fast\" tower, the \"long range and slow\" tower, the \"splash damage\" tower, etc. You won't find that here. Each of the towers has vastly different behaviors, making you think more carefully about placement. Behavior can change as you upgrade them, and they can also interact with your cursor as well (which is a weapon in its own right).\n\nThe game is also very challenging - experienced Tower Defense players will be tested here. But, the difficulty can be adjusted along the way, so if it's just too hard, you can dial the difficulty down a bit - for the one level you're having trouble with - and come back to it later if you want.\n\nVisually, Immortal Defense is fun. This is an older game but it still looks great. It's somewhere between a dream, a laser light show, and an LSD experience all rolled up into one. The visuals can also be dialed up and down as needed, though, so if it is too much for you, you can get back to a more \"sane\" experience. I recommend keeping on the higher side.\n\nThe music is great too - it has a delicate, mystical quality that fits very well with the art style.\n\nGenerally, tower defense games have at most a token storyline, something that is easy to throw away and ignore. But Immortal Defense delivers here, too - taken as a whole, the story of Immortal Defense gets into some interesting philisophical questions about immortality, good and evil, what is really important, etc. The towers (called Points in the game) come out of the story, and their names and functionality are drawn out of it as well. \n\nIt might be a bit too cerebral for a lot of people, but it won't interfere with the gameplay.\n\nFor the Steam version of the game, there are new challenges that you can complete for additional bonuses during gameplay. There is also a leaderboard.\n\nOverall, I rate this as a very strong buy for anyone who enjoys the Tower Defense genre and is looking for something a little different. Visuals aside, I put ID on the same level as other TD greats.\n\nDisclosure: Studio Eres provided me with an advance copy of the Steam version for the purposes of play testing and review.", "timestamp_created": 1441025678, "timestamp_updated": 1441025678, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 78, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.853505", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 98, "total_negative": 6, "total_reviews": 104}}

Very easy to learn and control, yet satisfying and smooth. Because it's limited to just lines and lights, the puzzles are tight and elegant without visual clutter.\n\nWhat elevates this game above the rest is its superb level design. There's constantly new twists and mechanics introduced, like every other puzzle game, but here they come at such a comfortable pace that they never feel exhausting or bloated. I kept wanting to go for just a few more.\n\nAnd as you go along the main line path, the puzzles combine the different concepts you've learned. It's getting more difficult, but instead of overwhelming you with [b]intensity[/b], it's always intuitive and clever. It feels charming, like the game was always trying to subtly teach and guide you, rather than arrogantly challenge you.\n\nThere's no narration, no dialogue, no characters. The game stays humble, not trying to deliver any pretentious story. Yet at times it can still feel like you're experiencing a beautiful little story, told only through combining its gameplay and your input.\n\nIt's only about 2 hours to get to the end, but took me about 7 hours total to do all the optional puzzles. I love how all the secret puzzles are found within the main puzzles, always accessible but never intrusive. Still, even the 2 hour version was worth it.\n\nLinelight is warm and inviting.

I'll play them just to scratch that itch, even if they aren't all that noteworthy. Linelight stands head and shoulders above pretty much ANYTHING else in this category though. It has one of the most finely tuned difficulty curves I think I've ever seen, and every puzzle feels more like a conversation about an idea than an obstacle. And it's FULL of content, 8 worlds long with new ideas all the time, and a ton of secret extra-hard bonus puzzles to search out.\n\nAnd if that weren't enough, what's this? Am I actually becoming emotionally invested in a game about lines? Through the use of a great soundtrack and pure game mechanics, Linelight somehow manages to evoke a melancholy story about conflict, friendship, loss, and finding purpose, in a way that something like Thomas Was Alone with its stilted, brow-beating narration never could. In all aspects it's simply a charming game that should be in any puzzle-lover's library.", "timestamp_created": 1511548378, "timestamp_updated": 1511548378, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3,

The concept seems very basic, but there are constantly new mechanics and ideas introduced into the puzzles that make them really deep and interesting. There are very few timing/skill-based puzzles, so the focus is always on creativity and problem solving. The controls are super simple and flawlessly executed. The dreamy soft graphics with nice piano music make the game a joy to play, and never frustrating trying to figure out a solution. The puzzles are never really too difficult, but also never boring. There are plenty of secret puzzles that are a bit more challenging too.\n\nBut the best part has to be how much charm and character and story is delivered through these tiny little lines. It's an amazing achievement, and a breath of fresh air after playing so many similar puzzle games that just feel soulless and dry.", "timestamp_created": 1506471955, "timestamp_updated": 1506471955, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581969", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35086547": {"recommendationid": "35086547", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126689286", "num_games_owned": 282, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 480, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505835399}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ud37c\uc990\uac8c\uc784\uc744 \uc88b\uc544\ud558\ub294\ud3b8\uc774\ub77c \uc7ac\ubbf8\uc788\uac8c \ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud50c\ub808\uc774\ud0c0\uc784\uc740 \ucd08\ud68c\ucc28 \uc57d 6\uc2dc\uac04\uc815\ub3c4 \uac78\ub824\uc11c \ub178\ub780\uc0c9\uc624\ube0c \ub2e4 \ubaa8\uc558\uace0 \ubcf4\ub108\uc2a4 \ucd08\ub85d\uc0c9\uc624\ube0c\uae4c\uc9c0 \ub2e4 \ubaa8\uc73c\ub294\ub370 8\uc2dc\uac04 \uac78\ub838\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4 \uc77c\ub2e8 \ubc30\uacbd\uc74c\uc545\uc5d0 \uc2e0\uacbd\uc744 \ub418\uac8c \ub9ce\uc774\uc4f4\uac8c \ub290\uaef4\uc9c0\uad6c\uc694 \uc800\ub294 \uc120\ubb3c\ubc1b\uc558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc660\uc9c0 \uac00\uaca9\uc5d0\ube44\ud574\uc120 \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \ud0c0\uc784\uc774 \uc870\uae08 \uc544\uc27d\ub124\uc694... \uc720\uc800 \ucc3d\uc791\ubaa8\ub4dc \ud37c\uc990\uac19\uc740\uac70\ub77c\ub3c4 \ucd94\uac00\ub418\uba74 \uc880\ub354 \uc88b\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc744\uae4c \uc2f6\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4 \uad6c\uc131\uc774 \ub418\uac8c \ub2e8\ucd10\ud574\uc11c \uc26c\uc6b8\uac83\uac19\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc740\uadfc\ud788 \ub09c\uc758\ub3c4\ub3c4 \uc788\uace0\uadf8\ub807\ub2e4\uace0 \uc640 \uc774\uac74 \ub3c4\uc800\ud788 \ubabb\uae68\uaca0\ub2e4 \ud558\ub294 \ud30c\ud2b8\ub294 \uc5c6\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4 \uc870\uae08\ub9cc \ubd99\uc7a1\uace0 \uace0\ubbfc\ud558\uba74 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c\ub4e0 \uae68\uc9c0\ub294 \uc2a4\ud14c\uc774\uc9c0\ub4e4\uc774\uace0 \uac00\ubccd\uac8c \uc990\uae30\uae30 \uc88b\uc740\uac83\uac19\uc544\uc694 \uac00\uaca9\uc774 \ubd80\ub2f4\ub418\uc2dc\uba74 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc2a4\ud1a0\uc5b4\ub098 \uc571\uc2a4\ud1a0\uc5b4\uc5d0\uc11c 1.99\ub2ec\ub7ec\uc5d0 \uc0b4\uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\uace0 \ud558\ub2c8 \uadf8\ucabd\ub3c4 \uad1c\ucc2e\uc744\uac83 \uac19\ub124\uc694", "timestamp_created": 1505921725, "timestamp_updated": 1505921725, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507389", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35019298": {"recommendationid": "35019298", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099147864", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 451, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513598359}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u597d\u73a9  \u7565\u6709\u96be\u5ea6", "timestamp_created": 1505642278, "timestamp_updated": 1505642278, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34994145": {"recommendationid": "34994145", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078951636", "num_games_owned": 1848, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 540, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511505156}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u97f3\u4e50\u4f18\u7f8e\uff0c\u753b\u9762\u8010\u770b\uff0c\u8868\u5173\u5361\u7684\u8868\u8c1c\u9898\u4e0d\u7b97\u5f88\u96be\u4f46\u5f88\u6709\u8da3\u3002\n\n\u66f4\u65b0\uff1a\n\u91cc\u5173\u5361\u548c\u9690\u85cf\u8c1c\u9898\u5168\u8fbe\u6210\u7eaa\u5ff5\uff01\n\nPS\uff1aOST\u4f5c\u4e1a\u5411\nPS2\uff1a\u81ea\u4ece\u5f00\u59cb\u6253\u9690\u85cf\uff0c\u6211\u5c31\u5b66\u4f1a\u4e86\u4f7f\u52b2\u8e6d\u5899\nPS3\uff1a\u627e\u4e0d\u5230\u8def\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u8bb0\u5f97\u627e\u201c\u670b\u53cb\u201d\u5e2e\u5fd9\nPS4\uff1a\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u73a9\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u7a81\u7136\u770b\u522b\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\u4f1a\u6709\u9971\u548c\u5ea6\u53d8\u9ad8\u4e86\u7684\u9519\u89c9", "timestamp_created": 1505560460, "timestamp_updated": 1506145890, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505173", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34917459": {"recommendationid": "34917459", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108183039", "num_games_owned": 392, "num_reviews": 140, "playtime_forever": 319, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505301029}, "language": "english", "review": "This is just such a fantastic game.

La musique donne \u00e0 ce jeu aux graphismes minimalistes une ambiance tr\u00e8s calme et po\u00e9tique. En fait je passe du temps sur les puzzles pas tellement parce qu'ils sont difficiles, mais parce que je ne fais qu'\u00e9couter la musique du jeu pendant 5 bonnes minutes. xD\n\nJustement, concernant la difficult\u00e9 du jeu, les \u00e9nigmes sont largement faisables si vous ne vous pr\u00e9occupez pas du 100%. \u00c7a se complique quand m\u00eame un peu lorsque la m\u00e9canique de gameplay du 6e monde est introduite. Certaines \u00e9nigmes ne sont m\u00eame pas obligatoires, car elles ne servent qu'\u00e0 collecter un losange jaune bonus. Il existe \u00e9galement des losanges verts, obtenus en r\u00e9solvant des \u00e9nigmes cach\u00e9es en dehors du parcours normal. Mais m\u00eame dans ces zones secr\u00e8tes, ce n'est que vers le 6e monde et dans les mondes bonus qu'il faudra r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir un peu plus.\n\nPoints positifs :\n+ L'ambiance du jeu, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la musique tr\u00e8s relaxante\n+ Les mondes bonus et les \u00e9nigmes secr\u00e8tes qui allongent un peu la dur\u00e9e de vie\n+ Des m\u00e9caniques de gameplay vari\u00e9es pour un jeu qui se d\u00e9roule sur une ligne\n\nPoints n\u00e9gatifs :\n- Pas vraiment de rejouabilit\u00e9...\n- Certaines \u00e9nigmes plus bas\u00e9es sur un timing serr\u00e9 que sur la r\u00e9flexion\n\nEn bref, un jeu de r\u00e9flexion pas tr\u00e8s difficile, et surtout tr\u00e8s relaxant !", "timestamp_created": 1502635433, "timestamp_updated": 1502657142, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34183187": {"recommendationid": "34183187", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036734587", "num_games_owned": 208, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6765, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 66, "last_played": 1513665614}, "language": "english", "review": "I've...umm...played this game a lot...\n\nIf you like the music from the trailer, and you love puzzle games.

If you're not immersed, the collective hour you spend just moving from puzzle to puzzle or watching one of the different-coloured lines escape from the grid and float around freely will only serve to waste your time rather than emotionally engage you.\n\nAs someone from the latter category, I was pretty bored. I put on other entertainment to the side as I waited for the game to ramp up in difficulty, and it never did. I had to stop and think three times throughout the entire game and all three times it was due to me missing a mechanic that I didn't realise existed and I hadn't required previously. There are \"secret\" paths that you can hunt for that lead to a bit of extra challenge -- but not enough challenge to stop me from solving them almost immediately, and I don't consider myself awfully adept at puzzle games. My hours played are inflated from leaving the game on in the background, and by the time I'd completed all the non-hidden puzzles in the game I couldn't be bothered to hunt for the rest of the hidden ones in the hope for more complexity.\n\nI recommend it in general though as I clearly wasn't the target audience, and it seems to have been made with a lot of thought and care for those that it's aimed at.", "timestamp_created": 1500337071, "timestamp_updated": 1500337071, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33549981": {"recommendationid": "33549981", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118858827", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1057, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500086972}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0425\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0438 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c \u0441\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0431\u043e", "timestamp_created": 1500087218, "timestamp_updated": 1500087218, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33468723": {"recommendationid": "33468723", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008743329", "num_games_owned": 274, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 605, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499818001}, "language": "english", "review": "A well executed puzzle game with high quality design and integration (sound/music, presentation/UI, etc.) that definitely couldn't be mistaken for a hodgepodge Flash game, for example. I strongly recommend use of a controller, as there are a few puzzles that are timing based, and even more that require a bit more finesse than a keyboard delivers. Overall, however, I found only 4 or so puzzles that required multiple tries due to my lack of reflexes (and most of these being optional as well). Most timing difficulties are actually the result of attempting an incorrect solution.\n\nThere are 240 main puzzles and 60 optional challenge puzzles, split among 8 worlds. Each world will introduce a major new mechanism (generally a new type of \"line\") and start you with simple puzzles that will escalate in difficulty as you progress through the world. Later worlds will also integrate some mechanics from previous worlds to add some variety. Given the sheer number of puzzles, the general lack of repititiveness in puzzles was also refreshing. Each world ends with a \"tandem\" segment in which you solve puzzles in tandem with the new line type that was introduced in the given world. Solutions for these segments are generally easier, but generate a nice kineticism and build-up as you work with your \"partner\" in a final sprint to the finish.\n\nThe use of multiple worlds to generate new mechanics, the way the worlds build up as you play, and the terminal segments all help create diversity and break up the monotony of solving the same problem over and over again, which can be a failing of a lot of games in this genre. Altogether, these elements, with a very nice accompanying responsive score help generate a sense of flow (and even a bit of narrative force) in the game that puts Linelight a cut above the rest.", "timestamp_created": 1499820754, "timestamp_updated": 1499820754, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33412428": {"recommendationid": "33412428", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069361329", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 778, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499955777}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e0d\u9519\nbut\nWe need steamcloud.", "timestamp_created": 1499627648, "timestamp_updated": 1499627648, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33403759": {"recommendationid": "33403759", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970629161", "num_games_owned": 1096, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 862, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499606042}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a great puzzle game.

Some seem just like the previous until you notice the subtle change which completely changes the solution. A few can stump you until you realise you've been thinking about it from completely the wrong perspective in manner reminiscent of Hexcells. One or two require some quick reflexes, but this is certainly not a twitchy game.\n\nVisually, it's minimalist but exactly as frilly as it needs to be. The music is playful without being irritatingly energetic, and ties in to what's going on on screen in a pleasing way. There's the mildest hint of narrative but no text. It's a puzzle game without pretension.

On your way to the end of each level you meet lots of friends and foes, have a happy time together and a sad farewell. Yes, I'm still talking about the same game.\n\nLinelight slowly introduces the player to every new mechanic you need to solve the puzzles and reuses some of them now and then, but not to a point where it would get repetetive. Some of them are simple switches you have to activate, others are quite complicated and include magnets and good timing. It is quite challenging at times, especially when you have to get the timing just right, but not too hard to make someone ragequit; the awesome and calming soundtrack will keep everyone in a good mood anyway.\n\nAs mentioned above, at the end of each world you will meet other lines of light that will accompany you on your journey and help you to solve some of the puzzles. And that's where it gets kind of emotional. Yes, emotions in a puzzle game without an actual story or any written text! And that's what I think is kind of fascinating about this.\n\nConclusion: This is a very cute, challenging puzzle game. It took me about 8 hours to get 100% completion, which is a good amount of playtime. If you're into puzzle-games that at some occasions not only need a bit of thinking, but also quite some skill and right timing, you will like Linelight.

Yes there are puzzles and some of them can be a bit of a brain tickler, but ultimately I didn\u2019t feel like they were the focus. If you look at games like Divide By Sheep and Girls Like Robots, these games are heavily focused on that puzzle element. Linelight feels more relaxed, more focused on its rhythm and fluidity of movement than mind shattering puzzles. To the point that it almost feels like a dance. Now I know that may sound odd for predominantly a puzzle game but give me a chance to explain.\n\nThe first time you load into the game you\u2019re immediately greeted by a wonderful piano melody. This beautiful soundtrack continues and completely enhances the game stage by stage. This is one of those games where I HIGHLY recommend purchasing the Game+OST bundle. Obviously graphically, Linelight is on the simple side, but it does make use of bright colors and a colorful cloudy background. Each stage or world usually has a theme that blends into puzzles from that point forward. Whether that be red lines that move independently and can impede your progress, orange lines that move only when you do or ways to make your white line longer. These elements are all given their own world/set of stages for you to master.\n\nLike I said before, I never really got stuck with any particular puzzle. I may have taken a couple more minutes on some, but I never felt like I didn\u2019t know what to do. This isn\u2019t really game you are going to need a walkthrough or a guide, as the game is pretty self explanatory. It\u2019s not a super difficult game but more focused on a pleasant experience. Get a hot cup o\u2019 tea, wrap up in a warm blanket and play this game. I am rather surprised that Linelight isn\u2019t currently on any mobile device, as this would be wonderful to play on a comfy sofa. I really hope that this game is ported to the mobile market, I think it definitely would excel there.\nWhen you\u2019re just about to complete a world the game does a bit of a pivot.\n\nIt takes all that you have learned from the former puzzles and does what I can only describe as a dance of lines. These are quick puzzles that usually involve more than one line that you may or may not control. These moments are rather beautiful. Even with the simple graphics. You fly forward as fast as you can, twirling and crossing. It\u2019s something you definitely have to experience to understand.\n\nLinelight is a nice but simple experience. There isn\u2019t really going to be much replay value. There are some hidden puzzles in there but nothing that I felt like I absolutely wanted to find. It\u2019s there if you want it. If you do replay this game, its because you want to chill and relax. Enjoying the aesthetics more than anything else. You can probably complete this game within three to four hours at the most. Linelight currently features Steam achievements but no Steam cards.\n\nI had a good time with Linelight, it\u2019s a great stress reliever and it definitely does things in a unique way. The puzzles were fun, inventive, innovative and the soundtrack absolutely sold me on this game. Any gamer/family can enjoy this game as long as they know what they are buying. Coming in at \u00a37.99/$9.99 it\u2019s not that hard on the pocket either. Just keep in mind, that this is a bit of a short experience.\n\nI am off to go do some lines!

That is the gist of the game.\n\n The game does introduce new challenges as you progress further with new obstacles. Further down the line new lines appear on the map which can make you restart the whole puzzle section with just a touch.  And that is where the gameplay pretty much ends.\n\nLinelight takes a minimalist approach to solving puzzles, there is always a soothing feeling while you\u2019re playing this game as it does not punish you too hard on a mistake, is not as much taxing on your brain as many of the games of its genre out there and that might pose a problem with the people who are looking for hardcore puzzle games.\n\n Linelight won\u2019t give you puzzles which are going to take you hours to figure out and such. The whole gameplay is based around giving you a relaxing and calming experience and Linelight excels here.\n\n The game itself is very neat and there is no unnecessary UI or any sort of tutorial and the game fares much better without one. It drops subtle hints towards the future puzzles with its gameplay and expects you to catch onto them.\n\n It is easy to browse through and there are a standard amount of options present to tweak the game\u2019s performance making it run well even on somewhat older machines. I also didn\u2019t find a single bug or crash that would ruin my experience and that is why I consider Linelight to be one of the best minimalist puzzle games to come out in the recent times.\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\n\nLinelight takes a minimalist approach to its visuals with its representation of lines and puzzles as something that resembles a circuit. The visuals are pleasing to look at and even the hardest of puzzles look like they can be solved just because of their visual flair. Overall, Linelight has excellent visuals that go along perfectly with its gameplay. \n\n[h1]Sound[/h1]\n\nA calm and soothing soundtrack makes Linelight a joy to hear to. The random sounds produced by the game are also nicely done and overall the sound design of Linelight just makes the environment of solving puzzles all the more soothing.\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\n\nLinelight is one of the best minimalist puzzle games to come out in recent time. While it may turn off some people looking for hardcore styled puzzles, it is one of the most relaxing and calming experience you can hope in a puzzle game. Point on visual flair and an excellent sound design makes it completely worth its asking price. If you are looking for a puzzle game which is not too difficult, then Linelight is the game for you. \n\n[h1]Rating: 90/100[/h1]\n\n\nThis review was brought to you by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/ReviewExperts/]Review Experts[/url] through the generous contribution of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/danielbink/]Dani\u00ebl - REX \u2665 Gaming[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1488699140, "timestamp_updated": 1488699186, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.613131", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30330429": {"recommendationid": "30330429", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041187156", "num_games_owned": 340, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 139, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488693248}, "language": "english", "review": "I cannot recommend this game enough.

There's no tutorial to speak of in this game. Instead, Linelight relies on simple controls and a superb gradient of difficulty that metes out patterns and puzzles gradually. Though the puzzles can become rather complex, the elements are all introduced fairly gradually. This ensures that you learn all you need to before taking on harder challenges. This not only allows for maximum satisfaction when you successfully plot and think your way through an area, but also resulted in a number of fluid, almost unconscious solutions as I sailed through sections feeling very pleased with myself indeed.\n\nOccasionally, when it comes to gaming's more overwrought puzzle experiences, you can sometimes almost hear the designer saying 'look how clever I am'. But the finest puzzle games find a way to allow the player to share in that feeling. Portal, for example, is a game with a brilliantly simple but gloriously clever premise at its heart. It makes us feel intelligent and buoyant when we solve the challenges. It gives us the illusion of agency in discovery, yet still wows us with its design. The same can be said of Linelight, in its own way. Here is a game that delivers moments of pure pleasure. It does so as an aesthetic experience, in the captivating construction of its worlds, and as an arty puzzler yielding precious eureka moments of fulfilment.\n\nI suppose the saddest thing is that it has to end, and you really won't want it to. If I may offer a little advice to those of you who do get it...don't speed through it all at once. Linelight, like all puzzle games really, loses some of its magic in repeat playthroughs, even if there are extra collectibles and hidden puzzles to help prolong the game's life. The first run through will only take you a handful of hours, so savour everything that you can. There are few finer games this year so far.\n\nFull Review:\nhttp://fuzzypixels.net/games/reviews/linelight-review-fine-line/\n\nVideo Review:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LS05l55j30", "timestamp_created": 1487528243, "timestamp_updated": 1487528243, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30021527": {"recommendationid": "30021527", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992733562", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487460842}, "language": "english", "review": "Oh gods, the feels. \n\nLinelight is a story about introverts and friendship, cunningly disguised as a puzzle game with brilliantly intuitive mechanics. This slice of life starring a set of firework sparks learning to cooperate and help each other realize their dreams, really tugs at the heartstrings. 100% guaranteed to get the waterworks flowing. Definitely this year's most likely to win the \"walking in Thomas Was Alone's footsteps\" award.\n\nThe actual game is pretty great too; very Braid like in the \"don't repeat yourself, keep surprising the player with new mechanics\" sense. It sits in that magical space of, \"was that easy, or just super intuitive and I happen to be a genius?\" puzzle space where you're challenged, but the rewards keep flowing. I got actually stuck a grand total of once, very late in the main story game where I'd just plain failed to see the obvious answer. Eventually getting that green star really did make me grin though :)\n\nFinally, Brett the game's creator? Genuinely sweet guy; met him at one of the gaming festivals. This game is already worth it on its own merits, but if you decide to jump in, know that you're also helping to keep alive something genuinely precious in the videogames scene.

The game has a very minimalist style, with bright, contrasting colors and an appealing design, along with some very relaxing music. However, this belies the true genius of the puzzle design. You control a single strand of white light that can manipulate its surroundings by traveling along a straight path to flip switches and unlock doors, revealing more and more of the map as the player progresses. This simple mechanic is pushed to its limits with some truly brilliant puzzle designs that are challenging while not being frustrating to solve. \nIn addition, each new world that the player travels to introduces a novel puzzle mechanic to create myriad opportunities for interesting and fun gameplay. In this aspect it's very reminicent of Braid, but with more of a focus on pure puzzle design than abstract video game meta-narrative. The prospect of getting to see what new mechanics and brain teasers will be presented gives all of the incentive needed to keep pushing through the game, making it very difficult to put down, and even harder to get out of your head.\nAll in all, this game is a criminally underrated knockout.

There is no jumping in this game and you have short levels and an immediate restart button if you die. Yes you can die in this game by colliding with red segments who are enemies and yellow segments who are your friends but you cannot cross each other. This is such a beautiful game with the yellow segment helping you out in puzzles where you have to work together. The puzzles are easy but the level of uniqueness of the setting absolutely will grab you. A must buy for gamers who like minimalistic puzzle games with unique settings.This game has some really soothing and beautiful music too. There is absolutely no dialogue in this game but when my companion segment left me it was really emotional.Also fighting with enemy segments was really fun.This game needs to be experienced by all puzzle fans This is one of the gems that we comeacross once in about 2-3 years. Absolutely phenomenal game. Highly recommended. This game makes you attached to a line segment. It reminds me a lot of Thomas was alone where blocks got you emotionally attached. I have just played an hour and am really loving this game. I am not sure how long it is but I have cleared about 40 levels. There are certain yellow blocks which I think so I have collected all till now and also green blocks which I have seen only one of till now.I am in the Level 2 area as of now and new mechanics have been introduced. Please consider this as a first impressions for now but I do hope all the new worlds would be introducing some new mechanics.I would give it a thumbs up based on my first impressions just because of the totally unique setting.\n\nI have now completed the game and the last world world 6 and the +a and +b were the only worlds where few of the puzzles became a bit tedious to solve due to a mechanic introduced. These levels could have been more intutive. It just got repetitive throughout.

I would have called them crazy. But Linelight is magical like that. It's the Journey of minimalistic puzzle games, and that is an amazing thing.\n\nA huge part of it is how the (beautiful) music provides a counterpoint to the game mechanics: you have these \"enemy\" particles that you'd normally feel like you were trying to avoid or run away from, but the music reminds you that you can harness their behavior to help you out. And each \"world\" in the game culminates with a series of puzzles, where you use the behavior you've learned to run alongside a \"partner\" particle, helping it to move forward, helping it to help you to move forward... and then when you inevitably need to part ways, the music is there to underscore the bittersweet end to the partnership. And throughout it all, sound effects blend with the music seamlessly and in a harmonically pleasing way. It's a masterfully calming and thought-provoking experience, and I don't think I've seen anything like it.\n\nOther commenters have described how the puzzles aren't the most challenging in the world, and there's not a ton of replayability. But in the context of the experience, that's okay. You're not supposed to pull your hair out, you're supposed to savor the experience. That said, I'm sure there will be speedruns if this game takes off, and eventually community level editing will increase the longevity here.\n\nOne minor gripe is that on Mac OS X, at least with my configuration, there were some screen tearing glitches, and some of the lighting effects could use some dithering to reduce visible \"rings\" where the color gradient changes.

My name's in the credits. You may wish to take this review with a grain of salt.\n\nRegardless, Linelight is an exercise in minimalism. Everything takes place on lines. There are no controls besides moving, and two others (to be revealed elsewhere in the game). How many puzzles, then, could someone possibly squeeze out of it?\n\nAbout 300.\n\nOh right, you want to know more about the mechanics. As you can see in the screenshots and trailer, there are switches that move lines, switches that open doors, keys that open doors, enemies (some only move when you do, some move to the beat of the music, and some repeat your previous movements), spools that allow your line to become longer (so that it can press down multiple switches, among other things), and... well, not too much else actually.\n\nYet throughout all this, there is definitely a whole ton of ideas that Brett Taylor has incorporated; he's really covered all the bases with these puzzles. Most puzzles illustrate a neat consequence of the rules (some are \"reprises\", if you will), so there's not very much wasted space. And for most of these puzzles, there is really nothing quite like them in other games. Using a switch to release an enemy, then getting the enemy to toggle the switch so that you can get to the end is something I don't think I've seen in any other game, yet it's one of the first few puzzles in this game. (It's also Brett's favourite puzzle in the game, if I recall correctly).\n\nNote also the amount of polish evident in the game. There is a very abstract nonverbal narrative involving helping other lines through problems (as opposed to the game being just a bunch of line puzzles, which is what some people who haven't played The Witness think of it). The soundtrack is spectacular and catchy (it's still floating around my head after all this time), and enhanced by the subtle percussion that the enemies add. The graphical effects upon entering a level, collecting a star, and so on, just add that tiny bit of prettiness that says \"Yes, the developer put actual effort into this game. Unlike Flow Match or Rolling Shapes.\". (And yes, I will be slagging off both of those games in every single review I post on Steam later. Because those two deserve it.) For a one-and-a-half-year one-person project, this is stunningly top-quality. (Unlike Flow Match, which was also a one-and-a-half-year one-person project, and was a complete piece of garbage that I managed to outdo in a single month.)\n\nSome puzzles are a little finicky, but other than that, I honestly can't see any fault with this game. This is a strong Puzzle Game Of The Year 2017 contender. Or at least, it would be if I gave out game awards.\n\nIf any puzzle game in January deserves money, it's probably this one; especially if you're at all interested in puzzles. (Though that having been said, I feel like the game's still a little too expensive. Then again, I'm harsh with price.)\n\n(Later parts of the game may not be accessible for people with colour-blindness. You may wish to take this into consideration if you're planning on buying the game during its first two weeks or so. This paragraph will be removed when this problem has been fixed.)\n\nHmm, it seems to be quite difficult for me to actually praise good games rather than go nuclear on terrible ones.

Despite high expectations, Linelight still surprised me. \n\nLinelight decides to ditch most gameplay mechanics found in today's games and focus on designing great puzzles. Basically you play as a line segment that moves along other line segments. You need to use the basic mechanics that the game gives you to get past barriers and move your line segment to other lines in order to proceed.\n\nI will admit that the puzzles are a little on the easy side but they are so well designed that I didn't mind. I would classify the early levels as easy and the later levels as easy to moderately difficult. While I wish the levels were a little more challenging I have to say that the game does such a great job using the few mechanics that the game has to create new and interesting puzzles. The game has 300 puzzles (60 being hidden/bonus levels) and every puzzle feels unique.\n\nEven though you can finish most of the puzzles in around a minute or two, Linelight is actually quite long for this type of game. The game has 300 puzzles spread amongst nine worlds. If you don't skip any of the puzzles you encounter I would say that the game will take most people around 6-8 hours to complete. If you want to finish all of the bonus puzzles it would probably take around 8-9 hours mostly due to it being kind of hard to find a lot of the bonus puzzles.\n\nIf you don't really like these type of puzzle games, Linelight is probably not going to be for you. If you like these type of games though I think you will really enjoy Linelight since it is one of the best indie games that I have played in a while. \n\nIf you would like to read my full review check out [url=http://www.geekyhobbies.com/linelight-indie-game-review/] Geeky Hobbies[/url] .", "timestamp_created": 1485882874, "timestamp_updated": 1485882874, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.678659", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29608378": {"recommendationid": "29608378", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001511116", "num_games_owned": 228, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 42, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489682832}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice relaxing puzzle game.

Optional objectives (diamonds you can collect) also give insentive to make it harder yourself, which I love. Secret levels are much more challenging, plus they're harder to find. The mechanics (up to world 5, so far) feel natural, and increase challenge gradually. You're always given room to figure out the mechanic's caveats before it mixes it with a previous one. The puzzles can get pretty complex, due to how each mechanic meshes, but they're still simple to figure out, and the solutions are rarely tedious. \nGameplay is equal parts logic and timing, but never too hard on either. Difficulty always feels reasonable, never out of your control. \n\nA couple times, the game has gone past the boundaries of my 5:4 monitor, but I know that's an uncommon aspect ratio nowadays. Hasn't made it unplayable, though.\nThis is definitely a \"one solution\" puzzle game (if you couldn't figure that out already), so I don't think there's too much in terms of replayability, outside of completing secret levels and collecting all diamonds.

I played the demo on Kongregate and it left me wanting more. This version definitely delivers on that. And it's so cheap, I bought it mostly with funds from my Steam wallet - you really have nothing to lose by getting this game.\n\nYou do need to have a very good perception of spatial relationships though. That is an absolute prerequisite for playing this game.\n\nThe puzzles are presented without instruction or any sort of text; however, the game is very good at introducing new concepts in a way that is immediately obvious, then expands on those concepts to provide further challenges. Later levels will present you with a combination of several different previously-learned mechanics, so you really have to pay attention. A bit of experimentation is sometimes required (and can sometimes be frustrating until you get it), and each of the puzzles gives you a decent sense of accomplishment when you finally figure it out.\n\nOverall it's worth the dollar or so you'd spend on this, so get it if you're looking for a new puzzle game to hold your interest for a while.", "timestamp_created": 1513670862, "timestamp_updated": 1513670862, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541667", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38398950": {"recommendationid": "38398950", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006179923", "num_games_owned": 427, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 69, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513602931}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u982d\u306e\u4f53\u64cd\u306b\u306f\u3068\u3066\u3082\u826f\u3044\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u3057\u305f\n\u81ea\u5206\u307f\u305f\u3044\u306a\u30d0\u30ab\u306a\u982d\u3067\u3082\u7406\u89e3\u51fa\u6765\u3066\u30b5\u30af\u30b5\u30af\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3067\u304d\u308b\u306e\u3067\u304a\u3059\u3059\u3081", "timestamp_created": 1513603041, "timestamp_updated": 1513603041, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518248", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38380828": {"recommendationid": "38380828", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042890558", "num_games_owned": 296, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 53, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513528223}, "language": "english", "review": "So when I first started playing this game, I was really concerned about the overall difficulty. The first several puzzles are very straightforward, and don't really involve too much thought. It takes a bit of tinkering to discover what a mechanic means and how it works, but I can at least say they are introduced in a way that allows you to fully understand each before moving on.\n\nThe game does get harder though, not by too much, but still, it becomes interesting. I'd say it's worth a buy just to see what the last level is.\n\nNow for some more level-specific commentary:\n\n[spoiler]\nBest types of puzzles were the ones where you had to rotate parts of the level such that the arrow buttons were solvable, and the expanding black/white arrow button puzzle. I really enjoyed how well and robustly you used the block rotation mechanic, moving parts out of the way and moving the center of rotation led to a lot of very interesting side effects.\n\nI really liked how the squares and circles were introduced to teach how you would have to handle one set of buttons at a time, but I didn't really like the levels that had both numbered dots and numbered lines. Counting backwards for the lines didn't really add anything to the game in my opinion.\n\nThe moving block levels were nice, and I kind of miss them. I liked the ones where you would manipulate the block and not see it move, and you'd either have to switch back and forth or just keep track of its position in your mind better. I wish you had combined this with the black/white mechanic more and the switches/rotation buttons. That could have led to some really interesting movement puzzles. \n\nThe way I saw it, what was super important about the block is that you would need to figure out how to always solve the outer \"layer\" of buttons first. Adding the black/white mechanic with moving parts would have made this a much more interesting process.\n\nI also wish you had played more with weird block topology, with curved edges. I think that showed up once in one of the lategame double-arrow puzzles, but it would have been neat to have that expanded upon.\n\nI noticed some inconsistencies with block rotation, when it seems a button should have been rotated, but wasn't (big black/white pyramid arrow puzzle). That level was the only case that I found.\n\n[/spoiler]\n\nOverall, a short, cute, puzzle game. The mechanics are a bit simplistic, and are developed very slowly, but they are still developed well.

I don't know if I'm a fan of it as there were moments where I ended up learning an incorrect \"rule\" for a particular button.\nThe most difficult puzzles require you to be able to dissassemble the environment and predict its topology when rearranged, and I did think the more difficult of the puzzles were very good.\nThere is some background music in this, but it occasionaly become distorted and crackly, which is not very pleasant.\nOverall, I would recommend this game, if only for the more difficult 3D thinking puzzles.", "timestamp_created": 1511981777, "timestamp_updated": 1511981777, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37931568": {"recommendationid": "37931568", "author": {"steamid": "76561198238096648", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 77, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511971290}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6700\u540e\u6309\u4e0bPUSH\u3002\u53ef\u4ee5\u53ef\u4ee5\u3002\n\n\u5927\u6982\u6709\u4e2a60\u6765\u5173\u7684\u6837\u5b50\uff0c\u4e0d\u7b97\u96be\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7b26\u53f7\u7684\u610f\u601d\u5c31\u53ef\u4ee5\u8f7b\u677e\u4e00\u4e9b\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1511970967, "timestamp_updated": 1511970967, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37931239": {"recommendationid": "37931239", "author": {"steamid": "76561198373145457", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 90, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512794996}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e00\u6b3e\u5f88\u4f11\u95f2\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u540c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5f00\u53d1\u5546\u51fa\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u6e38\u620f\u4e00\u6837\u3002\n\u4e00\u5f00\u59cb\u8fd8\u5f88\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u5230\u4e86\u540e\u9762\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u201c\u8fd9\u89e3\u4e0d\u5f00\u554a\uff01\u201d \u201c\u54ce\uff1f\u8fd9\u91cc\u8fd8\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u6309\u94ae\uff1f\uff1f\uff1f\u201d\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u57fa\u672c\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u5f88\u7b80\u5355\u7684\uff08\u6ed1\u7a3d\uff09\n\u96be\u5ea6\u6709\u4e9b\u50cf\u7eaa\u5ff5\u7891\u8c37\uff0c\u5c31\u662f\u4f60\u778e\u8d70\uff0c\u7adf\u7136\u8fd8\u80fd\u901a\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\n[spoiler] \u7136\u800c\u6211\u4e0d\u4f1a\u544a\u8bc9\u4f60\u4eec\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u5173\u662f\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u5f00\u76842333 \u53ea\u8981\u4ed4\u7ec6\u770b\u6210\u5c31\u7684\u540d\u5b57\u5c31\u4f1a\u77e5\u9053\u8be5\u600e\u4e48\u6441 [/spoiler]\n\u7bad\u5934\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u89c4\u5219\uff1a\u6cbf\u7740\u7bad\u5934\u6307\u5411\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u524d\u8fdb\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u7ed5\u5f62\u72b6\u4e00\u5708\u7136\u540e\u6309\u4e0b\u540e\u9762\u7684\u6309\u94ae\n\u81f3\u4e8e\u53cc\u7bad\u5934\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u6478\u7d22\u51fa\u89c4\u5f8b\u7684\u53ef\u4ee5\u544a\u4f60\u4eec\u662f\u600e\u4e48\u56de\u4e8b\n\u6cbf\u7740\u53cc\u7bad\u5934A\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u524d\u8fdb\uff0c\u5230\u8fbe\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b26\u5408\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u6309\u94aeB\u65f6\uff08\u6ce8\u610f\u9ed1\u767d\u5e95\u8272\u6309\u94ae\uff09\uff0c\u9075\u5faa\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6309\u94ae\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u518d\u524d\u8fdb\u5230\u6309\u94aeC\u5904\uff08\u6309\u94aeC\u6ee1\u8db3\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e3a\uff1a\u4e0e\u6309\u94aeB\u989c\u8272\u76f8\u540c\uff09\u3002\n\u6bd4\u5982>  |>>   <\uff0c\u6309\u4e0b\u987a\u5e8f\u5c31\u662f213\uff0c\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684 |>> >  << > < \u6309\u4e0b\u987a\u5e8f\u5c31\u662f15234 [spoiler] \u4e0d\u5f97\u4e0d\u627f\u8ba4\u8fd9\u79cd\u73a9\u53cc\u7bad\u5934\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f88\u53cd\u667a233 [/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1511970150, "timestamp_updated": 1511970150, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37930216": {"recommendationid": "37930216", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040835910", "num_games_owned": 194, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 99, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511966929}, "language": "english", "review": "PUSH has you doing exactly what the title suggests -- pushing buttons.

And at the same time, like with klocki, you must also figure out the mechanics or rules of the button patterns, or the entire pattern resets. This leads to a sort of investigative trial-and-error gameplay that just feels genius when all put together (how do people even design puzzles like this?). Again like klocki, the game starts almost trivially easy and smoothly transitions to more tricky puzzling, especially as the different mechanics combine together.\n\nThe whole experience feels like playing through a visual-spacial, mental-rotation, intelligence test. But unlike the IQ tests, the game also feels rewarding and soothing with its abstract visual design, soothing music, and forgiving gameplay that rewards experimentation. It's also very affordable, like $1? If you appreciate simple games with unique gameplay, I would definitely recommend giving this game a try. \n\n(One note though: I would recommend playing through the game by actually trying to understand the rules of each mechanic and pattern. Just like with other finite puzzle games on PC, it is possible to solve each puzzle by randomly guessing, but that kind of playstyle doesn't really reward you for seeing how each button is connected in sequence.)\n", "timestamp_created": 1510897374, "timestamp_updated": 1510897374, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36540057": {"recommendationid": "36540057", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076659464", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 77, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510782329}, "language": "russian", "review": "=))", "timestamp_created": 1510783340, "timestamp_updated": 1510783340, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454545", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36526798": {"recommendationid": "36526798", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144062508", "num_games_owned": 265, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1515916377}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u771f\u7684\u662f\u975e\u5e38\u559c\u6b22Maciej Targoni\u548cMichal Pawlowski\u505a\u7684\u89e3\u8c1c\u5c0f\u6e38\u620f\nHOOK\u3001klocki\uff0cZenge\u3001Art Of Grabvity\n\u8fd9\u6b21\u4ed6\u4eec\u5408\u4f5c\u51fa\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u6b3ePUSH\uff0c\u4ee5\u6309\u6309\u94ae\u6765\u89e3\u8c1c\u7684\u5c0f\u6e38\u620f\u3002\n\n\u8bf4\u5b9e\u8bdd\u3002\u3002\u524d\u671f\u771f\u7684\u5f88\u843d\u667a\uff0c\u672c\u4ee5\u4e3a\u50cfWayOut\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u53ea\u8981\u5408\u5e76\u540c\u7c7b\u9879(x)\u5373\u53ef\uff0c123456\uff0c654321\u4e5f\u5f88\u8822\uff0c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5207\u6362\uff0c\u62fc\u56fe\uff0c\u518d\u5230\u4e00\u8fb9\u63a7\u5236\u53e6\u4e00\u8fb9\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ea2\u8272\u65b9\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u8fd0\u52a8\u4ee3\u66ff\u9f20\u6807\u70b9\u51fb\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u6574\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c0f\u8c1c\u9898\u6210\u5927\u8c1c\u9898\u3002\n\u8fd9\u90fd\u53ea\u662f\u7e41\u7410\u800c\u5df2\uff0c\u4e0d\u662f\u89e3\u8c1c\u3002\n\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u524d\u671f\u592a\u5bb9\u6613\u529d\u9000\u4e86\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u5c31\u8fd9\u6837\u4e86\uff0c\u6d6a\u8d39\u9f20\u6807\u70b9\u51fb\u5bff\u547d\u3002\n\n\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u540e\u534a\u90e8\u5206\u5374\u5b9e\u5728\u662f\u60ca\u8273\u5230\u6211\u4e86\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u201c\u5168\u9ed1Y\u578b\u201d\u9700\u8981\u70b9\u597d\u51e0\u4e0b\u624d\u80fd\u5f00\u542f\u8c1c\u9898\u7684\u90a3\u4e00\u5173\uff0c\u771f\u7684\u60ca\u8273\u5230\u6211\u4e86\u3002\n\u62bd\u5c49\u5f0f\u7684\u63a8\u5165\u63a8\u51fa\uff0c\u5e73\u9762\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u548c\u8f6c\u52a8\u3002\n\n\u524d\u671f\u843d\u667a\u7684\u89e3\u8c1c\u62d6\u6c93\u6765\u7684\u70e6\u8e81\u611f\u4e00\u626b\u800c\u5149\uff0c\n\u751a\u81f3\u5728THANKS FOR PLAYING\u51fa\u73b0\u65f6\u8fd8\u610f\u72b9\u672a\u5c3d\u3002\n[spoiler] \u7ed3\u679c\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u4e2a\u8c1c\u9898\u6beb\u65e0\u5934\u7eeax[/spoiler] \n\n\u611f\u89c9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e2a\u82b1\u6837\u8fd8\u80fd\u51fa\u5f88\u591a\u5f88\u591a\u7684\u8c1c\u9898\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01\n\n\u671f\u5f85\u4e0b\u4e00\u4f5c\uff01\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1510732474, "timestamp_updated": 1512135104, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36511590": {"recommendationid": "36511590", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154808252", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 57, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510666219}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't know some complain about \"trial-and-error\" problems - it's logical, and when something doesn't work, there's a good reason why.

[i]Aller \u00e0 l'essentiel[/i] doit vraisemblablement \u00eatre leur mot d'ordre, ce qui revient en l'occurence \u00e0 privil\u00e9gier le gameplay. Lequel se r\u00e9sume en un mot, un seul : [i][b]PUSH[/b][/i]. De fait, il s'agit de pousser (ou plut\u00f4t d'appuyer) sur diverses dalles, sur lesquelles se trouvent le plus souvent des symboles : des dessins, des num\u00e9rotations ou encore des sortes de fl\u00e8ches. Pour esp\u00e9rer terminer les 67 niveaux qu'il compte, il vous faudra enfoncer toutes ces dalles dans un ordre particulier, qu'on vous laisse d'ailleurs le soin de d\u00e9couvrir.\n\nEt c'est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment l\u00e0 o\u00f9 les choses se corsent, pour deux raisons. La premi\u00e8re, vous vous en apercevrez vite, rebutera bon nombre de joueurs : rien (j'ai bien dit [u]rien[/u]) ne vous est expliqu\u00e9 quant au fonctionnement des m\u00e9canismes qui entrent en jeu. La seconde d\u00e9coule du nombre de ces m\u00e9canismes, au point qu'il me serait par trop laborieux d'en faire un expos\u00e9 \u00e0 la fois exhaustif et intelligible. A d\u00e9faut, je me contenterai de vous dire que l'ordre dans lequel il faut appuyer sur ces dalles peut \u00eatre fonction de plusieurs param\u00e8tres : la croissance ou la d\u00e9croissance de leur num\u00e9rotation, l'alternance de couleurs (noir et blanc), la correspondance des formes, leur orientation,... et j'en oublie s\u00fbrement.\n\nIl vous sera en outre possible de faire glisser ou pivoter certaines parties du d\u00e9cor, ce qui pr\u00e9sente l'avantage de r\u00e9v\u00e9ler des dalles auparavant cach\u00e9es. Dit comme \u00e7a, j'ai bien conscience que le fonctionnement de toutes ces m\u00e9caniques puisse vous para\u00eetre quelque peu obscur. Pourtant, tout est tr\u00e8s simple, en v\u00e9rit\u00e9. Et d'une difficult\u00e9 tr\u00e8s abordable, puisqu'il se boucle en une paire d'heures environ. Toujours est-il qu'il propose un gameplay ing\u00e9nieux, d'autant plus qu'il est compr\u00e9hensible sans qu'on nous donne la moindre explication. Le tout pour un prix d\u00e9fiant toute concurrence.\n\n[h1]Verdict : 4,5/5 - Excellent, \u00e0 acheter les yeux ferm\u00e9s ![/h1]\n\n[code]Vous avez aim\u00e9 cette \u00e9valuation ?

As you get further into the game, rules come up that prevent you from simply pressing the buttons in whichever order you please, slightly increasing the difficulty. That much is fun.\nHowever, there's one glaring issue that I wish I could overlook and that's the audio. The audio, a few levels in, begins to double over (two clicks being played on top of another instead of the one click) and pop with staticky crackles that don't fit with the feel of the rest of the game. About 5 or 10 levels after I first noticed the sound issues, they got so bad (sometimes tripling up, or even more) that I couldn't ignore it any more and had to close the game because the noise was so unpleasant. This was really unfortunate because I was really looking forward to this game and play these games to relax! The audio issues were just so bad that I was getting more stressed out; and I usually so look forward to the really sharp audio editing in these games. :(\nI would gladly change my opinion of this if only the audio problem was fixed.", "timestamp_created": 1508900949, "timestamp_updated": 1508900949, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533377", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35960311": {"recommendationid": "35960311", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041456395", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 55, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508824097}, "language": "english", "review": "Same atmosphere as klocki.

The concept is extremely simple: Press all the blue buttons to finish the level.  That sounds incredibly simple, but the game introduces different types of buttons which must be pressed in a specific order according to a rule set.  The game does an absolutely fantastic job of teaching you the different rules and gradually building up to ridiculously complex puzzles.  They start with the simplest possible puzzle involving that symbol, and then give you another simple puzzle that requires a deeper understanding of the rule, and so on.  If I have one complaint about the game, it is that they introduce a lot of mechanics that are swiftly dropped and never used again, which is kind of disappointing.  Unlike Klocki, there's no great final puzzle where everything comes together unfortunately.  That being said, the puzzle do get increasingly difficult as the game goes on, and the final puzzles were such brain melters that I think that if you showed the solutions to someone, it would be completely impossible to reverse engineer an understanding of the mechanics.

Each of the 60+ levels is about pushing buttons situated on an 3D shape in a particular order.

Further mechanics include among others panning and rotating particular parts of the 3D shape you are working with, and multilple dimensions with different 3D shapes to work with in a single level.\n\nI'd say that the learning curve is pretty flat in the first 20 levels but after that, puzzles become increasingly complex while still introducing new puzzle mechanics. I had great fun solving the remaining two thirds of the puzzles and they do provide for a satisfactory mental challenge.\n\nFinally, given all the above I do not hesitate to recommend this game to any fan of puzzle games.

However, it is safe to say that every puzzle kept things fresh until the very end. And the fact that previously introduced mechanics meet once again in the later puzzles, adds a layer of depth that is missing from several other puzzle games.\n\nI can't really find something bad to say gameplay-wise about the game, other than the fact that some levels were a bit tedious (to name an example, some with the multi-screen portals), but there are only a couple of levels like that, and said mechanics don't ever come back.

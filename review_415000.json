But first I need to say, it is a video tutorial and you can find this videos on Youtube but the creator spend so much time on it. And every week he update this program. Every week he adds more video tutorials. In the first tutorials, you add basics about Unity. And after this, he teach more advanced things. Also you can drop Steam Collections Cards and I think it is awesome. If you want to learn Unity as well you need to buy it. And I must say, the creator everyday help you in the Unity forums. If you have trouble with this program or if you want to ask him something, you can tell it from Unity forums and he will answer.

The system created makes it extremely easy to customise weapons, items, enemies. You can also create and customise melee weapons, destructible objects and now videos to make AI for non-player-characters is possible.

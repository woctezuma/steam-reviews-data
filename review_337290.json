They can be less time consuming and more straight forward to create in general. The problem with many of them is that retro games often carry over the shortcomings of their era of video games.\n\nThe early first person shooter era of games like DOOM, Wolfenstein and Duke Nukem are well crafted games in terms of aesthetic and design, but most feel janky to move and control by the standards of today.\n\nThe developer of Still Not Dead wisely realizes this and created their game to make use of the aesthetic of retro titles, with the enhancements of today's industry.\n\nMovement in Still Not Dead is smooth and responsive, there are no slow downs and the game feels frantic. You move quickly but enemies do as well. The jumping mechanic adds a bit of extra layer of strategy to come encounters if you are able to hop over a fence/low wall.\n\nThe combat is very well crafted. You start with a decent pistol but can also purchase more weapons during the levels. Each weapon packs a ton of punch and is used differently enough that you need to change up your strategies a bit when you get something new. There is also a melee system that has a lot of weight behind it. While limited to one button attacks, each slice and hit with your weapon is very satisfying.\n\nThere is a variety of enemies in the game both melee and ranged focused. Each looks completely different and has it's own attack pattern. Ranged enemies will have different types of attacks and patterns to deal with, while melee enemies, despite all doing close up damage, will also attack in specific ways instead of all of them simply running towards you.\n\nThe levels feature an upgrade/debuff system. Each time you clear a section, you are granted either a bonus or curse, alternating between levels. Most of these are more than just stat buffs with some fundamentally changing how you will have to play the game during that run. Things like less line-of-sight, exploding bullets, randomized weapons and plenty more are welcome additions to the experience.\n\nThe game is a rogue-lite, meant to be played multiple times. The maps are procedurally generated but usually get laid out pretty well. There are certain times where it looked like I could fit through an opening but it ended up being too small. Other than that, no major problems with the levels.\n\nThis is a pretty solid experience, especially for an Early Access game. Already worth the $5.00 price-tag and I'm looking forward to what the release version will be.\n\n\nIf you found this review helpful, feel free to follow my curator page. http://steamcommunity.com/groups/iampattyjack#curation", "timestamp_created": 1508882042, "timestamp_updated": 1508882042, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509296", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35635361": {"recommendationid": "35635361", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970563925", "num_games_owned": 924, "num_reviews": 94, "playtime_forever": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507719052}, "language": "english", "review": "PRETTY PRETTY GOOD \n\nFor $5 can't go wrong.", "timestamp_created": 1507716534, "timestamp_updated": 1507716534, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.645341", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35620484": {"recommendationid": "35620484", "author": {"steamid": "76561198290515210", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1743, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1515532036}, "language": "english", "review": "Really fun game.

After seeing him to play this game I finally decided to give it a go and I must say that it was well worth it.\n\nThe player is thrown into Doom-like environment where they must search for food, gold, weapons, items and ammo while fighting against hordes of monsters. Not only that but you only have about two minutes before [strike]Error Sans[/strike] Death starts chasing you. The exits won't open until you've killed a set amount of enemies so you'll better plan your actions accordingly... or rely on a huge amount of dumb luck to not end up dead.\n\nThe unique mechanic of the game is a blessing/curse system. At the beginning of each stage you'll get to choose one blessing (or curse) to either aid your battle or hinder it. You can also risk it by rerolling the blessings/curses (at the cost of losing health) or letting the game choose one for you instead. This not only makes the game more challenging but also gives the game plenty of replay value. The blessings/curses can dramatically change the way you play the game so you won't be having identical playthroughs anytime soon.\n\nFinding different ways to play the game is fun but the game still has some issues. Some weapons are clearly better than the others (I'm looking at you, Hell's Hand) which means depending on the weapons you find you either blaze through the levels with ease or struggle to finish the first stages of your run.\n\nSome blessings/curses can really screw you over without you even noticing. For example, there's a curse that halves the speed of your bullets but it also halves the range of your crossbow. There's a blessing that makes the explosions three times bigger but it also makes kamikaze zombies more likely to hurt you. Learning the pros/cons of each trait will help you plan your runs better, but I still feel like luck plays a huge role in whether you'll succeed or not. (This also applies to finding the right weapons in the stages.)\n\nThere are also some minor bugs left in the game. There was a time when I ran through an exit that was floating above the ground and I had to time my 3x higher jump to get through it. Once I was smacked by a spike ball before I even got placed on a level and had any time to react. Sometimes it's also hard to tell whether there are enemies chasing you but that mainly happens with the zombies who possess little threat and are easy to dispose. The enemies/levels also lack some variety but the developer has promised that more will be coming soon.\n\nOverall, while I have some nitpicks with the game it's still a blast to play. The soundtrack is great and gets you pumped, the game runs without issues (apart from Steam notifications glitching out at times) and seeing the world turn dark when Death appears really fills you with dread. Yes, the game is still in early access but unlike the most \"early access games\" this one actually feels almoust complete. And unlike the most \"early access game \"developers\"\" this one seems to genuinely care about the game and interacting with people without trying to sue the crap out of them. That if anything makes this game stand out from the rest.\n\nI paid 5\u20ac for this game and I felt like I got my money's worth during my first run. I'm truly looking forward to seeing what the complete product will be like. Until then, I'm grabbing whatever gun I can find and go running at demon hordes pretending to be on the quest to avenge my pet rabbit.\n\nGo buy this game.

This game is an interesting idea which, while a bit lackluster at the moment, is great because it explores a mechanic that it seems most other games in the indie genre have simply placed onto their games as more of a gentle push to the objective rather than a threat. That mechanic is the \"time limit mechanic\". To put it simply, after a certain increment of time (short enough that you'd be able to put a suit on provided that you don't have to redo anything, but that's about as long as it gets [actually probably around 3 minutes from a guess]), \"death\" appears, who is a large black skull that will chase you at a speed that the player can barely outrun, and because death does a lot of damage, you know that it's time to haul ass when you see the sky go red. However, you can't just sprint to the nearest exit: you need to kill a set number of enemies before that can happen! So off you go, pumping lead into zombies and floaty skulls and whatnot. That about does it for the core focus of the game. To aid you in your quest to do the aforementioned, you can buy guns using currency which can drop from enemies or is on the ground in large heaps. Usually ammo for guns is limited, so you're going to need to buy ammo as well, meaning you need to keep juggling your priorities. Regardless, if both of these options are unavailable and you've run out of shot, you have a melee attack (and using a certain blessing, can regenerate ammo for your gun). Now, blessings and curses. After each area, you are either given the option of choosing a blessing or a curse in a 1 0 1 0 1 pattern. Blessings, as the name would suggest, aid your quest. Curses disrupt it. I think that's good on a summary. Let's talk pros and cons:\n\n Pros:\n+Shooting is fun.\n+The death mechanic really lays down the heat and forces the player to act fast.\n+Blessings and curses usually (more on it) distinctly help your game or negatively impact them. They're not just pointless descriptions that seem to have a sort of \"Oh shit what else can I put here\" vibe to them either, they all have a genuine and noticeable impact on the game. Examples: There is a blessing which increases your jump height by 3 times, allowing the player to vault most obstacles. There is a curse which fogs your vision and decreases your view distance, making it difficult to judge the number of enemies surrounding you.\n+Visuals are nice.\n+Music does a splendid job of conveying this sort of stressed out vibe as well as being action packed (I would definitely buy this OST).\n+Environment plays a good role in the game and makes shooting more enjoyable.\n\nCons:\n-Enemy variety is nil. There are only 6 at the moment (but the developer is planning to add more, so be patient).\n-The reference to \"usually\" when talking about the blessing/curse system. It would seem that certain blessings or curses, while they still have a distinct impact on the game, find themselves on the edge of the coin, not on either side. Examples: There is a blessing which makes explosions larger, including ones made by these kamikaze enemies which will hurt you.\nThere is also a curse which remixes your loadout each level, and while my good weapons might have suddenly been replaced with something that has limited ammo and the effectiveness of an electric toothbrush, I have occasionally spawned in with the better weapons in the game while full on ammo.\n-Enemies can be a little retarded. Zombies can be outrun while walking at a snail's pace and they won't hit you, as well as not being able to hit you if you hop onto a fence (I suggest the dev make the zombies move a tad bit faster or have longer reach, as well as being able to slowly vault over or onto a fence that you're standing on).\n-The need to juggle ammo and the need for new weapons is challenging, but ammo is usually more demanding, making the player put all their currency into ammo and never really seeing much of the other guns. This can be remedied by a blessing which makes melee kills give ammo, but it's still a starter-revolver-fest. This could be remedied if on each level there was one free gun.\n-This is a niche complaint, but the font is a bit tacky.\n\nAll in all, it's a good experience, especially for $5 bucks. The gunplay is satisfying and the experience requires that the player be on their toes. I wasn't really expecting something this good from a single dev.\nWhile there are improvements to be made, the final verdict:\n\n78/100\n\nEspecially for $5, the gunplay is satisfying and the experience requires that the player be on their toes.", "timestamp_created": 1504322289, "timestamp_updated": 1504322480, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552529", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34484457": {"recommendationid": "34484457", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036715107", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503677323}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty good game even if its not my type.\n", "timestamp_created": 1503676844, "timestamp_updated": 1503676844, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527559", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34469226": {"recommendationid": "34469226", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007507154", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508794608}, "language": "english", "review": "Good fun time, challenging and varied enough to warrant coming back periodically.

Your task: kill them, take their loot, eat their vegetables, buy bullets and better weapons, and make for the exit before Death arrives to offer you a sample of this new cookie recipe he's been working on. Between levels you receive either a blessing (a small buff or helpful effect) or curse (a small nerf or harmful effect) alternately. It's a cool system, though I mostly find myself letting the game select at random in exchange for extra cash. Once I can manage to survive longer than 2 or 3 levels this will probably amount to something, right now they represent fairly minor tweaks.\n\nMovement is smooth and desperately fast, allowing use of environment to evade the hordes. Learn to love your jumpable walls, and the precise timing to mash 'E' so you can buy ammo without breaking stride. There's a primitive \"radar\" map in the lower corner to help orient yourself and lead you to objectives, which you'll need because otherwise there's not a whole lot of detail to steer by. \n\nGraphics consist of these funky, retro sprites (or at least they're styled as such). Enemy and item designs aren't hugely detailed, but they are very distinct and read well from a distance. My personal favorite's the giant spiders with inverted crosses. In-game sound is bare-bones but excellent\u2014enemies have their own audio cues to let you know when something's gnawing on your junk, and the soundtrack captures both the era this game's referencing and the frantic nature of play.\n\nNot sure if this can realistically be called roguelite\u2014so far I've seen no inkling of progression from one run to the next, which is something I'd expect from the genre. Rest of the elements are there though\u2014permadeath, map randomization, etc. Maybe progression's coming, this is early access after all.\n\nSo yeah. 5 bucks for a nice little panic-inducing manic FPS.

Also, it's not really stated in the description at all but the aimming is old school doom-like.  As in, you can only look left and right.\n\nCurrrently, from what I can tell.  The game's weapons are locked to levels.   Meaning, after hitting floor/level 4 or 5 you finally start to see an ak47, while on level 1 or 2 all you pretty much see for weapons is your starting revolver, a crossbow, an uzi, and maybe a shotgun if you're really lucky.\n\nAlso, the blessings and curses system need some tweaking.  Each level you start of with ether a blessing or a curse(they alternate each level, first level at the start is always a blessing). Reason being it seems like the best way to play it is get the runner gunner and the infinite ammo when your under 20hp blessings and just mow everything down with ether an uzi or an ak47 and pretty much become a glass cannon.\n\nThe weapons need some tweaking too, as the rifle does doesn't seem useful at all since the pacing of the game means you need to haul ass and run since death comes for you after a little while each level.  And the rifle seems to be ment for picking off targets long range.  This seems good in theory, but in use it's worthless since when you get spotted by an enemy they move and the bullet speed is a factor.  (Low rate of fire + slow base bullet speed= why pick it?)\n\nThe basics are here, but it needs quite a bit of tweeking.   If this was $1.99 I could recommend this game since it's in early access and will most likely be changing.  but for almost $5 usd (it was $4.77 for me after taxes), I can not recommend this game when so many older games give a lot more content for almost the same ammount of money.  Being as this is a 2d pixel game, graphics are not an issue here, it's the game play that is.\n\nAlso, I have refunded this game.  Mainly due to the lack of the description in the shop text of how the aimming works and I did not enjoy it in it's current form.\n\nIf I could make one suggestion to the dev(s), that would be have the crystals be able to change into ANY weapon/item instead of what just can appear on that level since you only get so many of them a run unless you take a blessing to get 25 more.   Even then, there is no telling what you'll get.  It could be something from that level or something 5 levels ahead making that choice to use it now or save it for later all the more tempting, because right now, it's not worth fighting you're way over to a weapon on the earilyer levels if you already know what can drop on each level after around 10-20 runs of the game.  This would be an easy change that would massively improve the game.  Also, if it's a weapon, change it only to a weapon instead of an item or a weapon.\n\nTL;DR = hold off on buying it, wait for release to see if it improves.

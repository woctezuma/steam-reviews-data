I was provided with a beta key during that period, but I purchased the game post-release and have been given no incentive or consideration to write this review.\n\nTL;DR: The game is fun. Buy it.\n\nWhen I describe Lupinball to people, I say \"It's sorta like Duck Game, but with wolves and fireballs instead of ducks and weapons.\" It gives you a bit of an idea what to expect.\n\nLupinball is a primarily 2-4 player game (with a single player mode) where each player controls a different bipedal wolf. These wolves collect energy icons that pop up on the field. Up to 3 can be held at once. When one is picked up, the wolf can deploy a shield for a short time, with the shield lasting longer with more spheres. With three, the wolf can deploy a magic fireball. The object of the game is to survive by dodging opposing fireballs while launching yours to hit your opponents. There are also items that pop up from time to time to twist gameplay a bit, like orb blockers (prevent opponents from using shields/fireballs) and one that flips the stage upside-down but leaves controls intact.\n\nThis is where the Duck Game comparison comes in. One hit, and you're dead. Once all but one wolf are dead, the stage shifts to the next and the match continues until one player wins enough rounds to win the game. There's a bit less humor in the death scenes compared to Duck Game, but the overall game is very light-hearted, with hilarious loading screen messages relating \"fun facts\" about wolves, and the characters are very charming. (Bart is best sheep.) Plus, ALL THE WOLF PUNS.\n\nUnlike Duck Game, there are no platforms or jumping. Levels aren't completely random either; each player selects a stage, and the selected stages are played in a random order. When they are complete, players then select additonal stages, and the game continues until a winner is decided. I like this freedom of choice, but I would love to see an \"uninterrupted random mode\" implemented as an option in the future.\n\nThe game handles really well. Movement is smooth (except on stages with elements like wind and ice where impeded movement is the point) and you can even adjust the trajectory of the fireballs for a split second after initiating launch. Each map is unique, and offers its own obstacles, be it slowed down movement (Gailes, Wolphone, Pawcific Ocean) or changing elements like shifting walls and temporary darkness (Wolffer, Moon Estate), to name only a few examples. Gameplay itself is extremely simple; with only movement, shield and fireball launch as your only controls, your mastery of the game will rely on experience more than learning any complicated combos or controls.\n\nYou can customize the match options (points to win, friendly fireballs, item appearance, among others) to create the match setting that suits you and your friends best. There are even accessibility options, such as a reduced flash mode and a color-blind mode. And of course, there is online play.\n\nSingle player mode flips the rules a bit. You're alone on a map, and you're firing constant fireballs to fill the stage up. You have 30 seconds (extended with each fireball you launch) to keep firing. One hit from one of your own fireballs, and you're out. Once time is up or you die, you are taken to the next stage, repeated until you've played all of the maps in a row. Your score is the amount of fireballs you launched in every stage, totaled up, and there is a global leaderboard for the best score. It's pretty fun, though I would like to see an AI single player mode implemented where you do battle against 1-3 computer opponents.\n\nDev support is top-notch. The Discord server is active and the community, while young, is already very friendly. Devs hang out there and are dedicated to improving this game and making it a fun experience.\n\nAll in all, for 10 bucks (I paid 9 with launch discount), it's a pretty solid game. I think it could earn its place among the many other popular couch multiplayers.", "timestamp_created": 1503160015, "timestamp_updated": 1503160015, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497124", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34339798": {"recommendationid": "34339798", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030215999", "num_games_owned": 614, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1048, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 154, "last_played": 1515246678}, "language": "english", "review": "Simple, Basic, Fun\n\nI would totally recommend this to anyone with a few friends who just want to have a bunch of stupid fun. This game doesn't take you on an adventure, it's not trying to be an experience, but what it is is just pure fun. The controls are tight and easy to learn; move with the analog stick, A to shoot fireballs, and B to generate shields... That's it. The multitude of \"on pick up use\" power ups and differing stage layouts gives a lot of diversity that is fun to revisit time and again.\n\nMy only cons with the game is that there is a single player mode, but it's just a \"Try to beat the high score\" gameplay I'm not a huge fan of, and I'd like to see a wider variety of characters and stages added over time. I know there's only so many colors available to make each fireball unique from another player's, but, perhaps, two toned or multicolored fireballs? And I'd like there to be a option to exclude certain stages from random selection. As fun as the game is there is a stage or two I don't, personally, like. Also a pause menu when playing online with friends (not necessarily with randos).\n\nThose very minor gripes aside, I still think this game is worth your time and it's cheap enough that it's an easy impulse buy.

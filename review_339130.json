More games need to do this! It's nice to have that option for those moments when you've got no time for a game's BS. The soundtrack fit the setting which I appreciated. My two main cons were the length and the voice acting. Novak's voice sounded fine to me, but Powell's voice was so robotic and cheesy. It was distracting how bad it was. Regarding the length, I only clocked in about 2 hours total. I was expecting 3-4 hours. The story felt rushed, and I wanted more explanation. What were the aliens'/robots' intentions? What did that one dead alien look like? Questions like that. I'm also tired of this sci-fi trope. Humans crash on a planet and find aliens who lure people in to destroy them. If anyone is interested in a better sci-fi point and click game, I'd recommend J.U.L.I.A.: Among the Stars.\n\nRegardless, I think Morningstar was a decent game for the price I paid (about $1.60).

You're a space merchant by the name of Powell who has crash-landed on the desert planet Deadrock. Since your captain, Novak, is injured, you must find a way to heal him and fix the ship on your own by braving the desert landscape in search for the necessary parts. However, there's more to Deadrock than meets the eye, as you soon come across another ship that has met the same fate as yours and slowly begin to uncover the fate that befell it and its crew. Will you share that same fate?\n\nLike [i]J.U.L.I.A.[/i], the mystery is what keeps you going in this game. The puzzles themselves are not that difficult to solve and there's the usual amount of backtracking. Unlike [i]J.U.L.I.A.[/i] however, this game is short (it took me less than 2 hours to complete), probably shorter than it should be to thoroughly explore the mystery surrounding Deadrock and get the full picture of what happened to the crew of the Armstrong (the other ship you come across). In particular, as you get closer to the ending of the game an event occurs that suggests one of them might have (recently) uncovered the secret of Deadrock but nothing comes of it; it's another mystery that will probably never be solved.\n\nVoiceover in this game ranges from bad to acceptable but the humor makes it tolerable. If there was a soundtrack to this game, it wasn't particularly memorable as I don't recall it. From the technical standpoint, I was fearful at first by the barebones main menu that featured no settings to adjust (no display/graphics options, no keybindings) and my fears were later justified as I played: the keyboard is useless in this game; I couldn't even use the Esc key to switch between the ingame menu and the game itself. Even the mouse felt a little underconfigured for my tastes, as gameplay comes down to using the left-click at all times (can't even right-click to backtrack).\n\nIn short, if you have a couple of hours of free time and are looking for a point-and-click space adventure, [i]Morningstar: Descent to Deadrock[/i] fits the bill. However, I would recommend you wait for a discount in order to get it. I myself bought it during Steam's 2016 Winter Sale at 75% off.

There was some hope of decoding an alien language toward the end, but all you really have to decode is on and off which I figured out by looking at the first alien console.  So, it didn't take much brain power.  \n\nConsidering the dearth of puzzles, I thought about regarding it more along the lines of interactive fiction.  But it's just all stuff we've seen countless times before there.  I was particularly reminded of the episode of Battlestar Galactica where Starbuck crash lands on an alien world and has to hot wire a Cylon drone to get away.\n\nI would like more sci fi adventure games, but I'm not going to give this a good review just because of the genres it's a part of.", "timestamp_created": 1474876209, "timestamp_updated": 1474876317, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485747", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25694254": {"recommendationid": "25694254", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074312453", "num_games_owned": 670, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474814249}, "language": "english", "review": "Surprisingly good.

I strongly appreciate how the protagonist does not try to find the backstories and home addresses of every goddamn alien or how to kill them, and simply tries to find a way home. That being said, the protagonist is the ultimate Jesus MacGyver of putting things together, he'd probably be able to clear Dark Souls 3 with a thread and a stick.\n\nPlaying through the game again, and hooooooly fuck how much the game has improved. Art, sound, voice, gameplay, these things took steroids and then some. Absolutely amazing to take this trip down memory lane again.

into gaming, it is the game that has had the most impact on me; the story, graphics and feel of it were just superb.\n\nLater when I found that it had been rematered for PC I could bareley contain my emotion.\nWhile playing it I just thought it would be just a better graphics and sound remaster, but holy hell was I wrong, it is sooo much more!\nThe story is expanded and many issues and things that felt wrong or weir in the original game are gone replaced with new and better ones.\nOnly bad thing is the voice acting which in my opinion the original one was way superior, and the face images for Capatain Novak and the computer in the original were awesome too, miss them in this one.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone, and I will probably get another 5 or 6 replays just like I got from the original flash game.\n\n\nSo I leave here waiting for a sequel or a prequel (only thing that pisses me off is not geting to know all of the armstrongs crew names)", "timestamp_created":

For all those short narrative focused games on steam  that just bore your pants off, this one nails it.

All puzzles can be solved by using plane logic (unlike so many other point and clicks), so they are easy enough.

You progress fast and get to see new things. The downside of this is that it's pretty short. It took me 2 and a half hours to complete. However I didn't get stuck much, so you might get some more time out of it. \nI'd recommend getting it on sale (like I did :) ) then you most likely won't regret buying it if you enjoy a nice little Sci-Fi Short Story. \nOn a last note: Some review mentioned bad voice acting. Initially I would have agreed regarding the captain. But as soon as I put 1+1 together the \"bad\" voice acting actually added some charm to the character, seeing that he's a Russian or some other Eastern European speaking english in a flat and bored tone.

will say, I was very pleasantly surprised by this title.\n\nI'm a fan of the Point & Click genre in general.  If you've played a few games in the genre, you know what to expect; you'll wander around, collect some items, try to combine them in logical ways, and when that doesn't work, try to combine them with anything interactable.  You might encounter some logical leaps, or other mini-puzzles along the way.  If that's not for you, stay away from this title.\n\nThere's lots of this type of game available on Steam, though, so how does this one in particular stack up?\n\nIn my opinion?  Very well!\n\nFirst, the atmosphere is spot on.  A sand-covered world filled with scraps of twisted metal, weird alien structures, and the corpses of the unfortunate, Deadrock gives just the right amount of sci-fi macabre I'd expect from the title.  Add in a handful of really great-looking cinematics, and you've got yourself a nice little experience.\n\nAnother major plus is the banter between your hero, and Novak, an injured smart-alec captain who serves as your point-of-contact during your exploration.  Major props to his voice actor, who got a lot more chuckles out of me than I'd expect from a game like this.\n\nThe adventure is a short one, and falls a bit on the easy side.  However, one of the reasons the game feels easy is because all of the puzzles feel like they make perfect sense, which is SO refreshing. \n\n There's no BS acheivement hunting in this game; what you see is what you get, and completing the title will earn you 100%.  And that 100% will be all the sweeter because the ending of this game is without a doubt extremely satisfying.

Schade eigentlich, denn abseits der grundsoliden Story mit ebenso grundsolidem Adventure-Gameplay, \u00fcberzeugt der Titel mit einem \u00fcberraschend hohem Komfort, welcher sogar neue Impulse ins Genre bringt. Wem die kurze Spieldauer nichts ausmacht, kann gerne einen halben Punkt zu meiner Gesamtwertung hinzuaddieren, aber auch so ist mir Descent to Deadrock noch eine gute Wertung wert.\n\n\nPro und Kontra:\n\nPro:\n- grundsolides Gameplay mit fairem Schwierigkeitsgrad\n- bietet \u00fcberraschend hohen Komfort durch gro\u00dfz\u00fcgige Hotspot-Trefferzonen, dauerhafte Speicherung freigelegter Hotspots und sehr flotter Fortbewegung zwischen den Szenenbildern\n- nette Rendersequenzen f\u00fcr ein Indie-Adventure\n\nNeutral:\n- ist \u201enur\u201c ein Remastering eines kostenfreien Flash-Spiels. Wem die Pr\u00e4sentation eines Flash-Spiels gen\u00fcgt, kann sich den Kauf also sparen und stattdessen Newgrounds und Co. einen Besuch abstatten.\n- die Story ist zwar spannend und motivierend aber auch recht ausgelutscht\n\nKontra:\n- schlechtes Preis- Leistungsverh\u00e4ltnis (10 \u20ac f\u00fcr 3 Stunden Spielzeit)\n- Powell's Synchronsprecher l\u00e4sst zu w\u00fcnschen \u00fcbrig\n- Renderbilder sind zu statisch\n- bietet nur einen selbstst\u00e4ndig speichernden Spielstand, der automatisch gel\u00f6scht wird, wenn man ein neues Spiel beginnt", "timestamp_created": 1448817594, "timestamp_updated": 1495654386, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19358991": {"recommendationid": "19358991", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974563751", "num_games_owned": 781, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 92, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448792129}, "language": "english", "review": "Short, but good fun!

You can get a few hours out of this game, and none of it is particularly difficult. Showing a lot of love from the old-school point-and-click days, all of the backgrounds appear to be hand-painted, which only adds charm as far as I'm concerned. The inventory system is easy to use and you'll need to drag some items onto another item to create a new item. Not all of these combinations are obvious, so you might end up trying a few things; but none of it leads to frustration. \n\nThe story itself isn't bad, but it feels like a lot of disjointed ideas that are thrown together. For example, one area shows an alien that's been stabbed to death in a hidden room and supposedly the body is still warm, meaning that it's a very recent murder. Nothing of this situation is ever resolved. The alien is never identified, the murderer is never revealed, the reason for the murder is never established, and there is nothing to link it with the rest of the story anyway. So, why bother introducing them in the first place? Also, human technology just so happens to be compatible with alien technology. That's quite a coincidence.\n\nWhat made this game difficult to get through was the voice acting. Oh, dear God! It's by no means the worst I've ever heard, but that's not saying much. It's bad! \"Reading lines while utterly bored\" might be more appropriate.\n\nStill, the artwork, the semblance of a story, and the throwback to the days of classic point-and-click gaming made this worth playing.

It\u00b4s a point-click game with a nice intro. If you played the old one and know the solution, you will do this here in an hour or two, without maybe 3-4, more would be annoying, because there are not so many things to do or many places.\n[b]Whats different:[/b]\n\n[list]\n[*] The story is a bit extended, but it\u00b4s just some kind of more task to do to the end. It\u00b4s a bit odd and I expected more.

While there is no time limit to the game, the atmosphere conveys a need to progress through in order to escape as soon as possible.  The voice acting is pretty bad, making it hard to push through, but as you play through the game, there is less dialogue making it easier to stomach the farther you get in the game.  \n\n\tThe story is decent, and does a good job of connecting you to the character that you pay as, but it is the gameplay that makes this game worth playing. You need to find items as you progress through the world and combine these items in different ways in order to progress forward. It doesn't feel like a scavenger hunt, as so many adventure games do.  The game didn't hold my hand as I went through, but it did use  puzzles and items in such a way that I had to use my brain, and work to solve the problems (even through the hint system is tied well into the story and doesn't make you feel like a cheater). This made me feel more like the character that was portrayed rather than some 3rd party player, thus why it may of added to the difficulty at times, but this also help set a stronger atmosphere. \n\n\tThe game was solid and sensible, and I enjoyed playing this game despite its few flaws.\n\nThis is a summary of my review video, which I encourage you to watch\nif you are looking for a more in-depth review.\n\nThanks for your viewership and support; for more videos click here:\n\nhttp:/www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho", "timestamp_created": 1426631204, "timestamp_updated": 1426631204, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.589112", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14925426": {"recommendationid": "14925426", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014824798", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1426540719}, "language": "hungarian", "review": "Nagyon j\u00f3 t\u00f6rt\u00e9net, fejt\u00f6r\u00e9st ig\u00e9nyel...\nVery good storyline", "timestamp_created": 1426540888, "timestamp_updated": 1426540888, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14884960": {"recommendationid": "14884960", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003124821", "num_games_owned": 2093, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 183, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1426325251}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]Rose Tinted[/b]\n\nI've always had a soft spot for Point and Click adventure games, they take me back to an earlier time in my gaming career when I could sit down in front of the latest Lucasarts game and lose myself with Loom, Full Throttle or Monkey Island.\n\nMy rose tinted view of these old classics tends to forget the ridiculously convoluted inventory puzzles that made up a large part of the problem solving mechanic in these games.\n\n\n[b]Random Combinations[/b]\n\nYou remember those frustrating puzzles where you'd find yourself spending hours combining items  in your inventory at random to try and figure out what on earth you're supposed to do next.\n\nThis isn't a problem you're likely to encounter in Morningstar, A point and click sci-fi adventure developed by Red Herring Labs.\n\n\n[b]It's Logical Captain[/b]\n\nThe puzzles here are entertaining and logical,  if you put a little thought into each problem you encounter here (which are mostly about finding parts and fixing machinery) then you're unlikely to find yourself stuck for too long without having to resort to the \"I don't know why I'm trying to combine these items\" tactic that was required in the old school titles.\n\n\n[b]Scanning for Pixels[/b]\n\nThere aren't  really any hidden object puzzles to  worry about  either, everything item you'll need should be fairly apparent to you as you move your mouse around the screen. There are no frustrating pixel hunts to stress you out.\n\nThis simplistic approach is  quite refreshing and  allows you to focus on the titles main selling point, the story.\n\n\n[b]A Tale With Impact[/b]\n\nDescent to Deadrock tells a compelling and mysterious tale.\n\nThe game opens with your ship crashing onto a seemingly barren desert planet. There are only two survivors, the ships captain  \"Novak\" and You!\nNovak, like the ship itself, is in a bad  way following the crash, so it's  going to be down to you to find the items you'll need to try and repair the ship and hopefully escape the planet.\n\nAlong the way you'll scratch the surface of some of the mysteries Deadrock keeps.\nDon't expect full disclosure though, Deadrock holds its secrets tightly and your main goal here is to escape the planet, there will be unanswered questions after you complete this game.\n\n\n[b]Finish Him[/b]\n\nAnd complete it you will... \nIt's the strong intriguing story that'll keep  you playing though the couple of hours required to complete Morning Star.\nYou'll probably finish it in one sitting, which isn't necessarily a  bad thing.\nThere's a lot to be said for a bite sized, focused tale that completes its story arc in two hours.\nA movie gives us a couple of hours entertainment and that is exactly what you'll get here, two hours of sci-fi mystery interspersed with some exploration and problem solving.\n\n\n[b]Static Atmosphere[/b]\n\nBased on an old flash game, this outing of Morningstar presents itself mostly as static screens where you'll be searching for and using items to either fix machinery or get past obstacles.\nThese static visuals are nothing if not atmospheric, the stillness in each location creates a sense of tension and isolation as you explore your crashed ship and later the surrounding area of Deadrock.\nDue to all this stillness, when animation is used, it has a much greater impact than you'd imagine.\n\nThere are also some cut scenes, not many, but they are very effective in pulling you into the moment, I just wish there were more of them.\n\n\n[b]Did you hear that...[/b]\n\nThe game is fully voiced, and whilst the voice acting isn't going to win any awards, it is competent enough to keep the story moving forward without breaking the immersion.\n\n\n[b]Going Down?[/b]\n\nShould you get Morningstar: Descent to Deadrock?\n\nThat depends on what you're looking for in a point and click adventure game.\n\nIf you're looking for an epic, sweeping tale to lose yourself in for weeks, challenging puzzles and state of the art cut scenes, then no, Morningstar isn't that game.\n\nHowever, if you're looking to invest a couple of hours in an enigmatic sci-fi setting, enjoy some thoughtful but not too challenging puzzles and be entertained in an encapsulated narrative experience, then you could do a lot worse than spend an evening with Morningstar.\n\n( To view the full review (and others) please take the time to visit [url]http://www.review-well.com/ [/url] )", "timestamp_created": 1426348534, "timestamp_updated": 1476524389, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.621299", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14784167": {"recommendationid": "14784167", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994666064", "num_games_owned": 2641, "num_reviews": 545, "playtime_forever": 173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1425594665}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "As vezes bate aquela vontade de ver uma hist\u00f3ria de fic\u00e7\u00e3o cient\u00edfica espacial sombria, algo misterioso e tal, mas infelizmente esse tipo de obra \u00e9 um tanto limitado e acaba dif\u00edcil de se achar, felizmente Morningstar \u00e9 uma op\u00e7\u00e3o e pode satisfazer muita gente!

Es el remake HD de un juego que sali\u00f3 hace a\u00f1os en Flash. Siento un gran respeto por la comunidad que durante a\u00f1os estuvo subiendo sus juegos flash, y me parece alucinante lo que algunos de ellos lograron (Alien Hominid, o este primer Morningstar). Teniendo esto presente, me parece una barbaridad el salto que han logrado dar desde Red Herring Labs, pasando de la versi\u00f3n inicial a esta que presentan bajo la distribuci\u00f3n de Phoenix Online Studios.\n\nNada m\u00e1s empezar nuestra nave se estrellar\u00e1 en el planeta Deadrock, una bola de roca llena de vac\u00edo y penurias que toda persona con cabeza procura evitar. Encarnaremos a Powell, del que no nos queda clara la profesi\u00f3n, que es el \u00fanico miembro de la tripulaci\u00f3n que puede intentar resolver la papeleta: el capit\u00e1n yace herido, empalado por una barra de hierro, y el ingeniero ha muerto por un fallo en su c\u00e1mara de hibernaci\u00f3n. Con semejante panorama la prioridad ser\u00e1 salir de la sala en la que estamos atrapados y ganar acceso al resto de la nave.\n\nUna vez empezamos a resolver los primeros puzles del juego es cuando empezamos a entender lo que sus desarrolladores quieren darnos. Porque tenemos por delante una aventura gr\u00e1fica de las de antes, en primera persona, con \u00e9nfasis en el uso de objetos para seguir adelante y con escenarios fijos con los que interactuar. \u00bfY qu\u00e9 es lo que nos quieren dar, bajo ese envoltorio? Un videojuego sencillo y honesto.\n\nPorque una tendencia odiosa que existe en muchas aventuras gr\u00e1ficas, especialmente cuando quieren alargar artificalmente la duraci\u00f3n, es la de utilizar puzles nefastos, de los que cabrean al jugador y le hacen buscar algo de esperanza en el terrible mundo de Youtube (sigo prefiriendo las gu\u00edas en texto, s\u00ed). Morningstar tiene la candidez de darnos puzles que, a\u00fan requiriendo que pensemos, tienen una l\u00f3gica aplastante y justificaci\u00f3n dentro de la historia. Cuenta, adem\u00e1s, con la opci\u00f3n de hablar por radio con Novak (el capit\u00e1n), que nos dar\u00e1 pistas si nos atascamos (aunque esto s\u00ed lo desaconsejo, porque casi resuelve las cosas por uno). Especial menci\u00f3n a una serie de momentos en los que tendremos que aprender un peque\u00f1o alfabeto y relacionarlo con sistemas planetarios, un puzle brillante.\n\nLa otra pata que sustenta a Morningstar es el planeta en el que hemos acabado contra nuestra voluntad. Una de las propuestas del equipo de desarrollo era crear una experiencia atmosf\u00e9rica, y, a mi juicio, lo han conseguido. Cuando conseguimos abandonar la nave y adentrarnos en Deadrock, notamos una soledad palpable y casi angustiosa. Metros y m\u00e1s metros de desierto por delante, sin una triste se\u00f1al de vida propia salvo de los desdichados que nos han precedido en el naufragio estelar. Formaciones de roca que nos ignoran mientras el silencio nos rodea, con un fant\u00e1stico dise\u00f1o de escenarios que a veces tienen hasta un aire majestuoso.\n\nPor otra parte, me gusta c\u00f3mo se dibuja la trama del juego. Se acerca a la ciencia ficci\u00f3n cl\u00e1sica, con ese planeta que realmente guarda m\u00e1s de lo que esperamos, pero tambi\u00e9n tiene la decencia de guardarse sus mejores secretos y no joder nada li\u00e1ndose a dar explicaciones. A lo largo de sus dos horas lograr\u00e1 mantenernos en tensi\u00f3n y acrecentar la preocupaci\u00f3n por lo que nos puede llegar si nos quedamos en Deadrock y cuando lleguemos al final acabaremos sintiendo alivio. Habremos seguido una ruta natural espoleados por nuestro ingenio, sin acciones estramb\u00f3ticas y con varios momentos para el recuerdo. Y aunque el doblaje (en ingl\u00e9s) es mejorable, tambi\u00e9n las escasas conversaciones con Novak resultan satisfactorias, sin tener que forzar una relaci\u00f3n que no tiene por qu\u00e9 haber.\n\n\u00daltimamente, el sector est\u00e1 instalado en la tont\u00edsima pol\u00e9mica de la duraci\u00f3n de los videojuegos. Motivo de m\u00e1s para hablar de Morningstar: como ya he dicho, dura no m\u00e1s de dos horas, y es una duraci\u00f3n perfecta. Le da tiempo para fascinarnos por el escenario, para ponernos en tensi\u00f3n y para contarnos una historia sin artefactos est\u00fapidos que la prolonguen y le hagan perder impacto. Precisamente, creo que el hecho de ser un t\u00edtulo sencillo le da a\u00fan m\u00e1s valor y sirve para ejemplificar ese \u201cmenos es m\u00e1s\u201d que desde aqu\u00ed reclamamos.\n\nPero d\u00e9jenme hablar de una \u00faltima cosa.\n\nSoy partidario de que a cada videojuego hay que valorarlo por separado, pero creo que la labor del remake ha sido impresionante. Han creado, pr\u00e1cticamente, un juego nuevo, rehecho desde cero, con unos escenarios preciosos, una banda sonora que acompa\u00f1a bien y unas escenas de v\u00eddeo muy meritorias (atentos al final). Eso hay que valorarlo, aunque lo mejor de Morningstar seguir\u00e1 siendo la honestidad con la que est\u00e1 hecho.\n\nSi eres fan de la ciencia ficci\u00f3n o de los point & click y no tienes problemas con la duraci\u00f3n, lo vas a disfrutar.", "timestamp_created": 1424876461, "timestamp_updated": 1424876461, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522445", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14631184": {"recommendationid": "14631184", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989570804", "num_games_owned": 305, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 147, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455813664}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice atmosphere, decent voice acting, nice story and graphics. \nWay too short and easy.

However, this independent title is one that may very well sneak under many a fan of the genre's radar. It was developed by the relatively new studio Red Herring Labs ([b]Nocran Space[/b]), which was then picked up for distribution through Phoenix Online Studios. The game itself is touted as being in the category of \"Atmospheric First Person\", placing you in a nightmarish struggle to escape an alien planet in one piece. It also happens to be a remastered version of the older PC title [b]MorningStar[/b]. But does this updated entry stand as a good modern take on the style, or is it nothing more than recycled cliche's that are far from enjoyable?\n\nThis story follows one of the ship's crew mates named Powell. He and the captain are the only survivors of a simple mission, having crashed on the alien planet referred to as Deadrock. You are tasked to not only help your superior officer, but also repair the engines in order to escape. Of course, you don't have everything you need on board, and soon you are forced to explore the planet, as well as the remains of another downed ship and deceased crew. However, the more you explore, the more the mysterious stone heads scattered about become an ominous sign that you are not alone.\n\nThe game mechanics are just about as traditional as the story itself. Other than fantastically developed and rendered cut scenes for the opening and closing, much of visuals are images that only move when you interact in a way that would affect them, such as removing or opening a door, causing a device to explode, or simply picking an item up to keep in your inventory. The puzzles require you to find the right item, often in order for you to progress like going outside or to replace necessary fluids to help you survive the long trip back home, as well as require a number of things you will need to put together in order to solve said puzzle or create some crude replacement part when necesary. Sometimes these combinations are a bit cryptic, but you can always call your injured higher up on the radio and get a hint as to what to do next.\n\nOn top of that, it's nearly impossible to miss investigating every little object you can interact with. Much like calling for assistance, this does detract from some of the difficulty in the game, which only comes in one mode: Casual. But, by the time you finish, you'll realize this wasn't meant to be that perplexing. There are some times, however, when you can overlook things like codes or patterns later on thanks to clues that don't really point you in the right direction. This is a major issue later on (one that made me spend an hour running between three different rooms cursing up a storm as to why the planetary sequences wouldn't do anything to the main device in the ship), though it has been kind of fixed thanks to updates that hit around the time of launch. These improvements mostly factor into the keyboard you enter the sequences in, making it a little easier to do so, as well as removing the coding on the left side of the screen during the aforementioned cinematics (something that appeared in the game prior to release).\n\nAnd then there's the voice acting, which is as standard as everything else in this game. The cast literally sounds like they are just reading off cue cards, rarely adding an emotion outside of sarcasm, especially when insulting one another in a manner that seems only jovial due to the dire circumstances at hand. Powell will narrate basically every move you make, so the hum drum approach does grow tiring after a while, especially when you end up a bit stumped as to what to to do next. This is, sadly, the only real punishment for abusing the easy item system. You can try combining items or placing them anywhere at any time, as long as you're willing to hear the same bland dialogue over and over if it doesn't work. Other than that, there seems to be no major repercussions that I have experienced.\n\nBut, what it all comes down is if the game itself is fun, and, yes, it is. A lot of the charm from the original is still captured here, even with the new shine the modern darker visuals bring to the table. [b]MorningStar: Descent to Deadrock[/b] doesn't set out to be anything but an enjoyable, casual point-and-click Adventure game that you don't need to put a lot of effort into, or worry about forgetting something important other than certain sequences later on. The only major gripe is that the mystery of those stone heads aren't really explored outside of logs you discover. A few more cinematic scenes also would have been nice to have, though their absence doesn't really impact the title negatively. But, everything functions just as it should, and there's just enough going on to keep the player engaged for the roughly two hours that this little quest ends up being. [b]MorningStar: Descent to Deadrock[/b] won't really appeal to the seasoned veterans of the style looking for a more serious experience like the [b]Tex Murphy[/b] games or [b]The Dig[/b], but this simpler and refined offering is a great way for nowcomers to the style to get their feet wet before moving on to some of the more challenging titles out there. Regardless of your experience level, this is a game worth checking out, though you might want to wait until it goes on sale given the length.\n\n[i]Score: 6/10[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1424564391, "timestamp_updated": 1424564391, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501363", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14583838": {"recommendationid": "14583838", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003174568", "num_games_owned": 431, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 77, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1424555520}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun point and click but DO NOT BUY UNTIL: its under 4 bucks.

Funny thing is that perhaps that's not completely true, but you are going to have to find your way through this point click adventure to find out what this planet has to hide, and are you going to be able to get off this planet in one piece.\n\nMorningstar: Descent to Deadrock is by Red Herring Labs and will take you on an hour and a half ride where you will get to explore this \"Dead Rock\" and try to find anything and everything you need to potentially get off of the planet. You will have to combine items, find items, and fix issues in order to advance the game.\n\nThe one thing that I can honestly say that ended up bugging me about the game was the EXTREMELY deadpan voice of the lead actor in the game. He definitely had the almost monotone approach of not getting a damn about anything as well as never being shocked or excited about anything. That's not to say that the other voice actor was that much better, but at least they gave a little bit of feeling to the game.\n\nI liked the look of the game, and it was pretty straightforward in how you navigated around. You are going to see almost always 1 single view of a room or an area, there might be deeper parts of the area/room that you can explore and get a new vantage point on, but this is definitely not a game where you are going to have to search every nook and cranny to find what you are looking for.\n\nOnce again, perhaps its my time away from point and clicks until recently, but there is a hint system in place, and it was good to see that it was actually useful with out making me feel dumb. There were a couple of times where I struggled to find out what to do next, but thanks to the hint system I was able to easily get back on track.\n\nI can honestly say the further I got into the game, the more I actually got into the game. What I mean to say is that it took me a little bit of time to find the pace, but when I finally found the pace of the game I was ready to move. It was unfortunate that once I got up to speed I found the end of the game, but hey it says something that I had no issue of playing the game straight through.\n\nSo I guess the question now is should you get this game... Well I think if you are looking for something light, has a futuristic space theme, is a point click adventure built around survival, you are going to enjoy this game. As I mentioned before the only big issue I had with it was the voice acting of the main character, and before anyone asks, there are really only 2 voice actors, so that sort of didn't do it for me, but then again it wasn't like he talked the entire time.

Thankfully, the game's been remastered a bit. The graphics aren't much better, but they are slightly improved. Some new voice work.

(Genug f\u00fcr eine Vortsetzung )\nDas w\u00e4re aber nur das Dressing auf dem Salat, schlie\u00dflich geht es ums \u00dcberleben und die Flucht von dem Planeten, und das wird durchaus gut abgeschmeckt geboten.\n\nDynamische Spielweise und Konzentration auf den Haupthandlungsstrang sowie das Vermeiden unn\u00f6tiger Laufwege haben zur Folge das das Spiel aber recht schnell vorbei ist. Sehr schnell. \nIn der Tat eins der k\u00fcrzesten Spiele die ich gespielt habe ( lt. Steam 3h ).\n\nDas Spiel ist in englisch, was f\u00fcr manche abschreckend sein kann, die Sprecher \u00fcberschlagen sich jedoch nicht und sprechen recht deutlich und verst\u00e4ndlich.\n\nFazit: Sch\u00f6n anzusehen, sch\u00f6ne Geschichte, gut erz\u00e4hlt, lecker, allerdings h\u00e4tte es ein bischen mehr sein d\u00fcrfen...\n          Wem das bewu\u00dft ist und wer sich den Appetithappen leisten mag kann zulangen.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1424273240, "timestamp_updated": 1424273240, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14526374": {"recommendationid": "14526374", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965738791", "num_games_owned": 636, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1424247388}, "language": "english", "review": "A quick adventure to escape a restricted dangerous planet.

He heads to the cockpit to find the Captain of the ship impaled through the stomach by a random piece of debris. He takes a seat and reins in the damaged vehicle as it cascades to the planet below. Powell must now explore the planet and find a way to repair his broken ship.\n\nHigh Points\n\nEngineering puzzles \u2013 The puzzles are sound from an engineering perspective. You\u2019ll find materials and parts to fix broken equipment and structures around the planet. Powell and the Captain will give us hints on how to use the parts, and from those hints we will craft makeshift sensors and explosives.\n\nCreepy Atmosphere \u2013 Descent to Deadrock has a truly creepy feel to it. Stone statues of unknown origin watch over a sandy wasteland. Wrecked ships and dead bodies are strewn about the desolate planet leaving only the mystery of how they died. It creates a tense sensation while you search for a means to escape.\n\nAverage Points\n\nDem Graphics \u2013 The visuals are very 1998, and that would be acceptable if not for the stillness of the game play. It reminds me of older games like Shadowgate or D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu. You are mostly watching a still image that only reacts when you interact with a puzzle piece. I wouldn't say it\u2019s bad, but it could use a touch of life to the environments. Wind blowing the sand, the Captain struggling to breathe in his suit, anything that makes the world feel alive.\n\nLow Points\n\nVoice Acting \u2013 The voice acting for the main character isn't awful, but it\u2019s not very effectual or interesting. It\u2019s clear that this person is just reading his lines off a sheet of paper, and not trying to inject emotion to the situation at hand. The Captain of the ship provides hints and information and he\u2019s actually worse than the main character. I found it difficult to care about the situation when the characters themselves don\u2019t seem to give a damn.\n\nClickity Click \u2013 Morningstar is an adventure game that\u2019s a bit too far in the past. You will swirl around the cursor on the screen looking for places to interact with. The game gives you some reasonable tells to solve most puzzles and even a nice hint system. However, there are still places where you\u2019ll have to just randomly click on items to solve a puzzle.\n\nShort game \u2013 You can beat this game in 3 to 4 hours even after all the random clicking. You can just plow right on through to the ending sequence without much of a problem. The ending is anti-climactic as well, and it never really solves a few of the mysteries on the planet.\n\nConclusion\n\nMorningstar: Descent to Deadrock hearkens back to the olden days of adventure gaming. It is light on animation and the voice acting is only tolerable. I recommend that only fans of the adventure genre invest in the short but eventful game play. If you\u2019re not a fan of the adventure genre it isn't going to convince you to join the genre, and the bad voice work and older design might just scare you off.", "timestamp_created": 1424246653, "timestamp_updated": 1435595715, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.571735", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14523944": {"recommendationid": "14523944", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970834531", "num_games_owned": 154, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1424238675}, "language": "english", "review": "I thought this was going to be a point and click game where you could walk around.

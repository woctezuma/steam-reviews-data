There is a basic Undo action, but no way to group strokes, name the group, or do anything more advanced (toggle visibilty, move, resize, copy/replicate).\n\nThere's a very nice screen-capture capability, too. You can take still images, 5-second predefined GIFs which shake back and forth to convey the depth of 3D, or capture your own video recording, short or long. This is a really nice way to get a sort of screen-grab of what the VR space is like, to post or share.\n\nKnowing how Google tends to create good demo apps and kill off great, long-standing projects, I have no expectations they're going to continue iterating on this app. But this right here is VR 1.0: 3-5 years from now, there will be a plethora of these sorts of content-creation tools.

The controls are super intuitive and easy to use. Being able to load other people's drawings from the internet showcase is really helpful for getting ideas on techniques and seeing what can be done with the tools available. The ability to shrink and expand the scene is super cool for creating things in scale - cover vast distances rapidly while zoomed out and then zoom it in to be able to walk around your suddenly huge creation and add smaller detail. The animated brushes are super fun and stunning to use. The in-game video camera and gif maker is really cool too, for sharing online.\n\nI am really hoping they develop it further, as it does have a few shortcomings- lack of 3D brushes (just wire and disco) is a bit disappointing for painting in a 3D space, as you are restricted to trying to paint 3D things with 2D brushes. The colors of paint in different environments are completely off in some of them which is frustrating; adjusting the source of lighting would be helpful as well. Lack of transparency adjustment on the colors and no dark color shading equivalent of the highlighter is a bummer; it would be nice to be able to paint things with smooth gradients. There doesn't seem to be a color picker tool either, which makes it hard to resume painting and match properly. Copy & paste would be a very welcome addition as well.

My sister could probably spend hours in it and not get tired. This app is wonderful and it really adds another dimension to art (literally) and I'm excited to see what not just my family can make but the entire community as well. However, there are some downsides to the app.\n\nAs you can see from the screenshots and videos of Tilt Brush, there's no real way to make a \"solid\" 3D object. All the works of art created are essentially just lines connected together. You can't fill in spaces, everything has to just be line art (but in 3D). This is obviously not a very easy to fix problem - however I had planned on making something like a cityscape but seeing as I won't be able to fill in the walls of the building, I don't think I'll bother. Also, as hard as the team has tried to make the controls intuitive, it can be a little bit confusing. My sister had no problem with it as she's used to new technology - however my mum had a bit of difficulty getting used to the paint pallet and all the tools. But I'm sure if you're looking to get a vive then you're probably used to new technology too and that won't be a problem!\n\nAlso, considering this comes free with the vive - there's no reason not to get it!", "timestamp_created": 1471717235, "timestamp_updated": 1471717235, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497957", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25028173": {"recommendationid": "25028173", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980848393", "num_games_owned": 735, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486847533}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing use of VR.

It's absolutely one of my favorite VR games, and it is its own completely unique thing. It's not a 3D sculpting game, it is really just drawing in 3D space. I got it for free when I ordered the Vive, but I would definitely have gotten it even it weren't. I recommend it absolutely. I'll use the remaining part of my review to list things that are awesome, flaws and things I feel the game needs. Ranked from most important to least important.\n\nAwesome things:\n- The light brush is beautiful and works very well in the default environment\n- Embers, snowflakes and stars are some of the really cool brushes that have 3D effects\n- The tools like Straight Edge and the Mirror are great\n- The mannequin and snowman environments are fun and creative\n- Loading a sketch replays the way in which it was drawn, which is really cool to watch\n- You can pull in reference images \n- Good updates\n\n[B]This was written many updates ago, several of the following flaws & improvement suggestions may no longer apply[/B]\n[i]Flaws:\n- Flat brushes look bad from the side and cause anti aliasing issues and cause sharp edges that are difficult to work with. \n- Eraser doesn't erase, it deletes entire strokes. \n- Many of the brushes are gimmicky and frankly bad looking.\n- The intro tutorial plays every time you open the game. It's short, but still annoying that you have to wait for the game to show you how to open the left hand palette before you can do it. And you have to clear the sketch to get rid of the actual intro.\n\nThings that would improve the game:\n- Ability to move, stretch, scale and re-shape strokes (This would totally invalidate the issue with erasing and flat brushes and would allow for the creation of precise models that are nigh impossible to make at the moment.)\n- Better brushes\n- A 'pen tool' sort of way to draw, where you place points and then bend the curve between them\n- A way to move up and down\n- No limit to teleportation (Yes, anti aliasing at long distances is a problem but I think it should be the user's problem)\n- Multiple mirrors! I want to draw in a 3D kaleidoscope!\n- More environments (Although I feel that the light brush in a dark empty space is iconic to Tilt Brush at this point)[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1467990257, "timestamp_updated": 1510339324, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496806", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24174495": {"recommendationid": "24174495", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006639376", "num_games_owned": 345, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484184190}, "language": "english", "review": "So fun, such color!", "timestamp_created": 1467955244, "timestamp_updated": 1467955244, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24169062": {"recommendationid": "24169062", "author": {"steamid": "76561198315803639", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3145, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482980469}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun for the entire family!!", "timestamp_created": 1467932657, "timestamp_updated": 1467932657, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24148019": {"recommendationid": "24148019", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998413239", "num_games_owned": 841, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 135, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492723290}, "language": "english", "review": "This came with my Vive or I probably wouldn't have gotten it.

There also should be an option to lock the flat brush in the orientation that it's in relative to the controller (for example, in a way that if you pull the brush upwards, the brush creates a thin line, and sideways for a fat line). As of right now, the brush \"swivels\" on the controller like a wheel on a shopping cart. It turns to the direction you are pulling the brush in. \nMore brushes also wouldnt hurt, and a flat plane tool so you could paint flat, similiar to a canvas (would be useful for painting walls to buildings for example).\n\nPros: Came for free in my bundle.

Pas de menu flottant ou d'\u00e9cran plat virtuel coll\u00e9 au visage, la manipulation de la \"palette\" virtuelle est tr\u00e8s intuitive et profite de la facilit\u00e9 d'utilisation des manettes du Vive. Le retour haptique des manettes est agr\u00e9able et offre une sensation de mat\u00e9rialit\u00e9 bienvenue, surtout lorsqu'on fait d\u00e9filer les diff\u00e9rents menus \u00e0 l'aide du trackpad.\n\nLe concept en lui-m\u00eame est relativement simple : j'ai souvent entendu Tilt Brush \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9 de \"Paint pour la RV\". C'est \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s \u00e7a. Dessiner et peindre dans l'espace offre une r\u00e9elle sensation de libert\u00e9 et d'immersion tout en utilisant les caract\u00e9ristiques propres de la RV, on ne peut pas imaginer ce programme sur un \u00e9cran classique.\n\nLes brosses sont agr\u00e9ablement vari\u00e9es, mais on ne refuserait pas d'en avoir encore plus. Mes pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9es sont, comme beaucoup, la lumi\u00e8re et le papier. Le papier, justement, offre une sensation de cr\u00e9ation mat\u00e9rielle, encore plus qu'avec les autres brosses. La lumi\u00e8re, quant \u00e0 elle, propose une sensation un peu surr\u00e9elle, \u00e0 mi-chemin entre la magie et la sf.\nD'autres brosses sont amusantes \u00e0 utiliser, comme la neige ou \"l'hypercolor\" mais ne me servent pas autant que les deux premi\u00e8res.\n\nDes outils comme le miroir ou celui permettant de tracer des lignes droites sont vraiment utiles et pratiques, avec toujours une utilisation simple et compr\u00e9hensible, et cela nous m\u00e8ne \u00e0 une autre qualit\u00e9 de Tilt Brush : son accessibilit\u00e9.\nToutes les personnes de mon entourage qui ont pu tester Tilt Brush n'ont eu aucun mal \u00e0 \u00e9voluer dans l'espace et \u00e0 utiliser l'interface, m\u00eame s'ils n'avaient jamais essay\u00e9 la RV. La plupart n'ayant pas de pratique artistique, leurs cr\u00e9ations n'\u00e9taient peut-\u00eatre pas forc\u00e9ment impressionnantes, mais elles ont su s'amuser en occupant l'espace \u00e0 coups de lumi\u00e8res, de couleurs et de textures. Je pense cependant que poss\u00e9der une pratique artistique comme le dessin ou m\u00eame des r\u00e9alisations en trois dimensions aide vraiment \u00e0 s'approprier le logiciel.\n\nCar oui, Tilt Brush poss\u00e8de cependant quelques limites. Comme toute application faisant appel \u00e0 des comp\u00e9tences de cr\u00e9ation, si, justement, on ne poss\u00e8de pas ce genre de comp\u00e9tences, une fois la nouveaut\u00e9 pass\u00e9e et une fois que les gribouillis volants n'amusent plus, un vide doit se faire sentir. Ayant un peu de pratique de mon c\u00f4t\u00e9, je ne peux pas parler en connaissance de cause mais il me semble que c'est une situation \u00e0 envisager.\nDe plus, certains fonctionnalit\u00e9s semblent manquer. Par exemple, une fonction de mise \u00e0 l'\u00e9chelle serait bienvenue (la fonction de t\u00e9l\u00e9portation venant d'\u00eatre ajout\u00e9e r\u00e9cemment)\n\nEn conclusion, m\u00eame si je l'ai obtenu gratuitement par la pr\u00e9commande de mon Vive, je ne peux que le recommander puisque que je l'aurais sans doute achet\u00e9 de toute mani\u00e8re. C'est une exp\u00e9rience immersive et lib\u00e9ratrice. D'autres applications pour le logiciel pourraient \u00eatre envisag\u00e9es : il pourrait permettre \u00e0 toute sorte de designers ou de cr\u00e9ateurs de faire des \u00e9bauches rapides de cr\u00e9ations, d'id\u00e9es, de projets. Un carnet de brouillon en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 virtuelle. Il y a s\u00fbrement beaucoup d'autres possibilit\u00e9s et j'esp\u00e8re que Tilt Brush sera mis \u00e0 jour et deviendra encore meilleur et plus peaufin\u00e9.

I've dreamt about this since I was a kid. I've had this creative urge to draw and paint in 3D space for years, but only achieved it through post-processing with video editing software and more recently with tracking technology like Leap Motion in VR. So I've been waiting all this time for something that didn't even exist, and here it is. Talk about scratching an itch! I've followed Tilt Brush progress since they first posted a concept video on Youtube a few years back. The approach  was a little different, using virtual flat surfaces you could paint on and rotate to create 3D objects and scenery. And that was good enough for me. I sat around practicing, air-painting if you will, to make sure I was ready to use it when it arrived. It has come a far way since then. The perfectly tracked HTC Vive controllers are a joy to use and having one controller as \"an artist's toolset\" is a great addition and very intuitive. I can't picture myself working without it. I would be happy just to draw, but Tilt Brush features loads of effects and helping tools you can use to expand your creative experience. I was testing the mirror tool that lets you draw in perfect symmetry, and I accidentally made it spin on its own axis. I had no idea that was possible. With it I can easily create galaxies in space, awesome projectile effects or trippy tornadoes. I can't wait to see what other features that will be added in the future. There has already been a pretty big update adding new paint brushes and effects, making the experience easier and more interesting. It will force you to think differently. You might have to relive your early days using a pen or brush on paper, getting to know a new artform all over again, but you will have a great time doing it. Which is what Tilt Brush is. Pure creative fun.

This is clearly a mobile game that has been converted over for Steam. There seem to be some artifacts left over from this change, such as the limited item stacks. That seems like the exact thing a f2p game would have so that then they could make you buy new slots or something. I think that is also why everything seems so crazy expensive- maybe they wanted to force players to spend real $$.\n\nBut this is the paid version so those issues should be (but probably won't be) fixed. I've also had it glitch out a few times and it never created an icon for my desktop- just a blank white rectangle.\n\nYet for all these issues I just can't stop playing. It's an addictive puzzler, and the bears are just so cute.

Pour ceux qui connaissent le jeu \"2048\", ils ne seront pas d\u00e9pays\u00e9s, car le concept est assez proche (tout en b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiant d'un c\u00f4t\u00e9 strat\u00e9gique tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able). Triple Town est ce qu'on peut appeler un casual/r\u00e9flexion : chaque partie peut durer quelques minutes, ou de longues heures. Dot\u00e9 de graphismes adorables, et d'un concept extr\u00eamement simple, ce jeu est avant tout une drogue qui rend extr\u00eamement accroc. Son format fen\u00eatr\u00e9 (qu'on peut passer en plein \u00e9cran si l'on d\u00e9sire) fait qu'il peut ais\u00e9ment tourner alors qu'on fait autre chose en m\u00eame temps : id\u00e9al pour tuer le temps !\n\nDepuis une \u00eele principale, il est possible de choisir plusieurs navires qui embarqueront pour des cartes vides. Ces cartes, assez petites, permettent au joueur de d\u00e9poser au sol divers \u00e9l\u00e9ments (herbe, buissons, arbres, ...) qui, lorsqu'ils sont en contact avec deux \u00e9l\u00e9ments identiques ou plus, se r\u00e9unissent en un \u00e9l\u00e9ment sup\u00e9rieur (ex : 3 herbes -> 1 buisson). La carte se remplit peut \u00e0 peu d'arbres, maisons et cr\u00e9atures (ours, voire \"ninjas\"), et laisse donc bien peu de place pour tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments \u00e0 rajouter : il faut toujours songer \u00e0 pr\u00e9voir de la place en r\u00e9unissant les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de sorte \u00e0 faire des combos et autres associations. Sit\u00f4t la carte remplie, la mission est finie : retour sur l'\u00eele principale qui permet, selon la r\u00e9ussite de la carte pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente, d'ajouter des plantations, des tonneaux d'or et autres bonus qui am\u00e9liorent le niveau.\n\nTriple Town est de ces jeux qui captivent au point de ne plus les l\u00e2cher. En g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, un joueur passera de tr\u00e8s longues heures sur ce jeu, \u00e0 faire un nombre incalculable de parties, cherchant toujours \u00e0 s'am\u00e9liorer dans le placement strat\u00e9gique d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments. A mon sens, un INCONTOURNABLE du genre, qui allie la r\u00e9flexion, la strat\u00e9gie, la gestion, le tout de fa\u00e7on profond\u00e9ment intuitive, sans aucune action de gameplay autre que celle de cliquer pour placer les \u00e9l\u00e9ments sur la carte. Simpliste, enfantin, et pourtant extr\u00eamement amusant. En plus d'\u00eatre adorable, color\u00e9 et accessible \u00e0 tous, ce jeu devient aussi difficile que le joueur devient bon.\n\nUne merveille, donc, que je conseille fortement pour s'amuser en toute simplicit\u00e9. Attention tout de m\u00eame au c\u00f4t\u00e9 casual qui finit par \u00eatre rapidement chronophage si on ne se surveille pas. Il suffit de regarder le nombre d'heures pass\u00e9es sur ce jeu par ceux qui ont r\u00e9dig\u00e9 une critique pour s'en faire une id\u00e9e (personnellement, j'ai jou\u00e9 \u00e0 ce jeu sur GOG durant des ann\u00e9es : ceci explique mon faible temps de jeu sur la version Steam acquise via un Bundle).", "timestamp_created": 1513542638, "timestamp_updated": 1513542638, "voted_up": true,

What purpose does it serve our primordial lizard brains to delight us when we put three of something together and watch it disappear? Whatever the reason may be, the game industry has seized upon this weakness with terrible force, compelling us to crush candies and swap orbs and do all sorts of ridiculous things to rack up points. Triple Town would be no different, save for one additional level of complexity that adds a unique hint of progression to the formula.\n\nRounds in Triple Town take place on small islands, gridded off for you to set your plants and buildings on. You're given something to place, anything from a tuft of grass to a sturdy oak to an entire house, which you can put on any open square. If three of the same thing end up adjacent to each other, such as three bushes, they combine on the spot of the last one placed into the next level of thing, such as a tree. In this way you can work your way up from grass to bush to tree to house to mansion to castle and on. Most of the time you'll be placing grass but you occasionally get higher-level objects straightaway, which you can use to your advantage or store in your single storage spot for later.\n\nThere are other factors at play, such as bears you must place that move about and block your construction, or crystals that act as wildcards, combining with any two other things to complete the set. Your goal is to amass points and reach certain milestones like Settlement and City, and the simple challenge of trying to finagle everything into place is honestly enough to keep you going. You'll slowly start puzzling out how to plan your grasses ahead to get the bushes in the right places to get trees where you want, and then realize you need to plan even further for the houses that the trees become. There's a remarkable amount of planning and strategizing involved, as well as the challenges of unexpected bear or crystal appearances.\n\nAll this would make for a fine coffee-break puzzle game, at least for awhile, but there's thankfully more to it than that. As you play, you obtain special items like farms and ores that cannot be used in normal maps. In between rounds, you travel to your capital city where you can place these to grant you additional resources periodically. These resources come in the form of items that can be used during rounds to place certain clutch objects when you need them most. The capital follows the same match-3 rules as well, meaning placing your special items intelligently can yield much greater returns. Triple Town basically gives you a hub city to develop which provides resources that makes the individual puzzles easier, allowing you to earn more items to develop your hub. It's a brilliant little gameplay loop that can keep you hooked for want of one more upgrade to your city.\n\nIt's almost a perfect package, but I must admit the presentation drags it down a little. The actual feel of Triple Town is like that of a Flash game, trapped in a static windowed mode with simple vector graphics and animation. There's almost no polish to the menus or buttons, either, which makes them feel more like developer placeholders than finished products. The sound is adequate for what it is but does nothing to alleviate the otherwise cheap feel of the game. Coming off of titles like Mini Metro that manage to be simple AND stylish, Triple Town can feel a bit disappointing. Still, the core mechanics are plenty solid and the progression systems are very addictive, so if you can look past the presentation you'll have a lovely little timesink to enjoy here.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

You can buy items in the store however they can be expensive (with in-game coins, not real currency) and there's a limit to how many of each item you can buy per round. \n\n\u2718  There isn't diversity in level design.\n\nThe game is still cute however the maps are all pretty much the same. Though some have lakes while others have none, they can all look alike, and thus appear fairly bland. \n\n\u2718 I do wish there were maps of different sizes.\n\nAll the maps/levels are the same size, though some have less space with lakes and rivers in the way. If this game were ever updated or a sequel made, I would appreciate if there were more diversity in the size of the towns. It would be fun to have some huge, some small, etc. \n\nOverall this is a wonderful game and all flaws aside, I think it would make a lovely game for any gamer.", "timestamp_created": 1464578419, "timestamp_updated": 1464578419, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23219772": {"recommendationid": "23219772", "author": {"steamid": "76561198173347807", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 690, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465810839}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u672c\u4ee5\u4e3a\u548c\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u7248\u672c\u5dee\u4e0d\u591a\uff0c\u6ca1\u60f3\u5230\u76f8\u6bd4\u6765\u8bf4PC\u7248\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u5f88\u591a\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u7b97\u662f\u4e0d\u5927\u4e0d\u5c0f\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u60ca\u559c\u5427\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1464277505, "timestamp_updated": 1464277505, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23096498": {"recommendationid": "23096498", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036091934", "num_games_owned": 196, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 1887, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463053895}, "language": "english", "review": "+1", "timestamp_created": 1463746164, "timestamp_updated": 1463746164, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474138", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23073114": {"recommendationid": "23073114", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025047440", "num_games_owned": 308, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 6996, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 20, "last_played": 1516767974}, "language": "english", "review": "Mobile style game, fun, easy, frustrating, life-ruining.", "timestamp_created": 1463614249, "timestamp_updated": 1463614249, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23006924": {"recommendationid": "23006924", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085440581", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 469, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471183195}, "language": "german", "review": "Triple Town ist ein wundersch\u00f6nes Spiel womit mat stundenlangen Spass mit haben kann...ABER mir gef\u00e4llt gar nicht, das man so wenig Geld bekommt.

Instead of match like tokens to clear the board. The individual is tasked to match building structure and plant foliage to build a town from scratch. Most of the matches that are made is rewarded with  two or five coins. In most cases there are treasure chests with random resources.\n\nThe coins that are earned from the gameplay are used to make purchases in the main island area. The items are very expensive it will require the individual to save up enough coins to purchase that particular item. Since there is no option of selling off extra resources. Saving up coins can turn into a mundane task to complete.\n\nThe main island, building structures only available to make, they give out certain amount of resources for earning certain amount of points during gameplay. And their max upgrade is tier ten.\n\n[h1][b]Miscellaneous[/b][/h1]\n\nThere are total of twelve different trading cards. You only get the six of those cards from the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the trading card: Purchased from Steam's Market; Trade with friends; Booster Packs and it's Booster Pack Creator.\n\nFinal thoughts, the game it's enjoyable to certain extent, even though it comes with a mundane task to complete. As for the game's replay value it's low. I would recommend this game but not at the full price.\n\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/209950", "timestamp_created": 1453136503, "timestamp_updated": 1477703202, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.665983", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20547164": {"recommendationid": "20547164", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023304520", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 14540, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513912901}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Esto es un vicio!

Because I do like this game but it does have some limitations which make it difficult to make a positive review.  Especially since this was originally a mobile phone game with microtransactions.  No, don't stop reading!  It's not as bad as the typical phone game ported to Steam.\n\nFrom the screenshots you might think this is a typical match 3 casual game.  And it is, but not like Bejeweled or other games like that.  Triple Town is all about the strategy of placement.   The main playing field (there are several variations, not just one field) is a big grid with some items already placed.  Each turn you get an item like grass or bush and you have to place it somewhere on the grid.  When you place a grass next to two other grasses they instantly combine to form a bush.  Get three bushes together and they form a tree.  Three trees form a small red house.  Three red houses form a bigger house.  3 of those form a mansion.  3 mansions form a castle.  3 castles form a sky castle.  So you can see how you can quickly run out of room.  The items you get are not totally random, there must be a variable to give a greater chance for grass and bushes since you get those the most.  \n\nYou do get random items to help, like the blue crystal which acts like a wild card to instantly make a match of any 2 items you already have on the grid.  And you can buy items with the gold coins you get (this is where the microtransactions were in the mobile version).  Like buy a bush or tree for a few coins.  But I like to save my coins for the other part of the game: your town.\n\nWhen you run out of room on the game field you go back to your town.  It's actually an island.  You build items here that use the same match 3 thing as the field but for buildings.  Like, 3 fields make a big field, 3 of those make a bale of wheat (or whatever it is), 3 of those make a store house, 3 of those make something else (I've forgotten).  There's farming, gold mining, and defense (cannons, towers, etc), Though you don't get attacked, it's just for show.  This is where I choose to use the coins I earn in the matching fields.  You can buy extra squares of land to add on to your island, extra matching items like fields or fences.  Or even a crane to move an item to a different location.  And once you're rolling in the dough (have lots of coins to spare) you can even buy decorations like letters, statues, and stuff like that to personalize your town.  \n\nI'm sure by now you can imagine the microtransactions and how much money could be spent (wasted!) on stuff in this game.  Which brings me to my point in the beginning, why I hesitate to write a positive review.  Normally I am against microtransactions.  But I love the cute graphics in this game and the strategy involved.  The bears are especially cute and the way the villagers go \"eek\" and run when the bears growl.\n\ntldr:\n\nPorted mobile game that had microtransactions\nCute graphics\nDeep strategy in placing items\nBuild your town, lots of personalization available\nBut it takes forever to get enough coins \nGet it on sale", "timestamp_created": 1451778237, "timestamp_updated": 1451778278, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.612076", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20147260": {"recommendationid": "20147260", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999524628", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 596, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452226304}, "language": "english", "review": "From my short time with the game so far, it seems pretty good, albeit rather grindy?

Got caught up in a bunch of other games, and came back to it last week, determined to get the last 2 or 3 achievements, and put in at least another 5 hours.\n\nThat might seem like a lot for what deceptively looks like such a simple game, but the crux of the matter is as follows: 1) I was determined to beat it. For neurotic achievement hunter me, that meant, another perfect game. 2) It takes a lot of planning, like playing a chess game and trying to think a dozen moves ahead. I sometimes found a scratch pad and pencil helpful for planning things out. 3) The effing bears! And lastly, 4) This game is more than a little bit addictive. You tell yourself, nope, just going to finish this building and I'm done for the night. And some bear gets in the way of a building you've been working on for the past 5 minutes, and somehow, you've got a new game going because you know you can beat it this time.\n\nI don't know that it's something that I would have shelled out $10 for.

It rewards you for getting better at it, with achievements and in-game rewards for scoring higher points. It makes you want to get good at it, because everything is easier: you get more points, more money, more assets and so forth. And sure, it's a Match 3 but you have an open grid to do whatever you want. Pretty neat. There are even little enemy bears (adorable mean fluffballs) to give you some amount of challenge.\n\nThe cons: It's likely never going to see another update again, so this is the final product - and it's kind of a small shell and a basic game. Is there a quirk of the gameplay you dislike? Too bad. My personal axe to grind, is that it takes wayyy too long to feel like you're making progress in the game. There's a little map you can customize as you earn more points: you build things, and those little buildings generate rewards and points for you. The map is its own ongoing mini-game, the actual 'objective' of Triple Town. It's a neat little system: if it didn't take a thousand years to earn enough money to buy and build anything. I'm at over 100 hours on this thing (don't judge me). I'd expect to be rolling in dough right now, but I'm lucky if I can save up to 10K before having to spend it on something for my little map. So sometimes this map's progress feels like watching paint dry.\n\nIt's a really cute game, though.

On a 6x6 board, you lay out tiles that merge into a \"better piece\" when three or more same pieces are matched. Since you build a city, this means you upgrade grass to bushes, bushes to trees, and then merge those into more and more advanced houses. Positioning your pieces is crucial because the upgraded piece appear on the tile you made the match, and with the very small board, you're constantly fighting for space. As if this wasn't enough, occasionally wandering bears will appear- you match those for cathedrals. A variant, the ninja bear, is even more distracting as it teleports around the board, and it can never be matched.\nA game ends when the board is filled, so each round is an attempt to beat your highest score- and earn resources for your \"main city\", which is a separate, larger map where you can match the earned resources into facilities and decorations.\n\nAs simple as the idea sounds (you match... grass), the game is pretty good! Once you've got the mechanics down, a round may well last a while before you succumb to bears or that One Bad Match. The \"main city\" is a nice addition, too, gicing you something larger to work for. You need special tiles to create the main city elements, wich are earned in the actual levels, or you can just spend some (in-game) money to buy your next upgrade... or something that gives you an edge during a level.\n\nTT is not flashy. The music is minimal, the graphics are clean but rather functional, and apart from some \"Simlish\" mumble and bear growls you won't hear very much. It feels a bit barebones, really. You also only get four different board layouts, and since all game elements are revealed you don't have any reason to hunt for unlocks.\n\nBut the fun thing is, it doesn't matter. Triple Towns is a great idea in a very slim, clean package. It plays really well and that's all that matters for me.\n\nFor 10 Euros, TT is hard to recommend. There are more varied, more exiting, and more varied Match 3 games on Steam for that money.\nBut! Keep it on your wishlish, wait for a sale or daily deal- and then get it.

Triple Town aims to reduce the role that luck plays on your game while emphasizing the importance of strategy. As you progress, you'll be forced to think several stages ahead. Say you're building a house; you should know where your last hut needs to go and plan backwards from there. Obviously this can get pretty complicated at the more advanced stages. There are some chaotic elements. Bears can quickly become a nuisance if you don't plan ahead for them. Ninja bears are even worse because they can't be contained like normal bears and can only be killed by filling all tiles on the map or by using a rare item on them. They're also the only thing that can really screw up your game even if you're playing well. There is a map without bears but you'll have fewer tiles to build on. This map is useful for getting the highest achievements. Overall, I highly recommend this. I think it's a must have for any fan of strategy and puzzle games.

N\u00e4r du bygger st\u00e4der skapar du samtidigt guld (och andra r\u00e5varor) som \u00e4r t\u00e4nkta att hj\u00e4lpa dig att bygga din huvudstad. (Du kan r\u00e4kna med att tj\u00e4na ungef\u00e4r 150-300 guldmynt per tio minuters speltid.)\nHuvudstadsbyggandet f\u00f6ljer samma princip som bybyggandet.

Det tycker jag \u00e4r av godo. Problemet \u00e4r bara att IAP-mekaniken finns d\u00e4r. I m\u00e5nga andra spel kan du v\u00e4lja att antingen betala en liten slant eller grinda under en l\u00e5ng tid f\u00f6r att f\u00e5 det du vill ha. \nF\u00f6r spel som saknar IAP vore det [i]rimligt[/i] att grinda under en rimligt l\u00e5ng tid, men tyv\u00e4rr \u00e4r s\u00e5 inte fallet h\u00e4r. \n\nDu b\u00f6rjar med en \u00f6 som best\u00e5r av 5 * 5 block. (Jag tror \u00e5tminstone att det \u00e4r startstorleken.)\nDu kan bygga ut \u00f6n genom att placera ut nya block och det \u00e4r ocks\u00e5 h\u00e4r problemen b\u00f6rjar. Ett enda nytt block kostar 4 500 guldmynt. Du kan \u00e4ven k\u00f6pa fem p\u00e5 samma g\u00e5ng f\u00f6r 20 000 guldmynt.

You match 3 building blocks to create a single block that is \"one up\". For example combine 3 grass tiles to make a bush and then combine 3 bushes to make a tree and so on. There is also the added difficulty of bears spawning on your grid which, put simply you need to kill.

You must link together at least three items of a kind in a vertical or horizontal chain, these chains can zig-zag and connect together a great many items, merging them into the next item up in quality of the same item base.  The three base unit types you have are Rocks, Bears, and Plants.

I can understand why people like it and it got so popular. However, even though the PC version has no microtransactions (praise Gaben), the free-to-play roots still show through in the structure of the game, and it's worse for it. In a puzzle game based on skill, where your goal is to see how long you can survive/how far you can progress/how many points you can score in a single run, having an inventory of items you can (literally) farm that carry over between runs feels...dirty.\n\nUnless you want to play a self-enforced challenge of willfully ignoring that part of the game, the optimal strategy is not to have the most skill at the game (or at least not JUST to have the most skill), but to spend x number of hours grinding to fill your inventory, THEN to wait until you're having a good run and burn through all your items to keep it going as long as possible. Want to try again? Waste another day. Why does this make the game better? It doesn't, because they're not making any money off you in this version. It's the taint of something that was originally designed to be a money siphon and not to play off its strengths, which it does have plenty of in terms of good design.\n\nIt's like if someone came up with Tetris today, and you could win spare pieces after each game you play if you do well, which you could stock up on. It would completely change the flow of the game from, \"Gee, I did pretty well. I bet I can do better next time!\" to, \"Dang it. I just blew through all my straight pieces.

Exemple : 3 touffes d'herbe font un buisson, 3 buissons font un arbre, 3 arbres font une petite maison, etc.\nParfois, des ours viendront envahir le plateau et vous emp\u00eacheront de poser les \u00e9l\u00e9ments o\u00f9 vous le souhaitez. Il faudra donc s'occuper d'eux, et les grouper \u00e9galement.\nChaque \u00e9l\u00e9ment pos\u00e9 ou assembl\u00e9 rapporte des points. L'objectif est de faire le score le plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 possible. La partie s'arr\u00eate lorsque votre plateau est plein et que vous ne pouvez plus rien y placer. Vos points vous d\u00e9bloquent des \u00e9l\u00e9ments \u00e0 assembler sur votre \u00eele : une petite parcelle de terrain persistante sur laquelle vous construisez un peu ce que vous voulez / pouvez.\n\nLa strat\u00e9gie du jeu r\u00e9side donc dans le placement des \u00e9l\u00e9ments : comment faire pour ne jamais se retrouver bloqu\u00e9 ?\n\nPlusieurs types de partie sont disponibles : la quantit\u00e9 d'ours importuns et la structure du terrain varieront l\u00e9g\u00e8rement d'un type \u00e0 l'autre.\n\nAu premier abord, ce jeu est plut\u00f4t sympathique : les graphismes enfantins mignons, les petits personnages qui commencent \u00e0 se promener sur le plateau quand vous avez quelques maisons, etc. L'ambiance est attirante.\nLe principe du jeu, loin d'\u00eatre r\u00e9volutionnaire, est int\u00e9ressant pour les gens qui aiment bien se creuser un peu la t\u00eate (mais pas trop quand m\u00eame). Une partie est plut\u00f4t rapide (selon votre niveau bien s\u00fbr...), ce qui permet de faire des parties occasionnelles, quand vous avez 15 min \u00e0 perdre.\n\nLe gros point noir du jeu d'apr\u00e8s moi : la dur\u00e9e de vie.\nMalgr\u00e9 les quelques succ\u00e8s qui permettent d'avoir des objectifs et le mini \"chez soi\" \u00e0 personnaliser, le jeu devient tr\u00e8s vite r\u00e9p\u00e9titif. Une fois qu'on a fait les 4 ou 5 types de parties une dizaine de fois chacune, on commence \u00e0 avoir fait un peu le tour... On s'aper\u00e7oit rapidement que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments int\u00e9ressants \u00e0 placer sur l'\u00eele perso nous co\u00fbteront de tr\u00e8s nombreuses heures de jeu. La diff\u00e9rence entre les types de partie pourrait \u00eatre plus marqu\u00e9e. \nBref, m\u00eame sans y jouer souvent, on s'en lasse assez vite.

When you upgrade an object you get points for it, naturally the more advanced an upgrade is, the more points you get. You can use those points to upgrade your town, which is the hub from where you access the randomly generated levels. The town's buildings generate items that will help you during the regular levels. The bigger and better your town becomes, the more and better items you will get.\n\nThe problem with the game is that there is no goal. No special challenges, nothing to achieve other than endlessly upgrading your town. It's the same thing over and over, and that felt rather pointless to me. You could try to get the best possible upgrade of an object (there is even a Steam achievement for it), but for that you need a lot of special items, and you can only obtain those by upgrading your town and collecting more money.

However, if you want a high enough score, you have to be strategic in your placements of every object.

So if you really don't want to put any effort in, you don't have to.\n\nTriple Town is designed in a way that makes it look a lot like many Facebook games that people get addicted to (or annoyed by). Yet, it separates itself from them because you are not compelled to fork out your hard earned cash to keep playing... because there are no in-game transactions, which makes it aces in my book.\n\nWhat I really like most about the game in addition to the simplicity factor is the soundtrack. The sound of birds. It's like you're sitting out in the middle of a garden on a summer afternoon.\n\nIn short, if you want a game that requires minimal brain power (but rewards you if you put more in) that you can wind down while playing, give Triple Town a go.

into this when it first came out on Facebook. I got a Steam Key because I bought $20 worth of gold coins. Yes, I'm well aware that this is more than the purchase price here. I don't begrudge giving money to smart and deserving developers.

It is simple match three turn-based game, but the last item you place becomes the next tier up. So three bushes = 1 tree, 3 trees = 1 house, so on and so forth. It becomes a game about managing the precious space you have, and there is something very satisfactory and rewarding about putting in that one last piece and watching your board transform into a new thing you haven't seen before.\nExcept the elusive Triple Castle. Curse you! I always lose before I get to that stage.\n\nSo, there are several maps to the game. There\u2019s the main town, were the buildings you place give you resources for the other maps - little extra things you can place down to match three when you're in a tight spot. Then there are a few maps with different flavours - one where there are lots of aggressive bears who walk around and get in the way of your plans, smaller maps with no bears where you can test your building skills. It's nice to be able to switch between them when you get stuck, and also nice to pop into your town and see what's up there.\n\nYou also gain currency when you 'complete' a map which can go towards buying things to help you in future runs, so that's pretty cool.\n\nAll in all a deceptively cute casual game that can be a little hard at times. If you're looking to play something relaxing when you have a little down time, this is perhaps my favourite puzzle game to recommend.

However, I found that with proper planning you will use very little of the items in the store.  On your home island you will most often use the crane to move a mistakenly places merged level 3 or 4 tile.  Get to planning ahead to avoid this!  Save the 20K gold for the 5 tile expansion.  \n\nDo not be afraid to spend gold on the colony boards!!  Bushes are cheap at 150 gold and get you out of a pile of trouble.

It's a match 3 game where you have the goal of building a small settlement in a new land. Other than that there's not much more story to speak of. You can play for a few minutes or an hour, however long you like. \n\nBeing a port of a Facebook/Mobile game, my first fear was that it would retain certain freemium or free 2 play features like grinding or paying for in-game currency. This fear really doesn't hold and I found myself really enjoying this small joyful timewaister.\n\nIt's a match three game. So say you start off by matching three Grass pieces together, which forms a bush. If you then get three bushes together it forms into a tree, three trees into a house, three houses into a town hall and so on. If you combine more than three you gain bonus points and a chance or higher chance for a structure for your hub world. Placement takes place on a grid system, the main antagonists being rocks, water and bears. Rocks can be removed by an item you can be given a turn like you can be given a grass or a bush or a tree. Water is there to stay and bears will hop to open spaces adjacent to them each turn and turn into tombstones when there are no open spaces for them to migrate to. Three tombstones turns into a church, three churches to a chapel, I think you get the idea!\n\nMaking matches and completing levels/settlements earns you coins. Coins can be used to buy items to be used in levels or in your hub world. The hub world follows the same rules as the levels. You gain resources that you place, match three and they become a better version of that resource. You use the hub world to embark on different level types like levels without bears or without water. The hubworld also allows you to personalize it a little. It's clear on the facebook and mobile versions this is where it would cost you actual money, but here it is just based on your actual progress, not income. And it is not necessary or made in a way where you are forced to grind.\n\nTriple Town is not completely devoid of strategy, letting you save at least one \"piece\" for later use, allowing special items that remove rocks or other structures on the level. But This never gets stressful with its adorable art style. It can be as casual or as in depth as you want, with the only limiter being the luck of the draw each turn and how far you plan ahead.\n\nIf you want an adorable, uplifting time-relief, you can't find a much better game than this. I've normally played this before heading out somewhere, played this on my laptop, played while I was downloading something or while watching TV.\n", "timestamp_created": 1394189980, "timestamp_updated": 1394189980, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505929", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9325711": {"recommendationid": "9325711", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969074367", "num_games_owned": 679, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 1043, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1424617346}, "language": "english", "review": "Cute and fun puzzle game.

On those platforms, the game advertises itself as free-to-play, but is actually not. If you want to play more than a limited number of turns per day, you have to pay a one-time fee of about $4. Triple Town developers have also devised other means to suck your money, by selling in-game currency, or cosmetic improvements. For what is ultimately a simple match-3 game disguised as free-to-play entertainment, the bill can therefore quickly inflate. Especially as the game is designed to make you want to trade your real cash against the in-game currency. \n\nFor you see, the in-game currency you earn at the end of a session, or from your meta-game buildings, is incredibly small when compared to the costs of the items from the in-game shop. It can literally take several hours before you can buy anything remotely useful.\n\nOn PC, where the game will cost you money upfront ($10, outside of sales), you of course get unlimited turns from the start, and there is no built-in real money micro-transaction. That doesn't mean that you get everything the mobile version has to offer against your initial investment. Oooh no\u2026 Instead, many things are forever out of your reach: no cosmetic upgrade and no graphical themes for you! And you\u2019d be wrong to think that the absence of real-money micro-transaction means a better balance between rewards and item costs.\n\nI know that all those optional extras (graphical themes, in-game shop\u2026) can be ignored, no matter how distastefully they serve the developer\u2019s business model. But the fact is that the core game quickly shows its limits too. There is just not enough variety to sustain lasting fun. Game after game, you\u2019ll be doing the same things with the same elements. Getting better only means that a game lasts more turns, not that you reach a further stage. There are several levels to select at the start of the game, but the difference is limited to the size of the starting grid or the frequency of bear appearances. Depending on your tolerance for repetitiveness, Triple Town will start feeling tiresome after two to five hours.\n\nConclusion: Triple Town is built on a promising twist of the match-3 formula, with limited but cute audio-visual assets. Its mechanisms are however too limited to provide lasting appeal. Add to that a misleading and greedy micro-transaction scheme on the mobile versions, or limitations to the PC version features, and you get a casual game that is very hard to recommend. There are many match-3 games on the market that are polished, provide variety and are honest about how they want your money, like \u201cBejeweled 3\u201d and \u201c4 Elements\u201d, to name just a few.

My problem with the game is that the dev didn't qute address the fact that this game was purchased - now your only source of coin income is constantly replaying towns, which make it an EXTREME grind to improve, grow, and customize your kingdom. It also feels that tthe game is stingy with giving you higher level placables (trees, huts, churches) and gives you a ton of grass and the occasional bush that more often than not, comes at a bad time. This game could really use a placable that lets you move objects and/or make the undo button less expensive and have more or unlimited uses...after all, the whole point of limited uses was to force players to pay for coins, but I'VE ALREADY PAID FOR THE GAME!!!

The premise is simple: You start with a somewhat empty board, the \"city\", and then receive one component per turn, which you need to place on the board. Three of the same kind result in one piece of the next higher tier. For example, three bunches of grass give you a bush, and three (or more) bushes connected horizontally or vertically give you a tree.\n\nThe tricky part is that the resulting item appears in the spot where you put the previous item, and this is where the strategy originates from. Not only do you need to create matches on a small board, you also need to plan ahead so that future pieces fit together and you can upgrade to, say, a castle. Matching the highest tiers will grant you a treasure chest. with random loot.\n\nDepending on the mode you play in (the game offers several with individual rulesets), there will also be bears. Bears wander around the board and turn into tombstones when you trap them. Three tombstones can be matched for a church (which does give you points) and three churches give you a cathedral. Building those is extra hard because the bears move around  and trapping them may require you to clutter the board.\n\nTo make it easier, you are given a storage spot where you can swap and keep one item, and there are special components such as the bot (that removes any item from the board) and the gem (which works like a joker). There is also a shop where you can purchase items and components with gold that you get by making larger matches. This is strictly in the game, there are no in-app purchases or DLC.\n\nThe other element of the game is your permanent capital city where you can place grain fields, military buildings, etc. which yield resources. These, too, can be matched and thus upgraded. If you play well, the game gives you rewards that can be put down in your capital.\n\nOverall, Triple Town is a deeper-than-it-looks match-3 game that gets quite addictive (further made \"worse\" by there being achievements!). It's a friendly game that does not get stressful (it's all turn-based). Sadly, while the iOS version got ratings in the 80s and 90s, the identical PC version scored much lower. Different audiences, I guess.\n\nI enjoy it, but I do like match-3 ganes, turn-based strategy and puzzlers. :)", "timestamp_created": 1371706971, "timestamp_updated": 1371706971, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "3231039": {"recommendationid": "3231039", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019236779", "num_games_owned": 734, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1365, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452275482}, "language": "english", "review": "CUTE & INTERESTING!!\nWATCH OUT,  IT'S ADDICTIVE <3", "timestamp_created": 1371661320, "timestamp_updated": 1371661320, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501027", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "6358767": {"recommendationid": "6358767", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064565766", "num_games_owned": 982, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 912, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1446323060}, "language": "english", "review": "The greatest way to waste time ever (but it helps to know math).", "timestamp_created": 1371641925, "timestamp_updated": 1371641925, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "5545573": {"recommendationid": "5545573", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051675171", "num_games_owned": 1630, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 2458, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508378833}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Grata surpresa dos Trading Cards, que me saiu de gra\u00e7a por conta disso.

These objects can evolve into others by making appropriate matches (e.g. three Grasses make a Bush, three Bushes make a Tree...three Trees make a Hut...and there's more after that! ;-D). Matching more than three items, or mathcing certain high-end items will gift you different goodies that improve your score or other parts of the game! What you're given to place each time is random, but you can place these objects in any free space you want (with the objects melding where you place the last item in the cluster), so there's more strategy involved than the average Match 3.\n\nBesides building materials, there are helpful items, like the Crystal, which is a wild card that completes matches (often important for much easier matching of high-end items!), but placing them without a Match makes a Boulder. Match three Boulders with the Crystals, however, and you'll get a Mountain that contains a Treasure Chest that contains a random prize. To get the Chest you need the Imperial Robot, which also lets you get rid of an unwanted item (most items penalize your score when destroyed, though...keep that in mind).\n\nBut watch out, there are Bears and Ninja Bears who'll try to impede your building! If you can trap a Bear or use an Imperial Robot on him, he turns into a Tombstone, and if you can trap three or more bears, the resulting Tombstones turn into a Church, and three of those make a Cathedral, and three of those make a Treasure Chest. Ninja Bears jump around and mostly can only be stopped by the Imperial Robot.\n\nThere are more items such as Fortune Cookies (which tell you the next five items that you'll be given to use), and Crates (which let you temporarily stash an item on the map), but these are gotten through the Shop and the Captiol City (more on those later!).\n\nIf you can't place something in a good spot right away, there's a little space set aside on each level where you can save an item, hopefully for a better use later in your game.\n\nWhen you do run out of space (hopefully later rather than sooner!), your score is finalized, and you win some Coins and Capitol City materials (more on those in a bit!). If you need to stop playing a level, you can pick up where you left off later. There is no limit to how many times you can play a level; if you start a new level after finishing one, a new one is rolled for you!\n\nThere are six different kinds of levels: \"Standard colony\" (self-explainitory), \"City on a lake\" (actually, it's a \"Standard colony\" with a small lake in the center), \"Peaceful Valley\" (island with no Bears!), \"A dangerous forest\" (island with lots of Bears!), \"City on an island\" (small island). You can also revisit the Tutorials that you play the first time you launch the game, if you wish. You visit these from the Capitol City hub, which you build and improve mainly by making matches, too! You'll mainly get the materials from playing the game. The highest level buildings in your town will gift you materials and items everytime you earn so many points at a time in levels!\n\nThere is also a shop system that lets you buy building objects and helpful items with coins that you win in-game, mainly by completing levels. There are two different shops; one for the colonies, and one for the Capitol City. The colony shop lets you buy materials and items, but they're limited in supply, and replenish after so many turns. But if you've got the money, they can help you keep building for longer! The Capitol Shop lets you buy materials, Decorations, Expansion Tiles, and a Crane that lets you pick up and move an item to a better spot. These will cost you, though, so build some colonies!\n\nThere are personal High Score lists for each level, and 10 Achievements to earn. Recently, support for Steam's new Trading Card program has been added, too.\n\nOverall, this is a great and different Match 3 game! Definitely check it out! :-D", "timestamp_created": 1370652360, "timestamp_updated": 1385406248, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504160", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "3207731": {"recommendationid": "3207731", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018938343", "num_games_owned": 1154, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 457, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1396684522}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u4e00\u56de\u904a\u3073\u3060\u3057\u305f\u3089\u6b62\u307e\u3089\u306a\u3044\u9b54\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0", "timestamp_created": 1370612648, "timestamp_updated": 1370612648, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497742", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "4673380": {"recommendationid": "4673380", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040623554", "num_games_owned": 223, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1456, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1426068024}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game.", "timestamp_created": 1370607184, "timestamp_updated": 1370607184, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "1874748": {"recommendationid": "1874748", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999157594", "num_games_owned": 954, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 179, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471571496}, "language": "english", "review": "Triple Town is one of the best puzzle games on iOS, and the Steam version brings a few differences.

The game handles the entire process, from picking who you'd think would be an excellent match for your client out of a list of potential dates, having your client dress or bring gifts that will give them an edge in the date, picking a place to eat that's compatible with the date's social status, and handling the weird (and sometimes hilarious) random situations that can arise and ruin the date no matter how well they were hitting it off before.  You also act as a wingman and tell them what to say to try to make the date run smoother.  After successful dates there are updates on the couples, either good or bad, because let's face it, not all dates end up in successful long term relationships.\n\nMost of the aspects of the games are handled by means of mini games.  Some of the mingames require basic memory skills.  Other mingames (such as having your client try to lie their way out of a sticky situation) are completely random.\n\nYou are able to make your own avatar that will go on other player's dates.  You answer a few multiple choice questions to determine your \"type\".  The game parodies different stereotypical \"types\" such as Glam, Hippy, Geek, etc.  But it's all done in fun and with a lot of love.  Speaking of love, there are no limits to the dating options.  There are straight, same sex, and bisexual options. (a plus for me)\n\nIt's a game from the UK so there might be some slang words that are unfamiliar, but that shouldn't be a turn off to anyone.  And you get to learn about some cuisine from around the world.  (one minor gripe is the music choice for the \"Japanese\" restaurant (what, no benten bayashi?) , but I'm guessing I'm the only one that was bothered by it)\n\nWhat is has over a lot of your typical \"dating sim\" style of games is its realism.  Everyone has their own opinions, turn ons, and turn offs about everything, and they don't always agree with yours or your client's.  Even if the characters are hitting it off, something disasterous can still happen on the date.  That sort of \"realism\" is kind of refreshing.\n\nAll in all I think it's a fun and endearing game.  It's silly and cheeky, but surprisingly addictive.", "timestamp_created": 1515358532, "timestamp_updated": 1515358532, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39124626": {"recommendationid": "39124626", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148937873", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 242, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 23, "last_played": 1515258601}, "language": "english", "review": "It still continues to make me very happy to know that there's a game that stars a drag queen.

That took me quite a long time (and about four approaches), but finally I got to [spoiler]pair-up Kitty[/spoiler], so I consider it some form of ending. \n\n\"Kitty Powers' Matchmaker\" looked like a perfect game for me - it didn't take itself seriously, it has great style, it has humor, romance (with LGBT options), fun minigames and aspects of pure randomness, which I absolutely love. Sadly, something didn't quite work out for me.\n\nThe game has all charm in the world, but it gets boring really quickly - it has a progression system, where you buy upgrades and unlock new options as you go along, but that wasn't enough to keep me interested in moving forward. I've restarted game few times (as I don't like to pick up where I left after long break), and first few dates are always the most interesting and engaging, but once the initial feeling of uniqueness wears off, the content gets very repetitive. Also, I find pairing up low-star folks more enjoyable - it's much easier and dates go very fast, when compared to three star customers or VIPs. Those are, understandably, more demanding, but not nearly enough rewarding, to make it fun, instead of frustrating.\n\nDespite my lack of interest, I still give this game a positive review, as it does many things right - I loved the art style, Kitty is amazing, there are funny moments, good mini-games and great ideas thrown there. I'm waiting for a next game from Magic Notion, hoping that it will turn out to be more engaging, because the potential is definitely there. \n\nIf you like dating games, I recommend to pick this one out during sale and see if it's something you enjoy.", "timestamp_created": 1488604091, "timestamp_updated": 1488604191, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.717177", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30272365": {"recommendationid": "30272365", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156483383", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 664, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499110965}, "language": "english", "review": "Kitty Powers' Matchmaker is honestly one of my favorite past time games, where I'm feeling like I'm not in the mood for a story, but also not in the mindset for PVP related games.

It's a very casual game for those, who wanna try to play the covet role of cupid, and try to match even the most odd pairings.\n\nAnyways what I love most about Kitty Powers' Matchmaker, is it's openness to sexualites unlike most western-released dating simulators, where they don't bare any LGBT relationships. Kitty Powers' offers freedom and equality, with all the characters being derpy like one another. \n\nMy only negatives is wising for the game to become more developed and offering a variety of different scenarios and outcomes.

The dates are all about paying attention to the prospective partner and trying to find common ground. Not only do you get points for pairing off your customers, but you will also get letters with updates on how the relationship worked out in the long run. This means that even though you can speed through a date, hide your weaknesses and pull a few \"white lies\", you will need to be honest and find really good matches to get those A+ results (necessary for getting the baby achievement). \n\nAll this adds up to a fun, charming and well-designed game which I recommend with all of my heart!", "timestamp_created": 1480422259, "timestamp_updated": 1480422259, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511818", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28011396": {"recommendationid": "28011396", "author": {"steamid": "76561198175543469", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2383, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481205143}, "language": "english", "review": "Got the game after watching a play through and didn't regret it.\nIt's fun to be a matchmaker for (mostly) weird characters and a casual\ngame play is enjoyable.

Sadly the game quickly goes downhill after the first hour or so, when you realise that practicaly every date is the same thing but with minor differences, and how A LOT of it relies on RNG. A lot of the crucial data about your client's potential dates is hidden meaning that you often have to just pick someone randomly and hope that it works. When the two characters talk you will often encounter a situation when your client won't like something about their date and you can tell them to lie. In this situation the success is determined by... a fortune wheel. Playing F2P mobile games made me hate these things with passion, and there they are even more vile, since failing this minigame gives you a strike - 3 strikes and the date is a fail. If the partner of your date hates something about them, they just say it straight which can either bring your client down or GIVE YOU A STRIKE WITHOUT ANY CHANCE TO PREVENT IT (well, about that later...)\n\nDuring the date there are simple minigames, for example the date says \"I want something spicy\", and you pick one of the three dishes for them. Pretty straightforward. But there are many other minigames that can happen during the date, and it's annoying how many of them rely on RNG. Like a memory game. Or picking if the next card will be a lower one or a higher one. All of them are associated with some situation, like your character telling a story or... trying not to fart (10 minute long laugh track). Like I said, 80 percent of them are RNG, and the only ones that are different are just based on remembering shit or a simple math problem. Booooooooooooring.\n\nSo yeah, you do the date, it goes either good or bad (of course the first option is the best) and then you get dat sweeeet moneeeeeeey my guy. \n\nAs you progress in the game you unlock shit like new restaurants (which get harder over time, but it's the only real difference between them) or options to prepare your client for the date with new clothes or hairstyle. This is a very important feature since it lets you prevent some of the annoying RNG related to the preferences different partners have, but many of these are locked for a long time and you're forced to endure the random chance until you can do it about it.\n\nAnd they cost money, often a lot of it. So you need to drop a ton of money on a character hoping that you will get paid enough to cover all the expenses. So failing dates is even more annoying since you pretty much lose money.\n\n\nIn all, a RNG grindfest, don't buy.\n\n\n\n\nDear Kitty Powers' Matchmaker\n\nI remember the first day we met. I heard dozens of people talking about how funny and original you are. When we saw each other for the first time, it was love at first sight. The time we spent together was wonderful. I loved your naughty sense of humour, creative ideas, cartoonish appearance and open minded nature.\nBut as our meetings became longer and more frequent, things started to change. You gave me this weird challenges that were pretty much luck based, and when I failed sometimes you would punish me, and sometimes you would forgive everything. It was like I had to spin a wheel of fortune everytime I messed up! And I'm not even talking about the times when you forced me to struggle with hard tasks that were often full of random unfair obstacles!\nSure, sometimes you had something different in store, but how was that supposed to be refreshing when it was all either memory games or random luck?\n\nI tried to make our meetings exciting, but you wouldn't cooperate. We kept doing the same things over and over, and when you suggested something different, it was as boring as everything else. Sure, you promised a lot, but you wanted me to spend hours doing the same thing with you first!\n\nSo, I think you know what I'm going to do.\n\nYou're nothing but a pretty box that promises tons of fun, but I kept getting out the same boring things and couldn't get to the \"super cool thing\" you had on the bottom.\n\nI can't help but feel that the time we spent together was wasted.\n\nI'm sorry, but that's it.", "timestamp_created": 1474195085, "timestamp_updated": 1498413508, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488693", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25376520": {"recommendationid": "25376520", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118589142", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 343, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500861206}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game, even though it's really simple, I can't stop myself from playing it.\nIt's pretty much about hooking people up and making your stats go up as a dating expert! \nI love how you get to see avatars people have actually created, and the choices are endless. \nIt has mini games, puzzles and goes a lot on the luck side.\nDo you think you're lucky enough to help people find dates? xD", "timestamp_created": 1473144375, "timestamp_updated": 1473144375, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501682", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25129680": {"recommendationid": "25129680", "author": {"steamid": "76561198237775148", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 378, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507916948}, "language": "dutch", "review": "Zeer leuk spel!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1472121299, "timestamp_updated": 1472121299, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25088880": {"recommendationid": "25088880", "author": {"steamid": "76561198160704214", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 333, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449360559}, "language": "english", "review": "why would u", "timestamp_created": 1471948847, "timestamp_updated": 1471948847, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.258932", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25083115": {"recommendationid": "25083115", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132488550", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 298, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474763716}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is really fun and its challangeing ur memory !", "timestamp_created": 1471913969, "timestamp_updated": 1471913969, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.996004", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25021924": {"recommendationid": "25021924", "author": {"steamid": "76561198259199935", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 14343, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495209068}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun, awesome, and hilarious, this game is highly addicting and very recommended!", "timestamp_created": 1471647714, "timestamp_updated": 1471647714, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.996004", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24984315": {"recommendationid": "24984315", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024439666", "num_games_owned": 154, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 870, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505371547}, "language": "english", "review": "Campy.

Play for a few minutes and take a break from the hustle and bustle of the day, or play for a few hours and go on a matchmaking marathon!\n\nI find it especially laudable that both Kitty and the developers have stood behind the game and continue to promote it, to encourage videos, and have even made appearances for the game. They have continued to update the game, and overall they have been exactly the kind of developer everyone loves. It's clear a huge amount of love and care went into this game, and I'm glad to see more people discovering and enjoying it.\n\nEven if you aren't sure if this might be your kind of game, I still suggest giving it a try. It's a lot more fun than most games in this genre can manage. It's funny, cute, sweet, and really enchanting. It pulls you in and has so many things to unlock and discover, there is so much play value to it. At its regular price it's a steal for all it has to offer, but at a sale price, I have to say you should get it immediately.\n\nGreat game, great fun, and far more entertaining than plenty of the games I've played with a higher profile. Kitty Powers will put a smile on your face and maybe inspire you to do some matchmaking of your own! Or maybe just to play one more date on the game...just one more!", "timestamp_created": 1451793996, "timestamp_updated": 1451793996, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520958", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20223924": {"recommendationid": "20223924", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021105122", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 770, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509040838}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought this after reading the reviews as I was a bit sceptical as to how much I would play it, but I love it!

There are tons of things to love about this game.  It's smart, witty and, let's face it, if drag queens ruled the world we would all have fabulous hair.  The game-play is, overall, enjoyable...with enough depth to require some brain work, but that's also a downside because I apparently don't have enough brains to make it work.  When taking on a client, Kitty tells us what \"type\" they are, which is easy enough, and we need to match the client with a compatible type, but it's difficult to figure out the type of character I'm hooking up with the client.  Each type has a number of different interests, and different types enjoy the sames interests at varying degrees, so it's hard to really figure out which characters are a good match for the client.  If they're not a match, your reputation goes down the toilet and game life begins to suck.  You can look at the guides that intrepid players have tried to compile, and even the enormous graphasaurus table is not nearly complete.  When it comes down to it, having a successful date in the game seems like little more than chance, which takes away some of the motivation to keep playing, especially after a run of miserable dates.  I don't mind putting in the time to figure out a game, but it has to be within the capacity of the human mind.  After 17 hours of play, I'm apparently the sorriest matchmaker on earth.

Sous la forme de minijeux, ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements feront appel \u00e0 votre m\u00e9moire, \u00e0 votre attention, \u00e0 votre sens de l'observation, \u00e0 vos capacit\u00e9s en calcul mental, et aussi \u00e0 la chance, entre autres. Saurez-vous par exemple calculer le montant de l'addition au moment de payer ? Vous souviendez-vous de l'apparence du serveur pour le rappeler et r\u00e9gler la note \u00e0 la fin ? Arriverez-vous \u00e0 m\u00e9moriser les centres d'int\u00e9r\u00eat du candidat, et parviendrez-vous \u00e0 retrouver sa silhouette dans le noir en cas de panne de courant ? La liste est tr\u00e8s longue.\n\nAu d\u00e9but, c'est simple et on se dit qu'on va torcher le jeu en un rien de temps. Mais au fur et \u00e0 mesure de la progression, on d\u00e9bloque de nouveaux restaurants, de nouvelles situations, toujours plus d'informations \u00e0 retenir, de nouveaux minijeux, et aussi de nouvelles possibilit\u00e9s pour perfectionner le client et l'adapter aux attentes des autres (trouver la coupe de cheveux, le maquillage ou les habits adapt\u00e9s, etc).\nEt plus on avance, plus \u00e7a devient DUR !!\nLes clients et les candidats sont de plus en plus exigeants, intol\u00e9rants, et le moindre faux pas peut totalement ruiner un rencard alors qu'au d\u00e9but, les gens ne se prenaient pas la t\u00eate. Vous devrez faire preuve d'un sang froid et d'une attention \u00e0 toute \u00e9preuve, car tout peut basculer d'un moment \u00e0 l'autre. En plus, rater des rencards fait plonger votre client dans la d\u00e9pression, et il finit par quitter l'agence en nuisant \u00e0 votre r\u00e9putation. Au contraire, un couple r\u00e9ussi la fait remonter et rapporte de l'argent.\n\nLes candidats et les clients sont g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9s al\u00e9atoirement, ou encore mieux, le jeu r\u00e9cup\u00e8re le profil des autres joueurs sur Internet et les transforme en candidats anonymes, ce qui donne une infinit\u00e9 de possibilit\u00e9s, aussi bien physiques que personnelles niveau informations. De nombreux crit\u00e8res d\u00e9finissent les personnages et sont pris en compte lors du rendez-vous : pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence sexuelle, couleurs des cheveux/yeux, style vestimentaire, signe astrologique, profession, loisirs, traits de personnalit\u00e9, mauvaises habitudes, et j'en passe. Vous ne tomberez donc jamais deux fois sur la m\u00eame personne. \n\nLe jeu ne se termine jamais, car une fois le niveau maximal atteint, vous ouvrez une filiale dans une autre ville, et vous continuez. D\u00e9tail marrant, si vous arrivez \u00e0 trouver l'amour \u00e0 votre client, il vous \u00e9crira pour vous donner des nouvelles de son couple. Parfois \u00e7a se transformera en mariage, en heureux \u00e9v\u00e9nement, en vie de couple stable, ou en rupture d\u00e9gueulasse au bout d'\u00e0 peine 2 jours. Un certain nombre de situations sont propos\u00e9es, et elles affecteront \u00e0 nouveau votre r\u00e9putation, qui pourra baisser en cas d'\u00e9chec de la relation. Eh oui, l'\u00e9chec dans la r\u00e9ussite, c'est pas vicieux, \u00e7a ? En contrepartie, ils peuvent vous offrir des cadeaux en remerciement si leur couple marche !\n\nLes personnages sont vari\u00e9s, les situations aussi : clients/candidats masculins, f\u00e9minins, h\u00e9t\u00e9ros, gay, bi, nombreux styles de personnalit\u00e9 propos\u00e9s (Sportif, nerd, chic, hippie, hipster et tous les autres). La compatibilit\u00e9, c'est bien, mais la prise de risque est \u00e9galement r\u00e9compens\u00e9e.\n\nPar souci d'objectivit\u00e9, on va citer quelques points n\u00e9gatifs :\n- Lorsque vous avez fait le tour du jeu (\u00e7a prend du temps), vous connaissez par coeur les diff\u00e9rents \u00e9v\u00e9nements, ce qui ne les rend pas plus faciles, mais juste un peu redondants.\n- A haut niveau, quelques moments rageants car certaines situations \u00e9chappent \u00e0 tout contr\u00f4le pour des raisons que vous ne comprenez qu'apr\u00e8s. Mais vous ne pouviez pas le deviner, donc parfois c'est juste de la chance pure et simple.\n- Les traits de personnalit\u00e9 sont tellement nombreux que certains sont un peu incoh\u00e9rents entre eux, m\u00eame si \u00e7a reste rare (exemple le plus simple : un sportif qui passe ses journ\u00e9es \u00e0 la salle de gym et se dope aux hormones, mais qui se d\u00e9crit comme fain\u00e9ant et pas dynamique du tout... un peu bizarre).\n\nMalgr\u00e9 \u00e7a, c'est un tr\u00e8s bon jeu, on s'amuse bien, \u00e7a peut m\u00eame agr\u00e9menter une petite soir\u00e9e entre amis ou avec le/la conjoint(e) pour s'entraider. En plus, le prix est extr\u00eamement abordable !\nVivement recommand\u00e9 !!", "timestamp_created": 1447648987, "timestamp_updated": 1447681943, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.642664", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19086182": {"recommendationid": "19086182", "author": {"steamid": "76561198212837104", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459707020}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a GREAT timewaster.

After a long 12 hours of playing this game, I can assure you this game is an absolute addiction! I shall present my TOP 3 REASON for you to consider this game in your collection! \n\nTOP REASON\n1. Everyone just loves Kitty Powers, who won't? She is the QUEEN!\n \n2. Each and every one of the clients who step into the agency is just a unique human being as any real human being are. It is just like a real-life online match-making service and that is the main key why this game is so much fun! You won't and will probably never meet the same client, EVER!\n\n3. Surprises and surprises! Honestly, the best part of the game, at least to my opinion, is the moment you receive letters from the pairings whom you succeeded in pairing. The letters are fairly mysterious and I LOVE it. Whether the pairings go happily ever after or the relationship didn't work out is 50/50 which makes me absolutely amused.", "timestamp_created": 1445370953, "timestamp_updated": 1462048680, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18565823": {"recommendationid": "18565823", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054547267", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1151, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467205759}, "language": "english", "review": "I've bought this game on the app store after a few hours of purchasing the game on steam. \nThis is a game where you bring two lovers together for Kitty Powers',a hilarious ,pretty self explainatory.\n \nThe core game mechanics would be made up by many mini-games that you can level up and buy upgrades to please your clients and get more sucessful dates. It can give off the repetitive feeling since you're basically doing the same thing over and over again.\nOne of the game mechanics I thoroughly enjoyed would be the matchmaking system. Leveling up will give you more options to make conversations between your client and his/her match. There are groups of clubs that you can advertise to gain more clients. \n\nAn interesting part of the game that made it stand-out would be the integrated matchmaking system where your created character can be matched by other players by either using your facebook account or steam. I did not get the chance to see my character being matched but I did match up a lot of other players with a bonus reward of cash and xp. I liked how bringing up bad dates would lower your reputation thus making it harder to get more cash. \n\nThe only bad news I can say would be that personally for me the game crashed quite often but as long as I just verified my integrity cache,it was fine. It would also be great if the developers made an option to be able to merge your character if you bought the game on another platform so you didn't have to start all over again. \n\nWould I recommend this game?\nSure,it's a good game to lose yourself and relax.

In Kitty Powers' YOU'RE the one pulling the strings, which means you WATCH the failure, YOU'RE not the failure.

Coincidentally, if you're not into goofy, cartoonish things, I don't want to know you :)\n-The Mailbox. It's SO DEPRESSING when a couple you thought was PERFECT for each other breaks up.\n\nOverall, for the $9.99 price, I say Kitty Powers' Matchmaker is definately worth the buy.

Apr\u00e8s tout, ca fait plus de 20 ans que je m'interesse aux jeux vid\u00e9os, j'ai finit par me rendre compte que la seule r\u00eagle qui comptait, c'\u00e9tait que peu importe le jeu, la premi\u00e8re impression est toujours bien meilleure que l'impression qu'on a manette en main. Ainsi, beaucoup de jeux vendu comme incroyable sont en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 pas terrible... Donc si on applique cette regle partout, on imagine facilement ce que ca donne sur un jeu qui de base n'avait d\u00e9ja pas l'air interessent. Non mais serieux ? Un simulateur de rencontre, c'est un truc de fille, aucune chance que ca m'interesse.\n\nCela dit, si je suis un grand pessimiste, je suis aussi quelqu'un de tr\u00e8s curieux et j'aime l'originalit\u00e9. Ainsi, j'ai du entendre parler de ce jeu sur youtube et je me suis rendu compte que pass\u00e9 les apparences, ce jeu met \u00e0 l'\u00e9preuve des comp\u00e9tences que l'on a pas toujours l'habitude d'utiliser dans le jeu vid\u00e9o. Je pourais notament parler de la m\u00e9moire \"courte\", de l'observation et de l'attention, 3 domaines dans lesquelles je suis apocalyptiquement mauvais. En tout cas, j'ai du voir ca comme un d\u00e9fi. Heureusement que le jeu demande d'autres comp\u00e9tences ou je suis moins mauvais comme la logique, le calcule mental ou la gestion du facteur chance pour ne citer qu'elles.\n\nJe pense qu'au vu de son prix, l'experience vaut le coup. Perso, je pense que je vais y jouer une trentaine d'heures ce qui ferait un rapport \"temps de jeu/prix\" d'\u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s 4 ce qui serait excellent (sachant que pour moi, un ratio de 2 est d\u00e9ja tout \u00e0 fait correct). Tout cela pour dire que je suis une andouille pr\u00e9tentieuse et qu'a l'avenir, je ferai plus attention aux jeux qui cachent un potentiel insoup\u00e7onn\u00e9.\n\nHum, je ne l'ai pas dit mais le jeu est en anglais, gardez donc google et google trad en arri\u00e8re plan... Je suis sur que m\u00eame un anglais en aurait besoin tellement certaines fiches de perso sont improbables... Mais c'est ca qui est bon.\n\nDerni\u00e8re chose, le jeu est \u00e0 l'heure actuelle class\u00e9 par la communaut\u00e9 comme un jeu d'horreur psychologique. Ca n'est pas pour rien, les menus sont tellement rose qu'il y a un fort risque que nous autres, hommes viriles en soyons traumatis\u00e9s. La nuit qui a suivit ma 1\u00e8re partie a \u00e9t\u00e9 pour ainsi dire cauchemardesque. J'ai r\u00eav\u00e9 d'un monde color\u00e9 remplis de licornes avec leur corne empaleuse et d'ours en peluche mangeurs d'hommes... Brrrr. Ce jeu n'est donc pas \u00e0 mettre entre toutes les mains.

This game is completely unique to anything I've ever played before, and it combines so many elements!  Let's start with clientele!  First you choose a location (disco, gym, comic book store, ect.) for Kitty to set up fliers to attract customers.  The locations you pick determine the type of clients that arrive; for example, choosing the comic book store will bring in the \"Geeky\" types.  Each client is different, varying in looks, personality, and interests.  Because of the uniqueness of each character, it can be hard finding the right match for your client, but that's what makes it so much fun!  Will your client swing a home-run of strike out on their date(s)?  \n\nThe actual dates are the most intricate part of the entire game.   Literally everything has a part in determining the success of the date, from choosing a restaurant to holding in your farts!  There are fun mini-games to be played that vary with each establishment you go to.  Leveling up unlocks new restaurants for clients to visit and different features in the salon to beautify your client before the big date!  \n\nThere is quite a lot of memorization involved in the game, so it can get tough once you reach the higher scoring dates, but I don't believe it distracts from the overall entertainment of the game.  \n\nMy favorite thing about the game is the mailbox feature.  After successfully setting up your client with a hot date, you will receive mail from he or she updating you on how things are progressing in their new relationship.  Sometimes things go sour and the couple breaks up, but sometimes they'll end up with children and even name one of the babies after you!  It all comes down to how well you do when playing matchmaker.", "timestamp_created": 1439621010, "timestamp_updated": 1439621010, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503258", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17537887": {"recommendationid": "17537887", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137180303", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 79, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1438275993}, "language": "english", "review": "Kitty Powers is a fun funny game 10/10 would recommend it!", "timestamp_created": 1439572804, "timestamp_updated": 1439572804, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500044", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17481282": {"recommendationid": "17481282", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158490923", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 512, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494161739}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is funny and morifing", "timestamp_created": 1439255427, "timestamp_updated": 1439255427, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500044", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17457568": {"recommendationid": "17457568", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094166685", "num_games_owned": 323, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 597, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471203914}, "language": "english", "review": "I relly don't like it.

This one is a little different, however, because rather than going on dates yourself, you pair up other lonely hearts and send them on dates in an attempt to help them find their soulmate.  It's set up in a game show-type fashion, where you watch your client and their date through secret cameras and tell them what to say to their date in an attempt to impress them.  If you can't impress them, however, you will lose reputation points and undoubtedly hold your head in shame.  One negative thing that I must bring attention to is that this game gets stupid hard later on.  It may just be the fact that my skillz just aren't mad enough, but I'm a little too dense to figure out the date's type based on their interests, which is something you must know for maxium chances of success.  It would be nice if you could see their type along with the rest of their info.  Another thing that I'm not so keen on is the randomness of the mini games which can get pretty frustrating.  Sure, you can cheat, but only if you have enough coins.  But I suppose the random aspect is all part of the fun, kinda like Mario Party.  Overall, this is a fun, simple game that I must admit is pretty addicting, even if it is a little difficult.

I saw a Let's Play of this game and decided I needed it in my life. The Kitty Powers character - while I don't personally like her - is very reminiscent of the Lily Savage style character, a fun but fabulous drag queen who rocks it. \n\nThe gameplay itself has you setting up clients with potential dates and trying to make the right matches for them based on personality type and more. It gets pretty nuanced which is pretty cool. \n\nBut that's not all, you're also a fly on the wall in each date, the client has an earpiece through which you tell them what to say. You have to work out what the date wants to eat from clues like \"I want something cold with no meat. And no wheat.\" You play a slot machine for conversation topics. You'll have to choose whether to lie or tell the truth on some of your answers, whether you think the date will be pleased or not. If you lie, you spin the 'Wheel of Misfortune' to see if you got away with it or not, with the chance of winning bonus coins. The coins you use in the shop to unlock add-ons to the salon where you can do your client up before their date, unlock more pages of potential dates, and unlock more retaurants. Each restaurant unlock adds in a new \"thing\" in to a date. For example, one restaurant unlock throws in the chance for your client's ex to randomly show up and you have to decide whether to be honest about who it was or lie. The date will either care greatly, or not. If you lie, you get the Wheel of Misfortune and if they don't believe you, as before, it's a strike. You get 3 strikes in a date. If you get 3, they walk out. Oh and if your client gets dumped they get a broken heart. If they are dumped 3 times, they storm out and you lose a bunch of reputation.\n\nTL;DR - It's a very pink, camp game with a really fun centre and I'm bloody addicted.

Where the game picks you, as much as you pick the game. Kitty Powers is one such game. It's a strange beast, being made up of one part casual coating, one part extremely devious memory games and puzzle minigame, and one part hideous pink topping. Had this been the same mechanics in any other presentation (say, a popcap game), this game would be literally flying off of digital shelves all over the place. The problem stems from well, the insane use of pink, but more of that shortly. Let's get into what the game is about.\n\n[H1]A dating simulator that's actually mechanically interesting? Say it ain't so![/H1]\n\nYou are a fresh hire in the ever expanding world of the Kitty Powers Matchmaking empire. You have been given a franchise branch in a city, and it's your job to service the city by matching people up and sending them off to find love and happiness (or at least make you enough money to keep you in profit). To this end Kitty Powers furnishes you with two hundred \"Kitty Coins\", a Kitty Powers office which would make Kerry Katona weep tears of joy, and introduces you with a step by step tutorial that teaches you the ins and outs of the basics of the game, as well as introducing you to some of the most basic of the minigames you'll encounter.\n\nOnce you've completed your first tutorial date, the training wheels come off, and you can use your Kitty coins to purchase anything that's within your level. As you successfully complete dates and match couples, you'll gain reputation and experience, this unlocks more things to spend your coins on, and as it turns out, there's a lot to buy. There's a big selection of restaurants to pick up, there's a wide bevy of make-up customisation to groom your dates before the night out, as well as additional pages in Kitty's book for room for more dates to give you extra leeway in selecting possible date options. In short, this game has depth, which is surprising, it will take you time, quite a bit of it, if you want to see everything.\n\nEach restaurant comes with its' own unique events, along with a generic pool that means each restaurant encounter will be different, along with the conversation system (where you \"pull the love handle\", deities help me, that's a thing now) which not only requires you to remember the personality types of each date, but enforces harsh penalties if you repeat topics, not just on the same date, but on [i]previous dates as well[/i]. For a supposedly casual game, this one doesn't pull its' punches when it comes to the memory mini-games and layering on the difficulty over multiple dates. You get reminders about topics covered and restaurants visited with a given couple, but the game will make damn sure that you're kept on your toes. It might -look- casual, but under that cute exterior, this game has a rather steely spine.\n\n[H1]Mechanically excellent, graphically chintzy...[/H1]\n\nIt's all presented in this smooth, glossy casual style that immediately evokes memories of Popcap games, and has that easy, big button approach that makes it very straightforward, and friendly to those even with poor fine motor skills (even if the humour sails terribly close to the wind on many an occasion). The art style is very, very consistent, albeit in many cases you're going to wish that the designers had a volume dial and they used it to tone the damn thing down, the game uses neon pink liberally. Great for calibrating your monitor, not great for your eyes, have ice buckets on standby if you intend to play more than half an hour at a time.\n\nHerein lies the great contradiction at the heart of the game, the mechanics are good, and in any other game there's the foundation and the scaffolds of something really good. This game hasn't got the positive reviews it has just for being he-he-hilarious. It's got them because when you manage to get past the horrific pink, there's a really solid game under the surface. But the visual design is going to deter people, I mean it uses comic sans fer chrissakes. That's not how you win the hearts and minds of some people. But then I have concluded the audience for this game is likely not the traditional audience who plays things like say, Counter Strike or the likes. Still, softening the pink would have helped a lot.\n\n[H1]Love can be simple, except when it's not...[/H1]\n\nThe game does a really good job of translating both the concept of a dating game, something that to now has always been done pretty terribly, and the longer term effects (by sending letters) using good procedural generation techniques. It's managed this by taking itself \"not very seriously\". This game isn't afraid to poke fun at itself, the loading screens are full of self deprecating humour, the game likes to jibe about various game genres, it asks you to \"Pull the love handle\" with a straight face, it throws chintz about in the same way Max Payne threw bullets.\n\nIn turning the whole process of dating, love and romance into this utterly comic and slightly off the wall casual game that's both approachable and yet at the same time potentially really tricky, it strikes a fine balance. As you get into the higher difficulty dates, you'll find the memory games get genuinely hard, like, brain training hard. You'll be asked to remember details that you may not have been paying much attention to ordinarily, you'll be asked to remember and pick out the desert from a list as they roll past, you'll be asked to correctly identify and order food based on vague descriptions. As I said, inside this cute chintzy game, there's a really tough nut in the center.\n\nIt's just too damned pink.\n\n[H1]The guilty pleasure of being fabulous...[/H1]\n\nSo. Hm. How do I put this. It's good. As much as I grit my teeth and press the button to recommend this, it's actually a good game once you get past the first initial dates and the difficulty ramps up. But you'll need a serious tolerance for the visual design (or a good pair of sunglasses) and probably Clicker Heroes so you can hide what you're doing, lest people stare at your Steam Profile and go \"What in the name of gods...\"\n\nVerdict : [b]Highly Recommended as a guilty pleasure. So do your research first, and/or run Clicker Heroes so people don't start laughing loudly in your chat window.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1432311887, "timestamp_updated": 1433367594, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502384", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15884867": {"recommendationid": "15884867", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043256535", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432053621}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Kitty Powers Matchmaker - A Steam Review[/h1]\n\n[i][Disclamer - I was provided a copy by the publisher for review purposes][/i]\n\n[b]The good[/b]\n\n[list]\n[*]Awesome sense of humor and jokes related to gaming & relationships\n[*]Huge variety of challenges \n[*]A multiplayer component (haven't tried it yet, no friends have this game)\n[*]In-game store to help you arrange better dates\n[*]Very addictive (clear goals, nice rewards) \n[*]Kitty Powers is a really good mentor\n[/list]\n\n[b]The not so good:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] After level 8 it becomes insanely difficult and it's hard to maintain a good reputation\n[/list]\n\n[b]The conclusion: [/b]\nThis is an addictive game that's gonna entertain you for a while.

Make some matches. Try to make REALLY GOOD matches too so that you can make some extra money and make better matches. \n\nGameplay:\n\nSimple but effective, each \"round\" you play is a date for one of your clients. At any date any given \"event\" might happen, triggering a mini-game; the amount of mini-games it draws from depends on your progression and how many different restaurants you get. The games are fun (if occasionally frustrating!) and don't really get old. Examples: card matching, higher or lower, plinko, spot the difference, etc.\n\nIt's not surprising to me that this is also a mobile game; however it doesn't necessarily feel like a mobile game ported to the PC, if that makes sense, and I would definitely rather play it on a PC than my phone or a tablet. I do wish there were some integration of the keyboard for mini-games though.\n\nOverall my biggest worry about gameplay is always whether or not it detracts from or serves the story. As it's not a story-heavy game, and as the gameplay is quick and casual, I'd say it hits the mark perfectly. Low investment in skill or cognition for an inversely high amount of pleasure.\n\nArt and Writing:\n\nThe art is campy, randomly generated, and absolutely perfect for what the game is. My one complaint here is that ALL of the characters are super thin and cisgender/gender normative? But diversity in appearance, race, and sexuality make for a fun enough romp that I forget that while playing. Kitty Powers herself is absolutely adorable while jumping off the screen, and while I think she's a tongue-in-cheek joke herself (she is a drag queen), the game has so far managed that without dipping into transmisogyny (I'm only level 9 though). The characters are incredibly repetitive, but the combinations of what they say change each time and the new combinations are almost always very funny.\n\nSound and Music:\n\nThe voice-actor for Kitty Powers is awesome. The character really comes alive even though she completely lacks animation. The rest of the sound? Eh. The music is loud, even when put down all the way to 1 and mostly it just annoys me. That's not terribly surprising, though; I rarely prefer to play games with their music (I like to turn on netflix or similar while playing). Sound effects and character \"chatter\" (they're not really speaking English) are very nicely done, though.", "timestamp_created": 1431580053, "timestamp_updated": 1431580053, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499987", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15819816": {"recommendationid": "15819816", "author": {"steamid": "76561198195463487", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 713, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500911218}, "language": "english", "review": "This game totally rocks.

This is Kitty Powers's Matchmaking and believe me, it's harder than you think.\n\nThe one thing that it has in common with other dating/matchmaking games is the ... well, dating and matchmaking. But how you go about it and that fact that you will have all possible couple combinations (which is amazlingly refreshing for once) is different ... and can be quite difficult. \n\nThere is some guess work and some unexplained features that can make this a little more difficult - for example who is what 'type'. No, not sexuality wise but life style wise. How do you best figure that out. Then you start having to guess some more and make conclusions until you finally realize that someone who loves Halloween might just like someone who enjoys costume parties. \nIt's not black and white - it is not match the same with the same but it is a but find the middle ground. \n\nThe rest of the set up dates are won or lost with a serious of mini-games and a good memory or the ability to right things down fast. Some are a lot of fun, some not so much  - and some are simply depending on luck.  \n\nDepending on your matchmaking skills, memory and luck, the couple will hit it off or not. \nCoins, XP and reputation are awareded. XP unlocks additional features via level - Coins are required to buy the features, cheat or get hints - and Reputation ... well I only know that the tip you receive for a sucessful case increases with reputation ... but that's all I know. \n\nFor now, the game does get slightly repetitive but I am hoping to unlock some additional features to spice things up with time. Kitty Power's comments, the ... unusual ways of talking, crazy hobbies and the likes are currently still making up for it. \n\nOne thing that I am really missing is the means to reset the account. I have the feeling I invested some money in the wrong things at the beginning and would have loved to start over.\n\nAll in all - it's addictive and challenging and I am bent to crack a good bunch of the achievements.\nSo yes, for the price, I would recommend the game.", "timestamp_created": 1430601703, "timestamp_updated": 1430679822, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500057", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15637713": {"recommendationid": "15637713", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141955703", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1600, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487019590}, "language": "english", "review": "I saw the gameplay and was instantly hooked.

You have this sinking feeling that something or someone may judge you, but you know what? It tastes good and it just FEELS SO RIGHT.\n\nThis is a very well thought out dating sim game and I'm happy to still be waist deep within it. Your task is to help your boss, Kitty Powers, make perfect matches. Send your clients off on their dream dates and make sure they don't blow it.\n\nSimple enough, right? Not quite. There are types of people to mix and match together while hoping that date goes perfectly. Will it take one perfect date or do you want to steam it out with three dates? Guide your clients by playing mini games to make sure they succeed in winning the affections of their date.\n\nIf you succeed, you get promotions and you get paid. Getting paid means better restaurants to take dates to, better ways to fancy up your clients (because they REALLY need your help), and other little perks like kicking out the more troublesome clients.\n\nThe tutorial makes things look incredibly easy, but once that's done, you are almost completely on your own and left figuring out things for yourself. You'll have to understand clients interests and how your little black book works. You'll either figure this out through dumb luck or failing. Either way, there's no harm in making a few mistakes at first. No one's perfect starting out. Even I have a completely ruined relationship from a client that I thought were totally into each other. Oh well, win some and lose some.\n\nI love that you get updates from satisfied customers and you get perks from their continuing relationships. I thought that this was a great touch and another incentive to get things right the first time. Another thing that I loved? Making my own profile to send out myself to be a \"mystery shopper\" for my own dating life. Can't wait to see the results to have a good laugh over that.\n\nThe graphics are bright and inviting, reminding me of traditional time management games. And those games? Those games remind me of addiction. They remind me of \"just one more level\". That's what I noticed immediately. I wanted one more date conquered just because I needed the ego boost. Just to say I was Kitty's best employee (I have no friends playing this so this is my wild imagination), I needed to do more work for more upgrades. Just ONE MORE client! It's very friendly and I'm almost happy that Kitty isn't cartoony because that would take away from the humor that is our wonderful and loving boss. She is quite sassy and pixels just wouldn't suit her, after all.\n\nI especially appreciated that there was a bit more inclusion in this game. It's not just limited to man-seeking-woman or woman-seeking-man, the devs did realize there's more than man and woman relationships so I must say I appreciated that option. Thank you. It means a lot that you did that.\n\nThere is a bit of stereotyping...but more so on the personality types of \"sporty\", \"nerds\", \"hippies\", etc. If that offends you then I have no idea what to say. If you have trouble with characters who are supposed to be \"punk alternative\" speaking with what seems like (forgive if I read it in the wrong accent!) a Cockney/London accent then steer clear. Seriously. British Punks from London stereotypes. I can't imagine anyone hating that but hey, they're there amongst a few other cliches. I thought they were all incredibly adorable characters I really, desperately wanted to see happy. They're very \"human\" with wants and needs and the need to be validated.\n\nEven for cartoon people without souls, yes. I'm entirely serious.\n\nThe more things you buy for your matchmaking business, the harder things get. If you buy better restaurants, you get paid more, but the games get harder and sometimes slightly lewd. Yes there is a game to hold in your fart. The fact I can write a review complimenting a game for recognizing that yes, you have to hold in your gas during a date and it is indeed a game of chance is astounding. I never thought I'd have to compliment a fart mini game.\n\nBuy a salon for your business and you can alter your appearance for a better potential mate for your client. Wouldn't that one guy or gal be great IF ONLY your client dyed their hair lilac? Now you can...if you do it quickly. Does that guy/gal prefer a more chic style? Quickly change clothes after you buy an add-on for your salon. They say you shouldn't change for anyone but hey, let's make an exception, right?\n\nIt's an easily accessible game that truly anyone can play. While I'd keep this for the crowd that can understand dating, I'd honestly say this is really a decent game for anyone to play. It's cute. It's bubbly. You can play against your friends and compare scores. You can even send your friends personas on dates if they're playing. You get bonus points for making matches with real life people and you'll tell who they are by the little globe by their profile as you match them up to people.\n\nI can't find a single thing bad about this game, really. It's a little tycoon/sim on dating and it really illustrates the whole luck/chance and repetition that is dating. And I'm not bored! There's always some new curve ball coming at me!\n\nPlus Kitty Powers is the best boss I have ever had.

I honestly don't even know how to describe what I like about it. It's just plain fun. Instead, here is the small list of things I don't like about it, compiled over my admittedly meager 1.5 hours played (in my defense, I bought this at 1 AM on a Monday morning).\n\n-Loading seems to happen all the time. If there's a different 2D background for the 2D characters, there will be a load screen, and they're often relatively long. I can usually load a new area in heavily modded Skyrim at least as quickly as KPM can load the lewdly named American restaurant. I feel like load screens and load times both should be pretty minimal for something like this, but I'm no expert, and it's not horrid. Just annoying.\n\n-It can get a little samey, and it's probably not something most people want to sit down and play for more than a couple hours because of that. The dialog is modular (i.e. there are probably 5-10 different ways of saying \"I like your hair\" and any other conceivable saying), but you see them a lot. After 30-45 minutes of playing, I stopped reading the unimportant dialog because it wasn't funny or interesting after seeing it a few times in that time. It was still fun, just a little less immersive, especially because it felt like the same people talking. Also, unless things change further in, the dates are all just dinner at a restaurant that consist of a few random minigames from a small pool. While they do vary from each other a little and it's a good formula, it does get old.\n\n-A lot of the difficulty of the game seems to stem from its randomness. Randomness is kind of a necessity in a game like this, but I think it has a little too much influence. It's very hard to predict how your client's date is going to react to what you say or the decisions you make, and I think there should be more reliable guesswork, if that makes sense. But maybe I just need to play more to understand. I do like that failing a client too much makes them leave and hurt your rep a lot - I almost got to a third strike with one client and I had to do everything I could to make their last date work out.\n\n-I'm not sure if I'd pay the full $10 for this game, just because it remains to be seen to me how much the gameplay fleshes out, but I got it on GMG for $6 and that was definitely worth it. At time of posting, it was $7.49 on Steam, which I would have paid if not for the GMG deal.\n\nAll that said is just overanalysis of things that weren't big deals. The art is fitting, the voice work and images for the one persistent character is hilarious and well done, and the gameplay is enjoyable and error-free. If you're looking to play a game all day, this probably isn't it, but it's definitely something you can keep on hand and get a few hours of fun out of. It also throws your friends' characters in the game as potential clients/dates, so you can have some fun with that if you can convince someone else to play it. I also plan to break it out at LAN parties so my friend Brian can laugh at me and call me rude names.", "timestamp_created": 1430125082, "timestamp_updated": 1430125082, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502622", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15575138": {"recommendationid": "15575138", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011364581", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2924, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452861919}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has seriously rocked my socks.

You create a character, that is supposed to be \"You\". You choose your looks, your personality traits, your birthday which is also your star sign (Gemini, Aquarius, etc.) Your first date you set up you cannot mess up, as it's the tutorial that's running you through how to play. \n\nYou choose your venue that you want to act as a matchmaker for. Each venue has different people's personalities. You do kinda feel like a third wheel on the dates, since you're just silently watching them. The goal is to pick up on verbal cues by the dates and give them the best experience. Make the right comments, order the right food based on the hints they give, etc. You can date other peoples character profiles as well. \n\nYou get coins that are used as a currency to buy upgrades and other things to help you. The better you do, the more coins you are tipped at the end, the higher your reputation goes up, and the more you matchmaking you can do. \n\nAll in all, it's a pretty interesting game and if you like the idea of setting people up on the perfect date, then it's worth a try.\n\n[b]Humorous, non serious review:[/b]\n\nI am Lord Tippington, a balding, introverted, antisocial, nerd. I have hundreds of hours logged in \"The Sims\", have had many lovers, and as such I feel I am the most qualified to take the esteemed role as \"Matchmaker\".\n\nMy first day begins now.\n\nI have chosen a comic book shop as my first matchmaking venue, I will help fellow nerds such as myself find love. \n\nMy first individual is none other than m'lady \"Ambrosia Bunfoot\". I tip my Fedora at her. \"M'lady!\" I inquire, \"What doth bring  such an esteemed m'lady such as yourself to my humble abode?\" \n\nShe does not answer, save for the phrase \"DUNGEON MASTER.\"\n\nAh! But the esteemed m'lady is a dungeon master! How could I not have guessed by her beautiful bowl-cut-mullet which appears to be stained by the grease of hot pockets of the distant past?\n\nI brush my trenchcoat back and fall to one knee, and grip noble Ambrosia's hand with my cheeto stained fingers, \"M'lady, I, Lord Tippington, am an expert matchmaker and can find you the most noble of men!  Pray, tell me, what interested such a fine m'lady such as yourself?\" It is not long before she robotically belts out the words:\n\"FPS GAMES.\"\n\"WIZARDY.\"\n\"ELVES.\"\n\n\"M'lady! I had no idea you indulged in wizardry! Pray, tell me, are you familliar of the Wizard's Gathering?\" \"Nevermind yourself with such trivial questions! I will find you a suitable sir right away!\" I tip my fedora as I search for potential candidates.\n\nI find a match! I tip my fedora multiple times in glee. He is a fellow neckbeard, with a long, grease drenched mane. The sir goes by the calling of \"Lucas Goldthwaite\".  \n\nTonight is date night, I have chosen a noble English pub as the location. They are taking their seats! I begin tipping my fedora furiously in anticipation.\n\nM'lady is getting along really well with Sir Goldthwaite! \n\nThey're... quite happy together. Happy. Together. My sausage-fingers clench into a fist and shake with jealousy. \n\nAs I watch in the shadows I notice they order Cheese Cauliflower and a Cheese Board to feast upon. I would've chosen something more bacon oriented, but alas.\n\nThe date winds down. They have agree'd to get more serious, settle down with a glass of fine champagne in a romantic hot tub, and partake in the age old tradition of making autistic kissing sounds at eachother. I watch from a distance, and stare at the happy couple I have created with ever-growing jealousy and tip my fedora repeatedly with rage.\n\nMy next dear romantic is a M'lady by the name of Rita. Rita... is b-beautiful. I find myself at a loss for words upon her entry.  I begin sweating profusely, and begin to sheepishly stammer: \"H-hello m-m-m'lady.. can I h-help you today?\"\n\nShe is no different than the damsel as before.\n\n\"TRAIN DRIVER.\"\n\n\"BUILDING COMPUTERS.\"\n\n\"UFOS.\"\n\n\"READING INSTRUCTIONS.\"\n\n\"I must find a sir for such a perfect m'lady!\" I thought.\n\nI turned to my computer and placed my cheeto dust stained fingertips upon my keyboard and began searching the database with expert precision. I have concluded her match is a dirty peasant butcher by the name of \"Frazer Melonthwaite\". A sir that appears to have taken after Mrs. Doubtfire.\n\nDate night has arrived and they have chosen an American themed restaurant. It appears to be a 50's style diner. I would have chosen a Taco Bell at 3 am to ensure I would only encounter my own fedora and trenchcoat clad brethren.\n\nThe two have taken their seats, and Rita, being the kind, and gentle lamb of a lady has allowed the uncouth sir \"Frazer\" order first.\n\n...He appears to have ordered something without meat! S-surely he must be mistaken! A sir-ly sir that may be suitable to ste- I erm... mean... take the harmless Foal \"Rita\" from my good graces just yet! No! I will h-help him. I will get him a large order of Buffalo Wings! The manliest and sir-liest food in all the land!\n\nMy dear Rita loves it! Frazer... Frazer is displeased.  My tip my fedora in disgust.\n\nI shall try conversational topics next! I have told the sweet, dear angel Rita to ask the peasant boy Frazer his valueless opinion on her attire! \n\n...\n\nHe hates it?! Oh, my dear Rita how I'm sorry for wasting your precious time with this... dirty individual. \n\nHe's left for the restroom? How dare he leave such an exsquisite m'lady all alone?! I expect him to be gone for long, as he is likely only accustomed to disease-ridden defecation holes. I ponder whether I should approach her and take his place...\n\nAlas, he eventually returns and he appears to have mistaken the toilet as a wash bin, and tried to freshen up. His hair is soaked. It looks awful.\n\nBeing the fragile little butterfly Rita is, I inform her to lie to this insufferable fool of a \"sir\" that his hair looks good. Alas, she is timid and her speechcraft is lax. He does not believe her, and storms out. Rita is heartbroken, my white knight instincts kick in. I extend my greasy hand towards her and bellow \"Dear Rita! Please allow a true good guy such as myself to court you! I shall treat you to only the best Hot Pockets my mother has to offer, and I will protect you from the evil \"bros\" that wish to harm you!\" \n\nShe ignores my White Knightery. She is heart broken and  vows to spend the rest of her days in a trash can.\n\nIn the desert wasteland.\n\nDuring a neverending storm.\n\nI tip my fedora in shame and question why no m'lady would allow such a good guy to take their hand in courtship.\n\n10/10 Strangest and best blind date & bitter third-wheel-nerd simulator.", "timestamp_created": 1429727890, "timestamp_updated": 1429752218, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 81, "votes_funny": 222, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565742", "comment_count": "11", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15492855": {"recommendationid": "15492855", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007928072", "num_games_owned": 287, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1429653296}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a silly matchmaker dating simulator thing.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/SDY65jKaWxA\n\nIf that's what you are looking for then I can say tha I personally found this to be enjoyable although not very complex of an game.\n\nBut it does manage to be what it set out to be and for what it is, it works.\n\nHave a look at some gameplay, because I can't really find any words for this in written form:\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/SDY65jKaWxA", "timestamp_created": 1429721650, "timestamp_updated": 1429721650, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.415338", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15492510": {"recommendationid": "15492510", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968826307", "num_games_owned": 509, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 789, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1436369339}, "language": "english", "review": "In this game my date wet herself with boredom.

Granted, I won't be putting countless hours into this like I use to because I had my fill and the time, but when I'm in the mood for 4x and have time to burn, this is definitely going to be the version of Civ I'll be playing unless Civ VI comes to fruition in future expansions, but I'm not holding my breath.", "timestamp_created": 1498330566, "timestamp_updated": 1498330566, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 49, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.798351", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32703472": {"recommendationid": "32703472", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024055883", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 15800, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508535361}, "language": "english", "review": "since Civ 5 is crap on windows ten...this one is currently the best in the serries and you need to get it.", "timestamp_created": 1498262653, "timestamp_updated": 1498262653, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543396", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32686183": {"recommendationid": "32686183", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016197938", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 1092, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1386603053}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Me recuerda al Call to power, y para mi eso es un gran elogio.

The game run's smooth and with little to no bugs, and there is never a dull game if you love the Sid Meir series. The base game improved with a variety of new units, buildings, and civilizations that are all a blast to play and add a new flare to the game which makes it feel fresh. Classic Civ at it's finest. \n\nThe game also has some of the most diverse and incredible scenario's to ever grace a civ game. Not only have they pulled scenarios from some of the best old mod of their time, such as Ryse and Fall and Fall from Heaven, but also a host of unique scenarios that almost feel like DLC within a DLC. Next War adds an entire new era and story allowing archology cities and clone armies to devastate the world while Road to War throws you into the war torn WWII era Europe and Pacific. They even added 2 scifi mods, one a traditional 4X space empire game and a Turn Based game controlling a team of cyborgs. These are only a few of the numerious scenarios they have added and your playtime will rise exponentially as you play each scenario for hours on end. This DLC is more like a dozen smaller games put together and packaged at an insanely low price. If there is any selling point you should follow in my review, it's simply this. \n\nBeyond the Sword is perhaps one of the best DLC to ever be sold for Sid Meir's epic series, perhaps 4X games in general.

Not since the days of Civ 2 has a Civ game been as moddable as Civ 4. Its kind of weird & funny that I've played more hours of modded Civ 4 then I have vanilla Civ 4 lol.

If you started with Civ5 or Civ6, try this-- you may or may not enjoy it, it's a totally different experience than those games.\n\nFor exposition, I started the series with Civ5, and have played Civ6 and CivBE and love them all. But this is a totally different experience than all of those.\n\nI can't really decide whether or not I like this game. There are so many aspects that I adore that they didn't return in Civ5, but there are so many things Civ5 improved on that I feel this game is missing.\n\nFirst I'll start with things I love:\n+ The culture system. I think Civ5 did culture a lot better, but it's very different. The culture system is the one biggest thing that makes me keep wanting to try this game out-- I love the idea of being able to peacefully flip tiles and cities. I wish Civ5 had this; I think it would be great especially with the tourism addition.\n+ I love being able to zoom out the whole map and see a globe.\n+ A very great selection of leaders; multiple leaders per one civ.\n+ The victory conditions for domination and space race are honestly much, much better than in Civ5. They're more dynamic; in Civ5 you just gotta own all the capitals to win, which is kinda lame.\n+ You can (and actually are encouraged to) play wide.\n\nAnd the bad:\n- Everything is connected to your gold treasury. Your science, culture, etc. outputs are all determined by how much money you put into them. It's weird though because I don't understand if there are really any penalties for having 0 gold...? You can't go negative and your output per turn won't go lower if you have no gold left.\n- Square tiles, I know everyone complains about this but, for real. They're really unbearable coming back from Civ5.\n- There's not as much of a sense of scale in this game compared to Civ5. Games feel a lot quicker, more like you're just rushing through eras.\n- And of course, the tiles of death. What can I say that hasnt been said?\n\nConclusion: It's cheap, so try it if you're used to Civ5. Honestly, everyone gets something different out of these games so it can't hurt to try. You may love it, you may never pick it up again.\n\nI'm honestly going to need to keep trying it. There's so much I love, so I'm gonna give it some more chances.", "timestamp_created": 1489813244, "timestamp_updated": 1489813244, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.556799", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30570790": {"recommendationid": "30570790", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087521701", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 38070, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 924, "last_played": 1516377018}, "language": "english", "review": "Take out all of the crap from Civ 5 and you get Civ 4.

This new world has decimated the old civilizations and sent them into a tribal life, struggling to survive. And here you come in. In short order, the mod adds a bunch of new civilizations, very different from each others. Orcs sucks at science, but can produce 2 units at the same time. The Khazad (dwarfs) rely on their stockpile of gold for prosperity, the elven civs can build improvements on forest tiles, etc. Religions added. Civilization alignment from good to evil. An armageddon count which turns the world into fiery hell terrain as it climbs closer to doom. Lairs and dungeons to explore. A ton of story, more or less every unit and hero (did I mention heroes?) have a backstory. Magic. So much magic.

Civilization 4 was such a game; from the moment you played your first turn, you knew it would claim far more of your time and energy than you were sure you had to give. Just one more turn? No, just one hundred more. And now that the latest expansion has dropped, it's time to re-evaluate your schedule once again.\n\nBefore we launch straight into all the new stuff, let's get the game's most noticeable flaw out of the way: Leonard Nimoy is no longer the voice for the game's pithy quotations. And since the tech tree has been considerably changed up, you'll be hearing Sid Meier's voice, and not Nimoy's very early in the game. Sid's a nice guy and all, but he's no Mr. Spock.\n\nThe expansion brings with it a host of changes, additions, and re-balances of Civilization 4's old formula. The benefits of the previous expansion, Civilization 4: Warlords, are rolled right in as well. Among the new systems are the espionage system, the corporation system, an advanced start system, and an army of new combat options. This is before we even look at all the new scenarios and mods that come packed on the disc.\n\nEspionage makes for an interesting addition to the game. Unlike the somewhat awkward spy unit of pre-expansion Civ 4, the re-worked espionage system provides for a variety of different options. By spending espionage points, which are generated much as research points are, you can work on counter-espionage, foment rebellions, gather information, attempt to steal technologies, sabotage buildings in opponents' cities, influence local civics and religion, or even poison the local watering hole. Most of these require you to send a spy along to a target city, but there are still some passive benefits to building up espionage points, most of which are just gaining inside information on your foes' activities. The espionage system doesn't really require you micromanage carefully, so it's a pretty rewarding system all around. While you shouldn't be expecting to watch James Bond murder his way through the Soviet Union to make certain your civilization comes out ahead, it's nice to know he's on your side.\n\nExcuse me a moment, I have to conquer Mongolia.\n\n[3 hours later] Crap, it's that late already? Alright, well, let's talk about one of the other new systems quick \u2013 the random world events. The addition makes a lot of difference to the game, and they're worked in amazingly well, frequently playing off of the events that are already ongoing in the game. Random events pop up due to wars between civilizations of different religions, over-farming, failed royal marriages, or just plain chaotic weather patterns. In a lot of respects, the random events are reminiscent of Galactic Civilizations 2, though they generally feel more balanced and less arbitrary.\n\nSome of the new systems don't go over as well, though. The corporate system in Civilization 4: Beyond the Sword presents an almost nightmarish window into our own corporate structures. Founding a corporation is an interesting proposition, as it may very well harm you more than it benefits you. Corporations can potentially generate massive profits, but they take a great person, access to specific resources, and a fair amount of startup capital to get off the ground. Even after that, they can end up costing a lot to maintain, and getting rid of them is hard. \n\nSpread a branch office to your foe, however, and suddenly the maintenance burden is lessened, because your neighbor is now shouldering some of it. It's a weird, and eerily accurate, process, where frequently no one but the corporation really profits much. When you feng shui your trade routes, resources, expenditures, and diplomatic relations just right, however, corporations can generate an impressive amount of income \u2013 finding and maintaining those balances is the trick, and it's not a simple one. Overall, corporations can be far more trouble than they're really worth, so players that aren't trying to eke every last benefit out of the game should really just stay away from 'em.\n\nThe combat refinements - including some considerable changes to artillery units - change up warfare in some interesting ways. The new specialized units bring some flair, and can help define some civilizations' preferred ages. Likewise, the new rulers (and in the case of Rome, a change in the ruler) also help spice things up in some interesting ways, and help to provide an even more varied experience. The new changes and additions help the game's replay value immensely \u2013 though it's not as though it was needed in the first place.\n\nHang on, Egypt's getting uppity again...\n\n[Another 3 hours later] Well, I'm happy to report that the pharaohs have made friends with my cannon balls. A few rounds through their fancy stone walls, and suddenly we're the best of buds again! Hatshetsup was positively grinning when she heard I wasn't going to put holes in the roof of her palace \u2013 but it's not cause she asked me real pretty, it's because she always serves the best beer at her diplomatic functions.\n\nThe A.I. in Civilization 4 has been revamped immensely with the new expansion \u2013 for once, you can't win the game just by keeping up with the science and agreeing to the occasional demand. When I first took up Civilization 4, I got into the habit of playing on \"Emperor\" difficulty level and doing alright for myself, but Beyond the Sword has forced me to scale back to \"Noble\" to break even, and \"Warlord\" to do well for myself. Between the new complications and the much cleverer A.I. opponents, I've found the game to be a renewed challenge, and a heck of a lot more fun. Given that the game was already siphoning off shreds of my very soul to power its dark simulations, I fear I might need the services of a preacher before I'll rid myself of this game. What's worse is that I'm not even clear I'll want to get that exorcism.\n\nGetting away from all that's new to the gameplay, the expansion also comes packed with a variety of mods and new scenarios. Some are great. Some are really quite bad. There's a total conversion packaged with the game that's frankly terrible; it attempts to be some kind of tactical RPG, but ultimately comes off as a clunky turn-based strategy game with ugly units. Though it's interesting to see what can be done with the platform that Civilization 4 was built upon, it's a poor addition to the expansion. There's also a fantasy total conversion packed in, which fares reasonably, though will likely not distract you much from the main game. The varying new scenarios and little mods add some extra amusement to the game, especially the Next War mod, which expands into futuristic, sci-fi technologies.\n\nOverall, Civilization 4: Beyond the Sword presents a lot of additions to what was already a great game. It's a good expansion, and capitalizes a great deal on fixing some of the weaknesses of the original. That said, the expansion doesn't do anything that will make someone who did not already enjoy Civilization games dance for joy.

I haven't played Civ VI yet as I am a cheap ass who won't buy until it gets a sale. There are a couple of reason for this one being the best. One is that I find it a lot more accessible than Civilization V. There is less clutter and when it comes to the controls the square based map is just better suited for the numpad... And controlling with the mouse is a hassle. The second and to me far more important one is that Civilization V especially in the late games draws to an absolute stand still with the opponents taking their turns. I like big games on big maps with marathon length. In Civ 5 every computer turn takes 1-2 minutes meaning that an endgame of 100 turns (which is a conservative estimate) takes upwards of 3 hours of me doing absolutely nothing but waiting. In Civ 4 the computer turns on my system never takes more than 10 seconds meaning I spend a lot more time playing and a lot less waiting. I have heard Civ players telling me basically I'm too impatient. But if I can actually go make a cup of coffee between every turn in the late game I'm not playing a game. I'm drinking coffee with the game as sort of a distraction.", "timestamp_created": 1480254110, "timestamp_updated": 1480254110, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27806719": {"recommendationid": "27806719", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031195379", "num_games_owned": 233, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4367, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508761892}, "language": "english", "review": "The Game where the Civilization Franchise was at its peak.

The reality is that in Civlization IV vanilla, defence is kind of possible, but needs a LOT of effort and is not ultimatly worth it because your score point generation falls off the map while producing military units you will not use to take a capital/city. \n\nHowever, in BTS this is even worse because defence is not even possible. You must research knights to counter catapults? wtf. The research is only like 1000 years apart. The only stategy available in Civ IV is: ATTACK, ATTACK, ATTACK! If that is how I wanted to play then I would play a fricken RTS. (Real Time Strategy) Like AoM, Warcraft III, or Starcraft. The fact that this grind for military units is the only way to play makes all other parts of the game more like a dissapointing minigame you pursue while everyones LotR size hordes hump eachother in the field. If you pursue a science victory you essentially are achieving a military victory, but decided to make a spaceship while your nukes were in transit to your enemies loved ones. \n\nSo, once again I state: A strategy game with one strategy is not strategy game at all. Don't really want to be identified as a Civ V fan boy, but yes they fixed this bullshit in Civ V and you can actually enjoy 5 different victory goals. (if you buy all the expansions that is, otherwise the vanilla game is the same meatgrinder of military units you wait on, while you fap or look at reddit) So, do not buy this game unless you want to have stacks of units slap eachother until one loses the strength to go on. \n\nIf you still want to buy this game, buy it on www.g2a.com for a $6 steam code intead of fricken $30-35 on steam, or what ever its up to now with the Civ VI announcement.\n\nI am sorry Leonard Nimoy.", "timestamp_created": 1463682295, "timestamp_updated": 1463683230, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.373638", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23047238": {"recommendationid": "23047238", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013814731", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1373155731}, "language": "english", "review": "IMO, one of the best Civ games.... but VERY detailed and not for the feint of heart.

I have installed it on every computer I have owned since it came out. The Steam play time reflects that I played from my CD-ROM copy of CIV 4 complete until recently when my install discs became incompatible with Windows 10. I feel that the Civ 4 gameplay is the most balanced and addictive of Civ 4 series games, with strong ai, diplomacy, building, expansion, religion, commerce, and war all providing great depth that makes playing just one more turn addictive. In my opnion, only the great Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri has comparable all around strengths and innovations for its time, Moreover, Civ 4 has given me unparalleled replay value because it is the most modable Civ game.  Besides the usual tweaks of the vanilla game on can find in Civ 5, Civ 4's structure enabled the creation of many complete overhaul mods that transformed CIv 4 with new gameplay and graphics, including historical, fantasy, and sci-fi mods. For example, in my opinion, the Civ 4 fantasy mod, Fall From Heaven 2, remains of one of the best 4x strategy fantasy pc games ever made. \n\nCiv IV, however, does show its age when compared to more refined interface of Civ V. Civ 4's maps of square titles and battles with stacks of units on the same tile, also give a less sophisticated first impression. However, when I compare the gameplay between Civ 4 and Civ 5, I find Civ 4 AI is usually more challenging, sophisticated, and strategically effective than in Civ 5, with regard to both combat and non-combat activities alike.\n\nInstall Civ 4 complete (Civ IV, Civ IV Warlords, and Civ IV Beyond the Sword) and join the addiction!\n\nNote: I have reviewed Civ 4 and its expansions as a single game.\n", "timestamp_created": 1460312690, "timestamp_updated": 1460312690, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22326720": {"recommendationid": "22326720", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971291058", "num_games_owned": 166, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 154376, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2327, "last_played": 1516051892}, "language": "english", "review": "Best high strategy which ever was and ever will be.

Everything what I'm saying relates to \"Beyond the Sword\" expansion and I highly recommend to purchase all the expansions, because, without them, the game is incomplete and you have limited mod and civilization options. (Actually, I don't understand, why people play vanilla versions. For \"Civilization\" games, it's usually like this: they release an incomplete game with some gameplay faults, which is substantially improved with following expansions \u2013 not only in terms of content, but also in terms of mechanics. I believe this will be the case with Beyond Earth, as well.)\n\nHere are some things that \"Civ4\" does have that \"Civ5\" doesn't, and things that \"Civ4\" is better at (well, imo, at least):\n\n+ More customisation options (e.g., no limitations regarding how many civilizations could there be per map size; an option to assign leaders to different civilization, for example, Ghandi as a leader of Russia).\n+ By far better interface (except, for one thing - when you are offered research/tech choice, you need to make decision right away - you can't examine your empire first. You can change it afterwards in the same turn, but, anyway, it's not very convenient). Apart from that, it's more easy to review the overall state of your progress. For example, howering over a tech gives you a detailed explanation of what you can achieve with a tech (units, wonders, bonuses for discovering first, etc.), why it's important and where it leads. Also, in \"Civ4\", there is the option to see the network of global politics or what a particular leader thinks of other leaders or what he wants or is willing to trade. I also prefer \"Civ4\" icons over \"Civ5\" icons.\n+ Unit appearance is different for each civilization and religion (and not just in terms of colour). For example, Korean swordmen will have different swords than European swordmen, a Buddhist missionary will have a different outfit from that of a Christian missionary.\n+ Cool wonder animations.\n+ Civics (ideologies) are available much earlier in the game, you can change them more easily and they are not linked to culture points. In \"Civ5\", many of the civic system functions are transfered to the relligion system.\n+ Map trading\n+ Cultural victory is actually a feasible option contrary to \"Civ5\", where it is possible only in rare occasions.\n+ Inbuilt World Builder (In \"Civ5\" it's available only from the \"Workshop\")\n+ Workers can build forest preserves (that add happiness)\n+ The rather unique \"Afterworld\" scenario and \"Final Frontier\" mod (which both feel like and actually are completely different games \u2013 full-conversion mods, if you like).\n+ Vassal states (you can push other leaders to become your vassals).\n+ No lag on large maps, since it is a much older game and requires less system resources.\n\n+/- Random events instead of city state quests\n+/- Workshops and windmills are tile improvements instead of buildings. \n+/- Religion doesn't have that much impact as in \"Civ5\". But it does have a considerable impact on diplomacy.\n+/- Culture bombs work in the same way as great general citadels.\n+/- Different great persons may discover different technologies.\n+/- Corporations - spread them like relligion and each corporation will have different effects. \"They are mechanisms that can add substantial production to a city, at the cost of higher maintenance costs. Thus, in essence they convert gold into other basic goods (food, hammers, science, and culture).\" [From Wikia]\n\nHowever, there are some aspects in which \"Civ4\" falls behind \"Civ5\":\n\n- Square tiles. Hexagon tiles are far better for strategical gameplay and layout.\n- Unit stacks. I know that I will be condemned for this and for a while I missed the stacking option in \"Civ 5\", but, when I got used to it, I must admit that one unit-per-tile limitation actually improves the gameplay a lot. With this limitation it matters much more where you put your units. You can manage your army more easily. The city placement has a bigger impact on your attack/defence strategy. And, finally, if you play smart, you can save more of your units (sometimes even win the game without loosing any unit), whereas in \"Civ4\" you are bound to throw your units into the battle as cannon fodder. \"Civilization 5\" feels like chess in that matter. And I prefer it that way.\n- Ranged units (Archers, Crossbowmen, etc.) don't have a \"ranged attack\" option. It is available only for siege weapons (\"bombard\").\n- No city states. I actually like how city states provide bonuses, quests and influence the diplomacy. I think it's a better mechanic than influence points. Although, on the other hands, AI leaders in \"Civ5\" are completely irrational, their attitude sometimes doesn't make any sense and there is little you can do about it, whereas in \"Civ4\", you can at least change your civic/relligion or influence those of the AI leader.\n- \"Civilization 4\" is harder than \"Civilization 5\" (although it might be a good thing for some players). In \"Civilization 5\", I feel comfortable on \"Emperor\" and with a bit of luck I can manage \"Immortal\" on smaller maps, whereas I struggle on \"Noble\" in \"Civilization 4\". Perhaps, it's because I haven't played \"Civilization 4\" in years and hadn't developed any strategy when I did.\n- Technology trading. This actually makes the game rushed, unbalanced and it's much harder to make that technological gap between you and AI players. Although, there were moments, in \"Civ5\" multiplayer, when I wished there was this option. But, now, I see that research agreements are actually a much more balanced mechanic. Luckily, you can turn \"technology trading\" off in \"Civ4\".\n- \"Civilization 4\" pushes you to expand early (as mush as possible). \"Civilization 5\" pushes you to build army early (expansion is less crucial than in \"Civ4)\". I don't like any of the two, but, I think, that the fact, that AI civilizations are expanding so rapidly and that you need to keep up, makes \"Civilization 4\" unbalanced - it's hard to maintain positive stats and to manage the cities and units. In \"Civ5\", you can win with less units, less initial cities and the overall pace is slower, which allows you to build your empire in a more balanced way. \"Civilization III\" had the same problem btw.\n- No \"Steam Workshop\" support. But you can still use 3rd party mods.\n\nThere are probably some more differences that I've forgotten, but, in the end, I would like to say that \"Civilization 4\" is a great game and offers many things its successor lacks. For that reason it's worth purchasing even today \u2013 not only for a nostalgic value, but also for the different and fun experience it offers.\n\nMy overall rating: 9/10\n\nAlso, my personal feeling is that \"Civilization 5\" is better in its strategical aspect, whereas \"Civilization 4\" is better in its \"God game\" aspect \u2013 just to fool around on easier difficulties.", "timestamp_created": 1451134863, "timestamp_updated": 1506184561, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 56, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.839419", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19935526": {"recommendationid": "19935526", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056172054", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 83513, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512765273}, "language": "english", "review": "^^^ :)", "timestamp_created": 1451047344, "timestamp_updated": 1451047344, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19924261": {"recommendationid": "19924261", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101203163", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 467831, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 8198, "last_played": 1516378591}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome game.

Its not as dumbed down as civ 5 and has many ways to win the game not just war.\n\nEdit:\nTo add a little depth to this review, compare the mod features of civ 5 and 4 and you will easily see how superior Civ 4 still is even without Steam Workshop Support. \n\n- Civ 4 has Multiplayer Mods. Still not happy? \n- Civ 4 vanilla has a working AI, want more?\n- Civ 4 Ai can be modded to kick you in the butt unless you are a freakin PRO! More?\n- Civ 4 has many ways too win and each can be played for equally...\n- Civ 4 offers small civs a debth and playability you cannot get in civ 5 it is actually pretty damn well balanced. Since with small civs you can outtech bigger guys like crazy... he attacks with stacks of doom 4x your size? Who cares his Swordsmen are no match for your riflemen...done that dozens of times...\n- Civ 4 has a well balanced techtree with rounded civics that work like a charm beside it. You can stack your bonusses to match your preferred way of winning. Tech-crazy, Culturewhore, Militarist, Space-Alien-Weirdo...and so on. \n\nEver wanted to get diplomacy to be transparent in 5? Me too...never really worked. In Civ 4 it is transparent, you can actually rely on the information in diplomacy. Are those pesky civs getting on your nerves...mod it, mute them, play in peace and calm :) \n\nAlright so the only downside for some might be the stack of doom, but if you rely on that vs a skilled player you can probably kiss your stack goodbye anyway... so, in MP a non issue if you know what you are doing. In SP, well... it actually is not a clickfest like civ 5...\"hey your 500000 units need to move...even though the entire map is already filled with units, but please do...\"\n\nHands down...Civ 4 >>>> Civ 5 all the way except in graphics :)", "timestamp_created": 1445606755, "timestamp_updated": 1472497267, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549589", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18633785": {"recommendationid": "18633785", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137659406", "num_games_owned": 217, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 22656, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1929, "last_played": 1516321894}, "language": "portuguese", "review": "Esse jogo \u00e9 simplesmente o melhor jogo de Estrat\u00e9gia que j\u00e1 joguei, as outras vers\u00f5es tamb\u00e9m s\u00e3o muito boas, mas sem d\u00favida o melhor \u00e9 o Civ IV Beyond Sword.

The graphics are in fact atrocious compared to the newer Civ 5, and even Civ 3, with its 2d isometric graphics and heavy reliance on shades of brown. But as any fan of the TBS-genre will tell you; graphics are secondary to everything else.\n\nYou may ask yourself \"why invest in Civ 4 when Civ 5 and BE is out?\". Well, apart from having better graphics and adding [spoiler](and taking away)[/spoiler] certain features, there aren't many differences between these games. Some of the most important differences (or improvements as some will call them) are the limitation on movement and stacking in Civ 5. One may argue that limitations compared to older versions are negative, but the point would be moot when faced with \"the stack of doom\". So yes, at first glance, the newer games are better. There are however saving graces for Civ 4: Plenty of advanced and interesting mods, as well as a (more) stable multiplayer, the latter of which is laughable in Civ 5.\n\n[b]Beyond The Sword[/b]\nBtS is arguably the largest expansion to any of the Civ games, and a must-have if you want to use mods, as most of them now require it to work. It adds quite a few new features, including, but not limited to:\n[list]\n[*]Ten (10) new civs, as well as 6 new leaders for existing civs.\n[*]Corporations: The religion of business.\n[*]Random events: FUN\n[*]Lots of new game rules and options, to help customize your experience.\n[/list]\n\nIn conclusion: If you like the civilization-games, but don't care about graphics, or don't like the limitations of Civ V, or like Civ but want it to be more advanced with certain mods, or just want to be able to play multiplayer for more than 10 minutes without having problems; i would suggest grabbing Civ IV with BTS as soon as possible.", "timestamp_created": 1440514843, "timestamp_updated": 1440514879, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545169", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17619160": {"recommendationid": "17619160", "author": {"steamid": "76561198190614534", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 597, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493249318}, "language": "english", "review": "Best Ever....Nuff said...", "timestamp_created": 1440012651, "timestamp_updated": 1440012651, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17602738": {"recommendationid": "17602738", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055333459", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3057, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508606688}, "language": "spanish", "review": "buen juego", "timestamp_created": 1439923702, "timestamp_updated": 1439923702, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17582103": {"recommendationid": "17582103", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985173194", "num_games_owned": 403, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 326, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1437739400}, "language": "french", "review": "Tr\u00e8s bonne extension ajoutant beaucoup de contenu !", "timestamp_created": 1439814197, "timestamp_updated": 1439814197, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17542016": {"recommendationid": "17542016", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111252450", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 7917, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505492289}, "language": "german", "review": "I like this game.It's the best CIV.\nI always search players to play with.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1439591524, "timestamp_updated": 1439591524, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "4.977901", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17541339": {"recommendationid": "17541339", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037534161", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4821, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489193669}, "language": "english", "review": "i played this game long before i bought it on steam its a fantastic game", "timestamp_created": 1439588226, "timestamp_updated": 1439588226, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17538423": {"recommendationid": "17538423", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067412408", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 32629, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513297084}, "language": "spanish", "review": "El mejor juego de la historia.", "timestamp_created": 1439575263, "timestamp_updated": 1483976710, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17530530": {"recommendationid": "17530530", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095652440", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502870212}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Muy bueno, continua la f\u00f3rmula Civilization visto en el III dotandolo de nuevos aires.

A little bit of single player.\n\nPositives: The most important thing for a strategy game is of course the strategy.  This game has a very impressive amount of depth.  I like that who you choose as your world leader matters, and that each one tends to feed into a different playstyle.  I like that there are various ways to win, including many non-violent ways.  You can not only win through military force, but also through technology or culture.  This is just a very cool concept for a strategy game.  But it's not just that the concepts are neat; they are also well executed.  It feels like the game is pretty well balanced, and that there are many legitimate ways to play.  Now, I'm not very familiar with the meta game, so for all I know in the competitive scene mulitary may be the way to go.  But for casual playing, it feels like there's a wide variety of ways to play, and that's mainly what interests me.\n\nAlso, Leonard Nimoy lends his voice to this game.  That's a huge positive for me!\n\nNegatives: While the graphics are perfectly serviceable, sometimes I feel they come acrossed a bit dopey; especially the cartoonish portraits of the world leaders.  This game is turn based, and while I enjoy that style of slow and methodical gameplay, some people may not appreciate that as much.  This weakness can be magnified if you play with the wrong people... it can be annoying when one person is taking a really long time to act every single time.  The in-game music is very timid and fades into the background, it didn't do much for me.  Sometimes it creates a nice ambience, but a more memorable soundtrack would have increased my enjoyment of the game.\n\nOverall: It's one of the best strategy games around, as far as I'm aware.  Certainly one of the best I've played.  If that's what you're looking for, then you've come to the right place.\n\nAbout my rating system: I have two things I rate on.  Overall score, and soundtrack.  Personally, I feel like game soundtracks are tremendously undervalued; to me, it's a vital factor in getting me into the game.  For the score, I grade on a scale of 1-10, and I try to grade in such a way that each number has a meaning and equal importance.  The meaning of each number are as follows:\n\n0: Garbage, 1: Awful, 2: Poor, 3: Underwhelming, 4: Mediocre, 5: Decent, 6: Good, 7: Great, 8: Excellent, 9: Phenomenal, 10: Masterpiece\n\nCivilization IV's score:\n\nGame Rating: 7 (Great)\nSoundtrack Rating: 4 (Mediocre)", "timestamp_created": 1437976625, "timestamp_updated": 1437976625, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505173", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17236562": {"recommendationid": "17236562", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054241944", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 54, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1437902966}, "language": "french", "review": "Compl\u00e8tement sans int\u00e9r\u00eat !!!", "timestamp_created": 1437919958, "timestamp_updated": 1437919958, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.288860", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17216650": {"recommendationid": "17216650", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079285273", "num_games_owned": 203, "num_reviews": 79, "playtime_forever": 88, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1409512308}, "language": "english", "review": "john cena", "timestamp_created": 1437808673, "timestamp_updated": 1437808673, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17199918": {"recommendationid": "17199918", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035728350", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 14960, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489116192}, "language": "english", "review": "As suggested by the lack of negative reviews (most of them are just criticizing Valve and/or Gamespy for multiplayer issues), Civ IV is truly a masterpiece.

en version boite, celui-l\u00e0 est totalement nouveau pour moi, LA meilleur extention pour moi. \n\n1) Des gros changement au niveaux l'abres de technologie et rajoute en plus 4 ou 5 technologie (ex Vol avancer, laser, supraconducteur...) De nouvelles unit\u00e9e, de nouveaux batiment, de nouvelle faction. Modification des doctrines pour s'associer aux nouveaux mode de jeux, (ex ; l'espionnage, les soci\u00e9t\u00e9es commerciale.)  \n\n2) Des nouvelles unit\u00e9e (ex artillerie mobile, cuirasser furtif, missile nucl\u00e9aire tactique, sous-marin d'attaque...) Coup de gueule aussi, il existe 2 type de sous-marin ; le sous-marin ''normal'' et d'attaque. Le sous-marin normal correspond \u00e0 s'eux de la 2e guerre mondial, petit et disposant de torpille, il peut transporter 3 missiles nucl\u00e9aire tactique, alors qu'il n'a aucun sas de lancement (WTF). Le sous-marin d'attaque quand t'\u00e0 lui correspond aux sous-marin moderne, comme on en vois dans les films am\u00e9ricain, ou de celui de Modern Warfare 2 quand il tire un missile atomique (bref vous avez compris son physique et sa fonction.) qui quand \u00e0 lui poss\u00e9dent plusieurs sas de lancement de missile nucl\u00e9aire, MAIS ne peu pas tirer de missile, sa fonction est de pouvoir stranporter une personne important (ex missionnaire, espion...) et attaquer les autres sous-marin et les navire de guerre, alors que se n'est pas sa fonction...\n\n3) Les soldats Marines aussi sont \u00e9trangement implant\u00e9e... Ils servent bien au d\u00e9but contre l'artillerie et les mitrailleurs (O\u00f9 ils dispose +50% de dommage sur les deux.) mais deviennent obsolet au file du temps. L'artillerie est remplacer par des v\u00e9hicules lance-missile et les mitrailleurs par des infanteries motoriser. Mais quand \u00e0 eux, les soldats Marine n'\u00e9volue pas, et donc ne peux plus contrer ses nouvelles unit\u00e9es et perd donc leurs bonus de d\u00e9gas contre eux.  \n\n4) Les espions qui apparaissent beaucoup plus t\u00f4t dans le jeux \u00e0 la technologie de l'alphabet, se cr\u00e9e comme des missionnaires et envoyer dans les villes amis ou ennemis pour voir se qui se traime chez le voisin, avec des points investie comme pour la culture ou la recherche. ils peuvent effectuer des mission de sabotage, r\u00e9volte, vol, ou de d'aide de convertion en votre religion. \n\n5) Des nouveaux sc\u00e9narios, celui du futur \u00e0 la conquete des planets est le plus int\u00e9ressant.\n\nConclusion \nUn tr\u00e9s bon jeu qui am\u00e9liore le jeu original et le surpasse.

Sure, it's really hard, but all games of the time were. When you got a game then, it was all about the single player.

The controls take literally a minute to change to modern FPS controls, so you can't really complain about them. Unlike many current games, it actually has a decent story and good atmosphere. The game has aged surprisingly well over eleven years. To get an idea of what I mean, go back and play the original Half-Life. Amazing game, but looks so bad it's almost impossible to play. The RPG elements are implemented really well, and any level-ups make an immediate difference in the game. While the inventory system is kind of a pain, it's realistic and works well.

Games are long and difficult, leaders are very animated and expressive and the soundtrack is utterly fantastic (Netherlands and Greeces theme are such smoothing tracks). The leader variety is slightly greater than Civ V (but Civ V has more civs with more unique abilities), and each leader has two traits, like Abraham Lincoln is Philosophical and Charismatic while Montezuma is Aggressive and Spiritual, for the most part these traits are fairly balanced, but there are a few expeditions of just play bad traits (Protective is infamously underpowered).\n\nEach Civ also has their two \"uniques\", unique units and unique buildings, unfortunately I don't really see these often being huge game changers with a few expeditions like Englands Redcoats, Ethipoias Omoro Warriors or Sumerians Ziggurats, this is probably cause the games combat is by far the worse aspect of it, units stack meaning most depth and strategy can be replaced with simply rushing enemies with strong melee units and hope to win, hope you built a lot of archers!", "timestamp_created": 1417111882, "timestamp_updated": 1417116557, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.599664", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13087089": {"recommendationid": "13087089", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111531339", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2033, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1417212423}, "language": "french", "review": "Tres bon jeu , tres complet ; je recommende", "timestamp_created": 1416990315, "timestamp_updated": 1416990315, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13022366": {"recommendationid": "13022366", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049668877", "num_games_owned": 247, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 96, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1415318664}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Fabuloso, uno de los juegos m\u00e1s adictivos e inteligentes que han existido...

case with all Civ games. What sets IV apart from the rest of the series is the sheer depth of the different mechanics that the player must manage to be successful. These include, but are not limited to: Economy, Military, Population, Health, Technology, and Espionage. With all of that work to do across the different eras of human history, it is easy to say that the turns you take in Civ IV will be longer than any other in the series.\n\nHow you deal with this fact is up to your personal preference. However, one thing is certain, Civ IV is extremely well streamlined, and even new players will be right at home with the mechanics with a modicum of perseverence. As someone who struggled with Civ III, I had fully grasped the mechanics of Civ IV by my tenth hour of gameplay: easy to learn, hard to master.\n\nUltimately, I recommend this game wholeheartedly to strategy fans. If you have Civ V, consider this the wise granddaddy of that great game. It is a wholly different and in some ways far more rewarding experience. If you have never played a Civ game before, Civ IV is a deeper choice, though if you are impatient and seek a more casual experience, the excellent Civ V is recommended.", "timestamp_created": 1415656639, "timestamp_updated": 1415656639, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12873275": {"recommendationid": "12873275", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027948597", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 17657, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1391789775}, "language": "english", "review": "Dispite time passed in Civilization series part IV remains a game with most options, great immersion and sufficient diversity via mods.

But the modding community is what keeps the game fresh and interesting.  Fall from Heaven II, Caveman2Cosmos, Planetfall, Realism Invictus, Rise of Mankind (to name just a few) - all are quality mods that change the dynamics of the game significantly to the point that they are almost entirely new 4X games in their own right.

After having achieved military, cultural, or economic superiority over the other Civs, however, the endgame often become tedious, and it is rare that I ever actually finish a game.   I don't have any experience with multiplayer, but even as a single player game, I love it.

Civ IV is a classic. After some of the frustrations with Civilization III following the majesty of Civ II, IV felt like a return to form for the series.  It has a lot in common with III, of course, but it made the game feel epic again.  It also resolved some of the awkward controls the series was known for, and added a few intriguing features.  In particular, religion, corporations, and civics (borrowed from Alpha Centauri).  \n\nWhat BTS gets right is amazing. There is a lot of depth to the decisions being made, and it can be a complex game if you want it to be.  The civic system lets you fine tune your own custom government (a theocratic police state with a free market?  Go right ahead!), with the rewards and penalties mixed, like in the classic Civs.  The diplomacy is vital to the game, and the AI's opinions of you actually matter, and can be influenced.  \n\nWhere it gets it wrong tends to be the tedium and the stacking mechanic.  Civ III and IV suffer from a design oversight that became a mechanic, called 'stacks of doom\" in which not only could an army be overpowered by playing upwards of 30-40 units in one tile, but such play became essential to win.  The city attacking and defending mechanics also leave something to be desired, as they are intended for stacks of doom.  The gameplay can be tedious compared to Civ V, many turns can pass without anything happening.  \n\nBut it's also more satisfying when you get to victory in this game.  And there are more victory options in Civ IV: BTS than any other Civ game, including early game victories such as religious.  \n\nThis game was so good in its time that even today the Civ fans are divided between Civ IV and V, with many fans preferring this game over the new version.  I do consider it a matter of preference, as I play both.  \n\nLast of all, certainly not least, Leonard Nimoy narrates this game in a Leonard Nimoy fashion.

The game play is deep, and with dozens of unique leader trait combos, several paths to victory, randomly generated maps, and tons of user mods, infinitely replayable.\n\nThe only downsides of this game are its failure to use hexes, failure to have a genuine 3d (as in globe) map, and a particular game mechanic in the combat system that makes crushing the AIs fairly easy when facing even remotely even odds.\n\nThere are religious, technological, corporate, political, cultural and military paths to victory.  Each civilization has both a unique unit and unique building, and each leader a unique set of two personality traits that affect gameplay significantly.  The game can be played on small maps, or gigantic.  It can be played in a quick speed - finishing in a couple hours - or in \"marathon\" speed, a game that can take several days to finish.  There are barbarian hordes that will smash your early civilization, and randomly generated events and quests to vary each game.\n\nIt's so infinitely replayable in fact, that I am going to stfu, and go start a new game right now...", "timestamp_created": 1393001262, "timestamp_updated": 1393001262, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9202154": {"recommendationid": "9202154", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032392742", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466564702}, "language": "english", "review": "A godly strategy game, even among other godly ones.

Tons of civs to choose from, and a huge civilopedia providing a wealth of knowledge about them. The civs are all well balanced, and there are tons of maps types to choose from. You can easily create your own maps as well, though it can be time consuming. A lot of fun to play with friends, just be sure to turn random events off because they will make the game go out of sync. Has some flaws, like the random events in multiplayer, and the fact that the CPU is pretty much pre ordained to hate you and try to kill you no matter what. Maintaining friendships with CPUS is very difficult. The most annoying thing in the game is when you have a very high percentage to win a battle and you lose. That small percent is there, so this does happen occasionally, and it can be quite dsheartening. Not at all a game breaker though. I recommend playing with friends for a more challenging experience.

The base game, Civilization IV, is great. It is a really in depth \"civilization simulator.\" You take control of a civilization starting at the dawn of time all the way to the modern era and beyond. The game is very in depth with all of the options at your disposal for how you manage your government, economy, religion, espionage, foreign policy, and many other factors. You can be Gandhi and set up a fascist theocracy with a socialist economy and nuke everyone on the planet. There is a lot of literature out there about how spectacular this game is so I\u2019ll just stop here.\n\nOne of the few flaws is the combat. It is all percentage based, so you can get in some pretty frustrating situations. Maybe you go into a battle where you have and 80+ percent chance of winning, but there is still a chance you can lose. Even at 97+percent I\u2019ve lost some times. This combat system is extremely frustrating when you \u201cget haxed\u201d and lose on battle you should have won. Another issue is that in late game the combat really just becomes \u201cwho can have the most units crammed into a tile.\u201d Your (and your opponents\u2019) empire will get so big and have so much production that it becomes quite cumbersome to manage a war with all the military units you\u2019ll have around. Since you can fit literally infinite units in one space, it really becomes a contest of who can get the biggest army and march from city to city. These flaws pale in comparison to how great and addicting this game is, however.\n\nThis expansion, beyond the sword, is the best. It adds even more units, buildings, and civilizations to the game. Also, it comes pre-loaded with some of the best mods, including Rhye\u2019s and Fall of Civilization, which takes this game to a whole new level. Over all it\u2019s as close to a 10/10 game I have ever seen.

It is a strategy game that got a lot right.  The gameplay mechanics encourage expansion, but simultaneously impose reasonable limts.  New technologies can alter the way the game is played, making a very different strategic picture through railroads, airplanes, and democracy.  The religion mechanic adds great flavor and some interesting gameplay.  Diplomacy is easy to understand, but hard to exploit.\n\nThere are some flaws.

You and your tribe have wandered for many moons. But now the village elders have consulted with the shamans, and have advised you to cease. For you have found the perfect place to call your new home. The grass is green, and ripe for farming. The river sparkles and dances in the golden blaze of the setting sun, waiting to be tamed, to feel the keel of boats along her great girth. And beyond, the distant forested hills call to you. Maybe someday, you and your tribe will dig deep into the womb of the Earth-mother, and harvest the metals that lie within. \n\n\nYou gaze with delight as the procession passes your balcony. The Emperor Jeffersonius himself, in his resplendent robes! His chariot rattles down the cobblestones as the victorious troops of the Ethiopian campaign march trimuphantly behind him, shields and swords gleaming in the summer sunshine. \"They have tamed Ethiopia, you know...\" you hear your father remark. \" We must move to the colonies soon, else there'll be no space left for us!\" Your mother laughs gently, and pats you on the head. \" We must think of Marcus. His education must take precedence, and you know old Ezrum refuses to travel.....\" You smile, and throw flowers into the path of those brave legionaires, who fight for the Empire so you may have the best of all  things, here in the capital of the world, Washington.\n\nYour horse gallops wildly through the smoggy streets. Gentlemen of industry, the representatives of the counties, aristocratic ladies, all of them jump and stumble out of the way as you ride past, angrily cursing your receding backside. Along the way, the butt of your rifle thuds against a slow-moving old academic, leaving him senseless upon the cobblestones. You care not, though. You have urgent news for the High Chancellor, and must not be impeded. A rebellion in the Indian colonies! The impertinence astounds you. How dare they, those brown-faced mongrels, rebel against the American Republic? You gallop up the steps of the Palace, and stop to gaze at the Eiffel Tower, under construction on the south banks of the Appatomac River. The fools....the nation that builds such wonders will not fall prey to such nefarious misdeeds! Reflection done, you proceed into the chambers of the High Chancellor to give him the news.\n\nYou sigh as you read the fine print of the tender submitted by the cold IronCorp executives. Summary privatization, first right to exploration contracts, government subisidzation of the first twelve months of drilling in the Thames estuary, etecetera, etcetera....your eyes water and you fling the document away, feeling the need for a break. You wipe your glasses and stroll over to the window. You gaze wistfully across the expanse of glass, neon and concrete that obscures your view of the Cristo Redentor, perched high above the city on Zara Yacob Hill. You ponder for a moment....is modernity really worth all this? Did all your ancestors, all the thousands of years of history, all the breakthroughs in science and technology and reason, all the accumulated pride, joy, triumph and defeat of the last four thousand years, lead to this? In the year of our Lord, 1955, you're standing here, in the Pentagon, trying to decide between two equally heartless, vile corporations. Is this what society has become?Ah, well. You wipe your glasses for the last time and shuffle back to your desk, reaching for the legal papers with a weary sigh. You look up at the television to see the newsman babbling about a terrorist attack on the Taj Mahal in Kyoto. Surprise, surprise......\n\n\"Oogaboog, wake up!\"\n\n\"hhmmphr....grumble...what?\"\n\n\"Chief Washington has called a meeting. He want all us warriors to attend. Quickly, get your club.\"\n\n\"....sigh...okay. But remind me to tell you about strange dream I had just now. Big strange.\"\n\n\"Okay, now come , we'll be late!\"\n\nYou exit, yawning, into the golden rays of the setting sun, hoping that Washington would let you settle here.

But I'm still of the opinion that this game has succeeded on its own merits. Even over a decade later, its mechanics still hold up to scrutiny. They're simple and abstract, but deceptively complex--one look at a Deity run on YouTube, and you'll understand what I mean. Granted, the graphics are a bit dated in 2018, and some still shudder at the thought of the infamous \"doomstack.\" Warfare has been (and always will be) a weakness of the series, but Civ IV eschews tactical depth in favor of sheer breadth. Neither Civ V or Civ VI gives you the epic sense of scale that Civ IV delivers when you reach a late game war and slam dozens of units into each other. And at the risk of offending naysayers, the warfare in Civ IV is still some of the best in the series. War is less tactical and more logistical. Winning requires planning, grand strategy, and proper allocation of resources, not finesse. This kind of approach feels better for a game that purports to cover the entire history of the human race. The game makes warfare a function of empire. You feel like a ruler sending nameless soldiers to their deaths, not a general commanding a single army. It's this sense of distance that the later Civs lack. Empire building games do not mix well with tactical wargames. Rather than succeeding as either, Civ V and VI turn out to be poor attempts at both--subpar wargames and subpar empire building games. In the end, Civ IV turns out to be a much more focused experience. It knows what it's trying to do, and it does it effortlessly. \n\nWhatever you may say about warfare, Civ IV is still king as far as the \"management\" and \"expansion\" sides of the game are concerned. One problem the Civilization series has always had trouble addressing is the problem of controlling expansion. How can we limit growth in a way that feels natural and rewarding to the player, while also leaving room in the late game for sprawling empires? It's a difficult question, and Civ titles rise and fall on the answers they give. Civ IV's answer is by far the best in the series, and it comes with three very basic principles. 1. Science is tied to commerce yield. Using a percentage slider, the player controls how much of their commerce they want committed to science and how much they want committed to gold. 2. Cities have a maintenance cost which depends on their distance from the capitol and how many total cities are in your empire. 3. Cities initially cost more gold in maintenance than they make in commerce. Together, these three mechanis require the player to take a balanced approach toward expansion. Expand too slowly, and you'll lose out on the early game land grab. Expand too quickly, and you'll ruin your economy, forcing your research to grind to a halt and causing your units to go on strike. Each city, as the Civ IV veteran Sulla once said, is an \"investment.\" Early on, new cities are weak and are a burden your empire has to bear. But if you keep developing them, building and working cottages, they can eventually support themselves. Establish a strong enough economic base wth a few core cities, and you'll have the ability to control dozens of cities in the mid-late game. It's a fantastic system, and still, I would argue, the best the series as seen so far.\n\nYeah, but it's 2018. We've got Civ VI now. Civ IV is old hat. It's dated, it's UI is clunky, and there's just no reason to play it anymore. Au contraire, my friend. Whatever the game may now lack in modern amenities, it makes up for with timeless mechanics and peerless depth. This is a game, to the detriment of every other aspect of your life, that will keep you glued to your seat well into the wee hours of the morning. If you have friends to play with, this is a game that will surprise you with escalating borders, Cold Wars, stunning betrayals, and the occasional nuke (not that I would know anything about that). This is a game that will test your capabilities, especially on the higher difficulties. \n\nThis is a game that stands the test of time.", "timestamp_created": 1516469903, "timestamp_updated": 1516470134, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39461290": {"recommendationid": "39461290", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013178993", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 68535, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 572, "last_played": 1516115289}, "language": "koreana", "review": "RFCD \ubaa8\ub4dc1000\uc2dc\uac04 \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \uc720\uc800\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.. \uc774 \uac8c\uc784\uc740 \ubcf8\ud3b8\ub3c4 \uc644\uc131\ub3c4\uac00 \ub192\uc9c0\ub9cc \ubb34\uc5c7\ubcf4\ub2e4\ub3c4 \ubaa8\ub4dc\uac00 \uc9f1\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.. \uc2e4\uc81c \uc9c0\uad6c\uc758 \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc758 \ud765\ub9dd\uc131\uc1e0\ub97c \uacbd\ud5d8\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 Rhye's fall and civilization \ubaa8\ub4dc\uac00 \uc9c4\ub9ac\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.. \uac1c\uc778\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc2a4\ud300\uc5d0 \ub3c5\ub9bd\ubaa8\ub4dc\ub85c \ucd9c\uc2dc\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba74 \uc88b\uaca0\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4 \u314e\u314e", "timestamp_created": 1516377027, "timestamp_updated": 1516377027, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 9, "review_score_desc": "Overwhelmingly Positive", "total_positive": 1183, "total_negative": 44, "total_reviews": 1227}}

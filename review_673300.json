The gameplay itself is nothing new to the genre, you're sidescrolling, shooting, and jumping over death pits while evading enemy shots and picking up an assortment of powerups which alter the pattern of your primary gunfire. This includes the traditional spreadshot, a fast-moving laser shot, a boomerang type shot (think Castlevania's cross subitem..) and others. You also pickup ammo for these various shot types, however you can only carry one gun at a time and it seems if you pickup another new gun type it will drop your ammo count down to the original 32 rather than transfer your accumulated ammo over, which can be a little bit annoying. You get so many of them so often though that it's never much of a hindrance. Some of the powerups seem a bit OP when compared to others though, such as the aforementioned boomerang which seems to slay bosses (including 2 instances where the sprite for one of its shots looked like it got hooked / glitched out on the stomach of the boss of stage 3...) while others, such as the linear (but fast) laser shot and the piddly little \"flamethrower\" seem to be more ineffective, requiring you to be positioned too accurately by comparison. \n\n\nThe game itself isn't quite as hardcore difficult as the titles of yesteryear, in that health pickups are scattered around the levels generously, and if you do die from falling down a pit you often restart at a checkpoint nearby rather than restarting the entire level (if you die at a boss, for example, you restart at the boss itself -minus your weapon modification/ammo- you do have a limited number of lives, however...) \n\n\nThe enemy patterns or dangers throughout the level aren't overly difficult to navigate either, whether it be arcs of lightning from certain platforms or weird fish enemies jumping up from the water to knock you down into the depths, the speed or quantity of their attacks never require too much precision to get around and don't occupy a large area of the screen. The enemies could be a little more varied, as you often see the same types throughout each of the levels, however this is also reminiscent of retro games in that they often repeated use of the same sprites as well.\n\nAbility-wise the game is more akin to early 8 bit titles, you are relegated to running, jumping, and shooting. You have no slide, double-jump, or wall-clinging/sliding abilities. There is no leveling up your weapons or character, so the game is very straight-forward. The game progresses in a \"level-by-level\" manner, so there is not much exploration at all, instead consisting mostly of \"running to the right\" until you reach the end level boss, defeat them, and move on to the next location. \n\nAll-in-all there isn't much to say about Alien Splatter Redux. If you're looking for a well-made, retro, 8-bit style game this is one of the best (and most affordable) available on Steam. Its music, sound effects, graphics, level design, and difficulty are all well done and in line with what made games of that era so endearing, and I look forward to playing more.", "timestamp_created": 1509306078, "timestamp_updated": 1509309039, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563218", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36066078": {"recommendationid": "36066078", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020737003", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509169591}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Jogo muito bom, relembrando os cl\u00e1ssicos de 8 bit", "timestamp_created": 1509168507, "timestamp_updated": 1509168536, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35214772": {"recommendationid": "35214772", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055157875", "num_games_owned": 247, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 95, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505679480}, "language": "english", "review": "If your like me, and you enjoy hard, challenging, fun 8 bit games, then this is for you. Controls are responsive, the weapon variety is limited, but fun to experiment with. I havent finished it yet, but its truly enjoyable to play. If you came for challenge, challenge is what you'll get.\n\nHowever, like mentioned, the game has quite a small weapon variety compared to the mechanics you could have to pair with the amazing level design. At time, an weapon that would fire on a circular pattern would help, or a weapon that would leave a delayed explosive so you could arrange for kills without putting yourself at risk. Sure, this would break the point of the game being challenge, but this comment is mostly for making an example of how more weapons could compliment the level designs perfectly. \nSimilar to weapons, the enemy variety is mostly prominent on bosses, to the point where the only threat you'll have during stages are going to be stage hazards more than enemies. After a while you just get their attack patterns down and they become more an obstacle than a challenging foe you have to beat to progress. \n\nFor as much as I like this game, and im willing to 100% it for fun, I'll have to say yes, but not a 10/10.

The gameplay is simple but fun, with basic platforming and interesting levels, from underground sewers to a moving train being hit by lightning. Most of the weapons feel fun and easy to use, and most enemies are diverse and fun to fight against. Bosses are interesting and are well  put to get, if a little bit bullet spongey.  The games' aesthetic brings back nostagia of Contra and the like, and if you feel like vomiting out your vital organs and/or commiting suicide, you can turn on the retro-vision to empty your eye sockets and fill you with even more nostagia. If I were to have any large complaints, it would be the controls on keyboards, as they are weird and unconventional. The game also don't save your keybinds between instances of the game, meaning you have to rebind them between play sessions. However, this can all be avoided if you just use a controller, which makes it feel better anyway.  My other complaint is that there is quite a large difficult curve between the train and snow stage, with unfair enemy placement, ice physics and that f***ing snow. Other then that, there are some small typos and lack of an options in the setting menu, but that is fine.

It's cheap, ugly, boring and no one wants it.\n\nASR is simplistic pseudo-retro platformer full of pandering for 'good old days' (namely project vice and contra) which brings nothing of value to the genre. It's a checklist 'retro' game. Faux 8bit, primitive soundtrack, moving platforms, elevators, lasers, pickups, instadeath pits etc.\nThe issue isn't the fact that it has nothing of it's own (like Axiom Verge or Shovel Knight), but the fact it isn't even good at ripping other games off (like Super Cyborg). If you are that 'retro' to the point of almost copying artwork, just make sure your game is actually any good in comparison.\nThe main story of the game is that Green Guy goes totally not ripping other games off and kills some Pink Blobs in the process. The same 5 types of pink blobs. Every level. Every small boring and repetitive level (with late ones being ugly too). Music is repetitive and not memorable, it's just a faux 8bit beeps you've seen millions of times. You'll fight the same enemies, jump the same platforms in different tilesets, pickup the same guns. Then there is bosses that look like slightly bigger pink blobs and they sometimes shoot stuff and die. Controls are simple, but a bit glitchy (which is rarely an issue though).\n\nTechnically the game runs and supports gamepads.\n\nWell, I think the game could provide a hour of entertainment for a low price if you have no other platformers to play, but you probably do - the genre is pretty healthy these days.", "timestamp_created": 1501461513, "timestamp_updated": 1501461575, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.455894", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33889837": {"recommendationid": "33889837", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053082325", "num_games_owned": 521, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501361143}, "language": "english", "review": "It's pretty fun, looks and sounds like an authentic 8-bit game but it's pretty damn easy.

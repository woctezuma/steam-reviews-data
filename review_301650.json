You drive a hover tank and it's great! The hover tanks controls amazingly as you zoom across the battlefield and strafe your enemies while pumping them full of lead and plasma. The terrain is hardly an obstacle for you, so make sure to use it to your advantage.\n\nThe campaign has a very interesting story and takes you to different planets and moons in our solar system. At times the missions can be very challenging, but they have managed to strike the perfect balance by putting missions with less pressure in between those that has you sweating bullets.\n\nThe gameplay and graphical user interface (that radar is awesome) goes far beyond what I'd expect from a game from '98.

The action is like Homeworld meets Battlefield 4, and it's a damn good marriage. Battles are fierce, especially when resources become scarce. Unit capabilties are all different, from weapons to manueverability along with the many different weapons you can equip. The multiplayer is fantastic, I've never had an \"easy\" game and the community is fun to play against. From players trying to snipe during a large battle with rockets and freaking laser beams going everywhere, to dropping a mega bomb at your foes base entrance to weaken the defences, there is no safe space. You will have your weakpoints exploited fiercly and deal with head to head combat when it comes to getting resources. People will treat it like gold, and rightfully so. I remember my bombers getting whipped by a fleet of scouts that flanked me -- but the balance is so well implemented with speed vs firepower, that I barely won the fight. I retreated after my victory, ammoless, only to be taken out by a few scouts chasing me.\n\nMy fondest memory was when I was literally ducking in my computer chair when a ship flew over me while I was attacking a small enemy outpost, which got ugly quickly when it became clear it was a trap. I recall knowing it was likely a trap, my ally said I'd regret chasing the bait, and even my cat said not to do it, but there's nothing more pleasing than chasing and shooting a ship running away from you if it means getting some scrap and downing one potential attacker.\n\nThere are so many ways to play the game, and so many ways to counter an enemy tactic. Each encounter is different, some more brutal than others. Such as both enemies going at it, blowing each other up, getting ejected high into the air, then floating downward towards each other to finish the fight ON FOOT.

And...it did! Mostly thanks to the remastering it was given. The AI was updated, the graphics were given a nice smoothing out polish that stays true to the original game while giving it its own appeal all on its own.\n\nThe Campaigns are great. The base two that is, the expansion is another beast. The story is a fascinating concept I've yet to see anyone pull off quite as well. The Space Race was a cover to launch a new fleet of ships to gather a mysterious but powerful metal that fell to Earth in a meteor shower. America and the Soviet Union are spreading throughout the Solar System to find this new material, and slowly discover its not so benign origins.\n\nAlthough it could be seen as basic in some ways, the writing and voice acting sell this story. Every VA is giving this story their fullest, and still maintains a strange sense of authenticity despite some lines or accents that are fairly cheesy in nature. The Soviets in particular are great in this regard.\n\nThe balance between the two isn't too difficult, the NSDF are a bit faster, the CCA are a bit tougher, and they share all the same units. Despite this they still manage to feel unique thanks to the great designs, and weapon loadouts. You have the ability to change loadouts as well once you have an armory, giving you any of the weapons in the game for just a bit of scrap. You can use units as they are and do great, or customize their weaponry and do even better! Or worse depending on what you give them, but still.\n\nThe difficulty is just right, as the campaign can be fairly challenging at times on the tougher difficulties, but thankfully a good strategy can carry you through the game. There's no times that not knowing what comes ahead in the mission will screw you over, and any mission that you lose will just about always be your fault, save for maybe one Soviet mission. You'll know it when you get to it.\n\nIf you're looking for the original RTS/FPS Combination, this is it baby. Great gameplay, Great story, Great voice acting, Great everything. The only gripes I would have are the AI are a bit too good at tracking your every moment before you make it, some missions are definitely stacked against the player and are a little frustrating, and ...Really that's it.\n\n9/10 Spores, easily.

I've been playing (not to mention making mods for) the Battlezone franchise since my childhood, and while BZ2 expanded and improved on the original in almost every way the original Battlezone holds a special place in my heart, forever and always. And I am positively thrilled to report that this reboot is the very same Battlezone I came to adore back in the 2000's, albeit with improved graphics and performance.\n\nNow, an un-biased review!\n\nFirst off, graphics. The graphics are, indeed, more than a little dated. This still looks like the game that came out in 1998. That's not to say that it looks bad or anything. It just don't hold up compared to modern games, so if you're looking for something as gorgeous as Crysis 3 you'd best look elsewhere. The reboot did do a wonderful job of reworking the terrain and textures, giving the game sharper details and clearer imagery while keeping the retro look and feel of the original.\n\nNext, gameplay. Where to freakin' start?! Not much has changed between the original and the reboot in this department. Gameplay is the original fast-paced RTS/Shooter hybrid, centering around the fleet of hovertanks you have at your disposal. Build a base, gather resources, build and command your army, all while dogfighting with enemy forces behind the controls of any one of the numerous vehicles at your disposal, from quick and nimble scout craft to meaty tanks to lumbering and terrifying walkers. Outfit your vehicle and your wingmen with a selection of conventional and futuristic weapons like anti-tank cannons, heat-seeking missiles, lasers, or that damn Thumper (an earthquake gun of all things).\n\nThe controls are rather intuitive for such a hybrid game. Sure, there are a few things that might throw off modern gamers (using E to jump and your spacebar to command units, i.e.), but once you get the hang of it the controls handle quite nicely. The UI is decent enough, with your units divided into catagories that you then select from (Offensive for things like tanks, Defensive for turrets and howitzers, utility for gatherers and such, ect.). The system is a bit limited but works smoothly enough with the gameplay.\n\nAll in all I HIGHLY reccomend this game to anyone looking to try something new. Battlezone plays like nothing else out on the market, and while an RTS/FPS hybrid does take some getting used to it is well worth a try. It may have aged a bit and might not look as good as current-gen AAA games, but this is one sleeper that will grab a willing player by the throat and keep them begging for more.", "timestamp_created": 1505193459, "timestamp_updated": 1505193459, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.637784", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34887702": {"recommendationid": "34887702", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020358251", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503806201}, "language": "english", "review": "Works Great on win10 Just as fun as it was back in the 90s", "timestamp_created": 1505153602, "timestamp_updated": 1505153602, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34721038": {"recommendationid": "34721038", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024154980", "num_games_owned": 319, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 740, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503630995}, "language": "english", "review": "History comes full circle.

You can run around, jump into vehicles, eject and so on - but more importantnly you can still command an array of ships and resources as the battle rages around you - almost as simply as pointing at something. \n\nThe AI of your ships and enemy ships is great and large battles can unfold - but then take that online - and suddenly you have a dozen people all doing this in a strat game, or simply battling it our like a roman gladiator. \n\nIn the last 20 years this game is still unsurpassed in the in game user interface, flight mechanics, first person strat - and potential for online fun", "timestamp_created": 1503958246, "timestamp_updated": 1503958246, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34448656": {"recommendationid": "34448656", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059883945", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503529710}, "language": "english", "review": "I am an experienced player of the original 1998 game and I still play it on occasion to this day. This is one of the greatest video games ever made and possibly the best tank real time strategy game ever made. It is legendary. Now onto the review of this Redux remake:\n\nFirst thing, I appreciate that they kept the opening theme of the game, that was a nice touch. The rest unfortunately needs work. This does not look much better than the orignal game with the HiRes texture pack installed. I was expecting the graphincs to be much more polished but I was dissapointed. The vehicles (Tanks, turrets, etc.) have been improved only slightly, they are still blocky/geometrical. I was dissapointed with the sounds (Gunshots, explosions) as well, they are the original ones and sound exactly the same. The explosion graphics look the same as the originals with the HiRes pack installed. A few more things worth mentioning: When you first open the game the small launch screen looks like the work of a 2 year old, very crude. The fonts of the in-game menus do not look good. Also, the original game has a built-in cheat code to enable access to all the maps. You would choose your side (Either US or CCA) and then type:  iamadirtycheater and the map list would appear. It doesn't work on this remake. Since it was part of the original game, it should have been included. \n\nI would not recommend this remake. Stick to the orignal w/ HiRes texture pack installed.

Commanding multiple units is still easy enough to figure out from the start, though doesn't get much more in-depth than what you get at the surface.\n\nAs for the remake, almost all of the changes have been cosmetic. Upgraded textures, visual effects, some touches to lighting.

Battlezone revived for modern computer systems! This is a dream come true for fans of this classic. \n\nIf you played the old Battlezone from 1998, this will feel very familiar to you. The sights and sounds are practically the same, but the graphics are upgraded from the original release. There is little reason to not get the Red Odyessy as well. \n\n\n\nIf you haven't played Battlezone before, here is the basic premise: \n\nIn 1952, a metor shower rains down around the Bering Strait between Alaska and the USSR. The meteor remains, which are collected by the US and the Soviets, contain strange material that is named Bio-Metal. This material allows both superpowers to be able to make massive leaps in thier technology, far beyond even today's tech, although the general public is kept in the dark. \n\nFast forward to 1969, and the Apollo 11 mission lands on the moon, Basically the Space Race as we know it still happens as a cover. The real space race is what the story focuses on. Before Apollo happens, the US has already established a military presence on the moon, using very advanced technology and vehicles derrived from the Bio-Metal. In fact, during the first mission, you see one of the Lunar landers.  \n\nHowever, the USSR also lands military forces on the moon, called the Communist Cosmonaut Army (CCA) on the moon, and attack the US forces, which are called the National Space Defense Force (NSDF).   The story takes off from there, with missions taking place around the planets and moons of the solar system, not Earth though.  There is also a campaign where you play as one of the Soviets. \n\nAdditionally, the Red Odyessy DLC, back then called an expansion pack, takes place on Ganyemede, one of Jupiter's moons, with the NSDF fighting the People's Republic of China, which has also obtained Bio-metal from meteors. Their space forces are called the Chinese Red Army (CRA). The Chinese have there own unique units, and are not completely allied with the Soviets, reflecting the real life Sino-Soviet split. There is one campaign for each side in this DLC as well. \n\nThe game itself is a hybrid of real time strategy/tactics and first person vehicle combat. \n\nYou control your vehicle and it's weapons, taking part in combat, but also command friendly units, as well as building bases and collecting Bio-Metal (the only resource, which can be found scattered about the maps or can be taken from the wreckage of destroyed units). \n\nEach side has a variety of vehicles, which you can change during a level. Hitting the 'H' key has you hop out of your vehicle and able to get in another one. You also eject automatically when your vehicle is destoryed. While outside the vehicle, you are basically an Astronaut infantryman with a plasma rifle. You are extremely vulnerable in this state.  So get in another vehicle ASAP.\n\nDon't fool yourself, This is a challenging game. This is from a time when games were more challenging to complete. \n\nIf you are up for a challenge and want to try something different from more recent games, get this and enjoy yourselves!", "timestamp_created": 1499031549, "timestamp_updated": 1499379194, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507082", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33062453": {"recommendationid": "33062453", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970721984", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 305, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511728825}, "language": "french", "review": "Premi\u00e8re mission impossible \u00e0 faire \u00e0 moins de tricher.", "timestamp_created": 1498870251, "timestamp_updated": 1498870251, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.358306", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32921662": {"recommendationid": "32921662", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047164550", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508056736}, "language": "english", "review": "A lot more fast paced than Battlezone 2, but it's not such an issue for me.

Now, you have to go to Mars to establish a base among the CCA already stationed there, until you find evidence of an ancient alien race and their ancient tech that could make or break space forever. As a time piece game, it's a \"Cold War-gone-Hot\" based game with some 1984-level cleansing to make sure the public never knows and, to be fair, it's one of the better games to execute the story. 9/10\nGraphics: The graphics look pretty damn awesome. Playing it from a N64 version, the graphical advantage is apparent and it does do a lot of what it needs to do in order to be a redeluxe version of the 1998 classic. 9/10\nControls: To me, the tanks control like lubed up bananas on a wax floor like they participated in the Indy 500 (which does make sense considering they're hovering tanks), but the controls for ordering your troops or base around to any potential power source works well enough. 8/10\nMusic and Sound: Both are recycled from the original '98 version, but it would have been cool if the voice lines were updated with new voice actors, but add in the touches needed to make it sound like the originals. While I could just leave it at a 6.5/10 and get on with it, the fact that the music and a lot of the in-game sound can be replaced with mods is the reason I'll give it a 7.5/10.\nOverall and mentions: As a person who has only seen footage of Battlezone 98 and had some trouble with Rise of the Black Dogs on the N64, I was disappointed to see how such a hyped game resulted in something relatively obscure. It's not exactly a diamond in the rough, but it is definitely something like a ruby in the rough. I hope that it does get more players, though most people will still decide to download the original 1998 game. 7.5/10 because it's not a bad game, but it does have some issues that could make it overlooked.

If you are looking at this title, you likely played it a long time ago, and if you liked it then, you will like it now.

The graphics are upgraded slightly from what they were a long time ago.  The game is stable enough to run on modern machines and OS, and the multiplayer works.  The story is a cliche 1980's cold war saga, but with a twist that the USA and USSR are fighting a secret war in space.  What sets this game apart, however, is that it is one of the first games that combined first person shooter with base building and unit controlling RTS, AND did it relatively well.  There are a handful of games that had this style back then, but Battlezone 98 definitely ranks up there as one of the better ones.  You can jump in and out of your vehicles, build a base, build new vehicles, mine stuff, order battle groups around, or have them follow you, and pilot your way to glory.  There are plenty of vehicles to choose from, and the tech progression works up nicely.  A real classic Command and Conquer feel, with a first person 3d twist.

When first person shooters and strategy games were still in larval stages while platformers and other genres dominated the market, this game brilliantly blended the two bold new genres together in a format unlike any other.  Not only did you build buildings and commanded armies, you went on the frontlines with them with powerful tanks, and if you were feeling lucky, you can disembark one for REAL sniper skill challenges as a humble trooper.  They have a wonderful mix of both units, and arsenals that can shake the game up faster than a bartender on crack mixing a martini.\n\nThe primary drawbacks i site on this is the lack of open ended skirmish both offline and online, if they did this like other strategy games did back in the day this game would be perfect, and resources are very finite making gameplay restrictive.  The game is very challenging but can be a real controller/mouse to the screen difficult, and not in the challenging way that uber gamers desire, more like, \"WHY THE FUCK!? HOW!?\" where you can only have a margin in the lower single digits of error to proceed.\n\nThe game had immense potential, and it still does, but as long as the gameplay remains this restrictive it won't go further than it is.  Despite the flaws, i still recommend this hidden gem to anyone seeking a witches brew of intense first person shooting combat and calculating real time strategy gameplay molded into one.

Does that mix do the job? Yes and no. What is certainly lacking is a [i]pause-and-command[/i] button, minding the FPS element is often intense, leaving very little time to make grand strategic decisions. But whether playing [b]Command and Conquer[/b] you have ever thought if it was you in one of those tanks, you'd show'em, here you go, [b]Battlezone[/b] is all about that and it is tough as nails.\n\nThe game is a true classic, reminding me of [b]UFO Enemy Unknown[/b] [1993] in many aspects. [b]Battlezone[/b] and [b]UFO[/b] are both innovative, experimenting and focused on multilayer management. Both also represent core science-fiction. While [b]UFO[/b] is yet turn-based and general level, [b]Battlezone[/b] is real-time and down to the gunbattle.\n\n[b]Battlezone[/b] is definitely a gem of its time, probably even beyond its time, probably even beyond any time before or after its release, so to say. It is just a unique product. How does it stand nowadays? How playable it ultimately is at the present?\n\nThat is when things come down to the rating, which unfortunately is negative. STEAM review must be either recommending or dissuading. With greatest difficulty I see this game appealing to modern [2016] players. The problem is more than just nature of visuals or lacking of certain ease elements, such as the mentioned [i]pause-and-command[/i] function. It is the oftentimes chaotic picture of action, difficulty of FPS combat and movement controls, overall difficulty level, complex real-time base and force management with flaws characteristic to the early productions standing for the RTS genre.\n\nThe score is 5/10 wHATs grade. I should best repeat what has already been put in one of the other customers reviews: if you are prone to like this game, you probably already know it, thus have little need for any reviews to help you make up your mind about the purchase. Otherwise, if you hesitate, skip it.\n\nWhat is needed with [b]Battlezone[/b], is a complete remake [reboot], reintroducing the game to the modern public, instead of only a visual facelift [redux].

If you like RTS games, and like what you see it is worth it. The way the game feels even today is smooth and just like I recall from nearly two decades ago, whereas normally nostalgia games don't live up to their memory this one most certainly does indeed.

I modded heavily, made dozens of maps, participated in strat tournaments, and was a very loyal BZ player for years (alias: Ian S.) Unfortunately, I got away from BZ in school when life happened, but now over the summer I've come to try the Redux.\n\nThis is a bit of an emotional game for me. My brother and I played it when I was 4, on an old Windows 95 machine. I found the game again when I was 14 and lonely, and absolutley immersed myself in modding and making maps, learning about every trick in the book to script missions. When LUA coding came out, my entire modding world was opened.\n\nAs far as the game goes, as advertised it's an awesome blend of the FPS/RTS genre. I've always appreciated how you can control and mobilize an entire army of vehicles but still zoom around in a tank blowing up crap. The campaigns are epic in this game, especially the NSDF one. There are some elements from BZ 1.5 (before the Redux came out) that I like better, but overall the Redux is much higher quality and transitions the game into the 21st century. Online multiplayer is also very fun, there is nothing quite like winning a strategy match after an adrenaline-pumping half an hour of back and forth combat.\n\nI can't put as much effort into this game as I wish I could anymore, but I do highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't tried it before.

The gameplay is so nostalgic it almost hurts (I shamelessly admit I did cry a little when I first started playing), and it helped patch holes in the story for me, having only played BZII prior.\n\nIt's a fun challenge, and, as far as I'm aware, a rather unique style of gameplay that I've never really seen replicated outside of BZII (the combination of the RTS base-building, unit-commanding with the FPS player-controlled unit is an element I just love to bits, yet I can't think of any other games that utilize it).\n\nWould I recommend the game?

FPSRTS games are a rare breed, and most of them are utter trash. This one is interesting though. The vehicles control quite well, and the command interface is pretty clear and easy to use, and the hud makes me need new pants. Seriously, not enough games understand that giving players a proper cockpit view of their vehicles make us immediately like the game like at least 30% more. My only complaint is that a lot of keybindings are locked permanently, so if you want to say, bind jump to spacebar, you're SoL because that's permanently bound to commanding your units. However, thankfully most of the controls that are locked are locked to logical keys. Targetting a unit, for example, is T. Can't be changed, but doesn't really need to. Also, for some reason the game doesn't recognize left alt as a valid key to bind things to for some reason.  I would love to put \"issue command\" to left alt and \"jump\" to space.\n\nEasily 9/10, just off of campaign alone.", "timestamp_created": 1466857824, "timestamp_updated": 1466857824, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505207", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23786429": {"recommendationid": "23786429", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045538583", "num_games_owned": 217, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2247, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487295607}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome game from my childhood.

One mod is the replacement of the music with the music from the N64 port of Battlezone; Battlezone:  Rise of the Black Dogs.

Obviously other Nations are going to fight over this substance, so the National Space Dfence Force and  Cosmos Colonist Army battle over control of this substance.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThis game is a blend of RTS and FPS elements that really seem to fit together and join together as one rather well. With the game primarily taking place in space with a sort of futuristic style it really takes upon the genre rather well. You can play as a hover tank that you can view from the cockpit, hunting down enemys with the hovertank destorying enemy crafts is rather satifying and brings back memories of when I used to play Starwars battlefront II.\n\nAlthough the game looks rather nice and seems like a pretty strong build from the earlier version of the game, sometimes the AI on the game seems a bit unresponsive and just sits there. Sometimes their pathfinding of where they are actually suppose to be moving can be a bit weird and obserdly different than what you would expect them to do.\n\nAnyways, the game is a really good source of what a RTS game should be all about. Being able to deploy your recycler at a power source to collect bio-metal that are used in the base in order to build defensive structers and wingmen into the battle. You are able to build towers to help you in the battle, with things such as Comm Tower which can take control of a satellite and you are able to view the battlezone. This gives you the added advantage of being able to command your wingmen in the traditional wya that you would normally in other RTS games.\n\nWith the graphics remasterd from the 1998 version of the game, it looks very nice and sharp which is what you would expect a game to look like in todays standards. With the hovercrafts and towers looking very futuristic and nicely detailed, I feel like the game was refinely detailed in every way when this game was being developed. The textures look very smooth and the explosions on are very nice.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n+ Detailed graphics\n+ Fun gameplay\n+ Shows what a RTS should rally be like\n+ FPS in a RTS game is very unique and hard to come by on steam\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n- Weird AI at times\n\n[h1]Result / Final Thoughts[/h1]\nMy final thoughts on this game are pretty high. They really took the original game and made it into a modern version, with the graphics of everything and the amount of towers you can build to help you win the battle it really shows what you can do with a RTS game.

It's the hidden gem of hidden gems.\n\nSet in an alternate 1960s where the space race is just a cover for a cold war turned hot, the United States and Soviet Union secretly deploy massive armies into space in pursuit of an extra-terrestrial substance, [i]bio-metal[/i], that can be used to craft amazing and powerful weapons of war. The National Space Defense Force (NSDF) and Cosmos Colonist Army (CCA) do battle over control of the [i]bio-metal[/i] throughout the solar system using hover tanks crafted from the precious material. Battlezone has some of the best sci-fi lore of any game- don't skip over the briefings and debriefings! \n\nBattlezone has always had interesting gameplay because of the way it blends RTS and FPS elements. You primarily play the game from the view of the cockpit of your hover tank: you can hunt down enemy craft yourself and blow them away, OR, you can deploy your [i]recycler[/i] (main production unit) at a nearby geyser power source and being collecting [i]bio-metal[/i] using [i]scavengers[/i] in order to build a base, defensive structures, and wingmen to take into battle with you. If you build a Comm Tower, you can take a satellite view of the battle[strike]field[/strike]zone and command your wingmen in traditional RTS style, but you don't need to have a Comm Tower to effectively command all of your units (in fact, most often it is better to NOT take this approach).\n\nBattlezone 98 Redux (BZR) has received many improvements over the original game. These include highly improved terrain textures, models, lighting, menus, and more, and these alone make the game worth a purchase and play through. However, because BZR is built on the code of the 1998 release, some of the baggage from years ago has made its way into this game. The net code, though improved, still struggles from time to time, and having a good connection can be important to having an enjoyable online experience. (Overall this is has never been a problem for me, though.) The sound system also struggles mightily when there are many units in play or in a battle- it will eventually just choke and cut out completely until there are fewer units. The sound cutting out is a scenario that you're for the most part unlikely to encounter during regular gameplay, however.\n\nKeeping these small qualms in mind, the game is absolutely a steal at its current price, and will buy you hours and hours of fun in space. I SAID FUN IN SPACE!\n\nIf any 90's game deserved a Redux, this was it. Especially if you never played the original (but even if you have!), this is a must buy.\n\n10 Grizzlies out of 10.", "timestamp_created": 1461890965, "timestamp_updated": 1461890965, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.724991", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22692900": {"recommendationid": "22692900", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965990971", "num_games_owned": 109, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1269, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474040862}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game that kicks your arse from the off, love it!", "timestamp_created": 1461870026, "timestamp_updated": 1461870026, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.468068", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22670114": {"recommendationid": "22670114", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111385841", "num_games_owned": 209, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505316757}, "language": "english", "review": "i first played this game when i was 7 years old it brings back so many good memories i remember the old graphics which was good back then and there was no shadows but the redux edition has shadows new and improved graphics and even multiplayer which they ended support for in 2002 i think anyway a great game i highly recommend this for people who are new to the battlezone franchise and veteran gamers as myself. i love battlezone 98 redux", "timestamp_created": 1461797911, "timestamp_updated": 1461892363, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497540", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22664454": {"recommendationid": "22664454", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970775027", "num_games_owned": 2367, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 533, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468519349}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't remember this game to be that difficult.

I feel like the game balance is wrong because the bomber and tank units died faster than the scout. I was also very frustrated when bombs and rockets seemed to do less DPS than my scout's mini gun. The rockets were especially frustrating because they fly very slowly, forcing you to lead the target a considerable amount.\n\nI could have dealt with all that if the joystick aiming was more intuitive.

The genre never really took off, but because Battlezone was bundled with a lot of graphics cards it reached a wide audience and gained a cult following.\n\nIf you are someone who's considering buying this having played it way back when, do it. It's a reworking, not a remake, so the real BZ atmosphere is still there. The ships and buildings are all heavily redone, with much more detailed models and much larger textures. They look excellent. The terrain looks very much like it did back in the original, so it's still behind Battlezone 2, nevermind more modern titles. But all things considered, the graphics do a good job today with the update. The gameplay is as rich as ever. Multiplayer is now handled through Steam within the game, which keeps things nice and simple, with all the old options. A bomber DM is still a thrill after all these years.\n\nIf you are someone who's never played the original and are wondering whether you should buy this, well don't expect it to look fresh. The developers of this update have done an incredible job hauling parts of the game into the 2010s, but there are engine limitations. Firefights are limited to a few hundred meters in distance, and don't expect detailed ballistics or other physics.\n\nThe real joy of Battlezone, however, was always its gameplay, and its blend of FPS and RTS that has never really been replicated since. In each mission you will be dogfighting and base building, often at the same time. A selection of ships can be built, each of which offer different benefits, and you can kit them out with a variety of weapons. Your resources (\"biometal\") are gathered by Scavengers which have an annoying habit of wandering off into dangerous areas and so need to be constantly protected. Two single-player campaigns are included, so there's a hefty chunk of content for someone who has no plans to dabble in multiplayer.\n\nAt the price, this game still delivers eighteen years after its original release, whether you're looking for something new or a satisfying hit of nostalgia.

To this day I can remember it all.\n\nSome of my best memories are of playing this with my dad and his friends and the journey it took me on as i developed my skills and mindset towards becoming Better and better,  Every match utilized a different  strategy there were so many different vehicles and weapons loadouts you could use that it provided endless challenge and excitement Even though I lost almost every match,\n\nJust as the year ended I donned a New mantle that would come to be my gamertag(ReaperX2000).\n\n Moments before the new millennium I defeated My father and his friends in a brutal day wrecker victory I built and ammased an army of scouts and an armory quickly hunting down my opponents by carefully placing my troops i ejected so i could overlook the enemy base, launching 2 day wreckers onto seperate targets so the blasts would overlap and cause the most  widespread havoc, \n\nI waited with my sniper prone trained on whatever red dot i could find as the bombs reached the peak of thier arc i waited anxiously counting down the moments before they would be in range, as they approached just above his base i took the shot sniping one of his scavengers to draw his attention.Perfect, Just as he had time to turn around the bombs dropped destroy his entire offensive wing most of his scavengers and almost all of the buildings lay in critical condition.\n\n\"Time to send in the dogs.\" I ordered my wing of scouts to attack his recycler, it was a crushing blow, as the scouts many miniguns quickly lay waste to what was left of Dads installer buddy.  I quickly ordered my scavengers and a couple defense turrets into the area to collect the salvage, It was time to take on the real threat, Dad himself.\n\nMy attack had been successful but in order to accomplish this task i had left myself open to attack at my original base, Fortunately i had already tucked my recyler away in a different geyser, calling it and the constructor it had built i quickly began raiseng defences for my new base, i built several powerplants and guntowers surrounding and plugging the perrimiter turrets,\n\n I had recyled most of my scouts and sent a few to scout for the enemy repurposing all the metal i could find into tanks and walkers, and of course switching to my own walker with my favorite choice of weapons,(Flash & Mag <3) Dad had already utilized the time to construct his own army of tanks but he lacked defensive structures, With my earlier attack run i had gained advantage by collectiong far more scrap far quicker, He put up a good fight, Our tanks clashed in a battle of explosions for what seemed like an hour. But in the end my resources allowed me the victory, Sending in wave after wave of tanks as i established defenses on his doorstep to reclaim my lost scrap, Eventually he lost out and I claimed Sweet Sweet Victory.\n\nThis victory would be the driving force to push me to succeed in any and every video game,Memories of the different odds i have overcome would give me the confidence to take on any new challenge,And the theme of this game would place space simulators action and strategy games in a special place in my heart.My 7 Year old Mind would grow to use battlezone as the basis to judge every game upon, And to this day, No game i have ever played,(And I have played ALOT) compares to matches in this game, \n\nThis to me, is simply the best game that was ever made, and seeing it here in steam(WITH MODS!!), remastered beautifully, Leaving the real joy to this game completely untouched, Because it was just so masterfully done the first time. is a dream come true,\n\nI would reccomend this as a 10 Out of 10 But this game is so wonderful it would simply take its score Divide by zero and multiply by infinity, Not only do I reccoment this game, this is THE game I reccomend For gamers at any point in thier lives\n\nThank you for reading.\n\nTL;DR: Buy this game, It could change your life.\nP.S.

Don't make that mistake coming into this game.  \n\nThe game's difficulty is pretty steep on some places forcing you to think about what you need and plan out a good defense and offence. Unlike most RTS ideals where rushing into battle before the AI get's its camp set, you're rewarded for planning out your base and making the right choices for your army. \n\nThe storyline for the game is also really interesting.

Space tank space race. \n\nThe gameplay is an incredibly well thought out combination of a squad based fps shooter with command and conquer-esque rts elements which has only been done just a few times, none of which has come close to Battlezone in execution.\n\nBecause let's face it, there is no reason to attempt it again. It was done perfectly the first time and all future attempts will fall short of greatness.\n\nThe base building is satisfying as you go from a small recycler to a full-on citadel of gun turrets and mines as you balance a need to finish off the mission as well as keeping your scrap intake moderated so you do not inadvertantly starve yourself of resources. That's where the first-person squad based gameplay comes in. There are a wide variety of different tanks to choose from with a varying degree of playstyles between them, starting from a nimble and weak Scout/Fighter to a slow, powerful Walker/Golem. Bread and butter Tanks to niche fillers such as Rocket Tanks and Bombers to tackle specific situations that may arise as you fight over a planet. No one tank feels completely useless and all feel as if they can be useful in a one-on-one fight if used/maneuvered correctly. If you choose that the fps gameplay isn't exactly your sort of thing, there exists more traditional RTS elements through satellites that give an overhead view of a map where you can micromanage your tanks effectively rather than blow things up yourself.\n\nIt is legitimately my favorite game, and now it has an HD remake and runs perfectly on a modern PC.\n\nThis game and all it offers deserves a playthrough, because it never got a fair shake when it initially came out. Think about it for a moment, Atari released boatloads of reboots of their old franchises and most of them were terrible because it did not do anything remotely interesting. Along comes another old arcade reboot which served as the antithesis of everything Atari was churning out. It not only features the badass story that hooks you on its sheer craziness, the gameplay has also aged incredibly well.\n\nInfinite recommends, you should play this and experience one of the most unique games to come out of the 90s.

I played the original version for 300+ hours. \n\nIf you've played this before, then you already know how incredible it is and have bought it.\n\nIf you haven't, this version of Battlezone is a hybrid FPS/RTS sci-fi tank/battle Cold War simulator... in space. It's every bit as awesome as it sounds. Basically, imagine a really excellent, top-notch RTS with a fantastic interface in which you get to play as one of your own units while directing the battle. It sounds complex, but the UI is so excellent that neither part of the game, the tank simulator or the RTS, loses anything in the translation; it's two first-rate games in one. You play as a pilot who can switch ships and even snipe enemy pilots and take over their vehicles.\n\nI still remember the amazing adventures I had playing this game. The heart-pounding race to escape  a planet about to explode in seconds, being chased by alien superweapons all the way. Escorting my Soviet scientists across a bridge above the fiery lava of Jupiter's moon Io, getting blown out of my tank as it's destroyed by superior American forces, sniping the pilot of an American rocket tank who attacked me, stealing his vehicle and using it to fire upon my unsuspcecting foes, saving my forces. Sneaking into a heavily defended Soviet base on Europa to see where they've hdiden the stolen plans. Being ambushed by Soviet forces on the plains of Venus. They simply don't get any better than this.\n\nThe emergent gameplay situations, the enormous tactical flexibility afforded by the strategic layer of the game, the first-rate physics and satisfying gunplay, the huge variety of weapons and vehicles- even nearly 20 years later, this game remains unmatched I truly wish more people would try to rip it off! To try to compare it to some more modern titles if you haven't played this, imagine melding the seamless tactical interface and large-scale battle control of Sins of a Solar Empire with the visceral action and FPS excitement of Call of Duty, plus the open-ended battlefield and branching combat options afforded by Crysis or Far Cry. All with a cool sci-fi story in space. I am not exaggerating. It truly is that good.\n\nAnd all this before I even get to the beautiful, loving restoration this game has been given!\n\nAll of the above refers to the 1998 \"vanilla\" edition. But in this 98 Redux edition, the game has been given a complete makeover and beautifully brought up to date with care and devotion. The developers really layered on an extra level of polish along with all-new graphics and options for modern PCs. New, Steam-based online multiplayer? Check. Brand new HD graphics and textures? Check? New mod support? Check. In my brief time to date with the new version, AI also feels like it's been improved and bugs have been fixed. It really feels like a whole new game with the excellent graphics update. This is NOT the shovelware, throw-anything-on-Steam junk that most developers throw up onto the Internet when they get an old license- this is the remastered, restored edition, presented with the care and attention that all developers should lavish on a game rerelease. It truly is worth a buy even if you've played this as many hours as I have.\n\nUntil then...

One of the defining games of my childhood and well deserving of this re-release.\n\nOriginally released in 1998, this take on Battlezone was itself a re-imagining of the 1980 arcade game. It blended first-person vehicular combat with real-time strategy elements to create a revolutionary hybrid game experience that has only been briefly revisited since, in games such as Sacrifice and Brutal Legend.\n\nIn 1952, as the story goes, a meteor shower in the arctic circle brought a previously unknown organic material to Earth. Simultaneously discovered by scientists of both the US and the Soviet Union, this \"Bio-Metal\" was soon discovered to have the unique ability to remember shapes it had previously assumed. From this material, the superpowers created hovering tanks and weapons centuries ahead of anything they could have otherwise made at the time. They quickly ran out of it, and turned their eyes towards the stars in search of more. In secret, the two nations sent thousand-man armies into space. Thus began a new, hidden chapter of the Cold War- the one too brutal to televise. You will journey to the moon, Mars, Venus and beyond in search of the bio-metal, and the truth of its origins.\n\nYou take the role of a soldier of either the Americans' National Space Defense Force, or NSDF, or the Russians' Cosmo Colonist Army, or CCA. You begin most campaign missions, as well as multiplayer strategy matches, with your own tank and a Recycler- at once your core base structure, your resource depository, and a factory that produces all other essential units. It exists in a mobile or deployed state, able to travel (slowly) about until you find a geyser over which to deploy it, whereupon it becomes able to build. You have two resources: scrap, and pilots. The former are gathered by scavengers, autonomous resource-harvesting vehicles built from the Recycler that will wander the map gathering bio-metal scrap, found lying around in fields on most maps, or generated from destroyed vehicles and structures. Controlling these scrap fields and assigning escorts to your scavengers is crucial in more difficult missions, and in multiplayer.\n\nCombat vehicles include nimble scout craft, light and medium tanks, rocket tanks, bombers, and walkers. Defensive units include mobile turrets and artillery that must deploy to fire, as well as minelayers. Offensive vehicles for the most part are fast, turn quickly and can strafe, allowing you to maintain fire on a target while avoiding return fire, though the bombers do not turn quickly and are more adept at long-range strikes on static structures. Combat is fast and chaotic- focused fire can destroy most vehicles in seconds, and battles can involve upwards of twenty tanks at once- more in the campaign. You should quickly master the ability to group your units using Control plus the Function keys, and commanding them to focus-fire individual enemy targets, lest they haphazardly engage multiple enemies at once and lose the advantage of their numbers. The scouts and turrets are built from your Recycler, while the rest are built from your Unit Factory, a more specialized builder vehicle that is also built from the Recycler. If a vehicle is destroyed, including yours, fear not- the pilot will eject, and have the opportunity to return to their base and be put in a new vehicle. While on foot, you are extremely vulnerable, but not defenseless- you have a low-damage plasma gun, as well as a sniper rifle you can use to snipe out the pilot of an enemy vehicle and steal it for yourself. Be wary of enemy pilots in multiplayer!\n\nYou may also build a Constructor vehicle from your Recycler that can build fixed structures, such as powerful gun towers, repair and resupply structures, and a communications tower that grants you access to an overhead satellite view in the vein of a traditional RTS. It can also build a barracks- the only way to increase your pilot count. Protect your Constructor well- it's often a priority target for AI enemies, and getting a network of gun towers up is crucial for fending off regular enemy raids in the later campaign missions. You will also want to build an Armory, a third mobile base vehicle that builds and launches repair, ammo and weapon pickups, as it is your only means of repairing structures and allows you to resupply in the field, as well as launch bombs on enemy bases.\n\nYou can command your units either by looking directly at them and pressing the space bar or by selecting them using the number keys from a list. Units are organized into offensive, defensive, utility, with an extra section for available navigation beacons, which also function as cameras when selected, to give you remote viewing of that location. Offensive units have the most diverse range of orders- they can be commanded to move to a specific location, attack or defend your current target, follow you, defend a key friendly, or to move to a selected nav beacon, as well as to get repairs or ammunition, or to recycle- refunding a portion of scrap used in their construction, as well as returning their pilots to your global pilot count- this is good, because you have a finite cap of 30 pilots per level and they cannot be replaced. This works both ways- target enemy pilots to deny the AI access to replacement units- I think. The computer probably cheats on both scrap and pilots, and they most certainly can spawn near-infinite waves of harassing attacks on your base. It works in multiplayer though.\n\nAside from the two story campaigns, there are a variety of multiplayer modes, including deathmatch, strategy, and \"MPI\", a form of co-op strategy versus AI. This Redux includes extensive Steam Workshop support- you can download maps on the fly even in-game. It also includes updated models and visual effects, trading cards, achievements, and other niceties- aside from running very smoothly on modern systems, more so then it ever did in the old days. However, it is a essentially a straight re-release, and does not attempt to address any of the game's existing shortcomings- save the netcode, of course.\n\nYou are limited, for example, to only ten units of each type, since that's as far as the number keys go, as well as the hard pilot cap of 30. The AI is single-minded at best and suicidal at worst, with frequent issues with pathfinding, often getting stuck trying to scale inclines the player would have no trouble at all with. Scavengers are completely incapable of not only defending themselves but even of reacting to being attacked, and will continue on their merry way scavenging in the face of certain destruction. Artillery units will fire at will regardless of the risk of hitting your own forces and cannot be set to hold their fire. Your offensive units also require careful management ot get the most out of their attacks. The walkers are also so painfully slow that their use in most campaign missions is extremely limited- its entirely possible to finish CCA Mission 6, for example, without the use of the three Golems you are given. Most campaign missions also have only one or two safe methods of completion, with very little room for experimental tactics.\n\nHowever, most of these flaws are attributable to the limitations of the original game engine, and and while they are even more glaringly obvious all these years later, there is something to be said for bringing the game to Steam and a new audience as is, the way we enjoyed it 18 years ago, and it is certainly easier to forgive then a brand new game with these same flaws. Battlezone was something completely new and any problems it had were excusable in the face of how much fun I had with it, and it was a great pleasure to revisit this landmark title in both my young life and the history of PC gaming. I urge newcomers and old hands, shooter and strategy fans alike to pick this one up.

The game was years ahead of its time. Unfortunately they don't make games like this nowadays. It's a pity since with todays technology and graphics, this would be an instant hit. \n\nThe campaign(s) are well written and fully voiced. You play a commander of either the US or Soviet forces in a war for resources in our solar system, mostly on the various moons of our planets. But it is not just your standard conflict of US vs Soviet, there will be a surprise in the campaign...nuff said. :) \n\nThe UI is innovative and context sensitive, which is also absolutely a must for a tactical and strategic game like this, given the orders you have to provide on the fly. Even after so many years developers still can't get UI right and given the complexity of BattleZone, it is a refreshing surprise that a 18 year old game nails it spot on.   \n\nIf you think that the price is too high for such an old game, let me tell you it is totally worth it. This overhaul comes with completly new models of vehicles, buidlings, surfaces and sky-boxes. It is not just a fake \"HD overhaul\".

Not only can the player build and direct units in battle, but they can participate directly in those battles themselves.\n\nI remember playing Battlezone consistently for several years, until I got my hands on Battlezone II: Combat Commander. My grades suffered because of this obsession. To see that it had been remastered was exciting. At only 15 dollars (20% off sale), it was an easy impulse purchase.\n\nRebellion has done a swell job of remastering this game. The gameplay is essentially the same as it was in 1998 (apart from bug fixes). Everything just feels right. With the substantial graphical overhaul, the style of the game has been neatly retained. There is no dissonance between my nostalgic memories of the original and the improved fidelity of this remaster.\n\nThe story is an incredibly captivating Cold War era sci-fi alternate history. The Americans and the Soviets battle across the solar system in a race to gather \"bio-metal\" and to discover its mysterious origin. There are two campaigns; one from the American perspective, and the other from the Soviet perspective. \n\nRebellion has also bolstered the mod support of the game with Steam Workshop integration and mod tools. Mods from the original can also be ported into the remaster.

That they do not make games like this anymore.  I will try now to stay away from my 18 years long nostalgia and do an accurate review.\n\nBattlezone is a mix between RTS and FPS/Simulation, as you will probably know. The gameplay mechanics are very well integrated into this concept: While piloting your hovertank through several solar system worlds, you can control your production ships, combat units, defense, support vessels.... Anything simply with your numbers, tab and space. It is a system that requires a bit of playing to learn but, once you do, it becomes really intuitive. \n\nFrom an strategy point of view, you have a very limited number of units in play. That is, 10 offense, 10 defense, 10 support. With those, you must overplay your opponents to actually win the game. If you combine that with limited resources (in the form of biometal) and ships that, when destroyed, become a little ammount of biometal, you have the key for very dinamic multiplayer games. A failed attack against the enemy base may mean that your enemy will get extra resoureces, while you will loose yours. Tough decission, right?\n\nThe simulation and FPS system is a combination of your piloting skills, the tank you have and how you outfit it, specially in the latest game. The best definition of it is \"ground based dogfight\": To pilot a hovertank that flies at about 3 feet from the ground, jumping over the obstacles and maybe flying over your enemy to rain death on him... That's majestic. Of course many players will feel confused with the handling, as this game represent very well the \"hovering\" mechanics... but that's part of the fun. A direct hit may send your tank flying away, and you may need a moment to retake control of it. \n\nAbout the rework: I love it... but the nostalgic kid inside of me tell me \"that's not my game!\". I really like how it looks: the new models, explosions, particle and light effects... It is really a HUGE improvement, profiting the potential that average computers nowadays can offer. But old players as I may find it... strange. The feeling is the same than when you watch your favourite movie dubbed in a different language. It may be very good but... it's not the same. \n\nAnd about the campaigns:\n\nThe campaign story is amazing.  New players may find it linear (yes, it is) and a bit topical for the first 2 or 3 missions. All this changes when you find, in Mars, an alien relic... that relates directly to an ancient human civilisation. And I will not spoil anything there, but if you like mithology as I do... You will be mind-blowed. Specially when the real enemy shows up in the end!\n\nMy recommendation for new players: Give battlezone redux a try. The mix of RTS and FPS may feel strange at first, but when you get a handle on it you will be amazed of the epicness it can handle! Deploy your recycler and get those scavengers! Get the biometal while defending them with a few scouts! Get your defenses, but move closer to a new biometal deposit! Get your army, and lead them into battle, charge against the enemy while the bomber's missiles fly just over your head! And find out no pilot, not even you, is good enough to win every battle alone!\n\nBattlezone is a relic, one that has not been repeated since its sequel \"BZ2 battle commander\"... so try it.

Remastering this timeless classic is one of the greatest revitalizations I've come across.\n\nThe game offers a unique environment where standardized FPS elements are challenged and redefined. I am a huge fan of ammo shared between all of your weapons. Combined with the mobile, dynamic RTS that forces you to make decisions based on the type of terrain you're in and what the enemy is building, just like any RTS. However, the only thing I find lacking in the entire game is the RTS itself as I personally find it quite simplified, but in exchange for the complexity of strategy there is a first-person combat experience to steal the focus from.\n\nAs a modder for the original game from 1998, I am enthusiastic about the capabilities the Redux has, especially Steam Workshop support. The unified and proven system Workshop offers will give my creations more exposure than ever before, something I look forward to and intend to make the best of.\n\nThe game has survived eighteen years of existence. Some said Battlezone was \"the best game you've never played\". With the Redux, that will change. Battlezone is better than ever before, and it is destined to bring both old and new players back to the front lines.\n\n- blue banana", "timestamp_created": 1461036921, "timestamp_updated": 1461036921, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 53, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.763882", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22509700": {"recommendationid": "22509700", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978361096", "num_games_owned": 170, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 481, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512447090}, "language": "english", "review": "Classic game.

Gathering scrap is important.\n\nThe gameplay has been left completely untouched, so those who have played Battlezone 1.5 will fit right in. However, with respect to the last official patch, which was 1.4, expect a completely new experience. For one, the Tank AI no longer retreats when shot, it actually fights properly. The infamous bugs from back in the day are no more! The MDM is now safe to use in multiplayer, The East-West bug is fixed, and having a framerate over 60 FPS no longer makes the game run faster. Battlezone is finally up to modern standards as of v1.5 and Battlezone 98 Redux!

After about 2-3 hours, I'm not so sure. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's bad, as far as a remaster goes, this is how it should be done... mod support, working multiplayer, ability to download new maps for instant action, graphical enhancements etc... this is a damn good remaster. I think my problem is truly just expectations. As someone who has heard about how amazing this game is and how it's pretty much the best action-strategy game to be released, all I can do is compare it to Uprising: Join or Die and how different philosophies they both are. \n\nBattlezone is slower, controls are floaty (because low gravity and hover tanks), units can be controlled directly and vehicles are all interchangeable with the player. You've also got 2 resources, scrap (metals) and pilots (nonrenewable). Scrap is gathered by scavengers from deposits all over the map and blowing up enemy units (or your own) creates scrap that can be scavenged and reused. Pilots are a nonrenewable resource, you need one for every unit you build. If the unit blows up, the pilot is ejected but he can also be killed thus losing him for good. If he makes it back to base, then your limit is not affected. It should also be noted that units have multiple weapon types and it doesn't seem like anyone is overly good against anyone else. Seems like numbers win the day in battles (from what I've played so far). This game also punishes you for your stupid teammates and makes you feel like you're just another soldier except you call in units.\n\nUprising: Join or Die on the other hand is more arcadey. It's fast-paced and operates more on a paper rock scissors format. Infantry beats building, Tank beats Infantry, Aircraft beats Bomber and Tanks, Bomber beats building, Building good against everything etc etc. It's more simplistic. Units cannot be directly controlled, they are called in and proceed to battle against any enemy within the area but after the battle can be recalled to gain back resources. Your tank is also your ultimate weapon, it can be upgraded with better weaponry and by the end of the game you'll be blasting away foes with about 12 different weapon types.  Your tank can also divert power to 3 areas, shields, weaponry or speed... making you take more damage, deal more damage or zip around the battlefield at ridiculous speeds. Buildings are called in on pads rather than you essentially placing them whether you want (except for turrets). It should also be mentioned that Uprising is brutally hard, but not because your allies are retarded... rather you made a mistake and they capitalized on it. I could go on but I believe my point is clear.\n\nHere we have two different action-strategy games that took the genre and walked opposite ways with it yet still remained true to a couple of different concepts (like having a command tank). \n\nIn summation, Battlezone 98 Redux is good for those who are looking for more of a slower paced, punishing game... Battlezone is your game. If you're looking for a twitch shooter that plays more like The Outfit, then Uprising: Join or Die is your game. I still believe this should be played by anyone who is a fan of action-strategy games!", "timestamp_created": 1461004989, "timestamp_updated": 1461004998, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558336", "comment_count": "9", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22503199": {"recommendationid": "22503199", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994171521", "num_games_owned": 312, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1708, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502176150}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely wonderful!

The new lighting and particle effects, as well as high-poly models and hi-res retextures bring the magic back to the current generation.\n\nAfter the first samples of a mysterious material known as 'bio-metal' fell to Earth in 1952, the two major superpowers facing off in the cold war - the USA and the USSR - utilised it to construct amazing new prototype vehicles and weaponry. Ever seeking greater sources of power, this whole new world of technology spawned from the stars spurred on humanity's thirst for the untapped resources of deep space...\n\nOne of the early [and sorely missed] action-strategy hybrid titles, Battlezone's first campaign casts you into a conspiratorial wing of the United States military - the National Space Defence Force (NSDF) - which is expanding out into the solar system during the cold war. The USA has used the smokescreen of the highly publicised Space Race to deploy a division of their military forces on the moon. What is this strange, otherworldly bio-metal scrap? Can such a malleable and strong substance really form naturally? All that truly matters at the outset is keeping it out of Russki hands at all costs...\n\nIn the second campaign, you play from the perspective of a Russian cosmonaut on the other side of the conflict. The differing design philosophies of the two factions is striking. The Soviet Cosmos Colonist Army (CCA) favours brutal head-on attacks and overwhelming numbers. Beginning with much the same immediate goals in mind as the USA (though initially more intrepid and bold in their conquest), the USSR expand rapidly to the Red Planet. Of course, not all is as it seems, and the cosmonauts quickly find themselves wishing they were safely home in the Motherland's bosom, for the cold of space is not inviting, and grander things lurk just out of sight...\n\n--\n\nA great piece of alternate history fiction with excellent gameplay values. You can jump in and out of any given hover-vehicle to wander around on the surface of many planets and moons around Sol. With your trusty sniper rifle, you can whack hostile pilots from a distance and jack their ride, if you so choose. The combat is frenetic and satisfying, driven by the desire for ultimate control over these new resources. Perhaps the most gratifying element of this game is the fluidity of its movement. The jet-thruster-powered movement of most of the vehicles allows for some spectacular handling of rough terrain, cruising along at high speed and ramping off outcroppings of rock, lending the game abundant z-play opportunities. Moving effectively and working as a team is absolutely as crucial as landing hits on target.\n\nIn many missions (as well as the instant-action and multiplayer[!!!]), designing, constructing and managing your base falls to you. The bio-metal is extremely versatile and can be used in conjunction with a Recycler vehicle to construct all manner of buildings, vehicles and bizzare, devastating weaponry, ranging from tanks and mobile turrets to howitzers, rocket platforms and walkers. You will need to protect your scavengers, deploy your battle lines and make offensive strikes on enemy positions, all the while keeping track of the number of pilots you have at your disposal, and that ever-crucial supply of bio-metal scrap. You can manage every unit in your force, every building and utility vehicle under your command, from anywhere on the very sizeable maps using the fairly intuitive command interface.\n\nStrategy and tactics evolve organically lending the gameplay as much or as little head-on action as you please, requiring you to source scrap fields and expand your production line and deny those same resources to your enemy. Your co-pilots are as effective in combat as you are, and you'll need all the help you can get throughout the challenging campaign.\n\nPick this up, it's probably quite unlike anything else you'll play this year, and you won't regret it.", "timestamp_created": 1460998115, "timestamp_updated": 1461026414, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 201, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.868715", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22501093": {"recommendationid": "22501093", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968212484", "num_games_owned": 217, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 1232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474816577}, "language": "english", "review": "A true class has been restored and can now be played by new generations of gamers.

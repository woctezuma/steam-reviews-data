A shame there are lootboxes, but at least they are [i]Purely Cosmetic[/i]\u2122\n\nAlso, while you're here, let me read to you a brief summary of one of my favorite movies - Blade Runner.\n\"In the futuristic year of 2019, Los Angeles has become a dark and depressing metropolis, filled with urban decay. Rick Deckard, an ex-cop, is a \"Blade Runner\". Blade runners are people assigned to assassinate \"replicants\". The replicants are androids that look like real human beings. When four replicants commit a bloody mutiny on the Off World colony, Deckard is called out of retirement to track down the androids. As he tracks the replicants, eliminating them one by one, he soon comes across another replicant, Rachel, who evokes human emotion, despite the fact that she's a replicant herself. As Deckard closes in on the leader of the replicant group, his true hatred toward artificial intelligence makes him question his own identity in this future world, including what's human and what's not human.\"\n-blazesnakes9, IMDB\n\nBlade Runner 2049, the sequel to Blade Runner, was pretty good too. Easily the most beautiful film from Denis Villeneuve, the man who also directed Arrival (2016), Sicario (2015), Enemy (2013), and Prisoners (2013). I thought the performances were good, Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford are definitely the stars of the show. I was originally concerned when I heard Jared Leto was playing the role as the antagonist, and while I would've liked to see him on screen more, he played the role well enough.\n\nAnother film I really like this year is Baby Driver, from Edgar Wright, the man behind Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, The World's End, and the underrated Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, featuring Michael Cera. \"What's the address for Amazon dot ca?\", Scott asked. \"Amazon.ca.\", replied his homosexual roommate, Wallace. Ah, that film is just a classic.\n\nBaby Driver, right, It's a crime film focused around a getaway driver named 'Baby', that's B-A-B-Y. His last name is NOT Driver, as I later found out. Yes, I was disappointed too. Anyway, the whole film is set to the beat of a variety of rock music, and the editing is nothing shy of perfect. This film just oozes style, from the cinematography, to the soundtrack, the fantastic editing, and the performances from Ansel Elgort as Baby, Lily James as the love interest Deborah, Jon Hamm, Jamie Foxx, and Kevin Spacey. Just a great, fun film.\n\nBlade Runner 2049 and Baby Driver are my two favorite films this year.\nAnd 'I Can't Believe It's Not Gambling' is alright, for $1 you really can't go wrong.", "timestamp_created": 1513498333, "timestamp_updated": 1513585620, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.638013", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38369880": {"recommendationid": "38369880", "author": {"steamid": "76561198294397087", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 12, "last_played": 1514540845}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5934\u4e00\u6b21\u5f00\u7bb1\u5b50\u8fd9\u4e48\u723d\u54c8\u54c8", "timestamp_created": 1513495729, "timestamp_updated": 1513495729, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38369634": {"recommendationid": "38369634", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005413139", "num_games_owned": 416, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 153, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513494312}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]We must imagine Sisyphus happy[/h1]\n\nFar better than it should be for its price, this game offers a repetitive mechanic with randomized rewards which are merely cosmetic.

Starting with lootboxes that are actual trash, you work your way up the hierarchy of boxes to obtain better and better in game items, and consequentially better and better boxes of loot. I enjoyed how items looked like low quality jpegs of things that are box-like in nature. These items can be equiped by the player and it is refreshing that any number of items can be equiped and they don't seem to affect gameplay OR aesthetics (unlike so many lootbox simulators where the items obtained drastically affect the aesthetics of the player character!)\n\nOne huge criticism of the game is that lootboxes never contained additional lootboxes. I don't know how companies can still be getting away with this in 2017 - if you're going to sell lootboxes, some of those lootboxes better contain other boxes that contain loot but also have an additional probability of yet more boxes.\n\nAn unusual positive in this lootbox simulator - it contains a small video game for those who aren't in it simply for the thrill of the box or get too tired of winning. The video game resemblies the classic game Snake, except that instead of a snake you are a dolphin and there are also portals in what is clearly a industry insider reference to the cult-classic, lootboxless failure Portal.

Anyhow, it is what it says on the tin: Lootboxes, sans game (and sans cash shop), and a simple minigame that gives far better currency returns than any cash shop game I ever played, modified at each new box-level.\n\nIt's a small thing and once you've played it, you've played it. But for under $1 US, it's a fitting parody of lootbox shenanigans. It's more likely to inspire a sarcastic snort than a laugh, I think, and is definitely more of a \"do it while most of your attention is elsewhere\" game than something I'd play with full attention, but I don't regret the purchase. \n\nThat's partly because every time I see this game in my Steam list, I'll remember why I seldom bother anymore with the sort of games this exists to mock. That's a reminder well worth a dollar to me. But, there appears to have been more effort put into this than into some Steam games that expect to be taken seriously. (The creators of which expect them to be taken seriously. Y'know what I meant.)\n\nThe \"build the game to drive players to the cash store with glitter and cattle prods\" design trend has gotten very old, and deserves the poke in the eye with a shiny, lootbox-skinned stick that this little game gives it. So, thumbs up for that. And all flippancy aside, things like the name of the first tier of lootboxes may be cheap laughs (along with the previously mentioned sarcastic snorts), but I'll take 'em. I can use all the laughs I can get!\n\nP.S. - No actual shiny sticks are to be found in this game at this time.\n\n[Edited because edits, and stuff I decided to unstuff from this post.]", "timestamp_created": 1513419238, "timestamp_updated": 1513422092, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38345950": {"recommendationid": "38345950", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970344814", "num_games_owned": 1964, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 42, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 20, "last_played": 1513612300}, "language": "dutch", "review": "I Can't Believe It's Not Gambling", "timestamp_created": 1513418184, "timestamp_updated": 1513418184, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38345400": {"recommendationid": "38345400", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053678836", "num_games_owned": 300, "num_reviews": 74, "playtime_forever": 190, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 110, "last_played": 1513925715}, "language": "english", "review": "This review will have 2 parts: joke review and serious review\n\nFirst, the joke review (which is a not recommended):\n\nGreat game; it recreates the loot box controversy well.\n\nHOWEVER; I cannot recommend it. Why? Because if this game wants to be a perfect satire, it has to cost $60. If it isn't $60 and has exploitative lootboxes it is meaningless.\n11/10 GOTY IGN\n\n\n\n\nAnd now my actual thoughts:\nI Can't Believe It's Not Gambling (ICBING) is a satirical game about lootboxes in videogames and how ridiculous the increase of monetization of customers has been. The goal is to open lootboxes with a fake currency and collecting skins for your lootboxes. To earn more cash you have to play a snake clone called Not BF2 where you play as a whale collecting lootboxes (looks like it's pisstaking actual designs, I recognise the Overwatch one). Earning coins is easy enough with this minigame but when you're done you get to open more lootboxes. Which after a while becomes addictive. You open box after box, celebrate when you see a legendary colour dropping only to be disappointed when you get another damn repeat. Selling the skins makes up for a bit of the cost, but of course if you get common after common you'll have to resort to Not BF2 to earn more.\n\nMy main complaint is that the devs could have done a bit more with earning coins. To be a bit more realistic playing it could give next to nothing unless you grind like mad, and you could \"pay\" for more coins. A simple buy currency button that guilt trips you whenever you click it. Something like that. (and by a button I mean clicking it gives you coins without a enter card number interface at all)\n\nHowever the best part about ICBING is that it might POSSIBLY be an exit drug should someone with a real gambling addiction gets into lootboxes.

None of that! The game cuts RIGHT to the chase on what you are really playing BF 2 for: a sense of Pride and Accomplishment(tm). Within minutes you will feel like you are really a massive whale spending your entire life savings on just one more roll... JUST ONE MORE! The only thing that'd make you feel less of a whale is the fact the Japanese Nissin Maru whaling ship isn't around to harpoon your ass!\n\nWithout a doubt this is the most stellar game EA has ever produced. Definitely a new standard set for AAA releases on the Games-As-A-Scam business model. My only disappointment is there is no physical Collector's Edition (now with Actual Garbage(tm)) and Triple Season Pass owners still have to pay $60 a month to play online... But that's fine with how awesomely mindblowing this game is. Even if you have better things to spend your money on... like food, and rent... ignore that shit! Spend that money here and preserve that feeling of pride and accomplishment! \n\n\"TOTALLY WORTH IT!\" I will hear you say to the homeless guy next to you in a month! And it will be!\n\nBuy this game today! With its current mindblowing value due to the incredible 1% off sale, you are truly getting your pride and accomplishment on a true discount! \n\nPlease note, game contains mature content.

DLC Quest made a fun, but ultimately forgettable, game where buying things needed for progression was purchased in-game as joke DLC. The main problem was, that there was actually a competant game under the hood of DLC Quest. I Can't Believe It's Not Gambling isn't even really a game, despite it having an awful snake clone to get the in-game currency, and that's what makes it so good.\n\nIt took me over 100 boxes just to get all 37 items in first box category. It didn't sugar coat it and give a raising chance to get the missing items, it showed just how blantant of a rip-off these sorts of lootboxes are. That, to me, makes it an excellent parody of this system. It isn't fun, it isn't rewarding, and, much to the chagrin of EA, it doesn't give a sense of \"Pride and Accomplishment\" opening all of these boxes. What it is, is tedious. That's why despite liking what I Can't Believe It's Not Gambling does I don't actually recommend anyone buy it.", "timestamp_created": 1513267042, "timestamp_updated": 1513361891, "voted_up": true,

rating as it shouldn't be treated as such. The game is 'bad', yet hilarious (well, not quite, but you get the idea).\n\n[h1]Short Review:[/h1]\nThis game is NOT a \"game\". It's a protest against AAA games and their companies, much like what DLC Quest was. Except, you will not enjoy the actual \"Game\" that is offered; you will instead be continuously opening loot boxes. And for what? A sense of \"Pride and Accomplishment\"? There is no reason this game is 'good' other than that it's pure genius at poking fun at recent AAA releases. Very well done, MES.\n\n[h1]Long Review:[/h1]\nThis game is a satirical parody of AAA games and their methods (in this case, the new \"loot box\" craze) to try and squeeze more money out of player's pockets. The execution of this game is perfect; you WILL spend more time opening boxes than playing the \"Game\". The \"Game\" itself is garbage. You'll play the first level maybe 10 times and by the end stages you're only playing the next tier once just to see what's changed. The only reason to 'play' is so you can open the next tier of loot boxes, so you can then try and get lucky, and then get more coins so you can open the next tier. That's it. That's all this game is. It represents how evermore, games are integrating excuses to gamble, to the point where the gambling aspect is of a higher quality than the game itself. Once again, bravo MES. This game is parody gold.\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n - Runs on anything, probably even your phone (oooh, how about an iOS or Android port?)\n - The level of your account is equal to the amount of loot boxes you have opened and is irrespective of the \"Game\" itself; a very clever \"screw you\" to the future of gaming.\n - Less than a dollar for a couple of giggles, as well as a powerful and daunting insight into the future of the video game industry.\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n - Less than an hour of playtime to reach the final \"stage\".\n\n[h1]Suggestions:[/h1]\n - Add the option for multiple save games, as well as a difficulty setting, which allows the following tiers:\n   - \"Owner\" - Easy\n   - \"Sponsored\" - Medium\n   - \"Lucky\" - Hard\n   - \"Realistic\" - Very Hard\n  - The only difference between all of these difficulties is the chance of the rarity of items dropping.", "timestamp_created": 1513228051, "timestamp_updated": 1513228234, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 36, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.695362", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38294653": {"recommendationid": "38294653", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042791478", "num_games_owned": 160, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 16, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513234082}, "language": "english", "review": "I felt a sense of pride and accomplishment across this rollercoaster of a game.

For example, DLC Quest remains one of my favourite indie games of all times, despite its shortness. Same as this one tackling lootboxes, DLC Quest tackles DLC, and does it hilariously.\nBut this game, well... Sure, it's funny at first, but the execution is lacking. Open a box, sell your stuff, buy another box, sell more stuff, and so on... There is barely any humor or anything that could make it worth the 20 minutes I spent on it.\nIt could be a good meme, or a free game, but it's a badly polished, hollow shell that pretends to be a game.

There's no actual entry of credit card information as far as I can find, but it's definitely a very blunt parody. It definitely knows what it's looking at though, because it has all those bells and whistles that P2W games use on their lootboxes to keep you going.\n\nThat said: it's a dollar. You get what you pay for. Pay a dollar for a game, get a dollar worth of entertainment. Is the game anything special? Not really: but it does what it promises, it offers a quick laugh, and really it makes a decent gift: because honestly, my friend passed it to me without even saying a word about what it really was, and so when I opened it on up, I had little idea what to expect beyond the title and description. I gave it a shot, got a good laugh.\n\nDon't expect a high replayability or a particularly exhilarating time. The devs are making active updates from what I've seen, so that's nice, and it's got achievements (though no cards as of yet).\n\nIn summation: it's a dollar, on release. It gives you exactly what a dollar game should. Nothing more, nothing less. Buy it for a friend as a joke, or if you're pretty wealthy just to say you did. If you're looking for an exciting game with replayability and hours of content: then save your dollars you're spending on dollar games for something more valuable.

"Surprisingly addictive and fun.  NOTE: You don't actually spend any real-life money in-game.  \n\nThe game is a satirical parody on the entire \"loot box\" culture that has pervaded our gaming culture in recent years.  The actual game is just opening loot boxes of varying tiers.  You start out with \"actual trash\" and work your way up the ladder to \"Cardboard,\" \"Presents,\" and so on.  Each loot box class has multiple \"skins\" and \"hats\" (of variying rarity: common, uncommon, rare, epic, and legendary) to alter the appearance of your boxes.  You obtain these cosmetics by opening the boxes with your in-game currency.  The goal is to collect all the hats and skins for each class of loot box. \n\nYou obtain this in game currency by selling your duplicate items and by playing \"Not BF 2\" (a centipede clone within the game).  As you obtain more currency you unlock the higher tiers of loot boxes which in turn unlock harder levels of Not BF 2 which give you more currency per play. \n\nAll in all, it's pretty simple. Overall I give it a 9/10.  Love the humor behind the project motivation and execution is done well.

Every so often, the letters P-R-I-D-E appear on screen and collecting all five of them earns several loot boxes on the screen to collect. Like with a game of snake, you lose if/when you hit a wall or your own tail.

[/h1]\n\nInformally, it's art. I believe, having played the game and unlocked all but a single achievement, that this game is artwork. In the same way that a novel or painting can be subversive, so too can a game. For those people looking for examples of artwork that only works within the video game medium, this is it.\n\nBut that's not what the game is about, or what you'll be doing. The game is a \"loot box\" simulator. Click a box, open it up and more boxes come out (or skins and hats). You'll take those crates, sell them for more crates. The game is designed to highlight an issue with modern gaming: the fact that many games these days feature a randomized system that encourages users to spend money. \n\nIn addition to the crates, you'll need money. The game shows a sliding scale of more and more valuable crates and while you could gamble your way upwards (and I did, to see if it worked), you also can play a clone of Snake. Instead of eating apples, your whale will collect Overwatch and Battlefront II style lootboxes, as well as the letters in the word \"Pride\".\n\n\n[h1] So how does it run? [/h1]\n\nThe game runs fine, even on moderate hardware. The graphics aren't anything to call home about, but they're varied enough with many skins over the boxes that it doesn't look too reptitive. Texture and sound quality are about what you'd expect from a game that costs a dollar.\n\nSomething I did appreciate, each crate that was opened was accompanied by a sound effect that varies by rarity. Getting an epic or legendary item comes with the sound of Whale calls and lesser boxes come with the sound of laughter. \n\n\n[h1] What about extras? [/h1]\n\nBecause the game doesn't feature Steam Cards, I feel that it maintains a sense of art. If the game had cards and a smaller variety of textures, I'd argue the game is trying to be greedy. The game does feature achievements, all which are something which requires effort to do, but are low enough effort a single play through should nab most of them.\n\n\n[h1] Sense of Pride and Accomplishment [/h1]\n\nThe biggest takeaway, I felt, was that the Snake game and the minor amount of entertainment the game provided was well worth 1 dollar. If you're looking for a bit of \"video game as artwork\", the game has a message that you already likely know. Much like DLC Quest, the game isn't supposed to be taken seriously for very long. \n\nOn the other hand, if you'd rather put that dollar towards an actual game, I wouldn't blame you. There isn't much to see here once you've seen it.", "timestamp_created": 1513103310, "timestamp_updated": 1513103310, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

This is one of those games. [/h1]  \n\n   With ICBING, there are no gimmicks, no bamboozles. No pre-order bonuses, no DLC, no map packs, nothing. Just a rich gaming experience. The moment you start the game you get right to it. You are greeted by your first challenge. The trashcan. All alone in a stunningly generated room with next gen graphics. From here the game changing design intuitively kicks in as you are greeted with a button. \"Open Loot Box\" After a few moments of taking in the beautifully generated trash can, I decide to take the plunge... I press the button. Upon the pressing of the button, the trashcan draws in closer and shakes... again... and once more as it erupts like a geyser. Emerging from this amazingly lifelike trash can is what can only be described as gifts from our one and only. Gaben. My rewards for embarking on the journey of clicking the button. To my amazement, it is equally beautifully generated additions for my trashcan. Different trash bags, trashcan lids, thrown out Trump protest signs. I can truly express my individuality through my very own unique and custom trashcan.  \n\n   But there is a cost. A challenge. This experience of unending satisfaction, suspense, and joy is not free. There is an in-game currency system. Your first couple of loot boxes are on the house. After that, well... you're on the streets, kid. BUT WAIT! Worry not you, adventurous trashcan. This can easily be remedied. What if I told you that you don't even need a credit card? Or even your mother's credit card? What if I told you that you can earn more credits to continue this magnificent gaming experience by simply playing a game.... WITHIN this game? I know. Good thing I was sitting down because I was also astonished beyond belief. With one press of a button you are transported to an entirely new sector of the game. What sits in front of you is a whale. That's you. That gorgeous free creature is you. What is your goal you, trashcan and whale beast of a hybrid you ask? Your job is to consume all other opposing, interfering, ill-advised forms of microtransactions and in game currencies and assert your dominance. You can single handedly save the war on microtransactions by consuming them all. Again, there is a catch. Your fallen currency and micro-transaction foes follow you as you are now their lord and savior. They are your followers, and you are their leader. If you run into one of your followers, the ideals of your other followers collide and cause an implosion so vast that you as a whale simply cease to exist... and you have to start your journey to save the gaming community from microtransaction once again. Fear not for there is a light at the end of the tunnel. You win even when you lose. You are payed for your previous trials and endeavors as a graceful uniting whale. With that currency you just gained you can go back to the riveting experience of opening more loot boxes.  \n\n   You might be thinking \"All this for a trashcan?\" Of course not, young Padawan! Once you master the trashcan, once you have seen all that is to be seen, collected all that is to be collected within this trashcan... more awaits. After you have triumphed over the trashcan, after you have made that trashcan a shining, gleaming, radiating representation of yourself, your next challenge is to master the Cardboard Box. I will say no more of the challenges that lay ahead of you. That is for you to discover on your own. \n\n   All this can be yours for a single dollar. One dollar is all it takes to unlock a world full of adventure and experiences that are all your own. You even have the ability to prestige and relive this phenomenal experience all over again. Compete in online leaderboards to have the bragging rights of the century. All for a single dollar. In today's day in age, you can't get much for a dollar.

It was an extremely costly defeat for German forces, and the Army High Command had to withdraw vast military forces from the West to replace their losses.\n\nThe German offensive to capture Stalingrad began in August 1942, using the 6th Army and elements of the 4th Panzer Army. The attack was supported by intensive Luftwaffe bombing that reduced much of the city to rubble. The fighting degenerated into house-to-house fighting; both sides poured reinforcements into the city. By mid-November 1942, the Germans had pushed the Soviet defenders back at great cost into narrow zones along the west bank of the Volga River.\n\nOn 19 November 1942, the Red Army launched Operation Uranus, a two-pronged attack targeting the weaker Romanian and Hungarian armies protecting the German 6th Army's flanks. The Axis forces on the flanks were overrun and the 6th Army was cut off and surrounded in the Stalingrad area. Adolf Hitler ordered that the army stay in Stalingrad and make no attempt to break out; instead, attempts were made to supply the army by air and to break the encirclement from the outside. Heavy fighting continued for another two months. By the beginning of February 1943, the Axis forces in Stalingrad had exhausted their ammunition and food. The remaining units of the 6th Army surrendered. The battle lasted five months, one week and three days.", "timestamp_created": 1515726212, "timestamp_updated": 1515726212, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545137", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39271201": {"recommendationid": "39271201", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156818600", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 9670, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6417, "last_played": 1515716737}, "language": "schinese", "review": "161 hours_100000 boxs, FA\u2642Q", "timestamp_created": 1515725776, "timestamp_updated": 1515725776, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39262208": {"recommendationid": "39262208", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013024197", "num_games_owned": 337, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 60, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513982111}, "language": "english", "review": "I can't believe it's not gambling.", "timestamp_created": 1515695168, "timestamp_updated": 1515695168, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504132", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39244843": {"recommendationid": "39244843", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041373046", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 72, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 72, "last_played": 1515698903}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a great game it even gives u the feeling overtime that CS:go crates addiciton gives. the evolving mini game is also very very fun to play and it keeps changing, just some more music and sounds would be nice ^^", "timestamp_created": 1515633337, "timestamp_updated": 1515633337, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39238626": {"recommendationid": "39238626", "author": {"steamid": "76561198262824952", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 267, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 267, "last_played": 1515623574}, "language": "english", "review": "Liking the game so far, opening 100,000 loot boxes will be kinda hard to get.", "timestamp_created": 1515611851, "timestamp_updated": 1515611851, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39233819": {"recommendationid": "39233819", "author": {"steamid": "76561198258283872", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 1576, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1080, "last_played": 1515917357}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u96be\u5f97\uff0c\u96be\u5f97\uff0c\u554a~\n\n\u5728\u5546\u5e97\u91cc\u627e\u5230\u8fd9\u4e48\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u7bb1\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u554a\uff0c\u5f00\u7bb1\u5f00\u7684\u6211\u597d\u723d\u554a\uff01\u7279\u522b\u8fc7\u763e\uff01\u7279\u522b\u7684\u723d\uff01\n\n1660\u6b21\u7684\u5f00\u7bb1\u5f00\u51fa\u6765\u7684\u672c\u4f53\u548c\u88c5\u9970\u54c1\u5168\u6536\u96c6\u4e86\uff0c\u6df1\u6df1\u7684\u611f\u89c9\u5230\u4e86\u975e\u6d32\u7684\u7231~\n\n\u6210\u5c31\u8fd8\u67092\u4e2a\u5c31\u5b8c\u6210\u4e86\uff01\uff08\u54ce\u5440\uff0c\u6211\u771f\u662f\u809d\u7684\u8981\u6b7b\uff09\n\n\u4e89\u53d6\u5168\u6210\u5c31\u5427\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1515598552, "timestamp_updated": 1515598552, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39142901": {"recommendationid": "39142901", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009136562", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 83, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 83, "last_played": 1515307699}, "language": "schinese", "review": "emmm 200\u7ea7\u901a\u5173 \u6ca1\u4ec0\u4e48\u4e86", "timestamp_created": 1515307732, "timestamp_updated": 1515307732, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39140376": {"recommendationid": "39140376", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042644077", "num_games_owned": 620, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1251, "last_played": 1515346894}, "language": "english", "review": "1638.

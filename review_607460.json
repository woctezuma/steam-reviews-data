The player is made to witness this horrific incident for a solid 20 hours, until suddenly the bunker he was living in was air-raided. Snail miraculously survives this carpet bombing, and flees Japan on a makeshift raft made from nearby palm trees. Snail manages to flee Japan into Australia, where he meets up with the aliens from the film series \"Pokemon\", fighting aliens such as Pikachu, Arceus and Jigglypuff, before dying and respawning at the starting town, USA. This is where the games starts. The original soundtrack was what really brought the game to life, conveying the game's highs and lows, composed by the collaboration of legends Nobuo Uematsu (the composer for Final Fantasy) and Koji Kondo (the composer for Legend of Zelda). The visuals also elevates the game to new heights, and you can really tell with its realistic geometry and textures, with painstaking amounts of detail that really makes you think \"this is definitely better than Uncharted 4\".

While most tank games would have you trekking through large gritty battlefields, Epic Snails brings you back to your childhood days of playing in the back yard with either your friends or some toys. Most of all this game brought me back to the early days of Club Penguin, chatting with my friends and playing fun minigames. Which comes to no surprise since... well, Rocketsnail made this game afterall! \n\nThe main gimmick of the game is that, much like a snail, you can climb literally any surface you want. This introduces some unique senarios where, unlike traditional tank games, you or the opposing team can have a significant height advantage.\nThere are currently only a few weapons to choose from, and it seems like the basic cannon is the best of them by a large margin. That doesn't mean the other two aren't fun to use, you should simply pick the one that fits your playstyle.\n\nThe game is in very much in its early stages, and there's a lot to be improved. The controls can be finicky at times and the camera can do all sorts of crazy stuff. At the time of this review there's currently only one map (with a winter one on the way) and a small selection of hats. Overall I feel Epic Snails has a lot of potential. In the future we'll see new weapons, maps, and customizables for our snails that will further bring the game to life.\n\nIf you were/are a fan of Club Penguin, I highly reccomend giving this game a go, and be sure to give the team feedback so this game can reach is fullest potential!", "timestamp_created": 1512533617, "timestamp_updated": 1512533890, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38094001": {"recommendationid": "38094001", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989177019", "num_games_owned": 855, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 145, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512528834}, "language": "english", "review": "Great concept and gameplay!

Das Genre entspricht dem Spielmodi von TF2 oder CS, aber hier kann man wirklich \u00fcberall sich hinbewegen, sogar auf dem Kopf. xD Ein Spiel f\u00fcr zwischendurch als Abwechslung ;-)\nAuch die cartoonische Grafik ist sehr gelungen :D Man kann M\u00fcnzen verdienen, um Gegenst\u00e4nde zu kaufen.

Epic Snails has been created by Rocketsnail. [i](Previous owner of such games as Club Penguin) [/i] It is set in a garden theme where you have 2 teams that shoot eachother with guns attached to their shells. You will earn coins to buy hats to wear in and out of battle.\n\n\nNow, for this review I am going to split this into six parts, they will be:\n[u]Gameplay[/u]\n[u]Lobby Life[/u]\n[u]Community[/u]\n[u]Personalisation[/u]\n[u]Settings[/u]\n[u]Staff[/u]\n\n\n[h1] Let's begin... [/h1]\n\n[b] Gameplay [/b]\nIn this review we are gonna start straight off the bat with gameplay. In this game the gameplay is amazing, I love the way it is set up and how I am coming back for more. The way they make it oddly satisfying to use the homing missiles from a distance is what I love. They have 3 guns to choose from to fit your desire, to add on to this you can buy hats to wear during battle and in the lobby - which I'll come to soon.\n\n[b] Lobby Life [/b]\nIn between matches you hang out in the well designed lobby; I really don't know how they do it but the map is so well designed the lobby takes hours to have enough of. There is so much to see and find if you look closely. You can try bug finding and you'd be suprised how hard it is to let it go stale.\n\n[b] Community [/b]\nNow a big part of a multiplayer or singleplayer game these days is the community - a potentially un-welcoming community can completely change the way new comers see the game. The majority of the players in this game are not rude or anything and they talk with you and start a game, this is from my experience but they will nearly always be happy to play a game!\n\n[b] Personalisation [/b]\nAt this time personalisation is what Epic Snails lacks. They used to have 3 guns, multiple hats and 4 tombstones. As of a recent update they changed this, removing the tombstone feature and adding 2 more hats in the shop. In this game customised snails would be a great idea due to how simple your snail is and how easy it is to copy it.\n\n[b] Settings [/b]\nIn Epic Snails the options contain all you need. Sensetivity controls, 3 sounds controls, screen resolution and fullscreen on/off, 6 quality settings + a custom and a recently added setting, the option to change the control keys. Epic Snails has what you need for a game that can deliver this much enjoyment. \n\n[b] Staff [/b]\nNow this is where the staff team comes in. From my experience the staff team are amazing people. They will fix found bugs in the next patch OR - as shown before - if it's a bad glitch they pump out an emergency fix. The owner Rocketsnail is a great guy, he listens to the community and what they want. The staff team arrange events with timing and all after all this, I don't really think there is much more that I can ask for.\n\n[b] [u] Summary [/u] [/b]\nI think Epic Snails is an amazing game, I have listed all there is from this. This game kis an amazing product from all of the developers experience. It is almost perfectly put together, when the game works it is fantastic. Overall I can't get enough of it! I'm usually always online - my username is \"fishypeter\" - unless it is school hours or late at night (in gmt). The youtube community is growing bigger, from YouTube and Discord I can see many people waiting for the game to be released. Epic Snails is amongst the best games I have ever played, so much fun comes in a neat little package; I can't wait to see it in it's true glory. I don't think I can give it a proper rating while it is in closed beta but until Open Beta - here is my rating.\n\n[i] I rate Epic Snails a... [/i]\n[h1] 9.8 [/h1]\n\n[i] This review was written on 18/11/17 at 10:50AM UTC exactly, at the time of this review Epic Snails was in Closed Alpha v0.9.9.1. The game wasn't out for public so reviews could not be posted. It has now been posted on the day of release (5th December 15:56) An edit may occur but not very likely. If you would like to play Epic Snails at this time of closed beta, DM @rocketsnail on Twitter and if he is kind enough (which I bet you he is) he will give you a Beta Key. Thank you for the amazing game. -Fishypeter [/i] (@fishypeter17 / fishypeter#5336)\n", "timestamp_created": 1512489410, "timestamp_updated": 1512489410, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502447", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38082479": {"recommendationid": "38082479", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046458172", "num_games_owned": 238, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 323, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 61, "last_played": 1514721659}, "language": "german", "review": "das Game ist sehr gut =) . \nder anfang war schon sehr gut . \nes hat sooo viel noch .\nich hoffe die mache weiter :D\n\n/////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nthe game is very good =). \nThe beginning was already very good.\n it has sooo much more. \nI hope it continues: D", "timestamp_created": 1512488966, "timestamp_updated": 1512609080, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38082367": {"recommendationid": "38082367", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116879965", "num_games_owned": 411, "num_reviews": 970, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512488664}, "language": "russian", "review": "Epic Snails\n10 \u0438\u0437 10", "timestamp_created": 1512488675, "timestamp_updated": 1512488675, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532520", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38082256": {"recommendationid": "38082256", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125595530", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 20, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512488265}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game.\naka, the roof camping simulator.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1512488422, "timestamp_updated": 1512488422, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38081400": {"recommendationid": "38081400", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972289764", "num_games_owned": 1890, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512486167}, "language": "english", "review": "Snails join the IRA.", "timestamp_created": 1512486253, "timestamp_updated": 1512486253, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526554", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38081161": {"recommendationid": "38081161", "author": {"steamid": "76561198175102311", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 14, "last_played": 1514783895}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome game, really funny as well.\n10/10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIRST REVIEW :D", "timestamp_created": 1512485639, "timestamp_updated": 1512486208, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}}}

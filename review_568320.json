I have played many piccross games before, so I was quite excited with it's release! The gameplay is pretty simple to follow, so those of you new to piccross games will have no issues. The puzzles themselves are very well thought out. I enjoyed playing all of them, especially the secret bonus levels that you can unlock at the end (if you figure out how.) The gameplay music is rather nice, so it makes gameplay relaxing. I wish there were more tracks available, but if you become bored with it, the option to mute the music is available. \n\nThe best thing I love about this game is the option to create your own puzzles as well as be able to play puzzles other users have created. This literally opens up endless gameplay. I have a great time seeing what other players can create!\n\nThe only thing I would love to see different is bigger puzzles. While 25x25 can be challenging, I really love challenges, so the 25s where not as much of a challenge as I'd hope for.

Not only do you get a plethora of fully colored Picross puzzles by default, it also has workshop support, meaning, essentially, an infinite supply of presumably well-made picross puzzles, all in full color.\n\nAre you still wary of this particular Picross puzzler? Or perhaps you're new to Picross and are wondering what the heck it even is?\n\nWell, addressing the latter part first, Picross is, of course, a type of puzzle game. I find it similar to Sudoku, but completely different and with pictures. Essentially, you have a box with numbers on the outside of it. According to these numbers you fill in squares in the box, attempting to make a picture, hence the name \"Picross\", each square you fill in gives you more hints as to what you need to fill in next, so on. It's one of those \"easy to learn, hard to master\" kinda things, and it's [i]really fun[/i].\n\nNow, for those experienced players or even new players who want to know why they should spend the wallet-destroying seven USD to get this Picross puzzler when there're likely countless free ones that you could choose instead, I'll explain more.\n\nFirst off, did I mention the puzzles are colored? Pretty sure I did, and most of the free Picross games I've seen for computer, or phones too even, tend to, you know, not be colored. I dunno about you, but it just doesn't feel the same to me without being rewarded with a full color pixel art image after completing a rather tricky 25x25 puzzle.\n\nAlso, like I've said, workshop support. I don't even know how many puzzles there are made by the community as of writing this, I do remember there's 76 pages, but I forgot how many puzzles for a page, oops. But I'm assuming its at least 760, that makes sense. Think about that for a minute, 760 puzzles, do you know how much that is? Hint: it's 760. That's a lot, and most of the community made puzzles tend to be between 15x15 to 25x25 too.\n\nNow you might be thinking: \"Natalie, that's pretty dang cool and all, but there's still so many free Picross puzzlers out there that I could just play all of those instead, why should I pay 7 dollars?\" Well, first off, remember that the famous Picross E series is somewhere around 7 dollars per game, and they're considered one of the best Picross puzzlers there are out there, and if you think about it [b]really hard[/b], you'll also remember that they have far less content than Pictopix, due to lack of workshop, since that's literally not a thing on the 3DS, well, at least by default. And these aren't some shoddy puzzles like that one free one on Steam, they're actually good, and difficult at times, perhaps not as hard as some of the more advanced of the E series, but in some cases they do tend to be actually. \n\nThe controls are also [i]good[/i], you've got controller support, proper mouse controls, and keyboard controls, so basically everything you could possibly want pretty much. And it also has stuff like auto-fading numbers and hints as to what columns/rows can be filled, if you're into that, though they're both considered 'hints' or 'cheats' and will deduct from your crown score. Honestly, I see near nothing bad about it.\n\nThat being said, there are some limitations. For instance, there can only be 5-25 puzzles, even in the workshop. Some really massive puzzles would be interesting in my opinion, but still, 5-25 is pretty standard and I wouldn't deduct points from this game for that.\n\nThere's also some things I think could be added that'd make it a bit more interesting or easy to use, for instance, making it so the placed squares while making the puzzle don't have to be white. I mean it's probably just me, but all that white hurts my eyes, can't I get something darker?? Also, I'd love to see stuff like the rather gimicky \"Mega Picross\", but I can see why it's not included.\n\nThe only real downside of this game is that the music does tend to get old, in my opinion. Otherwise, I'd give this Picross Puzzler a solid [b]10/10[/b].\n\nIf you like Picross, or are looking for an interesting new puzzle game, go get Pictopix, what're you waiting for?!", "timestamp_created": 1493748421, "timestamp_updated": 1493748421, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497587", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31449972": {"recommendationid": "31449972", "author": {"steamid": "76561198276571045", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 10441, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511033101}, "language": "english", "review": "Like mentioned a lot before: This game is highly addictive!

Really slick lay-out, simple, relaxing, basically the perfect puzzle game to me. Always came back to that year after year on Newgrounds, wishing the guy would just put out an Armor Picross 3 or a level pack.\n\nThis game scratches that itch for me. It's fun, easy to pick up and the coloured \"pictures\" you get at the end are pretty satisfying.\n\nMy only two complaints I'd have is that the game doesn't tell you when you're wrong; it lets you make mistakes which can sometimes put you 10 minutes further into a puzzle without realizing you have to do it all over again to \"3 crown\" it. My other complaint is that the game doesn't automatically grey out the numbers when you complete a row or column without rendering it unable for you to get 3 crowns. It's really just a QoL improvement to me and not a big issue (more personal preference), so it doesn't really interfere with my enjoyment, but I would like it better that way.\n\nEither way, worth the price, pick it up!", "timestamp_created": 1486757720, "timestamp_updated": 1486757720, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537765", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29805546": {"recommendationid": "29805546", "author": {"steamid": "76561198358824022", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1004, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486761820}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0414\u041e\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043d\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043a\u0430. +", "timestamp_created": 1486659651, "timestamp_updated": 1486659651, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.460880", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29773356": {"recommendationid": "29773356", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974708447", "num_games_owned": 392, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 3244, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 80, "last_played": 1515213312}, "language": "english", "review": "Good fun, simple and challenging", "timestamp_created": 1486520251, "timestamp_updated": 1486520251, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502884", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29770950": {"recommendationid": "29770950", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025205772", "num_games_owned": 216, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 426, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514869165}, "language": "english", "review": "Extremely relaxing game of Picross/Pictogram, plus with Workshop support means custom user puzzles and a near-endless stream of relaxing, fun puzzles.", "timestamp_created": 1486507525, "timestamp_updated": 1486507525, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526426", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29769331": {"recommendationid": "29769331", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139803400", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 469, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 81, "last_played": 1515359049}, "language": "english", "review": "ok time to play a relaxing game, HOW DOES THAT WORK, ITS NOT POSSIBLE I CANT EVEN-oh thats how you do it, wow that was easy\n", "timestamp_created": 1486500899, "timestamp_updated": 1486500899, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520133", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29758832": {"recommendationid": "29758832", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025092810", "num_games_owned": 692, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 711, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486364465}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Pictopix review: Picross Perfect[/h1]\n[i](Originally posted at Shindig.nz. [url=http://www.shindig.nz/gaming/pictopix-review/]Read my full review here[/url].)[/i]\n\nIf you enjoy picross (or nonograms, or whatever other name you may know these pixel-art logic puzzles), Pictopix is a game you need to buy. Until now, Jupiter Corporation \u2013 creators of Mario\u2019s Picross and Picross e, among others \u2013 is the only developer that\u2019s really done this puzzle form justice. Thanks to Thomas Leroy, there\u2019s finally a PC picross game with the same degree of polish and professionalism, and I can\u2019t recommend it highly enough.\n\nAs far as video games go, picross shouldn\u2019t be too difficult to adapt. It\u2019s quite simple on a mechanical level; the challenge is in the design of the puzzles themselves, and plenty of people have been able to rise to that challenge in the numerous printed books and magazines that are around. And yet, Jupiter Corp is one of the only devs that\u2019s really been able to make it work, and with their focus almost exclusively on Nintendo 3DS these days, options for playing their games are limited.\n\nThat\u2019s part of what makes Pictopix such a welcome game: it\u2019s very reminiscent of Picross e in terms of quality, but it\u2019s a PC game with such low system requirements that it should be able to run on just about any machine. Finally, there\u2019s a well-made picross game that\u2019s available to the masses.\n\nAnd it really is a high-quality game. The user interface is slick and minimalist, allowing you to enjoy the puzzle solving with as few distractions as possible. The controls are simple \u2013 left click to fill a square, right click to put a cross (indicating a blank space). Controller and keyboard are supported, too, but I never actually tried them because the mouse controls work so intuitively.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of effort put into making Pictopix as user-friendly and approachable as possible, but all of that would be moot without good puzzles. Luckily, that\u2019s not a problem that this game has \u2013 the puzzle design is impeccable, never relying on guesswork the way so many picross games do. Pictopix has 150 puzzles, ranging from 5\u00d75 to 25\u00d725 in size, and covering all manner of themes and pictures.\n\nIf that\u2019s not enough, there\u2019s also a workshop mode that allows players to create and share their own puzzles. This really is Pictopix\u2019s standout feature: not only does it allow for a potentially endless supply of new puzzles (assuming the community keeps creating), it\u2019s also a great tool for budding puzzle designers to get started. The workshop can check for solvability, which is vital, and also allows you to import PNG files to form the basis of your puzzles.\n\nPictopix is a delightful game that anyone with any interested in picross should buy. Its clean, simple, intuitive UI and control scheme removes all distractions from solving puzzles, and that\u2019s exactly what you want out of a game like this. Top that off with a massive collection of puzzles and a fantastic workshop mode, and you\u2019ve got one of the best picross games available.

Nothing too crazy or surprising in this one!  The puzzles are quite enjoyable, and can all be solved without resorting to proof-by-contradiction.  There's a handy \"mark\" feature available with the middle mouse button which can aid in counting out squares, and there's a superb feature called \"smart slide\" which restricts click-and-drag marking to a single row/column, which is quite handy for not accidentally making marks you hadn't intended.  All nonogram puzzle games should include that feature!\n\nThe in-game puzzle editor works great, and the workshop/community integration lets you upload your own puzzles, and play other users' puzzles, if you're so inclined.  Works great on Linux as well!  The game is well worth the money if you enjoy this kind of puzzle.\n\nThere are two minor things I don't like about it, neither of which should discourage anyone from checking it out, but I'll mention 'em for posterity:\n\n1) You get \"crown\" ratings for each puzzle based on some criteria (mostly to do with what \"hints\" you have enabled in the options), but the third crown can be missed if you accidentally misclick too often (which would require re-playing the puzzle if you want the third crown).  The threshhold for losing the third crown has been increased quite a bit in the most recent version (to the point where I never ran into the problem again after the patch), but it still feels wrong to punish misclicks in a puzzle like this, especially if you're able to recover from them and solve the puzzle anyway!\n\n2) It's a common convenience in computer nonogram puzzles to mark rows/columns as \"complete\" once there's an appropriate sequence of marks on the row/col (regardless of whether it's correct or not).  Pictopix considers that a \"hint,\" though, and you'll be unable to get all three crowns if you have this enabled.  In practice I didn't miss it too much, but it's something I always appreciate in other nonogram games.\n\nStill, those are quite minor, and the game's quite enjoyable.

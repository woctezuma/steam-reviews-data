You are greeted by a kid who can talk to the dead who is able to tell you some basic information about where you are. You then have to go around the boat, possessing people as a means of interviewing everyone on board to find out who the murderer is.\n\nWhat I like:\nAll the characters have a different personality and background. As you interview them you may be surprised by their individual histories and motivations for the future. The concept of possessing others to get them to talk to each other is interesting. Each character also has their own unique ability like peeking through doorknobs or reading people's emotions, but not all character abilities are useful to solving the case. There are several possible endings based on how much information you collect and your ability to conclude who the guilty party is at the end.\n\nWhat I don't like:\nI will admit this is a personal dislike, but this game contains some strong language. If you don't like the f-bomb, avoid this game. An NPC did get stuck on a corner in one of my playthroughs, and it was before I could possess him, so he was stuck there until I progressed the story meaning I couldn't complete a specific conversation involving him. I suspect this game could be buggy if you tried to find them. \n\nYou can learn more in my video review:\nhttps://youtu.be/A0YBGBHKdQ4", "timestamp_created": 1516324223, "timestamp_updated":

It's basically a murder/mystery RPG with a great story told in an inventive way that let's you gradually piece together the plot in layers as well as from various perspectives. The way it's implemented embellishes an already well-written story and keeps your attention the entire time. \n\nYou wake up as a ghost without any knowledge of yourself, and need to figure out who you are as well as who on the cruise ship murdered you. You work towards these goals by possessing the suspects (crew and passengers) to take control over their bodies and investigate them. While possessing someone, you open up new dialog possibilties with other characters - and also gain a special skill that's unique to each character such as being able to peek in door keyholes or read people's emotional state. You can only possess people after learning personal/private details about them so you need to find ways to accomplish that during the investigation since it's critical to progressing the story. There's also two different levels of possession which makes things even more interesting by adding another dimension to the concept. Between the dialog choices from all possessed suspects' story threads and special skills, you come to understand/experience the plot in additive layers of detail from different perspectives. I really enjoyed playing multiple storylines and watching how they weave together while collectively manipulating the suspects through  forced interaction with possession.

[/h1]\nI did not expect that.\nThis might be one of the best indie games I have ever played.\nIn this game, you are a ghost trying to piece together your own murder case.\nYou do so by taking over the passengers and talking to each other.\nGetting a whim of their personalities allows you to follow them around (you control their movement, but you can't relay information that you know through them).\nAfter getting to know them intimately, you can finally possess them and speak through their mouths, relaying that information that you've pieced together through other characters and exploring the ship.\nThis game throws a lot of twists into the story. Some bigger, some smaller.\nSome fairly predictable.\nIt keeps you interested throughout. It's a game that you can't really put down until you finish it.\nSomething that I really enjoyed was the Mindreading mechanic.\nIt doesn't really advance the plot (which is sad, cause that would've been kinda cool), but god is it aesthetic. \nThe cat one is probably my favourite.\nThis game features multiple endings based on the evidence that you collect throughout your journey.\nI recommend not looking at guides on how to get them until you finished the game once (don't worry, you can't really miss evidence until the very end. If you save, you can collect the rest of it before entering the finale).\nSometimes it can get kind of frustrating, in which case, look at a guide or keep trying.\nThe soundtrack is very memorable since its mostly tied to the characters. This gives every track a personal feel to it and it also helps giving life to the characters themselves. The melodies reflect their personalities.\nThe graphics have a very earthbound feel to them. They're fantastic for a pixel-art game.\nThe longer you play, the more do you get a feel for the ship, It's rooms, the character's usual hideouts.\nOne gripe I have with this game is that every character has his/her own special ability.\nThey really do range from kinda-, no - sorta-, nah, maybe important? to completely useless. \nFor example, one character's ability is to see what other people have in their pockets.\nYeah. It's never used.\nIt's kinda sad actually. It could've been used for some cool evidence collecting.\nLike, what if you look into someone's pocket and you find the protagonist's handkerchief in there?\nThen you could point it out and they'd get all nervous, which could then later be used as evidence.\nThat's just an example. Not sure how you make the \"take pills which make you run faster but also muddle up the screen\" ability useful in collecting evidence. It just feels like a tacked on feature, which is sad. It could've been a pretty cool mechanic to be honest.\nI've encountered one bug where Donnovan wouldn't meet me in his room and I'd be locked out. If that happens to you, just talk to him again and wait until he goes back to his room.\nNow I'll get into spoilers, DON'T GO PAST HERE IF YOU HAVEN'T FINISHED THE GAME.\nTHE GAME IS FAIRLY CHEAP AND QUITE AN AMAZING JOURNEY.\nSERIOUSLY, BUY IT.\nPLAY IT.\nPAST HERE IS NO-NO ZONE.\n\n\n\n\nokay? good.\n\n[spoiler] Some of the story twists really hit me. It really goes to show how indie devs write better stories than AAA companies with their millions of dollars. For once, I was really surprised to find out that the main character is female. I thought that that was a really neat twist. Adding that with her not only being the captain, but also a secret agent, she's a way more interesting character than I originally anticipated. I also like how every character tells you their own opinions on the captain. Again, it adds so much personality to these characters. They could've just as easily have every character say that she was really kind. The Donnovan twist was predictable as hell. I saw that coming from a mile away. That being said, he's used in a very interesting and cool way. When I took over Donnovan and that bloodpumping music started playing in the background, I grinned. You just feel so frickin' badass. And just as the Game Devs give you the Lollipop, they take it away and spit in your face. Before, I just thought that Donnovan was some kind of edgelord or really wanted revenge against the killer. But just those few moments you have with him, walking around with that music playing, knowing that he's an undercover cop, I immediately grew to love him. And then he dies (not really, but yaknow, I didn't know). I actually felt shocked and saddened. The Smilla/Donnovan Partners in Crime thing made that even worse. I'm amazed at how quickly they made me love a character who had zero appeal until then. Another thing that they could've improved is the showdown. Ferdinand just stands there and laughs while saying kinda predictable \"Nyeh-eh I am the bad guy Muah-ha-ha\" things. Also, Garv trying to pretend as if he's innocent and not really snapping out of it at any point until he tries to bribe a man who clearly has no need for money is EHHHHH. Also, they just kinda stand there and wait to get shot. Maybe one of them couldve taken a hostage or something. It may seem like I'm complaining a lot here, but I just intend to review games fairly. This game really touched me, it made me laugh, it made me hate (HOW DARE YOU DO THAT TO PAULO), It shocked me, surprised me and overall, I've had a great time with it.[/spoiler]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ITS 5$ ARE YOU KIDDING ME BUY IT AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "timestamp_created": 1500978104, "timestamp_updated": 1500979064, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33572594": {"recommendationid": "33572594", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050002024", "num_games_owned": 177, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 396, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500160890}, "language": "english", "review": "I absolutely loved this game.

Besides that, the music sometimes does not feel fitting for the setting of the game, it's not exacly bad, it just doesn't go with the mood. There were a few mechanics that are not used that had potencial, like the party, and mind reading.\n\nAnyways, If you think you'll like this game, you probably will, at it's price, I think it's a must buy.  \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1498934087, "timestamp_updated": 1498934087, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580545", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33077834": {"recommendationid": "33077834", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083557114", "num_games_owned": 224, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 500, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498903966}, "language": "german", "review": "Ich habe nicht erwartet, dass mich dieses Spiel derart packen w\u00fcrde!

However, these were core elements for good reason, and the changes cause problems that are uncommon and jarring for the genre. But whatever the verdict, it's a unique ride all the way. \n\nThe main draw to Why Am I Dead At Sea is its story. Without spoiling it, the basic premise is that the protagonist is a ghost (assumedly recently dead) trying to sort out, well, why it's dead at sea. This transforms the narrative into a murder mystery with a twist, as you can posses and manipulate the various characters during their own investigations. I personally love this mechanic. Instead of using a pointer, you'll control the ghost with a controller or in my case the keyboard. This makes the game significantly more interesting, since each character has a different ability, so once you unlock a new character you'll be able to explore the ship more efficiently (at least in most cases). Overall, this mechanic is the best part of the game. It makes playing the game more interesting than clicking and scrolling through text, it works well with the setting and tone of the game, and it combines some of the better parts of a first person and omniscent perspective without any narrative hiccups.\n\nSpeaking of the narrative, it does it's job well for a story rich game. The game is paced well, and has a great climax that will lead to one of the multiple endings. As far as the actual writing goes, you can learn a lot (I'd say a little too much) about characters and the mystery simply by reading the dialogue (which takes up most of the game). The characters are diverse, likable, and relatable, and the dialogue is well written. There are also a few missables that answer some questions that the main story never does.  And to top it all off, most of the characters' simple designs work with the visual style without seeming too basic. After all of this, it sounds like a perfect game, but unfortunately this isn't the case. \n\nMy first problem in the game is that many of the mechanics are buggy. It's surprisingly easy to get stuck on a single pixel or clip through a wall, and since the game has manual saving, this can lead to loss of progress. I'd advise avoiding walls when you can ([spoiler]and not abusing the cats jumping ability[/spoiler]). To be fair, I only experienced issues twice in my two full playthroughs, but as both instances led to lost progress, I resent both of them.  \n\nSecondly the narrative progression has some small issues due to the game mechanics. In most adventure games you'll expect a certain ammount of trial and error, but this game makes it much worse. Because each character is different, certain actions will only cause progression if done with a specific character. There is a speech bubble that will appear over a characters head when they have something to say to whoever you're controlling, but because you can only control characters one at a time (and the NPCs won't stay put while unpossesed), you may have to check each character, with every other character multiple times in order to progress. There is one chapter in which you must talk to one character with three different characters in order to progress to the next chapter. For this reason, I found myself possessing characters en masse and trapping them all in the observation room so I could check for new dialogue without having to walk back and forth between rooms. And what I discovered by using this strategy during my second playthrough was easily the most disappointing part of the game.\n\nNow, the following contains pretty blunt spoilers. It does not contain any details that would spoil the plot, but this information will likely ruin the climax and any multiple playthroughs for you. In my case, ignorance was bliss, so I'd recommend skipping this part if you haven't played the game yet. However if you do intend to 100% the game, the following information is important.   [spoiler]Simply put, the different endings, aren't. There are two good endings, two bad endings, and the best ending. The good endings are nigh identical, the bad endings [b]are[/b] identical, and the best ending seems like a watered down combination of the good endings. Every ending answers all of the main games questions, so the only thing different about an ending will be parts of its dialogue. Furthermore, only the actions you take in the penultimate chapter affect the ending, although the game seems less linear than it actually is. With a guide (and no spoiler guides do exist) it is possible to play the game up to a point in the next to last chapter, save, and experience every ending from there by slightly altering your actions (which is how my second playthrough went). The multiple endings are easily the worst part of the game, as they encourage multiple playthroughs in a game that's best on the first play. The only rewards for reading through the same dialogue multiple times (i.e, 100% completion) are the achievements.[/spoiler] \n\nIf you've made it to the end of this review, I'd simply like to specify that I do think Why Am I Dead At Sea is a good game. If you like this kind of game you'll definitely enjoy it, and if you don't it will likely change your mind. But in my case, I feel like I went in too deep (again) and ruined what was a fun experience for me by overthinking and overplaying it.

Most of the time they've got little good pieces but are overall pretty bad. But every now and again, I find a real gem hidden in all that dross, and this was one of them. Low production value, a number of minor non-gamebreaking bugs, but superb mystery and characters. Honestly, I found that this game captured all the things I liked about the Nonary Games (albeit in a different format and without escape sequences.)\n\nThe game takes the form of an overhead RPGmaker style game (without combat), like corpse-party or mad-father. You play as a ghost who can possess characters to some degree and read minds, but not work outside the context of that character's norm. A few characters have special abilities (technically they all do, but most of them are abilities like 'i change the background music' or 'I made amusing and silly flavor-text announcements over the PA' or 'I take a pill to walk faster'). So that means most of the game is instigating conversations between different people, although there are a few \"figure out how to get the key\" moments. In any case, swapping characters is a great mechanism for allowing you to investigate the story from different angles. As you get to know certain characters better, you get higher degrees of control over them, and so in some situations you need to learn more about each character to advance the plot. \n\nThere is a hint system as well, although it was disabled at the end of the game when I really needed it. It offers both vague suggestions that give you a rough idea of where to look, but you can press for more specific ones. I did the specific one once, and the result was almost as explicit as a walkthrough \"try taking this character and talking to this other character to open up more dialog options, then return with a different character and they'll react differently.\" I liked that because it ensured you never got really stuck, but again, it is disabled at the end and I ended up getting stuck once, although I did feel like the specific ones were a bit too easy.\n\nThis game is a murder mystery, and an excellent one at that. Multiple people are working in different directions, without knowing the entire story. Everyone has their secrets, and almost noone is who they initially appear to be. It creates a complex and intricate situation to unravel. The game does an excellent job of dropping just the right hints and the right pieces to keep things interesting without giving away too much. \n\nThe ending takes place with a big confrontation between all the characters, a little like you'd expect from an Agatha Christie novel. Except instead of a detective putting together all the pieces of the mystery, that role falls to the player. So you take control of each character to get them to reveal their piece of the puzzle, and try to reveal the whole mystery. I'll admit, I missed a few pieces the first time, so the game ended with parts of the mystery unsolved. I'm not sure how many endings there are, but apparently there's more than one. I need to go through a second time to see if I can figure out the rest of it. \n\nThe character development is one of the best things about this game. There are numerous characters, all with their own backstory and motives. Some are innocent. Some, not so much. Everyone's hiding something though, and as you sort through the evidence you come to understand the characters and get attached to them in their own way. Their interactions are complex and dynamic. Manipulative and dishonest at times as well (at least if I didn't misinterpret any pieces of the mystery)\n\nThere are lots of problems with the game too. The character sprites are good, but everything else is kind of bland. The music is simplistic and obnoxious, and I ended up turning off the sound about a half hour after I started the game each time. The characters were said to each have special abilities, but I'd say maybe half at least of them were useless. Also, the story can get caught at times, and your only way to continue is cycle through each of the characters and they've all talked to each other and exhausted all dialog options, which is a pain. The scenery never changes either. There's maybe two dozen rooms, most of which are tiny, and they get kinda old by the end. \n\nAlso there are alot of bugs... nothing game-breaking, but just annoyance kind of stuff. The biggest one I saw was when you tried to enter a room, but another character was blocking the door in the other room. You'd enter and get pushed back out, or end up inside a wall. Also, sometimes you'd click on a door and it wouldn't react at all. Normally you'd get a \"door's locked\" or \"I shouldn't go in\" message, but sometimes you got nothing. There was an ability for the ghost to scan who he could control, and it lagged horribly whenever I used it. Also the game wanted to restart every time I exited it, so I could only close it by rapidly jamming alt-f4. Nothing gamebreaking, but obnoxious. \n\nOverall, I would highly recommend this game. If you like mysteries with strong characters anyway. It's got alot of little bad things, but the overall game is so great. The game took me about 7 hours on my first playthough, although may have left it idling a few times while I got dinner ready, and I'm not sure how much that inflated it. Still, it's much more length than I usually get out of a cheap game like this. The characters and mystery were masterfully executed.\n\nI will certainly keep an eye on this developer. If they can produce more stories with such great characters and plotlines, especially if they can add a little more polish, we might be looking at some real masterpieces in the future.", "timestamp_created": 1495061607, "timestamp_updated": 1495061607, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31784090": {"recommendationid": "31784090", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069852998", "num_games_owned": 385, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 419, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494928066}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game. The name, honestly is pretty dull and the art is barebones but what makes up for all of this is an excellent murder mystery wrapped up in flawed and interesting characters.\n\nOne of my favorite choices design-wise is a character named Paulo. He's completely isolated from all the action and therefore I never felt pressure when talking to him. Paulo gives a little backstory but what I especially loved what that he exists as essentially an in-game walkthrough. Paulo will rarely give straight answers, but he will point you to what characters/ areas of the game you need to focus on to complete the story. He's a great crutch for players (like me), who frequently struggle to solve these types of games but he doesn't take the fun out of solving the mystery. He does what Contradiction's chief tried to do, but he fills his role much better because of how we are introduced to Lewis. Such a simple character that gives the player a lot of leeway in how they want to approach the game!\n\nAnother thing i liked: i got the feeling the game had a lot of respect for the player. There's a point in chapter two where one of the main riddles of the game could have been solved with context clues in the dialog, but the answer is never spoken out loud until chapter three. However, at the end of chapter two the game gives dialog options to the player as if the mystery had already been revealed. This showed me the game had faith that the player was working the mystery on their own and didn't need obvious plot points to be outlined to them.\n\nNoteworthy: The game gets dark, but it's not really edgy like a lot of games are now. This is a personal thing, but I hate games that try to be edgy, pushing things sexual harassment and gruesome murders in the gameplay and forcing the player to watch. Not that the game strays from those topics, but i appreciated the tact shown when handling sensitive subjects. \n\nThere are a ton of choices in the game, but never does the player have an actual impact on the story. While you can approach the story in a nonlinear fashion by following different leads and characters, the narrative is ultimately linear and events happen in a fixed sequence. I appreciate this, because it meant for things like dialog are almost always repeatable. This is a very pleasant change for someone whose always worried about missing an option, even if it's a little disorientating when you give conflicting answers to one question.\n\nNow with all that said, I did have several issues (mostly technical) that would have made me quit the average title. These include:\n-having to completely restart my game because the first mate got stuck inside an invisible wall. Easily the biggest issue\n-Almost all the controls for gameplay are with keyboard, but in the audio menu you can only escape using the mouse?\n-the name, while descriptive, is pretty dull. If it wasn't on sale I\u2019d never look into this game.\n-unskippable cutscenes\n-there is no auto-eject out of conversations. Honestly this one is super nitpicky, but i hate accidently starting conversations and having to mash through 4 textboxes\n+-to that point there is also no button to progress a conversation other than 'k,' or whatever you remap it to. This means if you mash 'k' too fast you can accidently conversation you might accidently start it again. Having another button to progress the conversation that doesn't start a new one would be nice.\n-sometimes crewmen back block doors. I see no reason why collision with other passengers is needed, especially with this sort of drawback\n-The ending feels really messy. SPOILERS: The best ending comes out in a clever and logical way, but it's attachment to 4 other endings makes it an extremely painful trial and error bonanza (if you don't give up and grab the walkthrough like i did). Moreover, the entire game is designed so that you can also go back and redo events, and nothing you can do is permanent. Having major elements of the story locked away behind optional activities at the very end feels cheap as hell, mostly because it only happens once in the entire game. Considering the games linearity up the that point, it might have made more sense to have only one or two endings. \n\nAll that icky stuff aside, love the game and will definitely be looking for other stuff the dev has made :D\n", "timestamp_created": 1494928225, "timestamp_updated": 1494928225, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31758157": {"recommendationid": "31758157", "author": {"steamid": "76561198349195327", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 358, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494799252}, "language": "english", "review": "What an amazing game.

It sounds clich\u00e9, but everyone hides something, be it a huge, dark secret, a tragic backstory or just a side of their personality they don't like to face. \nThe game operates wonderfully - for example the first creature you can posess is a cat, and every single person's reaction is reflecting their personality, as they react to the cat. Each person has a theme music that fits their personality. You'll have access later to a feature that visualize their personality, and that's also incredibly aligned with their reactions, personality and music, or even with just the walking speed of theirs.

It's a bit on the shorter side, but the multiple endings, engrossing story, and rich details make it worth at least one replay. \n\nThis isn't the only game where you play a murder victim back from the dead (with Ghost Trick being another great example), but Why Am I Dead At Sea executes the concept masterfully. The mechanics change as the player gains a better understanding of their former identity and the people around them, tying together narrative and gameplay in a way that feels satisfying and natural. All the characters have multiple layers, and their interactions are realistic and well-written. Also, I loved the way the human mind was handled. Reading someone's mind displays some abstract visuals that give you a glimpse of their general attitude, with snippets of text floating by as their surface thoughts. It's not a huge deal, but it does a great job of making the mind feel dynamic and real. Much more creative than just having a line or two of inner monologue. Also, interaction between characters is well-written and engaging, even in cutscenes when the player isn't at the wheel. For the most part, the things a posessed character is willing to say will tell you as much as the answer you get in return. Also, even within the same ending, characters will act a bit differently depending on what you made them say earlier in the game. Otherwise, the story is mostly linear before a certain point, although some things don't need to be done in a certain order. This gives the player a nice sense of flexibility.\n\nThere were a couple of issues I had, though. First of all, the last stretch of the game is a bit difficult to navigate. The pacing of the story doesn't suffer much, but there's a relative lack of guidance and some of the things you need to do are accomplished in an unintuitive way. Throughout the game, it can be difficult to figure out what to do, but this issue becomes more pronounced as the game goes on. A more astute player might have less trouble juggling all the information they have, but sometimes it's hard to tell which character needs to talk to who, especially near the end. Also, while the endings are mostly satisfying, I felt like a couple of characters could use a little more focus, or at least acknowledgement. Those issues, in my opinion, are still far outweighed by the strength of the characters and the excitement of unraveling the story.\n\nIn conclusion, Why Am I Dead At Sea is a thrilling experience, packed to the brim with complex characters and unique mechanics.

They vary in depth, but most of them have multiple levels that make them interesting to discover.\n- The story is above average.  There is a nice sense of progression -- although the fact that it will have twists is obvious, what those twists are isn't always.  \n\nNeutral:\n- The majority of the game is the conversational aspect.  There are very few puzzles, and what puzzles there are are pretty simple.\n\nCons:\n- A game-breaking bug where characters can get stuck in place and unable to move, requiring you to edit the save file to continue.   You're advised to keep multiple saves.\n- The plot runs on a script, regardless of your choices.  If you figure something out before you're supposed to, you can't do anything about it until the plot catches up.  Towards the end, you may know exactly what you need to do, but get stymied because you can't figure out the series of actions the game is expecting to advance the plot.\n- The game begins to fall apart, mechanically, towards the end.  Actions that were able to be done earlier in the game cannot be repeated even though there's been no change, some actions (like attempting to open a locked door) no longer give any feedback at all, etc.\n- Sometimes keystrokes are dropped, especially during conversations.  This is doubly annoying because you don't want to accidentally overpress the key either, or you'll inadvertently skip things.\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed the first 75% or so of the game, but the last quarter just got downright frustrating, which unfortunately left a bad aftertaste.

All the characters are extremely detailed and fleshed out; sometimes a simple optional observation can give entire new depth to the story that wouldn't be known otherwise. And that's all I can say without spoiling anything. It really seems that as far as story goes, this game is pretty impeccable.\n\nAs far as negatives go, there are some minor gameplay gripes. Players constantly going back to specific places when you're done possessing them, as well as certain characters walking really slowly, can get a little annoying, but it's in service to the plot and character development, and that is the main focus of the game, anyway. \n\nThere's also the complaint that the gameplay really boils down to talking to random people as random people, but I'd beg to differ. I can't speak for everyone (and obviously I don't), but in my personal playthrough, I very rarely felt like I was just randomly guessing at what to do. Very few games provide, and reward players for following, clues as successfully as this game, and if you feel like you're fresh out of leads, you can always talk to Paulo. The few times I did come to a conclusion through random guessing, my reaction was kinda, \"Oh, I should've figured,\" as the clues are always there. Except, that is, in the Fourth Chapter. THAT is the point where I think this criticism is valid, as the game hits a bit of a lul, not only because of the absence of Paulo, but also because it takes a long time before a visual change in the ship, which kinda makes you wonder when a major change in the story is gonna come, as well as making the gameplay feel a little monotonous.

Perhaps most importantly for me, the dialogue writing feels fresh and interesting. The story keeps your curiosity piqued, and your brain working on figuring out the mystery. It's good stuff.\n\nIt gets off to a really good start that's almost immediately very engaging and dramatic (in no small part due to the soundtrack), and its characters feel surprisingly nuanced.\n\nYou get access to various unusual abilities that you can use while exploring or during conversations, and it meshes really well with the story (even if some are more useful than others. But I don't really see that as a flaw.)\n\nLots of things about this game work really well, but it does have a few pretty significant problems:\n\n[b]Technical Issues[/b]\nI've had to restart the game multiple times before I was able to finish it due to various technical problems, the most common of which is that some characters will get stuck before they reach their destination, and can never get unstuck.\nAnother odd issue i got was that the game's save files seemingly deleted themselves overnight.\n\n[b]Design Flaws[/b]\nIt's very easy to get stuck not knowing what flag you haven't tripped so you can move on to the next thing. But the game dialogue is also oddly structured, which hurts the game's pacing.\n\nOften, you seemingly need to \"talk to everyone about everything\", but the dialogue trees are oddly designed in that choices don't \"stick\". You can say every possible choice by just repeating a certain dialogue tree path.\n\nIf you haven't exhausted all your dialogue with a character, there's a \"...\" icon, but it doesn't go away before you've made every possible choice.\nSo the problem is the character you're controlling has to be a total weirdo who starts multiple identical conversations about the same topic by saying the exact same thing at first, and then ends it by, for example, stating wildly different opinions each time, say, 4 or 5 times, to the same character. This doesn't make sense in the narrative of the game, and stands out especially because the game is well written.\n\nIt seems to me that the game is signalling that exhausting all of these dialogue options and thus removing the \"...\" icon from every character is required to progress - but I'm honestly not sure how that really works. It's entirely unclear as you're playing, and becomes especially apparent if you (like me) end up playing the game multiple times.\n\n\n[b]In conclusion[/b]\nSkill and effort went into crafting this story, and I recommend this game to people who enjoy a good mystery.\n\nIf you can find a way to back-up your save files, then you might want to do that in case a character gets stuck, or the saves decide to disappear like mine. Or just beat it in one sitting.\n\nI found it quite enjoyable despite having seen perhaps the worst of its flaws.", "timestamp_created": 1477357130, "timestamp_updated": 1477357261, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548387", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26164131": {"recommendationid": "26164131", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055006994", "num_games_owned": 618, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 446, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477145387}, "language": "english", "review": "This reminds me of Ghost Trick, a lot, wich is good, and also of Murdered: Soul Suspect, a little.

A great concept, excellent execution, fun world design that rewards exploration with insight, just a wonderful and memorable gaming experience.\n\nI am so into these games that offer unique modes of storytelling, I mean, it's a brilliant solution to a concept I've always hated in games: dead-eyed, slack-jawed NPCs who sit around waiting for you to do every little thing. You're ostensibly playing one entity, but really this game has more in common with \"split the party\" type horror games like [i]Siren[/i] or [i]Corpse Party[/i] where you play different people caught in the vortex of one event, each with their own fully realized personalities and desires. The care that has been put into constructing the characters is really what makes the game so great. Each character has unique music that plays when possessing them, a unique mindscape that can be peeked into, a unique placement in the societal incubator that is the setting, and each has different methods of talking to the other characters and dealing with the world they're situated in. In order to possess them, the game asks that you understand them, and thus witness them through the eyes of the people around them and then ultimately through their own. \n\nWhat results is a game that feels very empathic, very alive, where both the player and the characters seem to have so much agency towards pushing the story forward and solving the mystery. This ties into the existential crises of nearly all the characters, which range from poverty to surviving the suicide of a loved one to facing their own imminent deaths, the game offers several discussions on time and moving forward, overcoming traumas and spending whatever time you are given meaningfully and not just keeping your head down and doing the bare minimum to achieve comfort.\n\nAnd the mystery is good!

I played through the whole thing in one sitting, and I can see myself possibly playing it again at some point. \n\nBasically, the plot of the game is you wake up to find that you are on a ghost on a ship, and you have to solve the mystery of your own murder by meeting the other passengers on the ship and finding clues as to what has happened. The graphic style is cute and charming. All of the characters are very interesting and multi-dimensional. The game mechanics are unique and fun, and I wish there were more games like this.\n\nIt lasted around six and a half hours, for me at least, and I did a pretty thorough playthrough and didn't really get stuck at any point. It might be longer or shorter for you depending on whether you get stuck anywhere or if you play it more straightforward.  \n\nOne last thing I will mention is that there are a few dark themes in this game, so if you are sensitive to mentions of abuse, self-harm, and suicide, I would use caution. \n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1470864537, "timestamp_updated": 1470864537, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527559", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24764062": {"recommendationid": "24764062", "author": {"steamid": "76561198196483307", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 1240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470084275}, "language": "english", "review": "Such a neat little casual mystery game. As the title implies, this game's universe revolves around a journey at sea on what seems to be a particularly small cruise ship.\n\nYou - as the player - are handed control over a spirit. And that spirit is an energetic remnant of what was once a human being, who unfortunately died under strange circumstances.\n\nThe fun thing about controlling this spirit, is the ability to float through doors. And that inevitably means you get to take peeks behind closed doors... in spaces that hold secrets.\n\nYes... secrets. We're here to uncover secrets. One obvious secret revolving around the protagonist's demise.\n\nBut there's more... mhmm, a couple of subplots that tie in beautifully with the main plot.\n\nSo, on this ship there's a lot of moving from one cabin to another on different floors (which unfortunately has the process feeling repetitive and even dreadful at some point, but because the story takes place on a tiny cruise ship; it's kind of fun and doable, thanks to speedy movement of the spirit).\n\nThis spirit has no memory of what happened, where, when or how it occurred (which is very distressing & confusing to this little residual ball of energy), but of course we are here to do something about that, ey!\n\nAnd the way this is done, is by first being informed of the spirit's death, thru a very young passenger on board (i.e. Paulo) who is capable of tapping into the paranormal (and thus, communicating with spirits).\n\nHis guidance jumpstarts the exploration process and makes it easier to grasp what's going on and what to do.\n\nHe explains the process of possession/mind control, and encourages you to test the process on a cat which happens to be in his cabine at that time. \n\nConcerning possession; the game logic goes as following; the most insecure passengers of the whole lot are to be possessed first - which is simply figured out thru trial-and-error -  and via them you get to know the stronger minded folks (and thus possess them afterwards).\n\nThe more you know about someone, the easier it becomes to manipulate them (i.e. their insecurities weaken their aura so-to-speak, and allows for easier 'entry' in their body).\n\nThere is a basic possession mode & a full possession mode.\n\nIn order to unlock 'full possession' (which in this game, equals the unlocking of specific dialogue lines - which are required in order to progress and find out what really happened - one has to become acquainted fully with all passengers on board.\n\nAnd this is where a lot of running is done, because you're required to possess each and every one of them to get answers, progress and finish the game.\n\nThe one thing that really stuck with me (after finishing up) was the music and the graphics. And heck, even the plot. \n\nThe plot was nice. It was good enough and it made sense.\n\nA really cool thing they did in this game is the ability to see inside the passengers minds. \n\nWhat you get to see is a graphical representation of what their mind looks like (this is done thru clever use of colour, music and specific phrases, which reflect their thoughts & demeanor).\n\nThis really adds to the atmosphere of the game. \n\nEach character has their own theme music (which plays when they're possessed + in their cabins) and this really helps grasping their personalities.\n\nOn top of this, when the characters converse, their personality is emphasized thru sound & pace (as the dialogue appears on screen). \n\nSo even though, there's no voice acting present, it IS possible to 'feel' what the characters are like, because of the smart application of sound & tempo in regard to dialogue.\n\nHow this works is; as the words appear on screen, sound is played for every letter that pops up.\n\nI thought that was really awesome. It made a difference. This is a feature I had come across before in games (especially of the RPG type), and it simply works well for this game.\n\nThis is a game I would so replay if they ever decided to remake it in an upgraded version :).", "timestamp_created": 1470593819, "timestamp_updated": 1476212712, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24644162": {"recommendationid": "24644162", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133819015", "num_games_owned": 217, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 327, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470011999}, "language": "english", "review": "Why Am I Dead At Sea.

Like a lot of reviewers, I was immediately drawn to its Earthbound-style graphics, and expected a lighthearted indie romp through a ship. That compairson shatters within the first five minutes of gameplay, though. The 90's nostalgia and surreal charm of Earthbound are nowhwere to be found. Instead, you find yourself on a third-rate ship, among its cynical inhabitants. You've been murdered, and a telepathic boy named Pablo has pulled your soul back into the land of the living. He explains that in your current state, you can't open doors or speak to people, and must possess a living person to talk and search for clues.\n\nAnd that's the basic premise of the game: possess people and puppeteer them into revealing conversations. The more conversations and clues you amass, the more leverage you have over the ship's occupants, and the more you understand about who you were and what's at stake. In general, it plays like a lot of early 90's point-and-click games, trying different dialogue combinations with different characters. Some might find that frustrating, but I honestly found it a highlight. I miss old games like that.  If you get too frustrated, though, Pablo offers hints throughout most of the game (usually two hints per section, a \"where should I go\" style hint, and a \"complete this part for me\" style one).  \n\nSadly, these hints fall away where they're needed most, in the fourth act of the game. Up until that point, there's a sort of internal logic that can point you in the right direction. By act four, though, your choices are too broad, and there's no rhyme or reason for the interaction combos you need to pick. After reading a walkthrough, I understood why the choices I made were necessary for the story, but still thought \"I never would've realized that I should possess this character and speak to this character after doing this not-very-obvious thing.\" You lose sight of why characters are motivated to act the way they do, basically. \n\nThat said, I still enjoyed the story quite a bit. It was a solid, unpredictable muder-mystery with a interesting game mechanic. The music never felt out of place, and a lot of thought given to the personality and backstory of each character, even down to how they speak to one person versus another.

It was way better than I anticipated.  It was confusing at times, with me wandering around trying to figure out if I'd actually talked to everyone I needed to in order to progress.  I did use guides for a couple of the steps and three of the endings (because I'm not naturally very good at puzzles), but overall it wasn't too difficult or too easy.  The story was brilliant, as were the subplots, and kept me guessing for ages.  It's astonishing how much is really in this game and for such a good price.  It reminded me a little of Undertale without the fighting, by which I mean the many mysteries to uncover.  I had an enjoyable couple of nights playing, and I wholeheartedly recommend Why Am I Dead At Sea. \u2665\n\n\n\n\n**SPOILER** Trigger warning for pills for one of the character's backstories/special abilities.

He was happily married for three years, until one day he came home from work late to find his wife had committed suicide by medication overdose.  She had anxiety issues, the extent of which he was not fully aware of, and so it came as a total shock.  If you read his mind and listen to his apathetic speech you'll see he is quite clearly depressed.  He carries empty pill bottles in one of his pockets, and his ability is to take a pill which increases his speed but also blurs his vision (and yours, by default).  If you have problems with things like discussions of overdoses (especially by pills) then maybe this game isn't for you.  However it only plays a small part in the narrative, so it's possible it won't cause any issues if you are prepared for it.[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1467825969, "timestamp_updated": 1467825969, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562881", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22897020": {"recommendationid": "22897020", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139328230", "num_games_owned": 1829, "num_reviews": 218, "playtime_forever": 611, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462889779}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]\u201cBut what I mean is, lots of time you don't know what interests you most till you start talking about something that doesn't interest you most.\u201d \u2015 J.D. Salinger, [i]The Catcher in the Rye[/i][/b]\n\n[i]Why Am I Dead At Sea[/i] is an underrated gem created by Peltast Software just a year ago. Aside being an incredibly well weaved murder/mystery, it is a unique game that presents the rare opportunity of taking a glimpse on the human nature and the perpetual failure to communicate with one another, keeping unintended secrets while failing to hide things that they intended to hide to begin with. Through associations of the language and the mind, we are to investigate a horrifying affair. You should remember that you can only discover what people do care about the most by taking note on what they do not care about.\n\nOur story starts with a brutal murder; a soul is snatched away from its mortal body before its time. We start as the fragment of this soul, as a piece rendered out of personality due to shock and we remember not a thing about our former mortal identity. Who were we? What happened? Who killed us? With all these ominous questions at mind, we awaken. A young boy medium seemingly managed to help us manifest at the last minute, thus our scarred consciousness has taken form in the cruise ship he's been travelling in as a ghost. We are to wander around, listen to passengers and the crew, and influence their actions by possessing them in hopes of revealing the vile businesses going on in this ship to reach some kind of closure.\n\nThe game manages to present a unique atmosphere with a limited environment. We are in an old cruise ship with 3 floors: the residential floor for passengers, the residential floor for the crew and the deck, alongside utilities and recreational areas. Graphics-wise, it's nothing exceptional, but these limited areas are well used in both in display and story purposes, harboring countless unique details that you may investigate and discover. All characters have their own background music, dominating the game according to your interactions with them - and with your ability of taking a glimpse to their minds, you'll gather uneasy clues about their goals and pasts.\n\nWe are given unique gameplay dynamics and a well written story. All characters involved has complicated personalities, various conflicting motives and secrets to keep depending on their situations. With all parameters involved, [i]Why Am I Dead At Sea[/i] may be interpreted as an Agatha Christie novel with supernatural undertone. You are welcome to possess people if you are to grasp a basic understanding about their personalities and motives only - and still then you can only present subconscious suggestions to manipulate their actions. They cannot talk about a subject they have no idea about to begin with! For the full control of people, you should first reveal the fundamental drive that each of them possess. Only then, you can completely control their actions and speak through their mouths. Each character has a unique ability that could become useful in your investigation, including your ghost self. By revealing details of your own past and personality, you are to gradually gather your former self and memories, presenting grander abilities with stronger manifestations. As the story progresses, you'll find yourself in a web of intrigue, lies and misconceptions.\n\nThis whole experience takes 5 chapters to wrap up - 4 investigation chapters and one conclusion chapter - and contains 5 different endings according to your ability to conclude the interrelation of all happenings during the last chapter, presenting you genuine replayability. All said and done, [i]Why Am I Dead At Sea[/i] is a noteworthy experience and a thrilling story with more than decent narrative and personality depictions.

One noteable example of this is [spoiler] at the very end of the game, where their \"ambiguous job\" becomes clear.

Throughout the game, you are set upon the task of finding out the answer to each of these enigmas, and in doing so you will also learn much about the passengers and crew aboard the ship. I've been waiting almost a year to finally play this title, so needless to say I was hoping that I wouldn't be disappointed; I definitely got a lot more than I expected out of this experience.\n\nThe game plays out like an incredibly gripping novel, and at any point it's overwhelmingly difficult to put it dow for even the briefest moment. You will want to continue playing through until the end, so that you can unravel the questions that were roused from the beginning. You will initially start off by getting to casually know the people aboard the vessel, but as you progress throughout the four chapters you will get to know their most intimate details and innermost thoughts. The character building, and the relationships that are formed between them, are key points to the success of Why Am I Dead at Sea; many of the details that you will learn later on in the game, and especially what lies in wait at the end, will have many players on the Feels train, headed full speed towards Feelsville.\n\nSo as you may be able to determine, the title relies heavily on dialogue. That being said, the actual gameplay is minimal; as a ghost, you are able to possess the other people on the ship, as well as use their unique special abilities. These special abilities range from extremely beneficial, such as Donnovan who can highlight interactive objects, to utterly useless, like Darryl who can walk faster but at the disadvantage of having the screen become disoriented. Needless to say, you probably will not utilize of most of these special abilities, despite possessing the characters multiple times. To fully understand the story, and to uncover your \"true\" self as the ghost, you will talk to everyone around the ship at least once on every chapter, and at some point you will also be tasked to investigate every room aboard the liner. These are not incredibly daunting or time consuming tasks, as the boat only has three floors and ten passengers.\n\nOnce you get to know a character completely, you are then free to fully possess them; doing so enables new dialogue options to appear at certain stages of the game. Once you reach the end of the fourth and final chapter, you then proceed on to unlock an array of different endings. While the endings are somewhat diversified, there is in fact one true ending in the mix; however, you are still left to piece together, yourself, many of the riddles that the game presents. This is a nice change of pace, versus games that feel the need to explain their outcome in excruciating detail; it also leaves an air of mystery to the title, and one that is open to interpretation.\n\nAs a final note, I will say that the soundtrack by Bill Kiley is an absolute masterpiece. I never found myself getting tired of the amazing retro, Sega Genesis styled bytes that were infiltrating my ears; from the downright creepy, to the dubstep influenced, to the upbeat. The only gripe that I do have is that each letter of dialogue makes a sound, and it overtakes the background tracks. These sounds, however, can be easily bypassed by pressing the action key; although it would be nice to have the option to turn it off completely. It's also worth noting that if you enjoy retro soundtracks, the one for this game can be downloaded for free, or pay what you want, at Bill's Bandcamp page.\n\nWhy Am I Dead at Sea is one of the best mystery games on Steam at this point, and it's unfortunate that it's severely underrated and often bypassed. As of now, this will be the 55th review for this game. The depth of the characters is really where this game shines, without that element, Why Am I Dead at Sea would not be the diamond in the rough that it is. The only way that the experience could've been improved was if the ship was a little larger, and the story a little longer. With talking to everyone, obtaining all of the endings, and earning all of the achievements, I clocked in at a little under 5 hours. Since the time that I initially posted this review, this title has seen a significant price drop, and the current price of $5.49 CAD is very fair for the amount of content that you get. If you can nab it on sale, it's one hell of a steal for a must-play title.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]4.0/5.0[/b] - Excellent, highly worth playing.[/h1]\nThe Horror Network [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28221963/]Curator[/url] | [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thehorrornetwork]Group[/url] Click for Gore", "timestamp_created": 1458186475, "timestamp_updated": 1513692653, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523215", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21879473": {"recommendationid": "21879473", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042549377", "num_games_owned": 228, "num_reviews": 77, "playtime_forever": 358, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458163578}, "language": "english", "review": "A great game, more people need to play it though.

Its influences are clear; Mother 3's art style, Phoenix Wright's murder mysteries and Ghost Trick's possession mechanic..., yet it still manages to stand on its own as a unique and immensely gripping adventure, with plenty of brooding atmosphere to spare. These small 2D characters have more dimension to them than most from AAA releases; they're broken in sympathetic and often relatable ways, and the methods used to convey them show how effective games can be for storytelling.\n\nI do strongly recommend the game despite some faults; a few story details weren't elaborated on as much as I would've liked, even after the 'true' ending. Progression can be a little tedious or obtuse at times, mainly due to having to exhaust dialogue options with every character combination. Also, I did come across a couple of game breaking glitches (usually getting stuck somewhere with the cat), not to mention issues with music cutting out. Hopefully these can be resolved, not deal-breaking due to frequent saves but still something to be aware of.\n\nIf you look at the game's Steamspy sales, its sales numbers are criminally low. Let's change that folks!

I've not really heard of anybody mentioning it, and well, at this moment, it only has 50 reviews!\n\nI would have to say that I would recommend this game to just about anybody that I know. I imagine most people would really enjoy this game - if they truly enjoy story focus, that is.\n\nThe whole premise of the game is to find out what is going down on a supposed \"cruise\" ship, as you are the ghost of someone who has died while the ship was sailing. Further, you do not even know who you are when the game begins, and you have to find that out as well - however, that question is a lot simpler, and is easy to figure out before the game actually confirms it.\n\nIn order to gain more information, you meet with a kid who seems to be able to communicate with ghosts, who will guide you as you go along. Using his advice, you possess other passengers and have them communicate with others on the ship, or go investigate rooms, attempting to gain any bits of information possible. Of course, you can't just possess someone and have them do crazy actions; your capabilities are limited early on in the game. However, once you learn more about the characters, you seem to be able to channel a stronger connection with them, and can then have them say or ask things that do not fit their normal actions.\n\nAs a whole, that is pretty much the setup of the game. There are a few other things here and there, like each character has a special ability that you can use while possessing them, but for the most part, it is really just to possess, ask questions, and sneak around.\n\nThe story of the game is both really well-done, but at the same time, has some very large cons to it, at least for me. I am going to avoid any spoilers and will be high-level so as to not completely ruin the game, so don't worry. But if you choose to avoid even broad complaints of the plot, skip the next two paragraphs.\n\nIn any case, there was one particular character whom I thought very early on was the problem - but as the game went along, it definitely leads you down different passages of thought, making you question yourself. That in itself is a pro for the story, but my con is that I ended up being correct about my initial thought, and the ending of the story somewhat cheaply threw it together to prove it, based on a singular minor detail.\n\nSimilarly, some background events that happened during the story ended up being connected to something a lot bigger by the end of the game, even though it did not really make sense to me when it happened. Perhaps it is because I played the game across multiple sittings, I don't know... But I just felt like the finale did not set the story up well enough.\n\nEither way, the game has nice graphics and indeed looks Earthbound-style as many people say. I do not remember there being that many distinct songs in the game, but the ones I do remember were definitely nice. My main complaint in this area is that the game did not have a resolution setting to fit my laptop (1600x900), and during certain cutscenes, the screen seemed to get \"stuck\" and wouldn't re-focus to fit the entire event happening.\n\nThe game is decent length, but could probably be done in one sitting by many people. My time is over 10 hours, but that is both with pause/idle time, as well as collecting the achievements that I didn't obtain by the end of the game. I would probably suggest that you try to do it in one sitting, actually, since it would be more beneficial to keep all of the information fresh in mind. For me, it was 3 sittings across 4 days, I believe, because I did not know how long the game would be and so just played it late in the evenings.\n\nSo go ahead, get the game, set sail on the ship, and find out whodunit!", "timestamp_created": 1457290790, "timestamp_updated": 1457291375, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503759", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21271312": {"recommendationid": "21271312", "author": {"steamid": "76561198197661507", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455648345}, "language": "english", "review": "I would give the game a \"neutral\" review if that thing actually existed because the premise is nice, the gameplay is interesting (with some annoying bugs, though) but the game has several flaws that let me down a bit.\n\nAs I said before, the premise is great - you are dead. Nothing can change that. You are a ghost and you don't remember who you are or how you've dead. Your mission is to recover your identity and to try to investigate the reason of your death, if any.\n\nAs a ghost you can read other people minds and even posses other characters eventually. That way you can talk as your host and interact with other characters. Every character has its own personality and motivations (some of them lack of both btw) so is nice to see how different can be one character when talking to two different people. Nothing is as it seems to be at first and the characters will surprise you with their real personalities. \n\nAs I pointed before the idea behind gameplay is cool but its not so well implemented, leaving you several times with no idea of what to do next or letting stuck physically on some points like doors or stairs. Luckily, the set of characters is pretty limited so the same are the options to interact to. \n\nGraphics are pretty simple, but effective. I understand that the main focus of the game relies on narrative rather than any other aspect so it didn't bother me at all. But for the same reason, you can't afford to have narrative inconcruencies in your game, like possess a character and talk about yourself in 3rd person as it wasn't you. (i.eg. with Gwen at the end).\n\nAnother disappointing thing are the endings. Yes, the game has 4 endings but all of them are pretty similar and kind of lame. Plus, some of them overlaps with the others so you can't properly trigger them in order to get some achievements. Even if you try following a guide. It would be great that this thing is corrected in future updates.\n\n[spoiler]As I sad before the spoiler tag, all endings are similar and none of them have a real conclusion for the main character. That's pretty disappointing. You lead the main role and you don't know what happens to you at the end. I didn't expect a happy ending (you are dead from the very beginning afterall) but I was willing to know more about the captain background and that wasn't the case, leaving you with the feeling that your death was just the excuse for playing the game. The endings leave the story unnecessarily open.[/spoiler]\n\nTo sum up, I think it's an interesting proposal and pros overweight the cons but not for the current price.

While it\u2019s not a unique concept for a game \u2013 a similar title includes Square Enix\u2019s Murdered: Soul Suspect among others. However, I argue that none of the games that I have come across does the concept as well as Peltast Software has\u2026\n\nBrilliant soul jumping mechanic: An important part that the game absolutely nails is the soul jumping mechanic. As a dead spirit you\u2019re able to jump into the souls of the living characters on board the ship. Before you can solve your murder, however, you will have to find the clues and help these other characters solve their own mysteries or complete the quests that they have waiting for you. For example, the first such major quest, has you finding out who stole a family heirloom in the form of a vase. These quests first introduce you to the characters on board the ship then is utilized as a vehicle to enhance character development and to tell the narrative of the game. It was an intelligent design decision that keeps you immersed in the game. This soul jumping mechanic also enables you to read the minds of the characters who you have possessed. In order to take control of a person you must have achieved a spiritual connection with them previously \u2013 a further intelligent decision that makes players realize the depths of the story.\n\nSuperlative writing: What suckered me in most wasn\u2019t actually the soul jumping mechanic even though I compliment it highly. Rather, it was the superlative writing. A lot of titles these days claim to be story driven experiences but few are able to maintain such a clarity of focus and achievement as what Patrick McGrath has. To think that this game was designed by just one person is quite remarkable. There is quite a significant amount of depth to the story and it handles a large number of real world issues inside a single game tackling them all with poise and grace beyond McGrath\u2019s years. Each contributes wonderfully to the story without ever distracting the player from the game. A rare achievement.\n\n16-bit and soundtrack mastery: The screenshots of the game tell you exactly what to expect from a graphical standpoint. It\u2019s your traditional 16-bit game. I never had any issues with the graphics, I never found any bugs and do not have anything to say negatively about them. In fact, I would suggest that McGrath has done a very reasonable job in realizing his game world through the utilization of these graphics. Some may argue that this a simple achievement but I am certain that we have all played 16-bit games that have been riddled with annoyances. You will not find that here. The game\u2019s soundtrack has been composed by Bill Kiley from Eugene, Oregon and who has quickly developed a very good reputation in video games. He is currently working on music for Katana Zero which will certainly be a game to keep an eye open for. Kiley is at his very best throughout the entirety of the soundtrack and I would wholeheartedly recommend that you not only purchase this game but the soundtrack as well. Best of all is that you can name your price (no minimum) for the album. You can purchase it here on Kiley\u2019s bandcamp page.\n\nDifficult to criticize: In my opinion there really isn\u2019t much to critique in regards to Why Am I Dead At Sea. If I had to pinpoint anything at all it\u2019s that I found it very simple to accidentally re-talk to a character. This may lead to you replaying the same dialogue that you\u2019ve read multiple times. Although I find this to be a negative there is also a positive in this for those of you who accidentally skip a line of dialogue \u2013 which may ultimately prove to be essential to understanding the solution of the story. Otherwise this is a truly special game that has been criminally overlooked.\n\nWhy Am I Dead At Sea is one of the most intelligently crafted games that I have experienced to date. The grace in which important social issues are tackled is astounding. It is sincerely a must play title.\n\nFor more reviews similar to this one and our daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/", "timestamp_created": 1453318811, "timestamp_updated": 1453318811, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.579772", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20499610": {"recommendationid": "20499610", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972505014", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 494, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451887268}, "language": "english", "review": "I gave \"Why Am I Dead At Sea\" every opportunity to disappoint me.

Su premisa me pareci\u00f3 intrigate y su est\u00e9tica atractiva, pero me resultaba dificil imaginar como ser\u00eda su jugabilidad a la pr\u00e1ctica. Investigando un poco me top\u00e9 con su predecesor, un juego  gratuito llamado Why Am I Dead. Se trata de una aventura muy sencilla, de apenas media hora de duraci\u00f3n. Me pareci\u00f3 un juego magn\u00edfico, la verdad. Se trataba de un extenso puzzle de di\u00e1logo que consist\u00eda que conseguir que una cadena de personajes se sonsacasen informaci\u00f3n entre s\u00ed. Una vez conocido el limitado plantel del personajes disponibles la soluci\u00f3n al puzzle resultaba muy intutiva y satisfactoria. Realmente funciona muy bien como demo de Why Am I Dead at Sea, recomiendo jugarlo a cualquiera que est\u00e9 indeciso.\n\nEste juego es mucho m\u00e1s largo que su predecesor, adem\u00e1s de ser sustancialmente m\u00e1s complejo a nivel mec\u00e1nico. Cada uno de los personajes dispone de una habilidad especial y es posible leer su mente. Curiosamente estas novedades no tienen a penas utilidad pr\u00e1ctica a nivel jugable y su principal raz\u00f3n de ser es enriquecer la ambientaci\u00f3n. Tambi\u00e9n disponemos de la habilidad de poseer completamente a un personaje, teniendo as\u00ed acceso a un set adicional opciones de di\u00e1logo (aunque un porcentaje importante de \u00e9stas se repite independientemente del personaje poseido). Es muy de agradecer que cuando existen todav\u00eda l\u00edneas de di\u00e1logo sin explorar entre el presonaje actualmente poseido y otro cualquiera \u00e9ste aparezca marcado con un bocadillo.\n\nLa personalidad de los personajes est\u00e1 bien definda y son definitivamente el coraz\u00f3n de este juego. El desarrollo del juego est\u00e1 planteado de tal manera que casi todo avance est\u00e1 vinculado al descubrimiento de nuevos detalles sobre las motivaciones y problemas de cada uno de ellos. La narrativa y la jugabilidad est\u00e1n perfectamente integradas.\n\nEl apartado art\u00edstico es simple pero agradable. Los escenarios son bastante minimalistas, pero nunca llegan a parecer desolados. Los sprites tienen personalidad y est\u00e1n bien animados, aunque en alg\u00fan momento se hecha en falta algo de expresividad. La m\u00fasica es variada y pegadiza, aunque en alguna ocasi\u00f3n desentona un poco con la situaci\u00f3n (debido a que se adapta al personaje poseido). Los di\u00e1logos de los personajes est\u00e1n sonorizados con distintas clases de pitidos a modo de voces. Personalmente me parece una decisi\u00f3n bastante acertada, ayuda mucho a dar ambiente.\n\nEl juego tiene una serie de bugs que pueden llegar a ser algo molestos. En mi caso uno de los personajes se qued\u00f3 atrapado en una escalera cerca del final del juego y tuve que reiniciar la partida. Otros fallos menores incluyen opciones de di\u00e1logo que no concuerdan con el contexto, congelaciones temporales del scroll y otras cosas bastante random.\n\nSi buscais una aventura sencilla y bien narrada, dadle una oportunidad a Why Am I Dead at Sea. Si teneis dudas jugad primero a Why Am I Dead (que adem\u00e1s de ser gratuito en mi opini\u00f3n es aun m\u00e1s redondo).

Before I start let's state the obvious. [b] Why am I dead at Sea [/b] is less of a classical game and heavily story focused. But it is a story supported nearly perfectly by its gameplay mechanics. Most time you will read text. If I had to label the game I would probably call it an adventure. Not the ones where you search and combine items but where you acquire and combine information. It is a story about people on a ship.\n\nThe game starts rather unpleasant for the protagonist. He is dead, he doesn't know who he is and he can't remember anything else as well. Why? Most of those questions will be answered over the course of the game. As a ghost you have different abilities, some which you will gain only later on. At the beginning you can read the mind of the people on board. Not word for word but as an overall impression. Later, with learning more about the people on board you will be able to control them, first partially and some completely. This is interesting as a gameplay element because as player you know more than the people you control and you can't ask the right questions because your current character doesn't know what you need. But if you control them completely those characters gain this knowledge for the time. There is for example a brilliant scene where you look up a \"locked\" place with one of the characters and then confront the same character with another one although he could actually never obtain this information. You also have to regard the relation between the different characters because they are not willing to tell/ask everyone everything. And with the game going on you will learn more and more about the tragic to happen and the people on board.\n\nThe game is divided in different chapters. To complete each chapter there is a certain amount of information needed to be found. But there can be found more than that (especially in the last chapter) which may lead to a different ending.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by [b] Why am I dead at Sea [/b] and as such it is the first game I recommand which I have not completed to 100 % at the point of recommandation. I wouldn't call it actually \"fun\" to play but interesting. It is not the most epic story ever but is surprising at points and the way the gameplay is used to unfold the story is intriguing.

This game has so much development and so many curveballs to through.  This games gameplay is everything that is presented in the games trailer, but if you don't know I'll explain.  You play as the ghost of an unkown person who was on a ship so, as said ghost, you get to possess people and use them to interact with other characters, and learn more about their past, find out their purpose on the boat, and gather evadants to find out who killed you.  The controls are perfect and very simple, which is good because what more do you need to do than interact, and possess.  The EARTHBOUND style graphics really make this game feel special for some reason, and every character is presented well through there sprites.\n\nThis games feature's and game mode's are standard.  There is the very enriching and indepth tale that is filled to absolute brim with fun and sad character arks, and lots of moments to pull at your heart strings.  I won't spoil to, to much, but this where I talk about the story, so stop if you wanna keep everything a surprise.  SO.  The characters will never be what they seem like and always are very much the opposite of what you will first perseve them as.  Every chapter is going to shock you, and people are going to die in the story and it will always surpise you who.  Finally the game has a few nods to the original flash game which is kinda cool.\n\nThis is probably one of the best story telling games that I have ever played, and It held my attention to the very end.\nSo I think with what this game offers, I give it a rating of 10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1450483223, "timestamp_updated": 1450483223, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525381", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19350722": {"recommendationid": "19350722", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081431023", "num_games_owned": 206, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1035, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453077500}, "language": "english", "review": "everyone keeps referencing this game as similar to earthbound, which i totally get graphically (and through a few textual nods which were fun to catch) but for me this game is such an awesomely fun throwback to maniac mansion, one of my favorite games ever.\n\nvery fun to explore eloquently fleshed out characters that you feel both empathy and suspicion towards basically the entire time and a storyline with so many twists and turns i basically devoured the game until i finished it (once; going back for another round shortly).\n\nhonestly cannot wait for a new development from peltast.", "timestamp_created": 1448759604, "timestamp_updated": 1448759604, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19224766": {"recommendationid": "19224766", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060922162", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 723, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1447268331}, "language": "swedish", "review": "This is one of the best games I've ever played here on steam.", "timestamp_created": 1448231416, "timestamp_updated": 1448231416, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19129597": {"recommendationid": "19129597", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991117842", "num_games_owned": 1177, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 305, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448504992}, "language": "english", "review": "Why Am I Dead At Sea first caught my eye with its distinctly Mother 3-esque graphical style. It distinguishes itself from that clear lineage by being very much an adventure game, You, the ghost of a murder victim, spend the game inhabiting members of this 'cruise' ship and talking to each other, trying to figure out why you were killed.\n\nThe game is quite well written, with an intriguing story populated with empathisable and very realisitc characters. Aesthetically it's great, with evocative pixel art (espsecially when you dive into someone's mind) and a fantastic soundtrack. WAIDAS uses its limited scope effectively, with the confines of the ship not feeling constrictive.\n\nOccasionally it can be obscure as to how to progress (this was apparently worse before a recent patch) but it's not especially difficult or full of puzzles.

And the most accomplished narrative experiment seen since [i][b]The Stanley Parable[/b][/i]. An unforgettable experience about the necessity of communicating with others to overcome our traumas[/h1]\n\nWe currently live immersed in the most creative an eclectic single period in videogame history thanks to the current indie scene. Not only as a consequence of the creation of new game concepts, but also to the revision of genres of the past adding new innovative elements. It\u2019s amazing to think that only in the JRPG influenced genre using 16 bits aesthetics, we have seen in a year interval 5 of the all-time greatest classics in the form of [i]Lisa[/i], [i]Always Sometimes Monsters[/i], [i]Undertale[/i], [i]Hylics[/i] and [i]Why Am I Dead At Sea[/i]. With each one being a different deviation of the classic structure putting a lot of new ideas to the table. While they maintain some recognizable premises and mechanics to appeal to the players most beloved memories, using the nostalgia as a tool to generate vivid emotions. And most importantly, each of these 5 masterpieces can equal and even surpass the original referenced titles. If we look at the past, we can see that not even in the most creative and fertile period for JRGP games in the mid-90s, we could find a single year with such a sum of instant classics.\n\nBut between all these masterpieces, [i]Lisa[/i], [i]Undertale[/i], [i]Hylics[/i] and [i]Always Sometimes Monsters[/i], I think that [i]Why Am I Dead At Sea[/i] is a leap forward from the rest. Because it is not only a brilliant and almost perfect JRPG influenced classic with a plethora of charisma in which every second is an immense pleasure, full of magic and unforgettable moments. It\u2019s also a great achievement in its use of an interactive narrative element to create strong emotional ties between characters. With each one being infused with his own and complex psychological behavior. That can evolve based in the affective interactions created with other persons as part of life.\n\nAnd with one of the most mature writings seen in a videogame. Introducing a lot of complex subjects like suicidal motivations, illness, unrequited love, consumerism, third world poverty, psychological reasoning beneath violence, youthful frustrated dreams, lack of communication, isolation, false appearances and the existence of two personalities living inside every single person, the one that he shows to the rest of the world and how he perceives himself. And all of this without forgetting its videogame nature, emphasizing the fun factor with the use of fantastical elements and a lot of winks destined to drawing a joyful smile in our faces.\n\nIts playable mechanic is based on the idea of being the floating spirit of a dead person that needs to reconstruct his memories. So he/she needs to posses the body of the rest of characters in the game to gathering information. This idea on paper looks simple, but has an infinite number of variations and complex sub-mechanics. There is two types of possessions. With one of them, we incarnate the role of the other person, seeing the world from his eyes perspective. And with the second possession, we supplant his body, acting based on our own conscience that is molded by the clues found in the form of saved memories. And finally, we have a mental skill that permits us to trespass the subconscious of a character without taking his body. This mental plane is expressed in the form of a psychedelic alternate reality.\n\nBased in the person or role that we incarnate, every single character in the game will react in a different manner and the subjects of conversation will change. Also, each possessed character has his own special ability. While we incarnate the role of a female writer, we can push a button during a conversation to analyze the psychological motivations of the other character. With a thief, we can see the objects that the other character carries in his pockets. And the special ability of a depressive person is to ingest antidepressant pills, seeing a distorted reality for some seconds.\n\nIn order to be able to possess another person, we need to previously reach a spiritual connection with him.

Story driven games like To the Moon and Last Word are classic examples of narrative over action. You don't need flashy graphics and explosions to make a good game. Dead At Sea captures this in natural style with its supernatural themes. From the moment you begin to play, your immediately entranced. You are given the powers of possession and to read minds and set loose aboard a vessel with a unique ensemble of characters. Someone aboard the vessel is your murderer. Can you find out who? Through conversation, puzzles, and a little bit of trickery. You will guide your ghastly visage in a tale that takes many twists and turns. With multiple endings adding even more layers of complexity to the story. Graphically the game is akin to a darker Earthbound style of avatars. It feels like an RPGMaker style game but is different and unique enough that I appreciate. The music is used quite effectively as the tone of the game shifts. As you possess different characters, enter different rooms, or read minds. I liked this quite a bit. The music gave personality to each of the characters and scenes. \nIn all it was very difficult to find anything really wrong with the game. It's bug free and plays well. The only problem I found was that the momentum of the game was hard to maintain. With little direction given to the player as to what to do next. The goals were sometimes obscure and confusing. Only being made clear by constantly running back to your guide. This caused the game to drag a bit. As I constantly kept having to find the target I needed to possess over and over as they move about the ship. This lead to some frustrating moments. Nonetheless Why Am I Dead At Sea is a fantastic story and a example of how to do story driven game.\n\nI made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/KGSbCC5jDzM\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr", "timestamp_created": 1433993029, "timestamp_updated": 1433993029, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549899", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15993299": {"recommendationid": "15993299", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120260420", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 752, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1444973215}, "language": "english", "review": "Very enticing game with a decent level of originality to the concept of \"You're a ghost, possess things\".

Keep that in mind for the review in question.\n\nWhy am I Dead At Sea hits the points it needs to for the genre, as the narrative and interesting characters set a decent backdrop for this murder mystery. Attempting to figure out how you died and taking control of people via possession is a fun mechanic, and there are little touches that really help the game out like characters having their own music, and their own abilities. This does have the old school adventure game logic however: you will get frustrated wondering what is going on and will run around trying to figure out what you missed. And certain bugs can pop up that can halt all progress, which is a problem. But even with that said, it's a great narriative that will help those gamers lookinjgj for a mystery experience. \n\n+:\n[list]\n[*] Great narrative and a good set of writing here. Gives you reasons to get into the plot in question and makes you really want to see what happens next.\n[*] Character variety is strong and keeps the mystery going, even when a character or two is eliminated as a possible suspect. Backstories help connect you to these characters on an emotional level.\n[*] Music is appropriate for every character, and really helps bring their mood and emotional state to life. \n[*] Good visuals, and change of scenery when it happens. It's not a big game, but something has changed (in particular the outside), it works rather well.\n[*] Gets the mystery portion of the game down without reaching to do it. Doesn't force the element, which is critical in a good mystery plot.\n[/list]\n-:\n[list]\n[*] Trial and Error gameplay logic. Keep a notepad with you to write down what you did and didn't do. A couple of tools could have been used to help this in terms of not repeating actions you've done already.\n[*] Some bugs seemingly (this is not CONFIRMED on my side) stop progress entirely. \n[*] Some characters lack of personality change with unveiling of certain items hurts overall connection to characters.\n[*] Wish the mind reading mechanic had a tiny bit more use to it. Was fun, but ultimately didn't do much overall. \n[/list]\n\nFor First Impressions and Gameplay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g27FrJ0yhH8", "timestamp_created": 1431976016, "timestamp_updated":

You can possess characters on the ship once you get to know them a little and then talk to the other passengers on the ship, but you can only answer in ways that character would. Most of the game is spent talking to other characters about what's currently going on in the story and it feels really rewarding when you can take control of someone new. I really liked the cast of characters in the game and I also think the pacing is really good since there's a goal in every chapter and the overall mystery of the murder and the main character and the ship in general is really interesting.\n\nThere are a few other gameplay mechanics outside of possession and you unlock them the further into the game you get. You can take a look into people's minds to see what kind of people they are, and once you fully solve a characters problem you can fully control them and ask questions that the ghost would ask. Each character also has their own ability - some of them are pointless like changing the music but there are some useful ones like looking through doors and seeing what items a character is holding. This also gives each character a bit more personality.\n\nThe graphics remind me of something like Earthbound, especially with the characters, and it looks nice overall. The ship isn't very large so there isn't much to see, but still, it's nice. The soundtrack is also good, there's a new music track depending on what chapter you're on and each character has their own theme when you're controlling them. It's a mixture of chiptune and modern instruments and each track fits the mood well. My only real issue with the game is there are some missable achievements that are annoying, but the game is short enough if you're not talking to everybody so it's not the end of the world.

I don't know if those will be fixed anytime soon, but I highly recommend to learn how to save the game as soon as you start playing. Otherwise, when you encounter your first bug, you will realize that you need to start over because you forgot to save anything, like I did... There are no automatic saves, so save often! There are 3 savepoints, one on each floor, the first one you find being the Teddy bear in the room where you start the game.\n\nDespite the bugs, the captivating storyplot will get you hooked on the game. There are also 5 possible endings to uncover giving some replayability to the game.\n\nIn all, a very good game despite very simple looking graphics, but given the darkness of the plot, I do not recommend at all this game to children.", "timestamp_created": 1518353598, "timestamp_updated": 1518433558, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39988412": {"recommendationid": "39988412", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053472702", "num_games_owned": 426, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 685, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518304798}, "language": "russian", "review": "[i]\u042d\u0442\u043e \u0431\u044b\u043b\u043e \u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043f\u043d\u043e. \u0414\u0430\u0436\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0435 \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f, \u0445\u043e\u0442\u044f \u043e\u0433\u0440\u0435\u0445\u0438 \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c.\n\u041f\u043e \u044d\u043c\u043e\u0446\u0438\u044f\u043c \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 20 \u0440\u0430\u0437 \u043e\u0442\u0431\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u044e \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c.\nP.S. \u0411\u044b\u043b \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0447\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d, \u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0448\u0435\u043b \u0432 \u0421\u0442\u0438\u043c\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0432\u0435\u043b, \u0445\u043e\u0442\u044f \u043d\u0430 rutor\"\u0435 \u043e\u043d \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c.[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1518302781, "timestamp_updated": 1518460599, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531652", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39983466": {"recommendationid": "39983466", "author": {"steamid": "76561198395663777", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3457, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518286761}, "language": "english", "review": "A well written plot that leads to many twists and in depth backstories for each character.

Your primary goal is to dodge obstacles that are either fixed or thrown at you until the end or until you die. This game supports local multiplayer, up to four players, using the keyboard, mouse, and/or controllers. There are 8 gamemodes:\n[list]\n   [*] [b]Voyage[/b] - Easier; play to the end; fixed obstacles, respawning.\n   [*] [b]Expert Voyage[/b] - Harder; play to the end; fixed obstacles, respawning.\n   [*] [b]Endless[/b] - Voyager, but play to beat your best time.\n   [*] [b]Expert Endless[/b] - Expert Voyager, but play to beat your best time.\n   [*] [b]Berserker[/b] - Legit Insane Impossible; beat your best time; fixed obstacles.\n   [*] [b]Looper[/b] - Increasingly difficult; beat your best score; obstacles thrown at you.\n[/list]\n\nThere are Steam Trading Cards and eight achievements associated with the game. The achievements provide a good challenge to obtain.\n\n[b] What I have to say: [/b]\nThe game is fun and addictive. It can take time to learn patterns to the fixed obstacles. When you finally master the Voyage modes, there are the Endless, Looper, and Berserker gamemodes that should help keep providing a challenge to beat your previous scores, or one from the online leaderboard.

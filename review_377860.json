My anxiety is severely reduced while playing this, which is ironic due to it being a bullet hell game. Maybe CAVE is really that good? \n\nThe difficulty level is standard. I personally recommend using a controller with this game and playing it in fullscreen at night, though it is your choice, of course. Please enjoy this game in short, enjoyable bursts whenever you feel the need.", "timestamp_created": 1514601863, "timestamp_updated": 1514601863, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0,

A nivel de gameplay recordemos que estamos ante un juego arcade, as\u00ed que pod\u00e9is esperar que cada partida sea corta, de unos 20-25 minutos dependiendo del modo escogido (\u00a1hay much\u00edsimas opciones para jugar de la manera que nos sea m\u00e1s c\u00f3moda y agradable!). Mientras juguemos estaremos acompa\u00f1ados de una banda sonora bastante din\u00e1mica que le da mucha vida al juego, me encanta el apartado sonoro y tengo 0 quejas con \u00e9l.\n\nLa dificultad es un aspecto que quiero criticar en el buen sentido, porque a pesar de los v\u00eddeos que rulan por \"Yutubi\" donde se muestra la pantalla completamente morada (y el morado es el color de las balas para que destaquen sin problemas respecto cualquier otro elemento visible), tiene dificultades bastante asequibles. Esta versi\u00f3n incluye el modo \"Novice\", donde incluso el modo Ultra es hasta \"asequible\" para una persona humana y medianamente h\u00e1bil.\n\nMi problema viene con el jefe secreto cuando estamos tratando en dificultad Ultra (sin contar el modo Novice previamente mencionado), lo que viene siendo el logro m\u00e1s chungo del juego. Al ser un juego arcade, una de las gracias es imaginarse ser un cr\u00edo delante de una m\u00e1quina recreativa y \u00fanicamente tener una moneda con la que pas\u00e1rselo entero sin que salte el mensaje de \"Introducir moneda para continuar\". La cosa es, su \u00faltimo ataque es tan mortal que \u00fanicamente una persona, despu\u00e9s de 13 a\u00f1os de que saliera por primera vez a la luz Mushihimesama, logr\u00f3 esquivarlo entero sin perder siquiera UNA VIDA. Si usas una bomba o mueres, activar\u00e1 un escudo que impedir\u00e1 que le da\u00f1es y devolver\u00e1 cientos de balas si le intentas disparar.

Although the quantity of bullets can be scary in this game, there are some advantages that have favored me. For instance, the usual velocity of bullets is relatively slow comparing to that in other bullet hell games like Ikaruga or Raiden series, giving me longer reaction time to maneuver; and all the bullets are in the same color(purple), so they are easier to distinguish from enemies themselves and backgrounds. When an enemy perishes in this game, it creates an explosion that cancels bullets around it, unlike that in Ikaruga where the enemy's demise triggers the generation of more bullets instead. The most important thing is, it doesn't have a single one of those spawn-anywhere enemies, especially those that can appears at the bottom of your screen. Because of this, no one is able to backstab you unless you voluntarily go somewhere too close to the top end.\n\n\u5728\u6211\u73a9\u8fc7\u6216\u770b\u522b\u4eba\u73a9\u8fc7\u7684\u5f39\u5e55\u6e38\u620f\u91cc\uff0c\u300a\u866b\u59ec\u300b\u662f\u6211\u6700\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u73a9\u5f97\u6e9c\u7684\u3002\u867d\u7136\u300a\u866b\u59ec\u300b\u91cc\u540c\u5c4f\u5b50\u5f39\u53ef\u80fd\u591a\u5f97\u5413\u4eba\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u5bf9\u6211\u6709\u5229\u7684\u7279\u6027\u4e5f\u4e0d\u5c11\u3002\u6bd4\u5982\u5b83\u91cc\u9762\u7684\u5b50\u5f39\u901f\u5ea6\u76f8\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8f83\u6162\uff08\u300a\u6591\u9e20\u300b\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u5feb\uff0c\u300a\u96f7\u7535\u300b\u7cfb\u5217\u7684\u66f4\u5feb\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u8fd8\u5168\u662f\u7d2b\u8272\u7684\uff0c\u73a9\u5bb6\uff08\u6211\uff09\u65e2\u80fd\u5f88\u5bb9\u6613\u5730\u5206\u8fa8\u5f39\u5e55\uff0c\u53c8\u6709\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u957f\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u53bb\u89c4\u5212\u8def\u7ebf\u4e0e\u8eb2\u907f\u3002\u300a\u866b\u59ec\u300b\u91cc\u654c\u673a\u88ab\u6d88\u706d\u65f6\u4f1a\u9020\u6210\u5c0f\u8303\u56f4\u7206\u70b8\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u7206\u70b8\u80fd\u5c06\u5b83\u9644\u8fd1\u4e00\u5b9a\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u7684\u5f39\u5e55\u65e0\u6548\u5316\uff0c\u4e0d\u50cf\u300a\u6591\u9e20\u300b\u91cc\u654c\u673a\u6b7b\u4ea1\u53cd\u800c\u4f1a\u5c04\u51fa\u66f4\u591a\u5b50\u5f39\u3002\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u300a\u866b\u59ec\u300b\u91cc\u6ca1\u6709\u90a3\u4e9b\u4f1a\u5728\u5201\u94bb\u4f4d\u7f6e\u751f\u6210\u7684\u654c\u673a\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u90fd\u6ca1\u6709\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5c4f\u5e55\u5e95\u90e8\u51fa\u51fb\u7684\u90a3\u79cd\u3002\u53ea\u8981\u4f60\u4e0d\u81ea\u5df1\u8dd1\u5230\u8fc7\u4e8e\u9760\u8fd1\u5c4f\u5e55\u4e0a\u7aef\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4f60\u5c31\u4e0d\u7528\u62c5\u5fc3\u88ab\u654c\u4eba\u80cc\u540e\u6345\u5200\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1499932188, "timestamp_updated": 1500855489, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520257", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33408544": {"recommendationid": "33408544", "author": {"steamid": "76561198227703312", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 727, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501445070}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Excelente Juego, muy adictivo, buena jugabilidad, musica y graficos, solo hay un peque\u00f1o error y se traba al ponerlo mediante Steam Link.", "timestamp_created": 1499617720, "timestamp_updated": 1499617720, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33368371": {"recommendationid": "33368371", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084914424", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 176, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509649585}, "language": "german", "review": "Mit Matsuri/1.5 DLC fast so gut wie Futari!

Pretty good though the menus can take a little while to figure out.\n\nThis is another pretty good though fairly odd Japanese schmup game. In this one, some magical girl is apparently trying to keep garden pests out of her huge garden while searching to find her boyfriend at the center of the forest on her property i guess. She eradicates the garden pests by flying through the air on a giant beetle and shooting the garden pests with magical laser beams (the best way really). The game's ending is a bit sad though (her boyfriend dies). Of course I'm probably getting things wrong here and there because I don't speak or read Japanese.\n\nThe technical aspects of this game (controls, graphics, sound, etc.) are all pretty good except for the boring sound and overly frenetic yet still not catchy music. The ground scrolls by quite slowly so there is less excitement or sense of speed than there could have been also. The main menu gives you access to slightly different versions of the game each of which has slightly different options and some different versions of the music (and it is this game-type menu layered over the sub main menu which makes the menu system most confusing).\n\nDepending on what game mode you use, this game can be either fairly easy or extremely difficult, thus dramatically increasing the game's replayability. The weapons you use in any mode have interesting effects also. Particularly, if you fire continuously time slows down but then your character also loses some ability to maneuver well but tapping the fire button quickly results in little loss of firepower or maneuverability but there will be times where you will want the action to slow down a bit.\n\nOverall this game is pretty good but lacks enough gameplay variety and innovation to make it extremely good or even solidly good, even with the 1.5 version add-on DLC. The story is nonsensical and poorly developed (at least in english). The setting is unclear and the game's meaning is uncertain. This is basically just a little arcade style game to play once in a while. It's going to be best if you wait for a big steam sale and get this and some of its add-ons altogether for a fairly low price as it is definitely not worth 20 dollars or more.", "timestamp_created": 1499380748, "timestamp_updated": 1499380748, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33312207": {"recommendationid": "33312207", "author": {"steamid": "76561198399558712", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 719, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507968542}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u753b\u9762\u7cbe\u7f8e\uff0c\u624b\u611f\u6781\u597d\uff0c\u5224\u5b9a\u8d85\u4eb2\u6c11\uff08\u5f88\u591a\u65f6\u5019\u4ee5\u4e3a\u81ea\u5df1\u8981\u649e\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u5374\u795e\u5947\u5730\u94bb\u8fc7\u53bb\u4e86\uff09\n\u96be\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u7531\u4e8e\u6709Novice\uff08\u6c99\u5305\uff09\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u624b\u6b8b\u5982\u6211\u7684\u4e5f\u80fd\u73a9\n\u603b\u4f53\u800c\u8a00\u8fd8\u662f\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\uff08\u987a\u4fbf\u671f\u5f85\u4e00\u6ce2\u866b2\uff09", "timestamp_created": 1499349224, "timestamp_updated": 1499349224, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33304503": {"recommendationid": "33304503", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129818980", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499328763}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u73a9\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u5f88\u7edd\u671b\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5f88\u723d", "timestamp_created": 1499329419, "timestamp_updated": 1499329419, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33235902": {"recommendationid": "33235902", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126689286", "num_games_owned": 282, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 3415, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 432, "last_played": 1514787315}, "language": "koreana", "review": "1.5 \ube0c\uae08\uc774 \ub108\ubb34 \uc774\uc058\ub2e4... \ud6c4\ud0c0\ub9ac\ub3c4 \ub0b4\uc918\uc694 \u3160\u3160", "timestamp_created": 1499182906, "timestamp_updated": 1499182906, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33215379": {"recommendationid": "33215379", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990571159", "num_games_owned": 1214, "num_reviews": 124, "playtime_forever": 667, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513056955}, "language": "english", "review": "The title translates to Bug Princess.

Holy hell, it's not for everyone.\n\nThis is a game whose main draw is slowly learning the game inside-out. If you get into it, you will spend inordinate amounts of time playing small stretches of gameplay over and over again, slowly memorizing each and every bullet pattern, enemy placement, and necessary positioning in order to survive said patterns.\n\nIf you just keep hitting \"Continue\", you'll see everything the game has to offer, with the exception of the true final boss, in less than half an hour.\n\nIf these things sound like turnoffs to you, just click away now, as Mushihimesama won't offer anything to you.\n\nIf you're willing to accept that, then Mushihimesama offers an extremely satisfying ride for fans of the bullet hell genre, and the inclusion of the \"Original\" difficulty mode may just help newer players get into it - though there are a few caveats.\n\nI'm not going to bother with a plot synopsis, as it's pretty irrelevant and easily found elsewhere for the curious. It's a pretty simple premise, anyway, though sadly there are no subtitles for dialogue, and I've yet to find a translation anywhere.\n\nThe mechanics of the game are also fairly simple to pick up and understand. Three weapon types with differing movement speeds and (I believe) damage, each of which fires in a different pattern. Weapon power-ups, after a certain time, shift to a different type of weapon, which you'll gain if you pick them up in this state. You can also gain \"Options\" (little beetles who aid you via lasers) as the game goes on.\n\nIn terms of difficulty, the game's difficulty settings vary quite a bit - Original is a fairly comfortable ride, with quicker bullets but less of them. Maniac has much denser clouds of bullets that move more slowly, while Ultra has both the density and speed of the previous two, and is hideously difficult as a result. Naturally, the true final boss is only accessible on this difficulty - by completing the entire game from start to finish without using a continue.\n\nThough really, I find the levels, while very tough, to be fairly doable. Except level 3, that level can get fucked.\n\nNo, it's the boss battles that tend to give me a run for my money. One reason level 3 is so hard - it's pretty much one long boss fight sans health bar, with a (kind of weirdly easy, at least by this game's standards) standard boss battle at the end. All the bosses play more or less the same - Fill the screen with a crapton of bullets while you do the same, and see who dies first. In general, it's me who dies first.\n\nThen we get into the couple of caveats, and those are primarily related to a couple of bugs that Cave hasn't patched, and likely never will.\n\nAs far as I'm aware, there's a couple of issues with score recordings. I admit I haven't studied this particular issue extensively because I'm more concerned with trying to beat the game on one credit, so check around about that.\n\nThere's also a couple of situations where the game's emulated slowdown (that slowdown is intentional, yes), doesn't happen where it's supposed to, most notably on the first boss.\n\nOh, and the TLB's final attack is straight-up bullshit. You literally have to glitch the game and have a ton of lives in order to have a chance at completing it.\n\nOverall, I'm of the opinion that Mushihimesama isn't half as good as its sequel, Mushihimesama Futari (Black Label edition). That's not to say Mushihimesama is bad, though; it's a great game for fans of bullet hell. It's just that its sequel is much better. That game's not on Steam, though, so we're stuck with Mushihimesama, and there are far worse games of this genre we could be stuck with.", "timestamp_created": 1485404599, "timestamp_updated": 1485404599, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29452723": {"recommendationid": "29452723", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026637457", "num_games_owned": 1030, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 313, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486000441}, "language": "english", "review": "Mushihimesama (Literal Translation: \"Hello Princess\") is a SHooTing Game (commonly abbreviated as \"SHT\"), and although it came out last year, it feels like it came out over 10 years ago.\n\n\n\nIn case it wasn't obvious: That's my joke review. This is a great bullet-hell game, very challenging and very nice graphics and music. There's multiple modes and multiple difficulties, so if you suck, feel free to play on Novice Original (I 1CC'd it on my first try) and keep moving up.\nThe PC Port has nice features, such as tate mode, multiple backdrops, \"extra screens\" which can zoom in on a portion of your screen, so it's easier to see how many bombs or how much points you have.\nHighly recommend for Bullet Hell fans, new and old.\n\n\nIgnore the time I spent: I'll be playing it more, I just really wanted to make the joke review before I forget about it. But there's only 5 levels, a playthrough is roughly 30 minutes, but I think that's perfect length for a game challenging to 1CC\n\n\n\nEdit: Oh I got another joke review. \"This game is full of bugs\"", "timestamp_created": 1485218561, "timestamp_updated": 1485223187, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497738", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29284727": {"recommendationid": "29284727", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157695479", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 370, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486236537}, "language": "english", "review": "I've only played couple of hours but based on my first impressions Mushihimesama is really good. I got into shmups via Touhou and this was only my second non-Touhou danmaku shooter, so take this review with a grain of salt idk lol plz no hate.\n\nThings I liked:\n+visuals: backrounds are interesting and enemies look menacing and pretty cool. I hope you're not afraid of bugs though.\n+music: it's you everyday, nice backround music. Not too memorable maybe (at least in my opinion) but that's not a bad thing; it's there to make the game more enjoyable without distracting you too much.\n+difficulty: the game is challenging, but (mostly) in a fair way.\n+bullet patterns: more straightforward than in Touhou for example, but quite fun. They make you feel great about yourself when you finally get them.\n\nWhat I liked less:\n-bullets are all the same colour: this is a nitpick really, I just prefer colour coded bullets since they help you see the patterns and are visually more appealing. This colouring choise is still fine, since now you can easily separate the bullets from the backround. Like I said, it's a nitpick and more a matter of opinion.\n-ultra mode ending (minor spoiler): I've played only on normal since I'm a scrub, but I've watched others play and ultra mode final Aki's phase is unfairly difficult, forcing you to manipulate edge-screen scroll and to die multiple times. In my opinion you shouldn't be forced to die in a shmup if you play well enough. And I haven't seen anyone NOT die on that last Aki's attack.\n\nTL;DR: it's a quality shmup, but ultra mode can be frustrating (for wrong reasons).", "timestamp_created": 1484519285,

Gameplay is simple shooting and dodging(most gshmups these days introduce additional mechanics). Most people probably know the series for its argueably cheap \"ultra\" difficulty mode, but the other 2 modes are very reasonable. \n\n[list]\n  [*]\"Original\" mode cuts down on the number of bullets immensely compared to the other 2 difficulties, but keeps it from being too easy by increasing their speed. \n  [*]\"Maniac\" mode fills the screen with bullets, but they generally move relatively slowly. This gives you time to react to the situation, and plan a path through the bullets(or use a bomb if you think you won't survive)\n  [*]\"Ultra\" mode is something most people likely won't spend much time with. In the arcades, it was unlocked either by entering a secret code or beating the game without continuing 50-100 times. The difficulty on this mode is brutal, and the last boss is outright unfair. \n  [*]\"Arrange\" mode was made for the non arcade releases. Not gonna go into it too much, as it's more of an \"arrangement\" of existing modes. Difficulty is a bit harder than maniac, and you get to fight a more reasonable version of the last boss of ultra mode. \n[/list]\n\nLevel design is extremely well done. It can be hard to tell the quality of the level design compared to any random bullet hell just by looking at it, but after spending many hours on the game it's easy to tell they put a lot of thought into the game. Third stage is also notable for being very unique among bullet hells. The entire stage has you fighting one giant bug, moving to and destroying various parts of its body. \n\nThe sound is great too, especially the 1.5 OST DLC if you have it.\n\nMy biggest gripes are the graphics and the scoring. The art direction is fantastic sure, but the prerendered graphics don't do it justice. Scoring emphasizes memorization way too much, something the sequel improves on dramatically.

Of course, I haven't gotten to the TLB, but so far so good.\nThe modes are quite diverse, with different feeling in each one. The  Novice mode is a nice addition to newcomers, although it will feel boring after a dive to the Original's Maniac mode, but it it a good place to get your first ever 1 credit clear before moving on to greater challenges.\n\nEven though there are massive amount of bullets and you'll die a lot, it never gets frustrating. It doesn't even feel unfair, because controls are fluid and every mistake is yours alone. No invisible bullet syndrome here. And after a while of dying in the barrage of bullets you'll get better and it's very exhilarating to successfully dodge waves of bullets that might have seemed impossible before. I notice that my vocal cords produce funny sounds under pressure: different grunts and yells and laughs while dodging the impossible.\n\nThe main difference in Mushihimesama and other shmups is the beautiful, fantasy-like setting. Flying around surrounded by the lush greenery and colourful landscapes while butchering thousands of equally colourful and interesting bug creatures is really ...relaxing (?) in way. I think this is where the charm of Mushihimesama is. Most shmups are usually in a military setting or in space, so this is a welcome change of scenery. \n\nThere are cool features like leaderboards for Score Attack mode and the option to watch other peoples replays to get better or uploading your own. There's even a training mode for all modes excluding novice (it doesn't need it anyway) for you to train specific levels with different settings. \n\nFor newcomers to the game or genre, I suggest to try all the different modes of Normal before going to novice. Then laugh while the enemy falls before you before being able to do anything. Then get bored and go back to Normal Maniac to have some adrenaline-induced fun. (insert creepy yet somewhat satisfied but still craving smiley) Watch videos because they teach a lot. And don't get discouraged by inevitable losses or the intimidating barrage of bullets.

Gameplaywise Mushihimesama differs quite much from the most of the (newer indie) releases found on Steam. Therefore Mushihimesama is a very welcome addition to Steam's catalog. Additionally Mushihimesama seems to be best of those releases on Steam.\n\nInstead of shooting enemies, the gameplay comes much to dodging and situation analysis (here I can dodge there, now I can dodge there and shoot that one, now I blank and panic and use bomb). Little by little player's situation analysis skills develop and panic-bombing can be saved later in the game.\n\nThe pace of the game is very high and player needs to be constantly push his/her consentration and sit on the edge of the seat. Mushihimesama kind of reminds me from the good old times (I never actually experienced) when computers had names, joystics were the thing and video games came much to constantly retrying that seemingly infinite (actually 20 min long) game myriad of times, which can be surprisingly fun :)\n\nEdit: For all those Linux gamers let it be to known that Wine needs glsl set to disabled (winetricks glsl=disable). I also have CSMT set on, but not sure if it boosts performance. If glsl isn't set disabled ultra difficulty and arrange mode become unplayable. The game still might suffer from slight fps drops in the most intense parts after disabling glsl but after a short Windows session, I'd suspect most of them occur also while playing on native Windows.

I'd heard stories of CAVE's arcade shmups (especially DoDonPachi, Espgaluda, and Ketsui) for years, but had never actually had the opportunity to play any of them.  Upon seeing Mushihimesama on Steam I was excited, but after watching the trailer I decided to hold off on it.  I'm not sure exactly what it was about the trailer, but it failed to sell me the game.  I'm sure the rumors I heard that it wasn't a very good port didn't help matters either.  Eventually I decided to pick it up anyway, and I'm really glad that I did.  Perhaps you shouldn't always judge a game by its trailer.\n\nAlthough I've never played any of their other games, it's my understanding that Mushihimesama plays similarly to other CAVE games.  Your \u201cship\u201d in this game is actually the main character Reco riding on a golden beetle named Kiniro.  Reco's hitbox is tiny, which is good, because saying, \u201cthere are a lot of bullets to avoid\u201d would be a massive understatement.  CAVE certainly lives up to their reputation.  Depending on the difficulty setting, the enemy bugs will fire an astounding number of bullets, sometimes filling the majority of the screen.\n\nFortunately for beginners, there are quite a few different ways to adjust the difficulty.  The game has three different modes: novice, normal, and arrange.  Novice and normal are further broken down into original, maniac, and ultra.  Arrange doesn't have any additional difficulty options but features a different soundtrack, maximum attack power and options, auto-bombing on hit, and different enemy locations.  In addition to normal modes of play there is also a rather robust training mode where you can practice specific stages.  There really is a difficulty mode here for everyone here.\n\nThere are three different attack modes to choose from when you start the game.  The difference between the three deals with the movement speed of Reco/Kiniro and the spread of your attack (narrow to wide).  All of the attack modes have the ability to perform a concentrated fire attack which heavily slows your speed.  This is particularly useful for precise movement when navigating through bullet dense areas.  There are also two modes for options: trace and formation.  The attack mode and option mode can be changed by collecting the corresponding power up during the game.  In addition to weapons and options, Reco also has screen clearing bombs at her disposal which are very useful for getting out of sticky situations.\n\nAs far as the rumors of Mushihimesama being a bad port, it's difficult for me to judge as I never played the original arcade release.  The game looks and sounds great.  The only issue I experienced was a single crash in almost twenty hours of gameplay.  Perhaps It should be noted that you can stretch the screen so it reaches the top and bottom of your monitor.  I didn't realize this at first and spent some time playing with the default settings.  As far as I can remember all the previous shmups I've played stretch it out by default.\n\nMushihimesama is a lot of fun, and I've ended up spending a lot more time playing it than I thought I would.  It's the sort of game that validates the phrase, \u201cpractice makes perfect.\u201d  You can play casually through the game in about 30 minutes or you can spend countless hours trying to clear each difficulty mode without using a continue.  This is a game that I would definitely recommend.  I hope more CAVE games are brought to Steam in the future.\n\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/25660729-CelerySpin/]Like the review?

For those not familiar with danmakus, I usually define as a type of shmup characterized by gameplay fast, intense and frantic with the enemies \"urinating\" bullets all the time, defying dexterity and motor skills of the player who often have millimetric spaces to dodge the bullets and hit your enemies. Mushihimesama has excellent quality with top gameplay, great music, excellent controls and a particular thing that I find really cool about this game is its thematic involving the natural world and insects, because you control a princess named Reco using as \"craft\" a large golden beetle called Kiniro in the fight against insects, just remember that most often in the shmups the environment is set to futuristic times with high-tech ships, so Mushihimesama has a differential.

On top of that, there's also the Novice modes (enjoyable for newcomers) and the 1.5 DLC (a great thorough rebalancing that changes up the scoring system and adds new enemy placements, as well as the exciting MAX modifier that gives both you and your enemies drastic powerups). At this point, it goes without saying that one of this game's biggest strengths is its wide variety in modes - it really does cater to players of all skill levels.\n\nMushihimesama is aesthetically brilliant, too.

version, available for people on PC for the first time. Mushihimesama sets a standard in terms of modern STGs and cave games in general that we can get a taste for and is absolutely worth your time.\n\n[h1] Gameplay[/h1]\nVertical shooter, you control 1 ship called Reco and you have a choice of 3 different shot types they are :\nM-Power (best all round shot type)\nW-Power (wide shot type for clearing large groups of enemies in stages, low mobility)\nS-Power (powerful concentrated attack good for taking out bosses and single targets, fastest)\nIn game certain enemies drop the icon which gives you the power ups, there is a timer that counts down if you don't collect the power up within the time it switches to a different shot type which could be good if you need it for a specific boss enemy,or you are looking to clear specific enemies meaning it helps you plan more strategic.\nThere are 3 bombs given to you at the start but not like the classic screen clear bombs you get given a bomb that affects a certain area, you are still invincible during its active frames but you have to aim where you want it to go.It is also used in advanced techniques such as misdirection allowing you to have a better chance of surviving challenging patterns.\nYou start with 2 lives, and the first 1-up is available with a score of 10000000, there are a total of 5 stages and every stage has a mini boss and under certain conditions during the 5th stage you can get the true last boss.\n\n[h1] Scoring [/h1]\nDuring original mode the scoring mechanics are quite simple and to get good scoring you have to master surviving to gain the 1cc. Basically to get good scores you need to achieve NMNB (No miss No Bomb) The enemies drop gems and there are small and large diamond gems, small gems are worth 100 points, large ones 1000 which are dropped by airborne enemies. There are also gems for grounded enemies with small grounded gems worth 825 points and 2000points respectively.\nThe number of gems collected during the current life on the current stage with a bonus from no missing is added together as a score bonus at the end of each stage, and at the end of the final stage the number of lives remaining and bombs are multiplied resulting in the final score.\n\nIn the maniac and ultra mode, there is a counter called the parent counter and it increases when Reco is shooting enemies on the screen with her shot and decreases whenever she is not hitting an enemy, each enemy has their own counter that is similar to the parent counter and decreases if Reco is not shooting at it until it dies, and the higher the mulitiplier the more score you will recieve.You can gain an option powerup, a new counter called the child counter,the child counter will only increase if the options laser is hitting an enemy using her main shot, an advanced technique called counter banking allows you to use the C shot for example, if a player has 4 child counters with a vaulue of 500 each, everytime you counter bank, you will add 2000 to the parent counter causing your multiplier to skyrocket, mastering the technique and keeping track of your score and chaning will allow your parent counter to improve your score dramatically.\n\nOverall Mushihimesama is an amazing game and in HD from its original 2004 arcade release, it looks amazing and worthy of being released on PC in 2015, its challenging with different modes for every skill level and you can spend months and years playing this game.", "timestamp_created": 1458770043, "timestamp_updated": 1458770992, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562021", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21953820": {"recommendationid": "21953820", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124141077", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470260379}, "language": "english", "review": "Great port of this classic shooter game.

Replaying each stage and constantly learning new things and improving your survivability/score is a lot of fun!\n\nAside from Normal mode, this game provides a Novice mode (less/slower enemy bullets) and Arrange mode (different bullet patterns). If you own the DLC, you get access to the V1.5 mode (different enemy placements and bullet patterns). Normal and Novice modes provide 3 difficulty challenges each, with more complicated bullet patterns and scoring systems in higher difficulties.\n\nI find the soundtrack awesome and quite catchy overall. Arrange and V1.5 modes have their own sets of remixed soundtracks, which you can also assign to other modes to keep the background music fresh.\n\nThe game came out with a few bugs but, as of this review, most of them, as far as my experience goes, have been resolved. I also find the more complicated scoring systems, present in higher difficulties or in certain modes, a bit convoluted at first, while the game doesn't do enough to explain them, which will require checking a guide or two.\n\nIf you like bullet hell shoot'em up games, this is is a very well-crafted and gorgeous one. If you don't like them, this might still be worth checking out, but will likely not change your mind.

"language": "english", "review": "While it is great to see Cave release their games on the PC platform, their first release leaves a little bit be desired when it comes to options.\n\nI'll get it out of the way right away, this is a port of the XBOX 360 version and not much was really changed from that port. That means no graphic options and the game is stuck at 1280x720 and the game suffers from some vertical tearing due to lack of V-Sync. Other than that, the controls can be fully rebound on Keyboard an controllers.\n\nNow, the game itself its pretty fun. If you do not know, Mushihimesama is what people would call a ''bullet hell'' due to amount of bullets on the screen at once. You play through 5 stages and face the final (and a secret-final boss if you meet the requirements) and that's it... Or is it?!\nActually, no! Mushihimesama does offer enough content for both beginners and experts of the genre in order to provide them the most out of the game.\n\nFirst of all, you have several modes of play which includes a novice modes for newcomers, the original game with the three main difficulty settings, an arrange mode focused on high scoring and lastly a DLC 1.5 revision of the game which changes the way some of mechanics of the game work out too. If you think you need to practice a stage or a boss, you can always chose your mode (Except novice for some reasons) then play the section you want until you master.\n\nAt its core, the gameplay of Mushihimesama consist of shooting down enemies and bosses while avoiding a big amount of bullets on-screen as mentioned previously. While it may seem overwhelming at first, you'll notice that your player's hitbox is a very small blue dot that appears when doing a ''focused'' attack. The scoring sysem does vary depending on the mode you chose and if you are interested in learning more about it, I suggest looking up scoring guides on steam. They are very helpful and teach you how it all works.\n\nNow do I have some issues with the game other than the poor PC options and screen tearing? Yes, I do.\n\nOne thing the game could do it better label the prompts in the menues and what the button imputs do on the option screen when rebinding them. It took me some time before finding out that the two fire buttons it gives you do different things, since it was never labeled. No instruction manual is provided with the game either as far as I know.\n\nA second problem is the arcade emulation. To a veteran, this is going to sound like a weird complaint because that's usually a good thing if the game is true to the arcade original. The problem with Cave's games is the slowdown when the screen is cluttered. The game constantly speeds down and speeds up when it gets hectic and I've personally never liked that in a game as it usually becomes incredibly distracting and tends to get me killed during the phases due to the controls slowing up and down all the time. I enjoy games that never slow down and I can't get for the life of me why an option to remove them was not added. Some arcade ports (Like the fantastic Gradius Collections on the PSP system) added a way to remove hardware slow down and the overall experience is, in my opinion, better.\n\nThough the game's biggest issue is hat it has to save CONSTANTLY.\nHere's how often it does it; It saves when you chose a game mode. It saves when you quit training mode to get back into the training settings. It saves when you change the options (fair enough). It saves when the game is over. It saves when you go back to the main menu.\nIt gets irritating really quickly because you just want to get back to the previous menu without interuptions, and those 5 seconds it takes to save  every single time you do something adds up. I don't have any other games that saves as often as this one and it again shows this is a rather poor PC port in terms of technical fidelity.\n\nOverall, is Mushihimesama worth its asking price. Personally, I think 20$ is a bit much considering there are cheaper offerings that are as good as this game and I find releasing the V1.5 mode as DLC on day 1 to be of poor taste considering this game is old, very old in fact. If it was 20$ for the whole package (including the soundtrack) this would be an absolute positive recommendation from me. As of now, I can recommend this game to people who don't mind the retail price and would like to either get into the genre or for veterans who never played this game. It's a pretty fun game.\nOr you can always wait for a sale, but that's up to you.", "timestamp_created": 1452629942, "timestamp_updated": 1453057047, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20475547": {"recommendationid": "20475547", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961121795", "num_games_owned": 1268, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1472, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491596904}, "language": "english", "review": "In awe of the masters @ cave! wonderful and just as punishing as expected.

And they could've not started it with any better title than Mushihimesama! This game is a true shmup classic. I'm also happy, that they started with a port, that I don't already own on 360, as I have European 360 (Mushihimesama was only ported for Japanese 360, but Mushihimesama Futari was also for Euro 360, which I of course own :) ).\n\nI have to admit, that I hesitated buying this port for a while as there were some reviews, that pointed out some glitches etc. BUT it seems, that Degica is a LEGIT port house: they've already fixed bunch of stuff, with many patches, so I finally bought it and man did it deliver (hint: it really did).\n\nMushihimesama has IMO one of the awesomest bullet patterns to dodge, never feeling cheap and the challenge overall is spot on. IMO it's not the prettiest of all Cave shooters, but not ugly by any means and you can always see clearly the bullets you need to dodge. Level design (enemy placement and patterns) is also spot on.\n\nIf you're a shmup fan, you have no excuses to pass on this classic (unless you already own the NTSC-J copy of it for 360, of course... ;) ).

You get to make your way through dense bullet patterns requiring both quick thinking and reflexes in 5 stages.\n\nIn terms of gameplay the game is simple like every SHMUP. You shoot enemies for points while avoiding enemy fire. The difficulty ranges from challenging to exceptionally tough. The enemies and bosses have fun and challenging bullet patterns.\n\nThe graphics are great for a 2D shooter. Sadly the game only supports up to 720p resolution but allows full screen stretching. The screen settings also support 90 degree flipping, for those that want the true arcade experience.\n\nThe soundtrack is great and fits the game's atmosphere. Boss themes got a bit of a dramatic touch in them, stage themes are adventurous or mysterious, depending on where you are.\n\nOverall I love this game. It pretty much outclasses every other similar SHMUP available on Steam, and the only game coming close to it is Crimzon Clover: WORLD IGNITION. If you love getting punished by beautiful bullet patterns, then go buy it. If you're not familiar with the SHMUP genre, avoid the game (for now) as the insane difficulty will make you regret buying it.", "timestamp_created": 1451342103, "timestamp_updated": 1451342103, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19974351": {"recommendationid": "19974351", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110485281", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 81, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472490073}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best shmups ever created, Hope we'll see more CAVE games on Steam, like Espgaluda 1 and 2, Esprade and the DoDonPachi series.", "timestamp_created": 1451164658, "timestamp_updated": 1451164658, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19972271": {"recommendationid": "19972271", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040638108", "num_games_owned": 253, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1180, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492723497}, "language": "english", "review": "I won't write a review for the game itself, you can already find countless of them on steam and over the internet. I'll just review the port. I've waited for some time and observed how things were going before either bashing or praising the port. After 2 months, much has happened, things are more or less settled so I think it's the right moment.\n\nAt release, let's be honest, game was in a clumsy state: crash problems, leaderboards problems, rendering problems and what not. It was far from the Batman disaster hopefully, but it could definitely have been better. Since it was CAVE first PC release, I think it would have been wiser from them to do like SNKP with KoF XIII and let users pre-purchase the game in beta so they could benefit from their feedback and bug reports. Which is more or less what happened here, except it is not what we expected, and thus, not paid for.\n\nBut we can't go back in time so let's look forward instead : since the 6th november (so in less than 2 months when I write this review), they have released no less than 6 patches, most issues have been addressed and they still listen to players for the few issues remaining. They work hard, and fast. They acknowledge their mistakes and do their best to fix them.\n\nI wouldn't have recommended Mushihimesama at its release. Frankly. But now, there's no reason to keep your wallet closed for this game. CAVE devs proved that they are concerned and dedicated to the quality of their ports. They have proved it was more than a mere cash grab.

To some it's the challenge of clearing it with one credit, or learning the excellent scoring systems.\n\nMushi itself has it's main focus on pattern reading. It takes the bullet patterns from Dodonpachi to a new level by letting enemies spawn the weirdest patterns. For the rest, well, go see for yourself.\n\nWhat can I say what hasn't already been said?

Outside of a pedantic, competition-driven few, no one cares about scores the moment a game steps away from the arcade and into their home collection; not a single one. It's a pointless endeavor that severely hampers [i]Mushihimesama[/i] (et al.) at a core level.\n\nIn truth? There is no challenge here. Credits are unlimited; anything beyond a self-imposed 1cc rule offers nothing of real value or satisfaction and for a game rooted so heavily in a gameplay-centric genre, it more or less results in creative suicide.\n\nGranted, this is not a problem exclusively endemic to [i]Mushihimesama[/i] or the rest of CAVE's library; bullet hell as a niche has been guilty of it from the start, a major reason behind my strong preference for the classic array of shmups ([i]Gradius[/i], [i]R-Type[/i], anything by Compile). Still, I've tried to keep an open mind, revisiting the classic titles off and on over the years, but at the end of the day... I just don't understand the overall appeal beyond a very particular mindset. Probably never will, even if I should theoretically love the hell out of this game without question.\n\nFinal verdict: worth it if you're a part of the aforementioned mindset and/or a genre enthusiast.

A pure bullet hell shooter created by the kings of the genre Cave. I thank them for coming on steam because they're one of my favorite companies that makes these types of games. The game itself is fun with 5 stages of pure bullet hell with different modes of gameplay, especially a novice mode for anyone wanting to get into the genre. Visually, the game is beautiful from the enemies to the environment. Another thing is the soundtrack, one of my favorites. I also like the options for display, because there's one screen the entirely focuses on your ship and it really helps out in the later series, especially on the true final boss. While it is good, the only complaint, which is minor, is the slowdown, but this occurs when there are a lot of bullets on the screen, and can be helpful in manuevering  your way through a hail of bullets, however the game runs really smoothly. \n\nI highly recommend this game to hardcore players and new comers if you want to get into the series for the novice mode. It's got everything, great gameplay, excellent graphics, and it's got a cute anime girl, what more can you want. Hehe, but in all seriousness this is good for fans of shmups. As for the company Cave, I hope they bring more of thier titles on Steam. I'm hoping they bring a game from the Dodonpachi serious, either Saidaioujou or Daifukkatsu.

How hard would it be to implement stage resets upon continue, or better yet, boss stage resets?

Reflex based gameplay is the highlight here and your skill as a shump player will absolutely be tested. Having so much bullets on the screen the developers have done something very smart, and only a master of the genre could come up with. Make the character's hitbox smaller than the character model itself. The hit box is only about the size of the character's head. You may say \"but that doesn't make sense, and would only confuse the player\", but the reality is, in a good shmup, the player never looks directly at the character itself. Rather, the player will use his/her peripheral vision to track the character while paying attention to on coming dangers, almost like using a sixth scent. By designing the hitbox this way, it allows the peripheral vision to easily follow the character, while \"feeling\" their way around the bullets. It's simply brilliant and intuitive design on the part of the developers.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksqFN9xVap4\nAside from the hitbox design, the bullets are large, flashy, and purple and clear. There are no other purple elements in the game besides the bullets, which also adds to the excellent visual clarity of the game. The bullet's formations are also unique to Mushihimesama, beautiful at times, and most importantly, challenging and satisfying to bob and weave around.\n\nWhile playing you'll also be be able to collect upgrades and bombs. Upgrades are pretty obvious, as they'll upgrade your offensive capabilities, but bombs are the real strategic element of the game. Not only incredibly powerful, but they'll also whip the screen of any on coming bullets, giving the player a short opportunity to breath, or to escape an unavoidable situation. Use the bombs sparingly and strategically and you'll rack up those point chains in no time\n\nThe game also features great music, audio, and for a 2004 game, it stands the test of time as far as visuals and presentation are concerned. Distinctly Japanese, and it's wonderful.\n\nMushihimesama also features multiple modes to play, from time attack, novice mode, and even arranged mode. Though they all play fairly similar, does offer enough variability for people who are really into the meta of the game to find intriguing and worth exploring.\n\nSo I've said plenty of praise for the game, and in my opinion, it deserves all of it, but what about the negatives? No game is perfect after all. Mushihimesama can be unstable at times. When it was originally launched, many people, including myself reported a crash on load. Luckily that's been patched out (mostly). I still experience crashes when I alt tab sometimes, but, they are very rare. The game also slows down when a lot of stuff is going on, and this is persistent no matter how amazing your PC is. The game can also be repetitive as well, since even with all the different game modes available it is the same content over and over again. You can finish the game first time through in about 20 minutes. Since the game is an arcade port, and in the arcade, the main punishment for failure is more quarters, that element doesn't translate as well when it's on PC. To be fair, Shumps are rarely about completing the game, and are made to be replayed. It's the points that matter when you're talking about the high end, and when you continue, it does reset your score to a degree. In the context of the genre, this is still a reasonable punishment for the player, though even with that said, does lose some of it's punch as a port outside of the arcade.\n\nOverall Mushihimesama is a fantastic shmup and if you're a fan of the genre, I have no hesitation to recommend it. If you are a more casual gamer, who's simply curious to the game, $20 might be perceived as high for a lot of recycled content, but even with that said, that content is about as solid of a shmup can ever hope to achieve. \n\nPros:\n- Brilliant design on the character, the hitbox, and the bullets themselves\n- Satisfying and at time gorgeous bullet patterns\n- A fair amount of side content for the player to explore\n- Hardcore shmup fans should have no problem falling in love with Mushihimesama\n\nCons:\n- A lot of recycled content\n- Can be repetitive for more casual players\n- Some technical limitations\n\nMushihimesama played: 4\nCompletion Status on Mushihimesama: Completed\nThis copy of The Mushihimesama was given by the developer", "timestamp_created": 1448584870, "timestamp_updated": 1448584884, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504222", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19286403": {"recommendationid": "19286403", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995314247", "num_games_owned": 375, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476718817}, "language": "french", "review": "Les shoot them up de CAVE arrive enfin sur PC !

It features 5 entirely different levels, each one set up in a unique and compelling way. These levels can be played on varying difficulty settings with three different \"ship\" types and different modes to add even more variety and depth. \n\nThe beginner friendly novice difficulty, as well as the normal difficulty, is separated into 3 different modes, with unique scoring systems and their own challenges in regards to scoring and staying alive.\n\nDon't let the art style fool you, this not some kiddy/girly game throwing monkey wrenches at you, this is a bullet hell game with all the bells and whistles, frenetic, engaging and satisfying all throughout. Well planned and designed bullet patterns will fill your screen like nobody's business, especially when going for more difficult modes. The encounters are nicely orchestrated and structured. The stages play and feel different every time you approach them in a different way, be it hunting for scores or just trying another \"ship\" type.\n\nReplayable? Definitely... If you are the type of player to sink your teeth into games to improve on scores, routes, or to simply push yourself. If you are simply looking for some fireworks, you can have those in spades, but you might be missing out on some of the fun, challenges and content, for that matter. This game is no fast food at all. The more you practice, the further you will go, the higher your final score will be. This game respects your time and rewards you for your efforts.\n\nSure, the art style is matter of taste, but it is somewhat refreshing to have it this way, because the number of military-styled shmups is legion. The colours are vibrant, there is effort put into details which you might easily miss in the heat of the battle. The soundtrack is moody, catchy and matches the overall visual theme, which is always appreciated. The way it looks and sounds, it works fine, simple as that.\n\nIs it worth the money? This is something you will have to answer for yourself, because my 20 bucks are not your 20 bucks, if you know what I'm saying. Should you like shmups in general it is worth your time and money, should Mushihimesama be on sale at some point, doubly so.

We weren\u2019t able to get the 2nd controller to be recognized \u2026 still trouble shooting. Will let you know when we do, and possibly stream for you guys is the multi-player.\n\nYou can see my full review at http://www.confidentgamers.com/mushihimesama-is-available-now-and-so-is-our-review/", "timestamp_created": 1447288291, "timestamp_updated": 1447288291, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19023401": {"recommendationid": "19023401", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139397932", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4879, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 8, "last_played": 1514209393}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u5f3e\u5e55\u306e\u4e2d\u3067\u306f\u3001\u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u304c\u6df7\u4e71\u3057\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3046\u69d8\u306a\u8907\u96d1\u306a\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3001\u7279\u6b8a\u8981\u7d20\u3068\u3044\u3063\u305f\u3082\u306e\u306f\u7121\u304f\u5f3e\u5e55\u306e\u6700\u3082\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u306a\u90e8\u5206\u304c\u5f37\u8abf\u3055\u308c\u3066\u304a\u308a\u5f3e\u5e55\u3092\u521d\u3081\u3066PLAY\u3059\u308b\u65b9\u306b\u306f\u975e\u5e38\u306b\u308f\u304b\u308a\u3084\u3059\u3044\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u3059\u3000\u307e\u305f\u3001\u96e3\u6613\u5ea6\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u5f3e\u5e55\u7b49\u306e\u5f62\u3001\u901f\u5ea6\u304c\u5927\u304d\u304f\u7570\u306a\u308a\u69d8\u3005\u306a\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u306e\u5f3e\u5e55\u3092\u7d4c\u9a13\u3067\u304d\u3001\u907f\u3051\u65b9\u3082\u899a\u3048\u5f3e\u5e55\u306b\u6163\u308c\u3001\u4ed6\u306e\u5f3e\u5e55\u30bf\u30a4\u30c8\u30eb\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3082\u3059\u3050\u306b\u99b4\u67d3\u3081\u308b\u304b\u3068\u601d\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3001\u7279\u306b\u5f3e\u5e55\u306f\u672a\u7d4c\u9a13\u30fb\u30fb\u3067\u3082\u8208\u5473\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3068\u3044\u3046\u65b9\u306f\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u306a\u8981\u7d20\u304c\u591a\u3044\u6975\u3081\u3066\u308f\u304b\u308a\u3084\u3059\u3044\u3001\u3053\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u304b\u3089\u59cb\u3081\u308b\u4e8b\u3092\u304a\u3059\u3059\u3081\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3000\u305f\u3060\u30a2\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u76f8\u5f53\u3084\u308a\u8fbc\u3093\u3067\u308b\u65b9\u306a\u3089\u308f\u304b\u308b\u3068\u601d\u3044\u307e\u3059\u304c\u51e6\u7406\u843d\u3061\u7b87\u6240\u306e\u958b\u59cb\u3001\u89e3\u9664\u30bf\u30a4\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u304c\u30a2\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c9\u3068\u5fae\u5999\u306b\u7570\u306a\u308b\u6240\u304c\u6240\u3005\u3042\u308a\u300c\u3093\u30fc\u30fc\u3063\u300d\u3068\u601d\u3063\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3046\u304b\u3082\u3057\u308c\u307e\u305b\u3093\u304c\u30d1\u30bf\u30fc\u30f3\u306e\u958b\u62d3\u3001 \u7df4\u7fd2\u3059\u308b\u306e\u306b\u306f\u826f\u3044\u3068\u601d\u3044\u307e\u3059", "timestamp_created": 1447286117, "timestamp_updated": 1512831161, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19021700": {"recommendationid": "19021700", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024945473", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456784206}, "language": "norwegian", "review": "This is a awesome shooter from Cave, a real classic.

The reason why is explained at the end of the game but even then you will be left confused as to what happened and be left feeling like you just walked in to the ending of a movie with no context as to what it was about. Very few people go into a bullet hell expecting a engrossing story though I found it funny to be greeted with what was supposed to be a tear-jerking ending when the game didn't even so much as tell me the main character's name before that scene. It may sound weird to start off a review talking about the ending but this is a very short game and you will \u201cbeat it\u201d in about half an hour or less, regardless of your skill level. This game features unlimited continues so everyone will be able to get through it if they are persistent enough. However the feature allowing you to save a replay of your play-through will cut off at the point you first lost all lives and had to use a continue. \n\nThere are three modes to play here, them being Novice, Normal and Arrange. Novice is exactly what it sounds like and makes the game considerably easier by having less projectiles and simpler bullet curtains compared to Normal mode. This is definitely the mode to start with if you are new or out of practice to the genre. Arrange is a remix of the game that tweaks with certain aspects of the game that I will cover more thoroughly in a bit. Each mode minus Arrange has both score attack in which you compete with your friends and \u201cplay\u201d. While in either mode you will have the option of either picking \u201cOriginal\u201d, \u201cManiac\u201d for higher scores as well as more challenge and finally \u201cUltra\u201d, for when you want to throw your controller/keyboard across the room in utter frustration at the real last boss wiping the floor with you. You will also be able to change the amount of lives you have and at what score you get more. Finally you will be able to pick which one of the three bullet formations you want to have, S-Power for a stream of condensed bullets for heavy damage, W-Power for a screen filling low damage attack and M-Power that is a mix of both. There are quite a bit of options for you to mess around with to say the least. \n\nNow that you are finally in the game and shooting bugs you will notice that this is pretty much what you would expect from a bullet hell. Bombs to clear the screen of projectiles, a counter to keep track of your score and a ton of enemies wanting nothing more than to shoot you out of the air. It does all of this very well and keeps you in a trance like state as you splatter all the bugs and collect all the yellow gems they drop to rake in a high score. Black enemy beetles carry power-ups so you will want to shoot these buggers down. The power-ups are either a small ally beetle that will shoot beams whenever you press the fire button, an upgrade to your projectiles or if you are about to fight a boss, a couple of bombs. A neat thing about the upgrade projectile power-up is that you can let its timer count down and it will change into a different type of shot. So say that you are shooting condensed projectiles but this part of the level is filled with a ton of enemies, simply wait for the power-up to change into a wide-shot formation and you will now have a much more suitable, screen filling projectile attack. This is a really neat system that makes it beneficial to learning the three projectile types instead of always sticking with what you know. \n\nEnemies in this game are huge and their size does matter as they will fire larger projectiles the bigger they are. That's not to say you shouldn't be cautious of the smaller enemies as well, since they fire tiny projectiles it can be easy for them to shoot you when you are focusing on a gigantic enemy. Remember that you are flying, you will be able to pass over some ground enemies when the amount of projectiles get intense and it seems there is nowhere to go. Projectiles are bright purple and very easy to spot, so if you get hit it will always feel like your fault. All of the five stages have a mid-boss that you will have to face and will leave if you take too much time with them. Bosses are where you will be most tempted to use your bombs as they will shower you with intricate bullet patterns. These moments are when you will most likely experience slowdown that will bring the action down to a crawl. The developers have stated that these are on purpose to give you a chance to react to all that is happening on screen though it would be nice to have an option to toggle the slow down on or off nonetheless. \n\nThat finally brings us to Arrange mode. This is only a mode you'd want to play if you are already familiar with the game, it only has the ultra difficulty meaning the game is at its most brutal and you will have to face the aforementioned real last boss. She is the most shump/bullet hell boss I have ever encountered by far. It is an extremely difficult fight and to top it off she has an absurd amount of health. It will takes longer to whittle down her health and defeat her than it does to play through most of the game. Now with that out of the way onto what makes Arrange mode different from the other two modes. For one you start the game fully powered up and are able to kill the earlier enemies much easier than usual.  You will also have a feature most other games call \u201cauto-bomb\u201d which causes your character to automatically toss a bomb, clearing the screen when you are about to get hit. In this case she will throw all your bombs if you get hit, making your rate of survival much lower so you will not want to rely on that feature over your instinct of when to use them. The final thing that makes this mode much different is the ability to change your form of projectiles on the whim, to any of the three types available. \n\nMusic in this game is a calm and soothing strangely enough. Stranger still is that it somehow fits in with the whole shooting giant bugs theme of the game. That is mostly due to the nice environments that range from flying over the water, across deserts and through giant trees. You will also be able to mix and match the music to play stages with either of the two soundtracks available. If you are playing this game horizontally you will be able to pick from 12 backgrounds to cover the parts of the screen that goes unused. Vertically is how this game was meant to be played, so if you have a monitor that can pivot that would be the ideal way to play this, though you can't go wrong either way. Annoyingly enough you will have to tweak the screen settings and the background in each of the three modes separately. One global setting would have been much preferred instead of having to tweak the game to our liking in all three modes. At the end of the day however, that is a minor complaint that will hopefully be fixed in a patch. This is a blast to play and due to its length won't take up much of your time in your attempts to master the game. Mushihimesama is an excellent bullet hell with plenty of content to keep you coming back and is hopefully the first in many of developer Cave's games to be released on the PC.", "timestamp_created": 1447100479, "timestamp_updated": 1447100529, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.767943", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18975761": {"recommendationid": "18975761", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991701782", "num_games_owned": 525, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 98, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451253427}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good port of cult classic shmup.

It is like a dream come true. The port is very good, with only a few hiccups being reported (none of which i have personally experienced) but the developoers appear to be very active and in fact they have already released a patch to fix several of them. The only caveat is a lack of resolution options. The game is set at 1280x720, same resolution as the Xbox version. I'm positive this will be addressed, but in the meantime you can use the GeDoSaTo utility developed by Durante (the same guy who gave us the wonderful Dark Soul fix). At high definition, the game looks very neat and sharp, like God intended! \n\nAs for the game itself, this is one of Cave's best shooters and it oozes quality from every corner, from the vast array of gaming modes each offering unique bullet patterns to memorize and navigate through, to the complex scoring mechanic, all the way to the great visuals and music. Already clocked 8+ hours and will probably spend countless more trying to master all the various modes. There's even a novice modality for those new to the genre.

What I like about this game is that the movement is fluid, responsive and the tiny hitbox makes it possible to dodge various masses of bullets with ease if you know what are you doing. Music is good and the graphics are beautiful due to their crispness. Also, it offers customization for ex. screen display, background image, input display, detailed score ...\n\nThe only downside I can think of is the music for Arrange mode because it has little resemblance to the original one and i don't like its style. \n\nOtherwise, it's a great game and CAVE and Degica did a good job at bringing it to Steam.

The core game is solid.  There are still a few bugs that need ironing out.  I am hoping that Degica will shift their focus after all their recent releases.  They need to work on polishing and fixing their games.  They did a fantastic job with Crimzon Clover, so I have faith that they will do the same here.  (Yotsubane deserves much of the credit for the Crimzon Clover support, as well.)\n\nHere is some information that I haven't seen widely reported.  I recorded footage from the game with a 120 fps camera, and found that my inputs were responding around the the 13th frame.  This is 6 frames of lag at 60fps.

It's one of the more approachable bullet hell games they've made so it makes sense this would be the first one they bring over to get people interested over the arguably more difficult Dodonpachi Series.  Unlike other bullethell shooters, CAVE games don't rely on rote memorization to do well; They have a nice blend of freeform movement and tight bullet dodging which doesn't feel gimmicky or cheap.  If you're experienced in the genre or have good reflexes then even you can make it far on your first playthrough.\n\n*The controls are as tight as they always were and every death will be your fault (no blaming th controls here :P)\n\n*The game comes with 3 game modes (4 if you get the 1.5 DLC) each with 3 difficulty levels to control exactly how hard you want your experience to be.  You have Novice, Original, Arranged, and 1.5 (aka Matsuri).  Each has their own soundtrack which you can mix and match with other modes in the game in the options.  It's really customizable.  \n\n*The visuals are really crisp and good looking.  It's only in 720p, but it doesn't take away from the art direction and the cleaness of everything presented.  The menu is very slick and easy to navigate.  You won't be entering and exiting a lot of menues to switch modes or play with options for each game.\n\n*The framerate is great at least for me.  It switches between 59-60 fps during gameplay but I've never visually noticed or felt it. The main menu where you select which mode you want to play is 30fps but once you choose a mode it changes to 60.  There is slowdown during the game but IT'S 100% INTENTIONAL.  Cave's games have what's known as \"earned\" slowdown.  The game will LOOK like it's slowing down but if you look at your FPS counter it should still be +/-1 fps from 60 at all times during gameplay.  This is written 2 days after launch of the game but there have been framerate complaints from some people saying the game goes as low as 54fps for them.  I have a pretty basic non-gaming laptop and it runs fine for me.  I suspect it's some graphics card issue or they're running other programs in the background which might cause it to slow down.\n\nAll in all, if you are a veteran or a newbie trying to get into the genre then you can't go wrong with this quality title.", "timestamp_created": 1446940124, "timestamp_updated": 1446968625, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544751", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18941131": {"recommendationid": "18941131", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992758564", "num_games_owned": 388, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1055, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448165064}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the most iconic CAVE STGs out there, and probably the best place to start if you're new to the genre.\n", "timestamp_created": 1446937096, "timestamp_updated": 1446937096, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18940474": {"recommendationid": "18940474", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027812017", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 453, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451178194}, "language": "english", "review": "Cave made a good choice at porting mushihimesama as its first game on steam\nlike the port on 360, the audio and the control are very clear ... atm i got no glitches or bugs.\nbtw the leaderboard is awesome, with no connection problemas i can search for the best records on any moment.", "timestamp_created": 1446934617, "timestamp_updated": 1446934617, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18940382": {"recommendationid": "18940382", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989801201", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449602650}, "language": "english", "review": "A faithful port just like the X360 one.

"Ich bin noch sehr neu in diesem Genre und habe nicht sonderlich viel Erfahrung mit Shmups. Wenn man ein bisschen auf Youtube nach dem Genre sucht st\u00f6\u00dft man eher fr\u00fcher als sp\u00e4ter auf Mushihimesama. Das Spiel gibt es beispielsweise f\u00fcr die Xbox schon seit l\u00e4ngerem, aber da ich keine besitze habe ich mich umso mehr gefreut, dass dieses Spiel endlich auf Steam erh\u00e4ltlich ist. Und nach ein paar wenigen Spielstunden ist mir schon klar warum der Name ziemlich oft f\u00e4llt, wenn man von Shmups liest.\n\nF\u00fcr unerfahrene Spieler wie mich ist der Novice Modus ein sehr netter Einstieg in dieses Genre. Die Steuerung hat man schnell intus und man wird angenehm gefordert. In anderen Shmups hatte ich das Problem kaum einen nennenswerten Fortschritt zu sp\u00fcren, bin schier verzweifelt und habe sie dann schlie\u00dflich erstmal beiseite gelegt. Im Novice Modus von Mushimimesama merke ich jedoch wie ich langsam besser werde. Nach vier Stunden schaffe ich es schon ohne ein Leben zu verlieren in die Mitte der dritten Stage und auch wenn dieser Fortschritt langsam klingen mag f\u00fchlt er sich f\u00fcr mich gut und richtig an. In Normal oder Arrange schaffe ich es ohne Continue noch nicht so weit, aber selbst da bin ich nicht v\u00f6llig verloren. Selbst wenn ich dort in Stage 2 noch aufgeschmissen bin f\u00fchlt sich das Spiel aufregend an und macht sehr viel Spa\u00df. Ich kann es mit meiner wenigen Erfahrung nicht wirklich beurteilen, doch sp\u00e4testens im Modus V1.5(der leider nur kostenpflichtig als DLC erh\u00e4ltlich ist) auf Ultra werden sicher auch Profis schnell an ihre Grenzen kommen.\n\nUnter'm Strich denke ich, dass Mushimimesama wahrscheinlich ein sehr guter Titel f\u00fcr Einsteiger ist, an dem man viel Spa\u00df haben und wachsen kann. Die h\u00fcbsche Grafik und der ganz nette Soundtrack tun ihr \u00fcbriges.\n\nDas einzige derzeit noch gro\u00dfe Manko f\u00fcr mich ist, dass Highscores nicht local gespeichert werden.

"last_played": 1476057380}, "language": "english", "review": "This port is Dark Souls quality. That this is based on the Xbox 360 version is apparent with all the same menus and such. What makes it even more apparent are the little amenities made for the PC and the introduced issues:\n\n-The game is locked to horizontal 720p.\n-This means vertical mode (TATE) must be used in a horizontal resolution.\n-Movement is hard-bound to the arrow keys. (This will be addressed in an upcoming patch)\n-Keybindings are thankfully available, however, half of my keyboard doesn't seem to be recognized.\n-There are crashes upon pressing Start at the title screen, entering/exiting a game mode, and quitting the game. (Pressing Alt+Tab or waiting a few beats before doing the action might help you, but there are some gamers who can't get around these crashes at all. This will be addressed in an upcoming patch too.)\n-I'm not sure if it's just me, but sometimes I find Reco continue moving in a direction a split second after I stopped pressing into that direction.\n-Sometimes, the main menu items disappear upon returning from a game mode.\n\nTo fix some of these issues, particularly the crashes and locked resolution and even frame rate ones, look up GeDoSaTo and set it up.\n\nPast these flaws, the game itself seems to run beautifully. The new HD visuals are more pleasing on the eyes compared to their blurry arcade originals. I can't comment on the accuracy of slowdown compared to the Xbox 360 version or the arcade PCB, but Degica did get members of the shmup community who own either versions to playtest.\n\nIf you're new to shmups, then this game might seem too overpriced for what seems like a quick half-hour affair, but that's ignoring the brilliance of arcade gameplay that truly shines when you aim to complete the game in only one credit (1CC, one credit clear) without any continues. Probably the best analogy for this post-arcade and post-NES age is speedrunning. As you play through the stages over and learn from your mistakes, you start learning the stages and developing all sorts of strategies and techniques to carry you over to the final goal of surviving the entire game. That alone will give you hours upon hours of gameplay. If you enjoy the game and want even more hours of gameplay, then you can kick up the difficulty and this game offers in addition to Original, Maniac and Ultra. Or you can start getting into scoring and aim for the global high scores. Or you can check out the other modes that come with this game.\n\nThe new modes give a great shakeup with Arrange being a full-powered big numbers scoring affair (with autobombs) and 1.5 injecting more excitement into the base game with a stronger shot, more pronounced slowdowns, and an emphasis on point-blanking along with some tweaking to the stages. Personally, 1.5 is a must-have and it really makes this port so grab that too.\n\nWhile Mushihimesama isn't my favorite Cave game, I could see why this would be their first released title. This game (Xbox 360 version) never got a region-free release. It also has an emphasis on styilized slowdowns as if you're dodging in bullet time, which is a nice introduction for newcomers to the bullet hell genre. Another newbie-friendly mechanic is the consistent use of bullet-canceling. Throughout the stages, there are huge enemies that spit out massive bullet patterns and if they are defeated, then all the bullets on the screen disappear into gems, giving you a breather and encouraging you to gather as many bullets as possible. There is also a focus on the basic manuvering skill of going from one side of the screen to another as opposed to the more complex approaches of other Cave games. \n\nThe scoring mechanics are also fairly simple too. Original focuses on doing chip damage, destruction of boss parts, and surviving. Maniac/Ultra are about boosting up the multiplier by controlling your shot rate against certain enemies from certain positions on the screen to milk them for points before destroying them, and then chaining from one enemy to another to maintain the multiplier and prevent it from decreasing. Arrange/1.5 modes introduce point-blanking for gems. On top of all this are other minor mechanics such as the aforementioned bullet-canceling or \"no-missing\" (never dying within a stage for bonus points). Personally, the base game scoring mechanics aren't my cup of tea because the multiplier mechanic is very particular, but I do like point-blanking.\n\nCave is making a huge entry on Steam with this game, and if you buy this game, then you're telling them that there is a future for their shmups, because they are planning to make new ones on Steam beyond ports of their prior titles. \n\nI'm going to end this review with a tip.

Any controller at all will have you playing like a pro in no time. \n\nChallenge [5/5]\nSome of the most difficult Bullet Hell gameplay is yours to challenge in Mushihimesama...If you want to. Novice modes allow for newbies to get in on the fun too. \n\nLength [5/5]\nThere are so many modes available to play even without the DLC Version 1.5 that bullet hell fans are sure to get solid weeks of gameplay out of Mushihimesama. Players will definitely spend a decent amount of time finding the best mode for them. Our picks go to Novice and Arrange. \n\nVisuals[4.75/5] \nMushihimesama has some really cool looking visuals, but they are definitely not as polished at Muhihimesama Futari would later be.  Regardless amazing anmiation and awesome design oozes - sometimes almost literally - from this game. \n\nSound [4/5]\nOne of the better OSTs to come from Cave, Mushihimesama narrowly beats Futari in terms of composition...so it's kind of a shame that the bitrate for many of the tunes here, especially in Version 1.5 make for a very washed out sounding audio presentation. Ouch. \n\nIngenuity [4.25/5]\nThere's no denying that Mushihimesama paved the way for great things in the future. While not as polished as its obviously superior successor, Mushihimesama has features that still make it worth playing regardless.\n\nWATCH THE FULL REVIEW\nhttps://youtu.be/0dbqSmSg71U", "timestamp_created": 1446827249, "timestamp_updated": 1446827411, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.574102", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18911262": {"recommendationid": "18911262", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141165142", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 304, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494885451}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent, incredible, transcendental~!

Mushihimesama screams classic bullet-hell action that'll put your skills to the test. 5 stages with intense bosses along with an arrange version as well as the once limited 1.5 version now optional DLC. This is a title that is extremely welcomed addition into Steams growing library in the genre.\n\n\n[b] Pros: [/b]\n[*]Each of the main modes offer something different for a variety of skill levels\n[*]The 3 power ups offer a slightly different playstyle\n[*]A good variety of enemies. The huge 3D characters looks especially nice in action\n[*]The once limited 1.5 version is available ( although its offered as DLC)\n[*]Along with the catchy tones, theres also a couple of remixed tracks that you can change and mix up for each of the main modes\n[*] The game's novice mode is a welcoming addition for those who may be new to the genre\n[*]Thousands of bullets to dodge!\n\n[b] Cons: [/b]\n[*]Limited resolution at standard HD (720p). Only offers window and full screen.\n[*]Small minor stutters during gameplay\n[*]FPS seems to be set around 55-57\n[*]1.5 Version has some audio quality issues\n[*] Cloud feature isnt fully functional, but could be fixed with a patch\n\n[b] Verdict: [/b] THUMBS UP! I highly reccomend this game for fans of bullet-hell titles that are hungry for a challenge. Aside from a few minor issues ( which has been said that at least some of the immediate issues will be patched), this is a much welcomed title in Steam's library that could open doors for Cave to

Novice mode is super fun (press left on the main screen to access it) if you are not that good at shmups, and with 3 levels of difficulty for every mode, this game has tons of replay value.  You may want to read a scoring guide online (google will find one for you fast) to get the most out of this game, as there is no tutorial or instructions to speak of.  Try playing this with headphones...the soundtrack will blow you away though you may want to buy the soundtrack to listen to separately as it can be hard to focus on the music with so much happening on the screen!  My 2 gripes about this game are that the resolution options are not that great and that there is no explanation of the scoring, power-up items, or story in-game.  I would have at least liked some info to cover what a typical arcade pop might have, which would include what different icons mean and explanation of the shot types.  For the resolution issue, at least you can get the playfield the size you want it by adjusting the zoom, position, and zoom of the x and y axis separately, though it's hard to tell if you are playing on an arcade-accurate size ratio at that point.  Also, this must be done after choosing your mode, so you will need to set this 4 times (3 if you don't buy the DLC...but buy it).  Despite these problems I do not regret buying this game as it really shows why Cave is the master of this genre, I mean I was pretty much addicted after the first minute of playing and cannot wait to

new player on this genre, and you think you can beat this game at maximum difficulty, then...buy this game. What the hell, this game has a novice mode, so you can practice until you're good enough to, at least, beat the first stage of this game.\n\nThe soundtrack is sooooo good. So good that i don't care dying over and over again, i just want to listen the music one more credit. And the 1.5 DLC adds more music. Thanks Cave, my ears are really satisfied.\n\nThe port (because this is a port) is really, really good. Damn, everything in this game is good. Or not? Well, let me see it again....20$? Really? (15$ in week release) I think is worth, but a bit expensive.

It doesn't have a lot of uber PC master race settings like resolutions above 720p, but the gameplay is intact and then some, and it beats the heck out of paying out the butt for the PS2 or 360 versions.\n\nIf you're otherwise wondering if this game is for you... that depends.\n\nIf you want old-school, masochistic, NES era Gradius style challenge, you won't find it here... unless you try for the True Final Boss (hereafter referred to as \"TFB\").  To get to him, you must beat the game on Maniac or Ultra without continuing.  ...Or just play through Arrange mode, which is a special mode with it's own rules, which happen to include giving you access to the TFB.  Everything else in the game however is easily accessible as the game gives you unlimited continues, and as of this review, there's no way to turn them off.  You can not use them, but eh...\n\nBut if that's what you're looking for, get something like Gundemonium Recollection or Jigoku Kisetsukan: Sense of the Seasons instead (the latter of which is free).\n\nWhat you will find here however is still quite an amazingly well designed shooter with gorgeous art, a lovely soundtrack, and tons of replay value, especially if you're competitive (there's online leaderboards in this version), love to focus on personal improvement, want to get all the Steam achievements, and/or actually ARE going for the TFB.\n\nAnd to be fair, the unlimited continues aspect also gives the game a certain flexibility... you can get good at the game at your own pace, or just play it to veg out at your computer without worrying about death, or get a better idea of how all the levels and modes differ without looking at a guide, etc.\n\nI just want to be transparent and helpful about this feature, as it's a bit of a controversial one in shmups that can make or break a game for many people.  Myself included in some cases.  Yes, this game has unlimited continues on all modes and difficulties, and there's no way to disable it.  Whether that's a good or bad thing, I leave up to you.  Both approaches have different things to offer with their own advantages and disadvantages.\n\nOn the merits of the game's overall design however, I do absolutely recommend it.  Just know what you're getting into.  It's a game you'll finish in 45 minutes if you just play through it... or a game that'll take countless hours of your time if you wanna go deeper.", "timestamp_created": 1446811030,

All of my friends know me as a bullet hell fanatic. When my friends told me that Jamestown was awesome, I played through that so much, I almost got burnt out. In fact, I did.\n\nI haven't played \"You know what\" in years and I felt kinda rusty...\n\nAnd then I decided to reinstall Steam because certain other games caught my eye and what did I find when I came home from work today...\n\n....CAAAAAAAAVE.\n\nI don't own any iteration of XBox, nor an iPhone/Pad. I've never known the joys of DoDonpachi or Espgaluda. I've wanted to play a CAVE game SOOOOOO bad for years now, and I've finally gotten the chance.\n\nGoing into the game, I could honestly find little faults. To be fair, its because this laptop is fairly old, so I'm used to playing on lower resolutions to save framerate. Not that it means anything. I know CAVE has intentional framerate slows at points so the game isn't TOO hard when you're staring at an almost filled ellipse of purple death. In either case, if you're familiar with cave, you know the bullet patterns are always fair, no matter how harsh they may seem. Always remember that the bullet size isn't indicative of its own hitbox, and if you learn their hitboxes, you'll get the hang of dodging relatively quickly. Novice is well, novice. There's more breaks in patterns, some stage enemies don't fire at all anymore, etc. Its great for beginners. Standard is exactly what it says. Play Maniac on standard or above for a fun time. (If you're new you might even experience the rare occurance of smashing a keyboard/controller in frustration! But that's part of the learning process.)\n\nIn short, if you've heard of CAVE, buy this game. If you like bullet hell games, buy this game.\n\nNo seriously, buy it. Probably the best $14.99 (soon to be $19.99) you'll have spent in a good long while.

If you're looking for a really easy to play and beat without using continues shmup this probably isn't it since you'll be mostly locked to novice original mode. But unlimited continues are naturally welcome for those who want to try out the difficulties regardless without having to start from the first level again.

Cave on STEAM. Time to dive right on in the Mushihimesama First mode I tried was arranged mode and I jumped right in for some good'ol fashioned score attack. What looks like a punishing barrage of bullets comes out to be very manageable as long as you breathe, don't panic, and pay attention. Nothing in this game is impossible outside of the most ludicrous difficulty. Don't take what I'm saying as the game being easy. It isn't. You'll be praying for some slowdowns to hit left and right in no time. It does help ease those in who are new to the genre and continues to step up the difficulty all the way until the end. The game does give beginners ample tools to help enjoy the game all the way until the end. It's up to the player to get their selves off the training wheels. \n\nThe game offers various difficulties, modes, ships (beetles) for you to heep on to your plate. Each mode offers different speeds, enemy patterns, bullet patterns, and all that other deliciousness to keep you busy for hours on end. Score Attack allows you to take on each mode with locked in game options to compete for highscores against fellow players. I'm already finding this to be my go to mode. For those looking for a more soothing experience you can go to novice mode and crank everything down all the way so you can enjoy artwork and exploding beetles while relaxing to some wonderful tunes that this game has to offer. \n\nThe presentation, art direction, and music for this game is fantastic. The game has beautiful menus with an array of backgrounds with music that will make you glad that you got this game early for that free soundtrack. The backgrounds and enemies make me want to crank the difficulty all the way down so I can take the time to admire the work CAVE put into designing and animating these bugs. On the other spectrum I want to crank the difficulty up so I can appreciate the beautiful bullet spreads that this game throws at you. If only I were good enough to make it to the end to enjoy them all.\n\nCan't wait to get back into this game and sink some hours of my life into it. While I'm in no way close to being decent at shmups, this game makes me feel like I'm somewhat competent. The game does a great job of building player confidence and even when I died I rarely felt like it was because the game was unfair. It helps make me want to get better at memorizing enemy and bullet patterns so I can shoot for a 1CC.", "timestamp_created": 1446795346, "timestamp_updated": 1448959549, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561356", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18903899": {"recommendationid": "18903899", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974175422", "num_games_owned": 591, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 403, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474154818}, "language": "english", "review": "Finally the first CAVE game to arrive on Steam!

When eventually dying they leave behind vegetation that grows around them in a Great Circle of Life style (Living and then dying as a nature tale.) Due to them being poisonous though humans were not all able to survive infact needing to sacrifice every 200 years a 15 year old girl.

Previously, you would have needed to import a Japanese Xbox 360 or convince yourself that the touchscreen controls for the smartphone version felt right to be able to play it...but now you can have the real deal and it is worth the wait.  The game features excellent music, gorgeous sprites and killer Bullet Hell twitch play the way only the masters of the genre, CAVE, can deliver.   It's a challenge but there are \"Novice\" modes included to help beginners get a feel for the game.  The other modes are, to be expected, merciless...the game will steal your lunch money, hand it back to you, pimp smack you and steal it again.  Make no mistake, this is for the hardcore.  That being said, it is remarkably fun and satisfying to play.  It's also somewhat of a small miracle to see it come to the PC.\n\nThe one issue I encountered was a couple crashes when I first changed the settings to allow Full Screen in the options menu.  Apart from that, the game runs silky smooth and it comes with my highest recommendation.

Before you start asking what a \"Dowhatawhat\" is, allow me to explain. Cave is an STG* developer commonly known for their \"bullet-hell\" games. The foundation of STGs is the prevalence of tiny instant-death orbs, so a barrage of them is a truly fearful sight. \n\nIn a way, Mushihimesama was conceived to be an \"Anti-Cave\" shooter. Like a number of STG companies in the mid-90s, Cave was born from the ashes of Toaplan. Before declaring bankruptcy in 1994, Toaplan was a giant in the STG world. Their games were often high-quality, and relied mostly on traditional mechanics and scoring systems. When playing a Toaplan shooter, you weren't concerned about \"medal-chains\", you were struggling to survive. As intimidating as the average danmaku spread is; faster, more focused shots can be just as threatening. In [i]Dodonpachi[/i] you'll easily cut through battalions of tanks, but in [i]Twin Cobra[/i], one tank is usually enough to spell your doom.\n\nReco is just your ordinary princess in an extraordinary world. Atop Kiniro, her trusty beetle, she must face innumerable dangers in order to rescue her homeland from a deadly force. You have an odyssey of your own to undertake, because Cave has put two generations of STGs into one tight package. While you may or may not be a veteran of the genre, you always have to consider the basics. In the age of danmaku, we see plenty of bullets, but all too often, we forget where they came from. For the most part, all we know is that we'll stay alive as long as we continue dodging them.\n\nTo really grasp what makes a 2D shooter work, we have to consider the origins of the bullet, hence \"Original\" mode. In this mode, the bullets are minimal, quick, and very direct. Your first instinct will always be to stay as far away as possible. This means hiding out at the bottom of the screen. A very important aspect of STGs that we tend to ignore, is that enemies are shooting to kill. They aren't spreading bullets all over the screen for their health, they're aiming for you. This is subtle, but if you pay attention in between the waves of projectiles, you'll see cannons turning in your direction, and the eyes of adversity following your movements. Staying far away merely to give yourself the most reaction time, probably isn't the best idea.\n\nThe maneuvers that you perform before the bullets are fired, are just as if not more important, than maneuvers made after bullets appear on-screen. Every enemy in this game has their own attack-pattern. When a stage begins, you might see one or two creatures perform this attack, but by the end of the stage, their numbers increase substantially. These foes will combine their efforts with others (also introduced earlier) to make your life miserable. By memorizing their patterns and locations, you've got an advantage, which is a very rare occurence in the STG world. With this knowledge, you can \"lead\" enemies into firing at where you were, instead of your current position. Eventually this will minimalize those frantic situations where you're trying to dodge everything at once. Don't get me wrong, that's always fun, but not really conducive to survival.\n\nYou also have to consider the psychological aspect. All it takes to die in this game is one bullet, and even Original mode throws out hundreds of thousands. When the situation becomes desparate, you can throw out a bullet-clearing bomb. Bombs in a Cave shooter tend to penalize the player's score, but they also carry more insidious aspects. In short, bombs are a weapon that is used against you. In a genre where life and death are measured in pixels, do you ever really [i]need[/i] to bomb? Even thinking about the \"B\" button on your joystick is drawing focus away from the action. Oft-times, you \"panic-bomb\", which mentally shakes you. Shortly afterwards you're liable to exhaust your stock, and your lives aren't far behind. This is all the more reason to learn enemies, their patterns, and how to lure their fire away.\n\nThat's just the fundamentals. There are still three more modes to test your abilities on. Maniac is about what you'd expect from a Cave shooter. The bullets fly a little slower, but they're far more plentiful, and much more ornate. Still, what you learned in Original will help you here. A lot of enemy-fire can still be led away, and even though every bullet is similarly-shaped and colored, you'll know exactly what is firing from where, so hopefully you can avoid terrible situations. Unlike Original mode, where the bulk of your points comes from remaining lives at the end of the game (if you get that far), Maniac has a complicated scoring system. It involves something called counter-banking and...uh...in the interest of sanity (and character limits), I recommend looking up a guide or watching replays. One of the handy features this game offers is the option to turn on an \"input window\". Basically this shows exactly what joystick movements and button-presses are being made. When you watch a replay off of the online leaderboards, you can get an idea of what the top players are doing to get their hi-scores.\n\nUnfortunately there's only so much that can prepare you for Ultra mode. Just to give an example of just how difficult things get, I'll share my experience with this port. The last time I played Mushihime-sama was nearly a decade ago. When I started this port, I managed to reach the 4th stage on Original and Maniac, on my first attempt. Ultra? I couldn't even get past stage 1. It'll take a herculean amount of effort to figure this nasty mode out. So feel free to give Arrange mode a look. I really like this mode, because getting high scores require that you get close to everything. Point-blanking an enemy in a 2D shooter is a very dangerous idea, but it can also be extremely thrilling. It's especially rewarding, when you discover those hidden safe-spots. Once you get accustomed to point-blanking, the other modes are going to seem a bit easier. You'll find yourself taking risks you never would have before, making subsequent attempts all the more interesting. The only complaint I have about Arrange is that the True Last Boss makes an appearance. In Ultra Mode, he's substantially more difficult than anything else in the game, which is saying a lot. Arrange mode is a little easier than Maniac, but when the TLB shows up, everything goes out of whack.\n\nRegardless, this game is best experienced by spending time with every mode. You might think that you have to be able to master Original before you can move onto Maniac, but what's the that old saying? Rome wasn't 1CCed in a day? Ehh.. What I meant to say is that all these different modes exist for a reason. They're there to teach you about 2D shooters, and experience you gain in one mode can be shared with others. Yes, there are more bullets, and Maniac/Ultra/Arrange have scoring methods to consider, but stage layouts and fundamentals remain the same. There's also Novice and Training modes to help with your practice sessions.\n\nAll in all, Mushihimesama gets my highest recommendation, because it explains so much about how STGs work, without using a single word. The more you play the game, and its various modes, the more details you notice. Your play-style slowly evolves to fit the nature of the genre, and you begin to do things your past self could never even imagine. The gorgeous aesthetics and great soundtrack are icing on the cake. Oh and you'll definitely want to get the v1.5 add-on as well.\n\n*2D shooters, Shmups, etc.\n\n[i]Disclaimer: For the purpose of this review, a key was provided by the publisher.[/i]\n\n[i]If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Original_Curators_Group#curation]Follow Original Curator Group[/url][/i]", "timestamp_created": 1446782468, "timestamp_updated": 1446820122, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 433, "votes_funny": 18, "weighted_vote_score": "0.875322", "comment_count": "11", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18901758": {"recommendationid": "18901758", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000268062", "num_games_owned": 660, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1446791975}, "language": "english", "review": "long awaited, well worth it port", "timestamp_created": 1446782056, "timestamp_updated": 1446782056, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501964", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18901747": {"recommendationid": "18901747", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974549844", "num_games_owned": 716, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455998923}, "language": "english", "review": "Tonight, I will dream of swarms of purple bullets flying at me.

I've had other games from them on my 360, but now I can finally enjoy this game without having to play it on an Apple product on the big screen.\n\nDay one--there are a couple bugs I've noticed.  The option screen from the main game portal got weird on the edges when I finished up a game in Arranged mode, and cycled back to the opening.  Also, I've noticed once or twice that the gameplay will stop for a tenth of a second or so, almost like the game did a small upload.  These things don't stop the fact that Mushihimesama is good.

Their games often feature amazing art direction, unique yet fair mechanics, and lots and lots and LOTS of bullets. CAVE games have always had the unique mix of qualities that appeal to both the hardcore twitch-heavy shooter fan, and the casual amateur player just getting his feet wet in the genre. \n\n In short, I recommend this game to everyone. If you are a SHMUP fan, you don't need me, you probably bought this purely on instinct. If you aren't familiar with this type of game, or are just getting started, I recommend this as well, as it is relatively simple (by CAVE's standards), with a welcoming difficulty curve. Plus, it is just a beautiful game on many levels. \n\nFor the longest time, CAVE's games have been trapped in arcades, or limited console releases in Japan, only.

The game was not ported outside of Japan until 2011, where an iOS port, complete with translations, was released on Apple's App Store. On November 5th, 2015, the game was then ported to Steam worldwide, the first time a game by CAVE was released on Steam.\n\nThe port is very well done, offering a whole bunch of features along with the game. The Novice mode is great for introducing new players to the bullet hell genre, while still being fairly challenging. Visual options, such as windows that display stage score, high score, and closeups of ingame informations are added in for convenience. Controls can be fully and freely remapped, and you can choose between two(tree with the Version 1.5 DLC) different soundtracks to listen to ingame.\n\nOverall this is a great port of a great game, and I feel that anybody who likes bullet hell or shoot 'em up games will enjoy this game greatly.", "timestamp_created": 1446777557, "timestamp_updated": 1446777557, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522683", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18900771": {"recommendationid": "18900771", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091499263", "num_games_owned": 392, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 249, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505312196}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty good port i was surprised it looked as good as it did.

Translated to \"Bug Princess\" in English, it's one of CAVE's better bullet hell games, and probably one of the better known ones in the West, along with DoDonPachi. It doesn't surprise me in the least this is their first game on Steam, they sure love showing it off.\n\nIt's a great example of a CAVE bullet hell game, full of clever, harrowing bullet patterns and the simple CAVE gameplay. Not only are there the standard three game modes found in the original arcade release, this port includes a Novice mode with simpler bullet patterns (great for, well, novices, or losers like me who aren't that good at danmaku), an Arrange mode with different gameplay and music, and the V1.5 DLC includes a further arrangement of the basic gameplay, giving it a pallet swap and a third soundtrack to rock out to as well. \n\nThe HD graphics are gorgeous, doing an wonderful job setting the Japanese fairy tale atmosphere, and the music is similarly excellent. The voice of the main character, Reco, might be a little grating, but it's part of the experience, I think. Not that I much mind it, anyway.\n\nAll three soundtracks (one only available with the V1.5 DLC) can be mixed and matched around the different game modes, which is a nice touch. You can also set the backgrounds during play to cycle on a timer, or manually switch between twelve, which is also nice, though the screen settings don't seem to save between different versions of the game. Meaning, if I mess around with the screen size in Novice mode, it won't show up in V1.5, and I'll have to do it over again. Not sure what that's about.\n\nUnfortunately, the port quality is a bit dodgy. It seems to me they brought over the 360 version pretty much straight to the PC, for better or worse. You're locked into 1024x768 or 1280x720 for your screen resolution, windowed or fullscreen, which isn't...the best for modern computers. Furthermore, the game didn't actually recognize my controller properly, basically making it impossible to navigate the menus, though it wasn't anything x360ce couldn't fix.\n\nI've encountered a few crashes as the game closes, which is probably also why my fullscreen settings don't save between sessions. Hopefully Degica will put out a few patches to smooth out a few of the rough parts, especially if they can add proper screen resolutions to the game.\n\nThere was also a minor SNAFU when the game was released, and I accidentally bought it plus the V1.5 DLC at full price, instead of with the launch discount. Considering I also got the soundtrack somehow, I'll call it even.\n\nIn closing, despite a bit of a shoddy port, Mushihimesama is still very much worth your time if you're a fan of danmaku/bullet hell. CAVE just about invented the genre, and they definitely do it best.

So geht es auch hier darum, sich unz\u00e4hligen Gegnern zu erwehren, die unsere kleine Insektenprinzessin mit noch mehr Kugeln eindecken.\nDie Insektoiden Gegner sind dabei sehr fantasievoll gestaltet, die Umgebungen abwechslungsreich und sch\u00f6n bunt! Mit Mushihimesama erschien 2006 in den japanischen Arcade Hallen eine Legende. Es gilt als eine der schwersten Kugelh\u00f6llen aller Zeiten, selbst erfahrene Shoot'm Up-Spieler stossen hier, vor allem im Ultra-Mode, an ihre Grenzen. \nAllerdings bleibt das Spiel immer fair. In all der bunten Detailf\u00fclle, die f\u00fcr ein Spiel, das einst auf PS2 erschien wirklich einzigartig ist, heben sich die feindlichen Kugeln und das eigene Feuer trotzdem immer sch\u00f6n von dem Untergrund ab. Ich wage zu behaupten, dass das Spiel mit all den Insekten das am sch\u00f6nsten gestaltete Shoot'm Up \u00fcberhaupt ist.\nMushihimesama ist sicher auch f\u00fcr Genre-Einsteiger geeignet - nicht nur, weil es auch einen Anf\u00e4nger-Modus gibt, sondern vor allem auch, weil das Scoring System weit weniger komplex ist als beispielsweise in einem Dodonpachi - im Standart Modus geht es im Prinzip einfach nur darum, m\u00f6glichst viele Gegner \u00fcber den Jordan zu schicken, bevor einen selbst dieses Schicksal ereilt. Somit war es sicher eine gute Entscheidung von Cave und Degica, dieses Spiel als erstes aus dem Cave-Portfolio auf Steam zu ver\u00f6ffentlichen - hoffen wir, dass noch viele folgen.\nDieses Shmup-Juwel war bisher nur Region-Locked f\u00fcr die japanische PS2, sowie in HD f\u00fcr die Xbox360 erh\u00e4ltlich. Freuen wir uns, dass sich Degica anschickt, noch weitere Kultspiele dieses Nischen-Genres auf Steam zu ver\u00f6ffentlichen. Das wird aber nur geschehen, wenn Mushihimesama ein Erfolg wird. Also: Kaufen! Die Ideale M\u00f6glichkeite, dieses Spiel ohne japanische Konsole nachzuholen, bzw. mit dem Danmaku (Bullet-Hell) Genre bekanntschaft zu machen!

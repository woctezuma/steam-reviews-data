It's an audio-visual experience, and while it nails the visual aspect, the audio doesn't feel right. The reason is that it's not anchored in virtual space, as you turn around the audio turns around with you just like when listening to a song on your phone. There is zero spitaial audio used in this demo, and it really breaks the immersion. Especially when there are big audio differences between the two stereo channels, which give a momentary feeling of spatial sound, but as soon as you turn your head you realize the audio isn't part of the scene, it's just glued to your ears. It feels like there's an amazing silent light show, and you happen to be listening to matching music on your headphone.

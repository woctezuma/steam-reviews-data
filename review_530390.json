No really, you literally slide Jason (or whatever killer you want, there's loads of different ones here based on monsters from other movies, most with their own kill moves) around each level, find all the counselors, and kill them, which opens the exit. That is what Slayaway Camp is and yes, it's as amazing as it sounds.\n\nThink the game would get too repetitive? That's when they decide to add a new game mechanic with each \"film\" you go through. Counselor exits in one, cops in another. [spoiler]Later on crazier stuff shows up like death lasers, SWAT units, and pitfalls galore.[/spoiler] Just when you get comfortable with the game, they add another mechanic to keep things fresh. Apparently these devs were also involved with PopCap's awesome Peggle series, which explains the simple yet addicting progression of the whole thing.\n\nIn my experience, it never got too frustrating to the point I wanted it to end either; the balance is just right for the 9 hours or so it took me to reach the end of the final movie. Since the last time I've played it, there have also been quite a few updates, adding new killers and levels, so there's plenty to love here.\n\n[b]Recommendation:[/b] If you like puzzle games quite a bit, particularly stuff like Peggle and some of PopCap's older stuff where genuinely interesting gameplay was placed over artificial difficulty, then Slayaway Camp is practically calling for you to give it a shot.

Some games try to approach the core mechanics in unique ways while others simply try to create a more aesthetic change.  In the case of Slayaway Camp, the latter seems to be the route taken - but not without some interesting design shakeups along the way.  \n\n[h1] Slide to left\u2026 slide to the right\u2026 reverse reverse![/h1]\n\nSlayaway Camp, in a nutshell, is a basic puzzle game that has you sliding your character around to reach a goal.  Each move in a direction takes you as far as possible until encountering an obstacle.  We\u2019ve all seen barebones games like this where your goal is to get to a certain place on a map without going off an open edge in a maze-like structure and usually in a certain number of moves.  Slayaway Camp, however, has multiple goals for you to reach and doesn\u2019t always use a move limit.  The part that makes this game unique is that those \u2018goals\u2019 are frightened campers, and your character just happens to be a generic 80s slasher movie monster.  The visual design here is one that can be moderately entertaining if you were at all a fan of these old movies.  They make a point to have some fun with it in the intros and the blocky designs of the characters along with their often-silly faces makes it a mild affair even with the gore turned up.  They take this design to the max by having you unlocking new killers, new types of kills, and having each set of levels take place within environments that loosely reflect an overall movie narrative.  This all served to keep me interested longer than I would have assumed for a puzzle game that doesn\u2019t tread much new ground.  \n\nThe absurdity of some of your killers actions can range from bland to somewhat hilarious, but it\u2019s very easy to see all of them in short order if you end up repeating some levels.  Then it's easier to skip these little kill cutscenes than watch them repeat.  Slayaway camp definitely has the potential to lose its luster if you\u2019re not already a fan of puzzle games \u2013 which I have historically had mixed feelings on.   The implementation of some of the unlockable items also shows the game\u2019s mobile roots and makes it a little less appealing once you realize that it\u2019s the path they\u2019ve chosen.  \n\n[h1]How many monies is this worth?[/h1]\n\nGetting this game as part of a Humble Bundle full of other great games certainly made owning it a much better value proposition.  The aesthetic is undeniably an amusing package to wrap a simple set of gameplay mechanics in, and improves the longevity of a game that can be bogged down by tougher puzzles.  However, it does seem to be priced a little high on Steam for a game that is nearly a year old and has a ton of DLC available.  If you can get it on a really good sale or in a bundle like I did, it\u2019s definitely worth checking out and can be a lot of fun for fans of both puzzle games and those classic horror flicks, but this isn\u2019t really a must-play for people who aren\u2019t heavily in to at least one of those.\n\nIf you'd like to see more of my reviews, check out my curator page here: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/EndyoGaming#curation", "timestamp_created": 1507880854, "timestamp_updated": 1512816956, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505947", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35684151": {"recommendationid": "35684151", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120712540", "num_games_owned": 193, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 312, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "last_played": 1513923228}, "language": "english", "review": "100% real here, I greatly enjoy my time with this game in the beginning.

The game was on sale for cheap and I didn't even finish reading the description. Probably not the best method of purchasing a game,, but I lucked out.\n\nThis is a puzzle game. Now, I normally don't play puzzle games, so I don't have the biggest library of game knowledge to compare this to, but it reminds me of a cross between Hitman Go and one of those flash games where you try to get the car out of a parking lot, or into a certain spot in a parking lot, etc.,. Each level is a static checkerboard, and pressing in any direction will send your character, the murderer, as far in that direction as he can possibly go. The result is that you have to shift your character around using the level layout in order to reach some harder to get to squares. The game teaches you the mechanics in the beginning tutorial and then gradually ramps up the difficulty as you progress, adding more enviromental factors and different types of NPCs. \n\nIt's a very addictive game in and of itself, but there is a lot of homage to slasher films in here. Aside from the puzzle play trial and error (and don't worry - you can use in-game currency that you collect to unlock hints or answers in case you get stuck), the longevity comes from trying to collect two things: death scenes and different murderers. Fair warning, it takes quite a lot of grinding to collect enough coins to unlock all of these things, and that would be my only gripe with this game: after a few levels, you unlock a coin grinder mini-game. While this is certainly helpful compared to playing through a stage and collected coins, I do feel it doesn't give you enough coins. Each successful scene in the mini-game nets you 10 coins. All killers are 1,000 coins, and the death scenes range from a couple hundred to 2,500. The mini-game becomes difficult by the late teens, meaning even if you are able to score 20, you're only getting 200 coins. It got to the point where I played the final deleted scene of the final movie (campaign) over and over because it routinely nets you nearly 300 coins. \n\nHonestly, though, I think I stuck it out just to get all the steam achievements. That in and of itself is an accomplishment for the game, as I don't normally feel the need to play over and over for these.\n\nOverall, the game is a lot of fun, and if you're a fan of these type of puzzle games, I don't think you can go wrong. At only $9, with my 30 hours put in, that's essentially 30 cents an hour. I've averaged the total length of time a mainstream action title nets me at 12 hours. At $60, that's $5/hr., so do I think you'll get your money's worth with this game? Yes, absolutely. Even if you don't feel the need to grind out unlockables, it'll still come in at a better value if you put even two hours into this game.", "timestamp_created": 1507444417, "timestamp_updated": 1507444417, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.657395", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35554669": {"recommendationid": "35554669", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973052125", "num_games_owned": 2945, "num_reviews": 293, "playtime_forever": 277, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507766808}, "language": "english", "review": "Sliding puzzle game that gets surprisingly complicated.

You play as a whole host of slasher movie inspired killers whose goal is to slay camp counselors in a flurry of cutesy voxel art ultragore. The gameplay itself is very reminiscent of Hitman Go, where the killer must navigate the isometric levels by sliding in a series of logical moves that result in the murder of all victims, but one wrong move could lead to the killers demise or could lead to the level becoming unwinnable. If that happens, and it almost certainly will, a convenient and unlimited rewind a turn option is available, as well as the option to restart the level altogether. The game starts out easy, almost too easy, but as you progress the levels become fiendishly difficult, but always satisfying. New concepts, challenges and stipulations are added to the levels as they go, increasing their complexity and keeping the gameplay fresh. What's great though is that the developer included an option to skip levels or receive tips, which is excellent at preventing the game from becoming too frustrating when you inevitable hit a wall.\n\nThere's tons of great unlockables in the game to keep things interesting, such as new new killers and murder animations. The killers themselves are really fun by being direct homages to iconic movies and slasher tropes in general. I felt really incentivized to complete chapters because I was excited to see what movie the next chapter was gonna be a take on. And on that note, the design direction for the game is really stellar. It does such a great job at playing up the look and feel of 80's slasher movies from the character and level design to the VHS inspired chapter select menus. On top of that, the cute block shaped characters combined with the ultra gory death animations strikes a fantastic dissonance that makes this game stand out, and really highlights that the game doesn't take itself too seriously.\n\nFinally, the pricing for the game is reasonable at just $9.

What's even worse is it's set up like an android game..", "timestamp_created": 1506734613, "timestamp_updated": 1506734766, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.243809", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35221954": {"recommendationid": "35221954", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997801929", "num_games_owned": 1100, "num_reviews": 257, "playtime_forever": 74, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506356644}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Slayaway Camp delivers a solid horror parody in the form of a puzzle game.[/h1]\n\nDisclaimer: I was given my copy from the developer for my Twitch stream. I was not told to review it.  I just felt like it was a great game and I want you all to know I may be a little biased with this review.\n\nWith that out of the way, Slayaway Camp offers a lot of replay value.  It has plenty of unlockables and some frustratingly challenging puzzles as well as tons of humorous content to wade through.  If a puzzle gets too tough to figure out, you often can spend your coins on walkthroughs, though I imagine you could just as easily open a browser and watch someone's playthrough of the game.  Regardless, you can skip levels if they become frustrating, but you won't get all the rewards for completing a movie if you skip scenes.  You'll earn coins every time you complete a scene, so if you have trouble with a scene, you'll easily be able to get the coins for the walkthrough by completing old scenes over again.\n\nThis game is hilarious and offers both a gore-filled experience and a less fun, less gore-filled experience.  You don't have to play it with the blood effects.  I have not tried to play it with gore disabled, though, so I cannot comment on how well it hides or censors the murders.  It's not exactly a game created for kids, mind you.  It's a game about horror movie murderers and the silly but ultimately gory movies they star in.\n\nOverall, it's a great game.  I recommend it to anyone who likes horror movies enough to make fun of them.  If you like puzzles, you'll enjoy it even more.  Slayaway Camp gets a 4/5.  It's not a perfect gem of a game, but it's a lot of fun and very affordable.\n\nYou can play the free (not as good) version on Kongregate: http://www.kongregate.com/games/bluewizardgames/slayaway-camp", "timestamp_created": 1506432968, "timestamp_updated": 1506433574, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490809", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35200785": {"recommendationid": "35200785", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138325043", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 700, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506572067}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty good puzzle game, entertaining as well", "timestamp_created": 1506338631, "timestamp_updated": 1506338631, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.463422", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35065276": {"recommendationid": "35065276", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128612318", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 439, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509151469}, "language": "english", "review": "It's adorable and addictive, love this game so much.", "timestamp_created": 1505830543, "timestamp_updated": 1505830543, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.420252", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34975123": {"recommendationid": "34975123", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132812456", "num_games_owned": 176, "num_reviews": 155, "playtime_forever": 1051, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508901923}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like Hitman Go, this game is great.

In Slayaway Camp you control the killer in a horror movie, trying to both take out all the victims in the level, and then make it to the portal back to hell that opens up once all victims are dead. Slayaway Camp may let you kill campers but they won't let you kill cats and cats can't escape either, so you'll have to stay out of their way. The coin system is Slayaway Camp is very handy when you need help with the puzzles. But, the theme is fun, the puzzles are fun, and those two elements are skilfully combined into one complete package. Slayaway Camp is a killer puzzle game. 9/10\n\n[code][h1]Accidently Reviewed[/h1]\nWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more.

Something about the 80's horror movie vibe and voxel character gore has a lot of charm to it. In a way this is like the Broforce of puzzle games, and by that I mean, being able to play all of these classic villians, monsters, and creatures from your favorite horror films and slasher flicks instead of action movies. The humor of this game is spot on with the cheesiness of 80's slashers, and almost everything is a comedic homage to them or other well known horror movies.\n\nThe core gameplay is actually very simple, being only able to move in four directions, but trying to figure out ways to kill everyone on screen in a crude and bloody fashion, it is very addicting. It can be challenging, but never becomes too frustrating. There are several different death scenes when you kill someone, each character also has there own unique one. Something about watching these box-like characters violently murdering their victims is extremely satisfying, and humorous at times. Levels are grouped together in VHS quality worlds, each spoofing a bad B-rated slasher movie and their atrocious sequels. There's lots of unlockables to purchase with coins you earn after each level, or by playing a really fun minigame. You can buy more death scenes from the shop or more killers through the mystery box. There are a lot of characters to choose from and they seem to keep adding more, I don't think I've even unlocked them all yet. You can also use your hard earned coins to get some useful tips to beat a level if you get stuck.\n\nI also want to point out how good the music is. It fits in so well, and the main theme song is so catchy. I had to buy the deluxe edition just for the soundtrack, and more specifically just for an mp3 of the main theme song. Only con is I wish there were more levels, there are tons already, also harder puzzles once you beat the game, but I just want more to quench my bloodlust.  Maybe we will get another DLC or hopefully a level editor in the future.\n\nIf you love puzzle games and 80's gorefests, then you should get this game. You'll get sucked in with the nostolgia and how well it makes references to all the famous slasher and horror films in the most amusing and quirky ways.

Sometimes a fresh puzzle or a break entirely will be all you need to see a puzzle with fresh eyes and come at it from another angle. \n\nThat all said, we appreciate you checking out the game. If you end up with some crazy high tech cerebellum implant in the year 2021 that transforms you into a hyper-evolved super-genius, making the previously difficult puzzles seem incredibly easy, we would highly encourage you to revisit your review.

It is an homage to slasher flicks of the 80s and early 90s in a puzzle game setting.  You play as a series of killers in different movies tasked with killing victims.  The catch is that you have to move in a direction until you hit a wall, object, or your victim.  If you move left, your character goes until he hits something.  So kill the victims and escape through the portal.  Simple.\n\nBut then the game starts throwing new mechanics into play.  As you progress through each scene/level, you will be introduced to different things.  Scenes which require you to finish within a certain number of turns, scenes that involve holes, mines, cops, and other objects that make your objective more difficult.  \n\nThere are quite a number of levels.  I have gotten through the first 4 movies and still it seems I have much more to get through.  If you get stuck, the game offers you a hint.  For a price, you can get a hint or a step by step walkthrough of the level.  How does this work?  You gain coins after each level, which is used to unlock these kills.\n\nI recommend this game to puzzle fans that enjoy horror flicks, or just want a different type of puzzler.", "timestamp_created": 1496717431, "timestamp_updated": 1496717431, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.709443", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32208475": {"recommendationid": "32208475", "author": {"steamid": "76561198229176968", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 100, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495568471}, "language": "spanish", "review": "lo obtube gratis por apretar una moneda todos los dias :V", "timestamp_created": 1496698217, "timestamp_updated": 1496698217, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32133887": {"recommendationid": "32133887", "author": {"steamid": "76561198185905709", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 909, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503589636}, "language": "german", "review": "Ein super geiles und komplexes puzzle spiel f\u00fcr zwischendurch.

And you can earn lots and lots of different killers. It even will show you the solution to puzzles your stuck on for in-game money. The game engages in constant affectionate slasher movie parody without going so far it looks stupid or like it has a self-loathing complex.\n\nThe Bad: The way you grind coins actually requires reflexes, the hints are not as helpful as they could be. Also, the game's target demographic is very narrow, only people who have watched slasher movies before the era of self-awareness would get all the jokes. The game could use more options, like replacing the cats with dogs or deliberately bad picture and audio for that 'old vhs' feel. Also, its a trifle too counter-intuative at times how to solve some puzzles.\n\nOverall, I give it a 9/10. I want more, but what is there is excellent. Only the lack content and sneaking supsicion the game is just an evil plan to get people who hate puzzle games to play a puzzle game keep me from giving it a perfect score.", "timestamp_created":

Just like any good puzzle game, the game's mechanics start off super simple and get increasingly complex (as traps, stacking and scaring victims, and the authorities get involved) the further along you go making for some pretty serious head scratchers toward the end. \n\nLots of unlockable characters and even more unlockable death sequences (little animated bits that play during/between levels). \n\nEnjoyed the puzzle mechanics and enjoyed the developer's genuine affection for 70s/80s slasher movies. For an under-$10 indie game, it has a ton of content (hundreds of puzzles) but if you want to just do the main \"story\" content, it won't take you more than 8-10 hours. \n\nOnly knocks on the game I would say are the Minecraft-y look which was initially a turnoff for me but that's probably a selling point for some people and there seemed to be too many levels where there was essentially one solution which made it very trial and error.

Sure!\nFan of gory slasher flicks from the 80's? Yeah! (But what does that have to do with anything?)\nWould you like a game that mixed both? Wait..., WHAT!? :O\n\nSlayaway Camp is a sliding puzzle game where you take control of the main hero (come on, everyone knows that the killers in those movies were the true heroes!) in each movie of the \"Slayaway Camp\" series. Each movie is made up by many set pieces (puzzles) where the goal is to slay all victims. It all starts simple enough, but each chapter introduces new mechanics that add quite a bit of challenges the farther you go. Fortunately the game offers the chance to skip troublesome levels, as well as offering some advice or a video showing you how to solve a particular puzzle in exchange of in-game money. (This is great, since it allows players of all skill levels to enjoy the game!)\n\nThe game's graphics are quite unique. Everything looks quite cute, until the blood starts flowing (be sure to check the game options to adjust everything to your liking as well as having a laugh!) The music definitely follows suit with moody and scary tunes, as well as a couple of 80's style hair-band rock tunes. I mean, you even get a horrid hippie-style song as the main theme in one of the game's most memorable puzzles! ;)\n\nControls are simple and easy to use, whether you are playing with a mouse or a gamepad. (Something to take into notice would be the fact that the mouse tends to override a gamepad's input while navegating the game's menus, but on the whole it is not a big deal)\n\nAlthough the game can be played and enjoyed by pretty much anyone, the game is definitely geared to slasher flick fans who will have just as much fun locating all the references. Packed with plenty of content, the game is sure to bring you back for quite a while! :D\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1493751700, "timestamp_updated": 1493751700, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31454676": {"recommendationid": "31454676", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010581690", "num_games_owned": 640, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 359, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499101502}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a puzzle game where you need to kill everyone in the right order to get to the next level.\n\nIf you hurt animals, you get a game over.\n\nNo remorse for human death, but overly compassionate for cute little fluffy animals; pretty realistic if you ask me.", "timestamp_created": 1493524348, "timestamp_updated": 1493524348, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.601682", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31389659": {"recommendationid": "31389659", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148748704", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1820, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505795936}, "language": "english", "review": "funny and fun", "timestamp_created": 1493282469, "timestamp_updated": 1493282469, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31374660": {"recommendationid": "31374660", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970329288", "num_games_owned": 1754, "num_reviews": 966, "playtime_forever": 54, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493210024}, "language": "english", "review": "GTX 1060 Gameplay Video + GIVEAWAY!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayfJZHZo56w\n\nMy Thoughts:\nOMG!

It's a nice little detail that the developers worked out a fitting way to implement mechanics that are in line with the actual theme of the movies. It only makes sense to have a shark scaring people into drowning or to put in portal tiles in a spacey sci-fi flick. The puzzles as such have the right amount of complexity with misleading arrangements and sometimes only one right solution. Because the level areas maintain a manageable size, the puzzles are never overwhelming but tricky. \n\nWhile solving puzzles generally doesn't require external motivations, Slayaway Camp further awards the player with points to spend on a variety of unlockable death animations and random murder costumes.

Instead of sliding to press switches, or change coloured blocks, you're sliding around campgrounds, beaches, hospitals and more as a masked killer on the loose looking for victims.\n\nIf you're a fan of 80's slasher flicks this game will be right up your alley, it does homage to them (especially the Friday the 13th films) very well, down to the cheesy synth-rock ballads and the killer's refusal to hurt animals. Each level pack is given a trailer with increasingly forced puns and justifications for the killer to be killing....a lot like most slasher franchises of the 80's and 90's.\n\nWith each movie (set of levels) a new mechanic is added, such as environmental hazards, the previously mentioned animals, police officers which will arrest you if you enter their range, SWAT which have level-crossing lasers and will fire at will and more. With each new system put in place the levels become more and more strategic, having you need to take absolutely all risks into account before making a move. \n\nSlayway Camp's star feature, in my opinion, are the levels where you're given a very tight amount of moves to kill all your victims and escape in. The game absolutely shines here, you can't mess up even once and it's incredibly satisfying once you figure out the perfect route to complete the level. \n\nThe only negatives I can think of are that the previous mentioned new mechanics are often given very, very easy levels to figure them out in - I understand why this was put in place but it is a little annoying that 2/13 of each level set's levels will be a total cakewalk, even on the later levels. \n\nMy only other 'criticism' of Slayway Camp is that it may be better purchased on mobile devices rather than on Steam as the UI is definitely more suited to a phone or tablet than it is for a desktop, and the design is definitely suited for 'pick up and play' style use, if that's what you're looking for in a game. \n\nIf you want to check it out before buying it you can play a couple of the level packs on Kongregate.", "timestamp_created": 1491933756, "timestamp_updated": 1491933756, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518871", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31081413": {"recommendationid": "31081413", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106342518", "num_games_owned": 847, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 204, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493689030}, "language": "english", "review": "Best game about pure love!", "timestamp_created": 1491929136, "timestamp_updated": 1491929136, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454545", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31073759": {"recommendationid": "31073759", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982079483", "num_games_owned": 846, "num_reviews": 117, "playtime_forever": 329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494702422}, "language": "english", "review": "Slayaway Camp is a game about two things: sliding and gore. It provides a solid and well-balanced gameplay experience, but SC does have a couple annoying things that make it tedious. I also had my fill of this type of puzzle experience after several hours. Other players that stick with the game will find a good number of maps and victims to clear.\n\nSC oozes b-movie horror vibes all over the place. It\u2019s funny if you understand the references and tropes that the game parodies. Did I mention the blood? There\u2019s plenty of bones and blood with all the victim slaying that one does. There are also different kinds of executions available to purchase to keep things fresh on the slaying front. You can play as different killers depending on the movie (set of levels tied by a theme) selected or any that you unlocked. Revisiting the movies to play the deleted scenes levels is recommended since more jokes are found there.\n\nThe blocky aesthetic works pretty well overall except for the close-ups when a cutscene execution is triggered. That\u2019s when the game is at its worst graphically. The models don\u2019t look very good at that distance, but the unique executions are fun to look at for the first few times. They do wear out their welcome after a while, but thankfully, you can skip them with the press of a button. The slow-motion executions that can trigger are a good time that result in an explosion of bits and pieces.\n\nThe gameplay is the strongest part of the whole sliding experience, partially due to the developer deftly handling the pacing of new obstacles and mechanics. The game starts off simple with your character sliding across the tiles without much to stop you. Over time, you\u2019ll encounter pits, water, cats, mines, police officers, S.W.A.T., and more. They all contribute to a fun and challenging experience. I thought the idea with light switches was really neat because of how it changed victim/police behavior. When it comes to the tools available for figuring out the moves to make, you can easily restart the map, rewind, or fast forward your moves.\n\nThere\u2019s also a system in place for buying hints and solutions. You can also skip levels instead if you don\u2019t have the money (there\u2019s an uninteresting mode you can play for gold which is comprised of quick time executions).

This game is cool. Sticking straight to the facts, this is a puzzle game that works through the filter of an 80's B-Horror film series! Each level is a \"Scene\", and when you complete a whole campaign, you unlock a \"Movie\". The movie shows up on a traditional video store shelf, complete with original VHS box art that you can flip around andd read the back of. For all those who grew up in the 80's, or at least were old enough to esperience the \"Classic\" horror movies of that time, THIS, is a really good throwback omajge to that whole genra. Especially now that Wes Craven has passed away, it feels like movies are going to start sucking. But this game allows you to play as \"The Killer\" !!!! Not another helpless victim. It comes along with an awesome sounding metal/rock esc music track, additional unlockable killer characters, unlockable fatalities, and up to at least 12 movies/campaigns!!!! \n\n  The best part about this game for me was the actual gameplay. The puzzle solver in me/ocd freak, enjoys the puzzles. While the kid who was litterally raised on \"DOOM\" just LOVES the killer/gore humor! (Seriously. You can hype it up, or turn it down to suite your needs, or mood). They even have a \"Faces of Death\" movie that allows you to play a mini game to earn extra skull coins. SO if you're getting really frustrated on a particular scene, you can stop, earn some coins, then come back and either get a hint, or unlock a walkthrough of how to beat it. THIS FEATURE IN PARTICULAR, I feel really takes off the stress that can build up durring a lot of puzzle type games, typically in which you are stuck but have no way of figuring out ahow to move on.\n\n  And now, they've added a couple of DLC's, Including \"Santa's slay\" Which includes unlocking, \"Crampus\",  \"Stripe\" from the Gremlins movie, \"Santa Skullface\" and many more. All amplified by soft comforting music straight from the nutcracker sweet, as yu kill oversexed lesbian elves at the shopping mall santa location after hours!!!

The animations are great and every blood splattered blocky death is done with humour and great animation. The puzzles, whilst some simple , some are not so obvious and sometime you kill the last person with a smile on your face thinking you have completed the level, only to find you are now stuck and can\u2019t reach the exit, at which point you can use the rewind feature, that takes you back through your steps one at a time, allowing you to continue from any point in the level, this is animated like an old VHS tape rewinding. The way the puzzles are constructed and the need to position some victims in the level by such mechanics as scaring them in a certain direction, or getting their attention with a ringing phone, ensure that the way the puzzles are solved is in keeping with the theme of the slasher movie genre. \n\nA great game, reasonably priced and fun to play.

Soundtrack is pretty good for that however, It fits well. \n\nThis game has you play as a killer and you can only go in full directions left right up or down. \nPlayers have to kill all the victims and then exit via a portal, at the end of a level you get a bonus kill scene where you can earn some extra money to spend. \n\nMoney can be spent on unique fatality kills or unlock new killers too, you can also use money to get a hint for a puzzle or even get a full sequence on how to complete the puzzle too. Mind you, all of these are expensive so you'll have to pass a lot of puzzles in order to buy them, which keeps you playing. \n\nAs levels progress, new features are added. there will be victims you're not allowed to kill and there will be victims who can actually kill you. You also have traps, hazards and other objects which will alter the puzzle together.\n\nSome puzzles are easy and some will get you quite frustrated. We're all different in how we think and solve puzzles in general so you'll always be challenged in some way and sometimes you'll blitz no problem.\n\nI hope they can introduce some kind of workshop support for this game. I'm up to the NC-17 videos which provide some extremely challenging puzzles and being a colourful game too with its simple graphics, I'd say its a very enjoyable game. \n\n#endorse5natch", "timestamp_created": 1485658513, "timestamp_updated": 1485658513, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29532704": {"recommendationid": "29532704", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967844955", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500276867}, "language": "english", "review": "At first, this game was really repetitive, but later on in the game, as you go through, it starts getting more difficult and more things are given to you to kill people and is very challenging.

The catch is, you can only move in straight lines, so you can't directly walk over to the victims, you have to figure out how to get to them, making this the puzzle game that it is. Each new movie introduces a new mechanic or obstacle that can help or be a pain to get to the victims and kill them. The music is also pretty cool and fits well with the situation, and it's too bad I can't find the OST on YouTube or in the files because I'm a noob when it comes to computers.\n\nMy only real complaint is that sometimes the puzzles are cryptic or too hard, and the next movie or scene they're so easy it's unbelievable. It's probably just me, though, I'm an idiot.\n\nSo is it worth the asking price? In my opinion, yes, it is. It's a fit for anyone who wants a challenging puzzle game and also likes murdering people.

Slayaway Camp takes that idea and applies it to a genre that seems ill-fitting at first: puzzles. But it actually works surprisingly well.\n\nYou play as the various different killers in the Slayaway Camp horror series, starting with a clear homage to Jason, and moving on to different antagonists in films that have increasingly less and less to actually do with summer camp. You slide them around the levels and guide them into their hapless victims, then watch the carnage. Sounds simple enough, but Slayaway Camp doesn't waste time introducing different puzzle elements. Your killer can move in any four directions until they hit a solid wall or victim, and naturally there are many times you need to make careful use of the terrain to get where you need to be. Sometimes even getting to the end of the level is part of the puzzle.\n\nComplicating this is that even if they're stoned idiots, your victims are still smart enough to turn and run away if you move next to them, or kill someone they're adjacent to. Depending on the level, you might need to avoid this happening or exploit it. Early on the game also introduces cops, who will arrest you if you end up in front of them. I don't want to give too much away, as there are two shelves worth of movies and each one adds some new mechanic to worry about. It's very solid gameplay-wise, and there are plenty of 'aha!' moments to be had. The game's also pretty nice about hints, and you can pay a reasonable amount of the game's currency to get a solution to a level you're really stuck on.\n\nSo it's good that the game has substance and isn't just the aesthetic - but the aesthetic is pretty good itself. The normal animation for killing a victim is just the killer sort of jumping on them, but if you like you can use coins to buy special ones that can show up instead. These are exactly the kinds of silly deaths you'd expect from a self-aware slasher movie, and they're all fun to watch. My only complaint with them, and with the game at all really, is that getting the coins to buy them can be difficult. You receive them by beating a simple timing mini-game after each level, or doing a gauntlet of them you can access from the level menu, which goes until you miss. Getting all of them sounds like it could be pretty grindy, even with the cheesy 80s ballad that plays during the latter.\n\nAside from that minor quibble, I quite enjoyed what I've played of Slayaway Camp. It's an oddly addicting game, and I'd definitely recommend it if you're into the slasher genre or just puzzles.

The most obvious of these differences is the way the player character is controlled. In [i] Hitman: Go, [/i] the player moves Agent 47 one tile at a time at their own discretion, whereas in [i] Slayaway Camp, [/i] the killer is controlled like a rook in chess, moving in a single direction until they reach an obstacle or teenager unfortunate to be in their presence. The solutions to the levels are also more concrete than those found in [i] Hitman, [/i] and typically don't offer room for variation in play style. \n\nThe puzzles are well designed and often difficult, especially later in the game. The game introduces new mechanics in each of the subsequent level sets, such as SWAT officers that can only be killed by turning off lights in the level, telephones that can be used to lure away certain targets from their positions and electric fences that can be used to kill teenagers without getting your own hands dirty.   \n\nThe game also allows players to purchase (with in-game money) different killer characters and brutal ways of killing degenerate teenagers.

Much to my surprise, however, there's a very good puzzle game in here under the simple cubist graphics and cheesy-just-to-be-cheesy farcing of the 1970s-80s ultra-campy slasher/splatter movies.  This is actually quite a legit sliding puzzle game and you get a couple hundred of them.  The puzzles get more and more complex as you go along, adding new elements that force you to devise new solutions and plan your moves well in advance.  But despite this, most puzzles are just the right size, not too long or too short.  It's just that instead of something like an elf picking up gems or whatever, it's a psycho killer painting the walls with blood and leaving body parts strewn about the floor.\n\nThe game's levels are called \"movies\", of which there are about 13.  Within each \"movie\",  there are 12-16 \"scenes\" which are the puzzles.  After completing a \"movie\", you unlock it's \"deleted scenes\", which are 5-7 additional and fairly challenging puzzles.  Each \"movie\" stars a different killer and introduces new puzzle features.  Usually the 1st 2 or 3 puzzles are very simple to make sure you understand the mechanics of the new features, but then you really have to start thinking.  Much of the solving process ultimately involves herding victims and arranging movable obstacles into specific places to let you not only kill all the victims but avoid traps and then reach the level's exit, all while avoiding police and not harming innocent animals.\n\nPeriodically, as you kill victims, short cut-scenes play showing a spoof of some classic slasher movie death scene. (you can click to skip these if you want).  A lot of the achievements revolve around unlocking new cut-scenes, which you do by buying them in the store.  You get a few coins for completing a puzzle, with a short, simple \"click-at-the-right-time\" thing to get a few more.  You can then spend these on a selection fo cut-scenes, which are called \"gore packs\".

That sentence alone points to a clear sign of why you should add this game to your library: it's popular as all f*ck. \n\nRight now, according to the store page, [i]Slayaway Camp[/i] is sitting pretty with an overall score of \"Very Positive.\" OK, sure, the game did just release in October, but I hope to see the game community and devs continue to grow, as well as eventually see the day that this game is listed as \"Overwhelmingly Positive.\" That's the kind of game it is.\n\nNow, as Halloween is my favorite holiday, and I was in the midst of my month long rewatching of horror and slasher flicks, you can bet your ass that I bought this game, rather impulsively, within about five seconds of glancing over the store page.

The game isn't too difficult, if you're worried about that, but does ramp up the stakes with things like SWAT cops to avoid, electric fences, and even teleporters. With each new \"movie\", a collection of levels, I got more and more excited to see what new elements would be thrown in to puzzle my way out of.\n\nThe devs were also great and prompt about patching the game and fixing bugs, days and even weeks after the game's release. They also added some fun new content and really seemed to pay attention to what the players had to say. \n\nTL;DR: I need a Skullface plush, and will throw my money at the dev's faces if they make that happen.

Slayaway Camp is a slider puzzle game presented as a love letter to one of the greatest of all movie genres - the 80s Slasher film.  You play as one of a series of psychotic klllers that pay homage to a host of horror icons; mostly from 80s greats like Friday the 13th and Halloween, but with a bit of bleed-over into the 70s and 90s for good measure.  You slide around the environment, avoiding obstacles and slaughtering helpless teenagers until everyone is dead and you can make your way to the exit.  \n\nEach of the 10 scenarios is presented as an 80s-era movie on VHS tape, and consists of a dozen or so \"scenes\", with another 5 or 6 \"deleted scenes\" that are unlocked when you finish the main ones.  The puzzles range in difficulty, with some being actually quite hard, but hints are available if you need them.  Each movie gives you a new iconic killer to play, and more can be unlocked with coins you earn in-game.  You can also unlock a number of execution kills that randomly play through the course of the game.  It's not too difficult to gather enough coins for unlocks, but if you want to speed things along there's a separate mini-game that let's you grind out as much as you want.\n\nI typically can't stand games with these sort of blocky, 8-bit \"retro\" graphics, but there's an exception to every rule and this one's it.  One of Slayaway Camp's greatest features is its sense of humor and tongue-in-cheek approach to the subject matter, and watching all these little teens being slaughtered in shockingly brutal ways ends up being quite hilarious when you see it in all its blocky, pixelated glory.   We get enough [i]realistic[/i] brutality in other games - this game is about [i]charming, fun[/i] brutality, and it succeeds at that brilliantly.  In fact, pretty much everything that Slayaway Camp tries to do, it does exceedingly well.

Slayaway Camp, at it's core, is the tried and true ice-sliding puzzle, where pressing a movement key pushes you as far as you can go in that direction. Your objective is to murder all the people (except the cops) by moving into them, then getting to a designated exit point.\n\nMoving into a person kills them, but leaves you stationary, potentially leaving you in a row or column of the grid you couldn't otherwise access. So, the position of people becomes important. People will also run away from you if you occupy a square adjacent to them, or kill someone who is adjcent to them, and they will run in the opposite direction as far as they can go. So, we get, in addition to the ice sliding puzzle, a block pushing game, but one where the blocks can't directly be pushed! Often the trickiness in the puzzles arises from deftly manipulating the scared people into being in the exact position you want them to be. Although, some of the puzzles have a limited number of moves, so the challenge is in being efficient.\n\nSlayaway Camp's learning curve is quite gentle. Over its hundreds of puzzles, it drips down several new mechanics, and always presents an easy puzzle or two that forces you to explore the implications of the new mechanic. The overall difficulty increases gradually, and it may take 60-90 minutes before a more seasoned puzzle game player begins to feel the challenge. But, rest assured, the puzzles do become challenging, and remain that way for the majority of this surprisingly lengthy game.\n\nWhat's more, they are definitely the good kind of challenging. I rarely found myself wandering aimlessly to see what I could accomplish. My method for solving a new puzzle was to dive in and see what I could accomplish. Then the difficulties of the level would present itself (How can I get to the exit? How do I get that last teenager in the middle of the room? etc). More often than not, by working backwards from these difficulties, I could figure out a blueprint for what I needed to get done, and in what order. It was a fun, intellectual experience, rather than a frustrating experience of headbutting a brick wall until it cracks (although, some of the move-limited puzzles were more like this).\n\nI highly recommend Slayaway Camp. It's extraordinary value, and the developers have clearly crafted it with both love and skill.

Slayaway Camp loves slasher movies.  This throwback to the slasher movies of the 80's absolutely does justice to the genre while simultaneously satirizing it to great appeal.  Instead of being a straight-up \"survive the madman\" horror game, this game spins that around to where you are a cute voxel murderer cheerfully plowing through scores of victims in the most over-the-top ways possible.  The puzzle mechanics, aesthetics, and extra content all blend together to create a unique slasher experience\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\n\nMechanics-wise, this is first an foremost a puzzle game.  You are a killer sliding around a puzzle map, navigating obstacles, avoiding cops, killing generic victims and escaping through your satanic portal (yes, you heard me correctly) to move on to the next puzzle.  Normally this would get old fast, but thankfully the game keeps things fresh by introducing different mechanics throughout the game.  This makes the game more interesting, not to mention vexingly harder, as you progress, especially when different mechanics start being combined to create some of the most difficult puzzles I have every seen.\n\nHowever, the game doesn't explain very well how some of the mechanics work or affect other mechanics, like how lights affect the cops or telephones affect cats.  You will almost always die several times learning how the mechanics work before completing the puzzle.  For those that prefer this type of experiential learning, it won't matter.  But for those of us who prefer not being virtually set up for failure, it's annoying.\n\nI would be remiss if I didn't mention the bonus game at the end of each puzzle.  You get to try and earn an extra kill by timing a button press to land your sliding marker in the \"Kill Zone.\"  It's a neat little distraction, and it earns you coins to spend in the shop.  More on that later.\n\n[b]Aesthetics[/b]\n\nThis game looks and sounds like bits were ripped out of every 80's slasher movie known to man and Frankensteined together.  While primarily based on Friday the 13th, you'll find nods to Jaws, The Ring, H.P. Lovecraft's work, and even Mars Attacks!  All of it brought to life effortlessly through the voxel-style art direction.  Even the menus are made up to look like those VHS video stores where one used to rent slasher movies from.\n\nThe soundtrack's pretty awesome, too.  Sure its got those stereotypical (and very well done) horror underscores, but it even remembers to include the cheesy 80's rock songs that accompany every slasher movie ending credits.\n\nAnd the kills.  Oh my word, the kills.  Every kill imaginable (and previously unimaginable) is shown in glorious over-the-top fashion.  I have never laughed so hard at saxophone slayings or death-by-deep-fried-sugar.\n\n[b]Extra Content[/b]\n\nThere are two different types of unlockable extras - killers and kills.  Killers cost 1000 coins each (from winning those extra-kill mini games) while kills cost between 1000 and 2000 coins.  There is a large variety of kills you can pick from, but killers are earned by opening a \"mystery box\" and randomly winning a killer.  This irks me because I really wanted one of the killers ([spoiler]The JimSaw Killer[/spoiler]) but as of yet haven't attained him.\n\nMy other minor gripe is that once you purchase a kill, you can't preview it in the store.  You have to either wait until it randomly appears in the game, or move over to the trophy shelf.  It just seems unnecessary to have the extra steps.  I dunno, maybe I'm just crazy.\n\nThere are other extras included, but I think I'll leave them for you to learn about on your own.\n\n[b]In Conclusion[/b]\n\nDefinitely worth getting for any fan of puzzle games or 80's slasher flicks.  It's great in both regards and stands out heads above other puzzle games because of that seamless blend. \n\nWhat else is there to say but \"Love is Like a Machete to the Heart\"\n\n[b]Final Verdict: 9/10 [/b]\n\n\n\n[i]Note: This review is done for the Steam Awards 2016's \"I Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award\" award.

Go buy this game, it's awesome and worth your time.\nLet's get the bad stuff out of the way:\nSometimes I have tiny glitches but I'm just nitpicking.\nI don't really like the way that I get the killers, I wish I could choose on my own, but everyone will enjoy it differently.\nAnd that's about it for the cons.\nNow the good stuff:\nThe design of the game - All the killers look cute and somehow menacing at the same time, and I love that. The victims are always funny and charming to see brutally murdered (More on that in a second)\nThe level design is also top notch, sometimes it'll be a bit frusterating but in a good way, it makes you think and outsmart the victims. Sometimes you'll need to scare them away, and sometimes you'll need avoid killing animals like cats.\nNow, the amazing kills - Every kill feels like it was created by Tom Savini (Although he's working for Friday The 13th: The Game right now), every time you kill a victim after scartching your head thinking about how to kill the other victims is so satisfying to watch, and there are mini games between each level so you can get points to get new kills and killers, and if you are lazy like me you can spend them to get hints or even skip the level. Which is great since the minigames are really easy and fun.\nThe amount of content is big, especially for 8$, I'm in Part 5 (Every part is between 12-24 levels) and I think there are at least 8 Parts and pretty sure more are coming + there is some side activity and a high replay value.\nConclusion: This game is one of the best games I played this year and easily the best indie game I ever played. I enjoyed every second of it and will continue to enjoy it until I 100% complete it.", "timestamp_created": 1478803003, "timestamp_updated": 1478914961, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545746", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26496033": {"recommendationid": "26496033", "author": {"steamid": "76561198341913827", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 719, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489611682}, "language": "english", "review": "This is my first purchase on Steam. I normally don\u2019t buy games on the platform as my PC isn\u2019t very powerful and there are only a few games that ever get my interest. But after seeing a review of this game and really liking the aesthetic and puzzle based gameplay, I decided to pick it up. \n\nThe cheesy horror theme is one of the games strongest selling points, which remains present in all parts of the game. The soundtrack is also superb! The gameplay itself has a good learning curb to it. It gets pretty difficult later in the game, though the \u201chint\u201d option provides genuinely useful information for a small amount of in game currency, and for a larger amount they will show you have to complete the puzzle. Plus the selection of killers and Gorepacks (kills) is pretty extensive.\n\nThe way to earn money is a bit of a grind, not helped by repetitive kill animations for the bonus kills. However, I have little doubt the developers could add more in a future update, as they have been updating regularly and are listening to the community.\n\nOverall, I\u2019m having fun with it and have no regrets about buying the special edition (because that soundtrack was worth it!).

Does it slash its way across the pile of various puzzle games or drown in its own blocky blood. Let\u2019s find out:\n\n[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]\nSlayaway Camp puts you in the shoes of a psycho killer with a single aim of killing all the teenagers camping in the area and get the hell out of there. The main gameplay loop is pretty simple, you slide across the path of laid out in front of you and stop at the end of the lane. You continue this till you reach a teenager and kill him, repeat this till you have killed all the people in the area and then get to the portal.\n\n While initially it seems pretty easy, it all gets a bit more complex as more and more gruesome ways to kill enemies are introduced and when the police get involved. Every turn you take is very important as even a small misstep can leave you stuck with no way of getting around. This applies not only to the killing but even after the killing is done, you may come to a place where it becomes impossible to reach the portal, thus forcing you to restart the level or retrace your steps. If you are stuck, you are given two options: Either replay the steps and try to find out where you went wrong or start the level with a clean slate.\n\n As the SWAT forces are introduced, they introduce a new challenge, completing the levels with a specific number of turns and try not to get in their way as their guns take you down if you get in their laser sights.\n\nSlayaway camp features a lot of different ways to kill your enemies, scaring them into fire, a hole in the ground, crushing them beneath a refrigerator etc. While none of the people you\u2019re supposed to kill flee the whole level at any point, they do get scared and back away if they see you passing or when you kill one of their buddies close to them. This way you can scare them into falling into their own deaths.\n\n After every scene, a quicktime even minigame is given to you for a chance to get bonus kills and earn bonus coins. These coins afterwards unlock \u201cGore Packs\u201d which are various kill types which will be played in your upcoming kills. After every act of a certain movie is complete, it unlocks a different movie which features a different killer. You can also purchase killers at the shop if you don\u2019t like the killer provided to you. Note: A killer named Jimsaw is based on Jim Sterling who is a must buy.\n\n Everything in Slayaway Camp is made so that you get the feeling of being a psychopathic killer without actually being too controversial, as was seen before in games like Hatred. Don\u2019t mistake it for a game like Party hard, which is mostly a strategy game. Slayaway camp is a puzzle game through and through with a fresh coat of blood. There are a lot of puzzles to go through and a ton of content to unlock here. Slayaway camp\u2019s finely tuned puzzles are just difficult enough to appeal to both casual and hardcore fans alike.\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\n\nSlayaway Camp features gory visuals in a very cute cartoonish style. It reminded of an indie game OTTTD, which featured similar visuals. Blood and gore flow through air everytime an axe is swung. The characters look cute and the environmental style is also very good. What really impressed me was the way the characters got scared.\n\n You see a guy perfectly fine and listening to music and slowly shaking their hips. Suddenly you pass by them in a flurry and their expression changes as they start to shiver and look around. This really helped in creating a solid atmosphere for the game. The killers themselves look different enough to provide a different feeling than the last one. Overall, Slayaway Camp provides a solid graphical style to keep you invested throughout. \n\n[h1]Soundtrack[/h1]\n\nThe Soundtrack of Slayaway camp is good. At the start of each scene, the music is soothing and relaxing but when you get in the heat of the action, they start pumping a much more tense sound. Other sounds like people letting out loud shrieks when you pass them or in front of them and the way your weapons slash them down are pretty good. Everything in Slayaway Camp\u2019s soundtrack is solid and goes along with its pretty visuals.\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\n\nSlayaway camp is a very good puzzle game which is coated by layers of blood. Even if you\u2019re not the biggest fan of puzzle games, the tricks applied here are simple enough for a newcomer to get into. It\u2019s pretty visuals and humour is enough to warrant a ticket to Slayaway Camp. It\u2019s a blocky good time!\n\n[h1]Rating: 80/100[/h1]\n\nThis review was brought to you by Pcgamesnnews.

There's a good deal of content to unlock through gorepacks, killers, new films, deleted scenes, and other such bonuses.\n\nIt's a great Halloween/horror game that isn't another dime-a-dozen jumpscare fest made in Unity, and deserves far more attention than it's gotten.

It captures the campy silly feel of a B-movie horror flick with some well though out puzzle mechanics. You start out just having to figure out how to reach and slash victims (with random Gore close-up kills), and quickly moves into the idea of controling victim location with their fear mechanic, where if you end a move adjacent, or kill a victim adjacent to them they will make a move in the opposite direction. They do a good job of expanding these mechanics as they go, introducing for instance traps that kill those you move into it, or land mines you may have to get victims to activate to get where you need to, or objects that can be knocked over to crush victims or simply change the map, or light switches which make victims no longer run away, or adding cops who can arrest you if you end directly in front of them, or swat teams who will shoot you dead if you end a move in their lazer sight (and can only be killed when the lights are out), or the dasterdly cats who must not be killed for  fear that the overzelous canadian censorship board will ban the movie completely. The introduction of mechanics is well paced, and each of games levels (styled as the sequals of this horror movie franchise)  has its own little arc that ends on a comparitively difficult level surrounding the use of some enviromental murder device (be it the woodchipper, rollercoaster, bandsaw...etc). Finally the game has multiple layers of additional challenges beyond the base levels, first off with the 'deleted scenes' and eventually the NC-17 content, which you unlock after the last movie which seems to remaster the most memerable puzzles from a movie but with the end game mechanics. The only complaints I have are minor compared to what is good about this game. One of these is that getting all of unlockable cosmetics (the gore packs for more variety in the close-up kills, and additional killer skins) take a lot more grinding than is necessary. The fact that there is a money grinding movie/minigame seems a bit out of place for the whole puzzle game experience of the rest of the game. Also the hint system for when you get stuck could have a bit more nuance, the one time I used it gave a hint too vangue to even resemble useful, and the only other hint it had was to fast forward through the entire puzzle (which is only for when you have given up on the puzzle and never want to deal with it again).\nTLDR: Good puzzle game with charming B-movie Horror aethetics and great pacing, with only minor complaints.", "timestamp_created": 1478151054, "timestamp_updated": 1478151054, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505693", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26394383": {"recommendationid": "26394383", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092028549", "num_games_owned": 212, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 642, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493947716}, "language": "english", "review": "Good MEme Game, FUnny #Killer #lol #XD\n\n10/2\n\ngraphipces /10\n\nBIG LEGOZ >>>> 1000\n\nBUY", "timestamp_created": 1478144797, "timestamp_updated": 1478144797, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.463677", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26381805": {"recommendationid": "26381805", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988524396", "num_games_owned": 600, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 448, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507932458}, "language": "english", "review": "As someone who grew up in the '80s watching Jason Voorhees slay teenagers, I'm very much the target audience of this game.  And it captures the essence of the genre quite beautifully, from the VHS effects, to the music, to the context and those oh-so-glorious killshots.  The mechanics are simple enough, Skullface can only move in one of four directions, and he'll move until it runs into something that blocks him, something that kills him, or someone to kill.  His inhability to stop is where the challenge comes from.  Find the combination of moves that will allow you to kill all the teenagers and then leave without getting killed and before the cops show up can be quite the challenge.  Considering his propensity to walk straight into a lake and drown, or into a fire and get burned alive, it's a miracle Skullface managed to last so many movies!  \n\nEvery segment is just a few minutes long, so bite-sized play sessions are quite possible, always a plus for busy people.  The game's learning curve is quite smooth.  The first few movies are like satisfying walks in the park.  Or slaughters in the park, if you prefer.  As you reach the end of the third movie (where I'm stuck), difficulty starts to rank up.  Fortunately, the game has a fast-forward feature if you ever find yourself stuck.  This'll help you keep things fun until the end.\n\nMy main gripe with the game, and it's a rather small one, is that although controller support is there and complete, it's very hard to know which menu item is selected vs. those that are not.  So you can start on the option you want, but you'll still to move the controller around to figure out which option is actually selected. \n\nDisclaimer: I received a key to this game from IndieGamerChick's IGCHalloweenParty and GamesMatter.

You are a serial killer, going around, killing kids and cops.\nBUT its all a movie!\n\n...\n\nIts still fucked though >.>\n\nAnyhow.\nThe game is played on a small platform that varies in size and shape due to the obstacles on the map. Around the map victims are being placed in their spots just like the obstacles to give you a fairly interesting puzzlegame. How you move is simple: You go in one direction and slide until you hit something. May that be wall or kid. Sounds easy right?\n\nWell, it is a puzzle game. And the further you get, the harder IT gets as well. Some puzzles have a really easy way to solve it but the map is build so you dont actually get this right away. I was sitting there, my brain exploding multiple times. And that is where the next feature comes in handy. The hint and walkthrough feature.\n\nThis game can give you a hint for 25 coins that you earn by performing bonus kills after mostly every level. You do NOT have to buy them with actual money. There isnt even a way for that. Back to the point: You can buy a hint with 25 coins. However these hints, for some maps, are not allways that helpfull. If you request more help you can buy a walkthrough of the level for 100 coins. Granted, the coins are fairly easy to come by so you could cheat your way through some brainbreaking levels. I recommend not to do this though. It isnt as fun~\n\nWith the coins you can also buy new things inbetween the \"movies\". You can by ways to kill the victims and different killers. The latter however is only made available through a randomized system. You can pay a thousand bucks for a giftbox and in this box is a random killer.

With being a homage to 80s horror movies, you play various killers to terminate all teens and some cops along the way. With Halloween coming, this game is a treat to those who love puzzle games and horror movies.\n\nSlayaway Camp capitilizes on 80s movies any way they can. Each area is labeled as a 'movie' with each level labeled as 'scenes', along with a new killer that is associated with those movies and a short cinematic. After each scene, there is an extra kill which will gain you coins to buy gore packs (which has a chance to show up after killing a teen) or more killers. Movies, gorepacks (both what you have and whats in the store) and killers are displayed on shelves in their respective areas with a funny description with each. An added bonus is that there are backs to the movies, so once they are on your shelf you can click the movie box to read the back summary.\n\n It has a good difficulty curve, with the first movie being a tutorial and each new addition that affects how the puzzle would be solved has a few scenes for the player to get used to them. There will be some scenes that would probably get you stuck, but the game has a built in hint system. Recently, a skip feature has been added, however you would have to at least play the last (\"boss\") level to move onto the next movie.\n\nGrinding coins is encouraged, with deleted scenes being unlocked for players to go back to previous movies and a dedicated grind movie. More is to come, as the developers make more ways to grind for coins.\n\nOverall, Slayaway Camp is a great puzzle game with 80s horror movies framing their game, anticipating what new kills and killers will look like as they unlock; while simultaneously cursing those sneaky teens that seem to not want to be killed in each puzzle.", "timestamp_created": 1477872921, "timestamp_updated": 1480325868, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.556232", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26325791": {"recommendationid": "26325791", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002779721", "num_games_owned": 438, "num_reviews": 112, "playtime_forever": 657, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481140306}, "language": "german", "review": "so much fun for so little coin", "timestamp_created": 1477868044, "timestamp_updated": 1477868044, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506683", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26325105": {"recommendationid": "26325105", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079099879", "num_games_owned": 388, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 249, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477845229}, "language": "english", "review": "Chess puzzles for pyschopaths.", "timestamp_created": 1477865627, "timestamp_updated": 1477865627, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.554422", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26323474": {"recommendationid": "26323474", "author": {"steamid": "76561198305148873", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478953408}, "language": "english", "review": "can kill teens by mowing their faces.\niz gud gem.", "timestamp_created": 1477860296, "timestamp_updated": 1477860296, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503149", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26323401": {"recommendationid": "26323401", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987783860", "num_games_owned": 915, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480651325}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun little puzzle game styled after old-school slasher movies.

(Don't worry, they were probably having pre-marital sex and/or doing drugs anyway).\n\nThe puzzles I've gone through so far aren't super complicated, but there's been one or two per \"movie\" that I've had to cheat and use the hint system in. \n\nThere's also a pretty fun unlock system that gets you new killers, murder screens, and possibly new movies down the road. You play a mini-game between each scene that earns you a good number of currency to buy pretty much something new after every movie you play through.\n\nI'm pretty excited to see what other movies and villians unlock as I go farther through the game.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1y-Y6BQnDo", "timestamp_created": 1477767668, "timestamp_updated": 1477767668, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502520", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26296952": {"recommendationid": "26296952", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045744095", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 224, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491743178}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was definitely not what I expected, but in a good way!\n\nMy gameplay video of Movie 2:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC0Ru9Ln5XI\n[h1]What I Enjoyed[/h1]\n- Cute graphics\n- Quick, yet (sometimes) challenging levels\n- Humerous \n\nGreat game!

The game screen can get a little busy and, as a result, all those chunky voxels can become a bit visually overwhelming in some of the levels where there are several different puzzle elements in play at once. Thankfully the game does let you zoom out from the default isometric view to an overhead camera that's much better for surveying the playfield and planning out your moves. Just don't forget to zoom back in to see all of the glorious violence!\n\nAnd that's pretty much all I have to say about the game that could possibly be construed as negative. Slayaway is one of those rare games with such a tight focus on familiar premise and simple design that it's difficult to find fault with if you enjoy the genre. Some of the puzzles will give your noodle a proper thrashing, and the plethora of unlockables will keep slasher flick fans coming back for more.

It reminds me of Hitman Go, which I also highly recommend.  But, it's also completely different.  Once you finish a story (level), you get deleted scenes which are MORE levels to play in that story!  What a great idea!  The humor is top notch, the poor taste oozes out of every corner of my computer while I'm playing.  \n\nThe puzzles range from pretty easy to extremely devious and brain burning.  You wouldn't think by looking at the small play board that these puzzles could get so crazy, but they do.

An option I initially ignored until I became completely stuck on a level in the 5th movie (I was just approaching the start slightly differently but meant I got stuck trying to get the last teenager). \n\nEncourages you to grind for coins to unlock new kills and character skins.

If you are into campy horror flicks and indie puzzle games, this is a no-brainer. The price-point is wayyy too cheap for a puzzle game that has 15-20 hours of content (...And they just added a few more things yesterday). \n\n[i]Essentially, you really only need one joystick for this game - you play the killer, and need to slide your way around the map to get everyone.[/i] The layers of complexity are unleashed upon you as you progress. You begin using pieces of the level to solve puzzles; things such as using telephones, landmines, and cats. Yes, cats. The different 'enemies' have different behavior and mechanics. The police are optional to kill, but must not be slid into from the front, for example.\n\nHonestly, there really isn't much negative to say about this title. While there is a quick restart button, I requested it be quicker, and they put it on the to-do list. The music and voice acting are top-notch. I mean they freakin' got the actor who played [i]Jason[/i] to do some voice-acting for gawds sakes. All the campy horror films are present.

I bought it on a whim just looking for something casual to play in-between bigger achievement hunting projects. I'm not the biggest puzzle game fan; it's not that I don't enjoy them, but I usually get bored trying to figure out the solution. I'm also not a huge fan of horror, although I'd classify this as horror-comedy. The game also does have a lot of voxelated gore; but there appears to be a slider that changes the amount of bloodshed and bones you see; with the option to increase or lower the amount.\n\nThe difficulty curve in this game has been fair, for the most part. The odd puzzle will present itself as a bit more tricky and involved than some before or even after; but they're usually solved fairly quickly. There's only one puzzle so far that had me stuck and ended up using a hint to help solve. After the game gives you a hint, it has an option to auto-solve the puzzle for you for a small amount of the skull tokens you use to buy Gore-Paks and skins for Skullface. \n\nThe game has a wide-variety of bonus kills and Gore-Pak kills. You get a free skin every movie you start; as well as being able to buy some through a Mystery Box feature. These skins (so far) also seem to have some skin-specific kills, and some levels also have level-specific kills. I can't say whether the Mystery Box skins have any skin specific kills yet as I've mostly been focusing on buying the Gore-Paks since some of them are more expensive.\n\nThis is a good puzzle game to pass the time with. There's a great amount of levels, as well as a solid amount of variety with new kills to witness, skins to see, movies to unlock that features different types of worlds, and new level hazards as you progress.\n\n\nIf you're a fan of puzzle games, horror, or just looking for something to pass the times with, this is a great buy. Even if you're not a huge fan of either, I'd still recommend giving this game a chance.

Continue at your own discretion.\n[/code]\n \n[h1]Teenagers Beware![/h1]\n\nI've never written a disclaimer like that before - intriguing right? The graphical content in this game mostly pertains to the methods in which the main characters perform their acts of life-ending showmanship. Even though the character models are all voxel-based (similar to Minecraft), there can be some really gruesome scenes throughout this horror fest. In fact, some of these death animations are so creatively macabre, the developers must have employed someone whose entire job was to think up of ways to commit murder in an artistic manner. Bees, nails, spikes, water, etc. You name it, Skullface and company can make it happen. Furthermore, these artists of death have found their way into Slayaway Camp, populated with an absurd amount of innocent teenagers. Channel your inner demon and help guide these fiends through multitudes of brain-tickling puzzles.\n\nNow you might be thinking how a puzzle game might work with horror elements. I mean, helping Jason fill out a Sudoku puzzle isn't quite anything to write home about, and HOGs with a haunted house setting are a dime a dozen, so when Slayaway Camp decides to reform Sokoban style sliding puzzles into a means of expressing a \"darkly comic homage to 80s trash horror\", I am truly, and wholly interested. Blue Wizard Digital did not back down in finding a way to merge these two completely different genres, and their unique love-child is nothing but demented humor. \n\n[h1]Darkly Comic Homage[/h1]\n\nEven though Slayaway Camp is inspired from Sokoban, I find it more similar to the Pok\u00e9mon Ice Gym/Team Rocket floor puzzles. Starting at a stationary origin, moving in any cardinal direction will initiate a slide, stopping only when the main character reaches a wall, an obstacle, or better yet, a soon-to-be-victim. Your goal in every level is to reach and murder all teenaged targets and escape through an exit. Various puzzle mechanics will be added into the lineup of stuff-to-avoid as you progress, making these sliding puzzles increasingly difficult down the line. Staying away from a SWAT member\u2019s line of sight is manageable, but surround him with electric fences and I\u2019ll have to think a bit. Drop in some cats, turn countdowns, or teleporters and I\u2019ll be in deep trouble. Fortunately, an undo button provides the ability to go wild exploring path options, but the true life-savior lies within the hint and full-walkthrough system if things go south for too long. Knowing that the system is in place, the developers have crafted some hair-pulling, blood-pressure-raising, maniacally difficult puzzles. Towards the final levels of the last 2 films, the enormous amounts of feints, backtracking, and chaotic movement had me reaching for that help button more times than I\u2019d like to admit. \n\nEach level plays like a scene in a movie, filled with gut-wrenching murder cut-scenes and popular scary movie tropes. Beginning with a deep and cringy horror movie narration that would make the late Don LaFontaine proud, every videotape is set in a different stage. From the traditional camp grounds and hospitals, to the more unique work offices and scenic parks of New York City, Slayaway Camp really wants to be an equal opportunity murder campaign demonstrating that death is all around us, and fun to watch at that. With 10 movies and a bunch of deleted scenes, Slayaway Camp will most likely manage to satisfy your dormant cardinal need for bloodlust throughout its 200+ feature film puzzles. Even though slogging through so many puzzles can be a big stretch to perform in one sitting (which is why most puzzle games have a fantastic save & continue feature), Slayaway Camp varies its puzzles and environments enough that I was able to go through multiple videotapes at once without feeling bored or sick of the gameplay. \n\nThe developers' passion for slashing, killing, and reimagining cult horror films can be seen in the beautifully constructed, and well executed art design. I've never seen as much gore in a horror film as I have in Slayaway Camp, but the hyperbolic forms of murder can only be described as comically grim. From individual \"murder-scenes,\" such as Skullface sliding a knife through a victim's eye, to unlockable death animations (victims roasting in fire) and iconic killer characters, Slayaway Camp just oozes with horror film recreation to a fanatical degree. In addition, small visual details, smooth gameplay, personalization options, customized intros and skippable transitions all lend a hand in heightening its polish and player engagement.\n\n[h1]Video Gameplay[/h1]\nhttps://youtu.be/cP60B6aNBjQ\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n\nI\u2019ve noticed that nearly all of Slayaway Camp\u2019s levels are pretty small in nature. Even when it gets extremely complex, the designers have chosen to favor a claustrophobic environment over the alternatives. I definitely would have loved to see a large hanger like area split into various rooms with interconnecting mechanics, or perhaps a building with multiple floors. It\u2019s a shame that the game\u2019s scope was not as encompassing as it could have been. To be fair, Blue Wizard Digitial could have just went with a horror skinned puzzle game and left it at that. I am really glad they didn't, because their vision and love for slasher films set this game apart not only from other puzzle game competitors, but also horror game contemporaries too. The devs even managed to grab Mark Meer (Cdr. Shepard - Mass Effect) and Derek Mears (Jason - Friday the 13th) to take part in the fun. \n\nI clocked in at around 7 hours to complete all 10 videotapes (Space Camp was freaking hard), which unlocked NC-17 and Deleted Scenes (levels) afterwards, including the fan-favorite censored shower scenes. Having only covered two-thirds of the available levels at this point, there is still so much left to see. If you are looking for a [strike]light[/strike]dark-hearted experience to play this Halloween, or really any time of the year, make sure to pick up Slayaway Camp.

Incorporating in the gameplay movie titles, legendary murderers starring in their personal horror series, hundreds of recognizable ways of extermination of the victims and all the archetypal figures of slasher movies, produces many hours of fun. I love his puzzle gameplay which is reminiscent of chess and requires the player to preplan all his movements using forward thinking.

I would classify it as a \"sliding\" puzzle game. In the game you move your character in a direction and they continue moving in that direction until they run into something. The basic gameplay in Slayaway Camp is figuring out how to more your character around the level killing all of the teens and making your way to the exit. \n\nIf you enjoy these type of puzzle games I think you will really enjoy Slayaway Camp. The puzzle design for the game is quite good. The game doesn't deviate too much from other games in the genre but it does a really good job at what it is. If you don't really care for these type of puzzle games though it probably won't be for you. \n\nThe theme/story of the game is spoofing 1980s horror slasher films. The game features different VHS tapes which are different movies in the Slayaway Camp series. Each VHS tape is a different set of levels. Slayaway Camp uses the different movies to make fun of this genre of horror movies. People who enjoy this genre of movies will probably really appreciate the game's story/theme.\n\nDifficulty wise I would say that the game is moderately challenging. Quite a few of the levels you can figure out pretty quickly but you will run into the occasional puzzle that will take you some time to figure out. So far I have finished around half of the levels and have been playing around four hours. I would guess that the game will take seven to ten hours to complete. \n\nI enjoyed my time with Slayaway Camp and if you like \"sliding\" puzzle games I think you will really enjoy Slayaway Camp as well. If you don't really care for these type of puzzle games though I don't think Slayaway Camp is going to be the game for you.\n\nIf you would like to read my full review check out [url=http://www.geekyhobbies.com/slayaway-camp-indie-game-review/] Geeky Hobbies [/url].", "timestamp_created": 1477418254, "timestamp_updated": 1477418254, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516271", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26218503": {"recommendationid": "26218503", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027157496", "num_games_owned": 814, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479796417}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Full review here:[/h1]\nhttps://tdgameclub.com/slayaway-camp-pc-game-review/\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n[list]\n[*]though out sublevel names\n[*]voxel graphic \u2013 bloody scenes are thereby lightened\n[*]logic\n[*]awesome level design \u2013 well-changing, creative, definitely not boring\n[*]collectibles\n[*]mini games between sublevels \u2013 gain coins for shopping (new murderous techniques/killers)\n[*]levels represent movies\n[*]various characters \u2013 unlocked gradually with completed movies\n[*]various obstacles\n[*]funny finish moves\n[/list]\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\n[list]\n[*]error page not found\n[/list]\n\nScore: 84/100\n\n[h1]Join TD Game Club - Steam group:[/h1]\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/tdgameclub\n\n[h1]TD Game Club - Trusted game reviews:[/h1]\nhttps://tdgameclub.com/", "timestamp_created": 1477417898, "timestamp_updated": 1486221390, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.600395", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26218149": {"recommendationid": "26218149", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999991828", "num_games_owned": 933, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481233575}, "language": "english", "review": "This game takes a great puzzle game, adds a great art style, and adds in the fantastic idea of using classic slasher movies as a theme, which all adds together to make a great game.\n\nThe puzzles start off simple enough, but as the levels go on they add new and unique mechanics which make you really have to think and earning coins to buy the extras is simple enough and not tedious at all.\n\nAll in all Slayaway Camp is a great puzzle game, with plenty of levels, which keeps you hooked.", "timestamp_created": 1477416485, "timestamp_updated": 1477416485, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501201", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26218129": {"recommendationid": "26218129", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960746459", "num_games_owned": 167, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 579, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482198427}, "language": "english", "review": "Slaytastic!!!

My backlog is huge and I need to trim it down a lot, so I thought the best\nway to do that is to play games for an hour or so and see if I would go back to them at a later date.\n\nSo with that said, here is my first impression review for.... Slayaway Camp!\n\nSomebody thought that if you took 80's horror slasher movies and made them into a puzzle game it would be a good idea.\n\nThey were spot on!\n\nYou controll a killer who must... well, kill, innocent campgoers. How do you do this? well, your character can move in one direction, but only ALL the way along a grid style playing field. Problem is, if there are hazzards in the way, you die, so you have to avoid them (but you can make victims fall into them by appearing next to them and scaring them into traps)\nSo you have to navigate your way around the map/puzzle to find your way to victims, or items that will finish off them.\n\nI'm doing a terrible job of explaining how this works, but it's a clever puzzle game wrapped in lovely (some might say cute) slasher-tastic paper.\n\nA couple of minor things, I did have problems on the main screen (the video store - nice touch - each level is a new video cassette) being unresponsive, and as the game goes on, it feels more like trial and error to find the correct solution. I would have liked it if there were multiple ways to kill people off, instead of having to do things one way only (but that is what makes it a puzzle game I guess)\n\n\nSo will I come back to play it later on?  Yes, no, maybe?\n\nYES!\n\nThis game is great! \nI am not a massive fan of puzzle games as a rule, but the asthetics of this one makes it so much more enjoyable.\n\nHighly recommended!\n", "timestamp_created": 1515690542, "timestamp_updated": 1515690542, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536083", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39233519": {"recommendationid": "39233519", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968807811", "num_games_owned": 582, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 325, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508695303}, "language": "english", "review": "Darkly charming puzzle game in which you slide your murderous character across the levels with the goal of killing any innocents around.

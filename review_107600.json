With only one arena, two weapons and a handful of game modes, Waves offers a streamlined twin-stick shooter experience, but rather than leave the game feeling sparse, this allows its triumphs to shine through without clutter. Gameplay is well balanced and addictive, with enough twists through the different game modes to keep things interesting. The sense of \u201cflow\u201d the gameplay instils is complemented beautifully by the ambient soundtrack and a feature I particularly like is the option to change each of the game\u2019s sound effects to pentatonic notes that harmonise with these tracks. It doesn\u2019t affect the gameplay, but is a good indication of the attention to detail Squid In A Box has put into this game.\n\nWaves is not without its issues however. The main ones that come to mind are:\n[list]\n[*]The HUD looks very flashy but can be a little hard to read in the heat of the moment, especially if transparency is enabled.\n[*]The \u2018Challenges\u2019 mode only displays the objectives for each round after the round has finished. They all basically equate to [spoiler]\u201c[i]get a high multiplier and do it quickly[/i]\u201d[/spoiler] but this still seems like an odd decision on Squid In A Box\u2019s part.\n[*]Some issues with preferences in the games settings not being retained through updates, I haven\u2019t given much investigation to this yet so it may be easily resolved or a problem on my end. \n[/list]\nThese are all fairly minor problems though and haven\u2019t stopped me cracking Waves out whenever I have other gamers over or half an hour to kill. Overall, Waves is a streamlined and polished gem of a twin-stick shooter that stays fun long after you expect it to. Definitely worth its low price if you\u2019re a fan of the genre or looking to get into it.", "timestamp_created": 1513735585, "timestamp_updated": 1513735827, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38434602": {"recommendationid": "38434602", "author": {"steamid": "76561198364336916", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 1448, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491610772}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought this because I am a massive shoot em up fan and love these style of games.

These in-depth analyses explained why they believed that the score system and some other mechanics in Waves are better than GW.\n\nThis convinced me to give Waves a second chance. I spent some time on it, and it started to grow on me. The thing is - this is pretty common with shmup's that have their own unique systems. After playing it for a few hours, I realized that it is actually not so similar to Geometry Wars. It was super fun too, in it's own unique way.\n\nI often encounter a comment \"it is just another shooter game\", \"it is a Geometry Wars clone\", \"it's Super Smash TV\" or \"it's Crimsonland\". Players have a hard time seeing the differences, figuring out the depth. But it is actually us, designers, who need to think more about this, and present our games in a better, more clear way.\n\nSo after playing many shmup games, I am giving Waves a huge thumbs up, and huge recommendation.

First off, the story:\n\nIn some games, story is presented as a series of characters with lines of dialogue, and/or events that happen. In other games, story is emergent, in that you create your own narrative based on choices you make. This game has none of that. This is a series of minigames with their own rules and challenges, but they're all meant to be played in short bursts. The result is that you're constantly getting snapped back to a menu, unless you're really really good. I admit I'm not the best at these types of games, even though I enjoy them. What some games do, to compensate for lack of player skill (twitch reflexes) is add RPG or progression elements and difficulty level. So if you're not good enough to make it 30+ minutes without getting snapped back to a menu, add an upgrade system and a difficulty slider so you can grind out some boosts to give yourself an edge. This game doesn't have that. If you want your sessions to last longer, it's on you.\n\nThe controls are fine. Some people complain about how your avatar (a ball) has physics with inertia and such. That doesn't really bother me too much, but maybe it contributes to the difficulty. Several times I'd find myself getting smacked down in ways that made me wonder if it was poor reflexes or my avatar was just sluggish to correct.\n\nFinally, there's the art style. It's 3D neon geometric shapes chasing you around a circular field, with a honeycomb grid underneath that moves in and out of view. There are particles flying everywhere, and when you make kills, harmless bright blue bolts fly out of them and chase you. This makes you feel like you're constantly getting shot at even though you're just collecting \"XP\". (There is a leveling system but all it does is increases the difficulty, it doesn't give you any new skills or stats.) Sometimes enemies charge you at crazy speeds from very short distances, but you can only survive one hit. So your brain is constantly trying to figure out if the things coming at you are friend or foe, and it gets confusing. The abstract art style makes me feel disconnected, unmoved, so I'm less motivated to keep playing.\n\nTo summarize: This isn't my favorite twin-stick shooter. It has a few cool features (like the time slow that charges up as you make kills, or the bomb that becomes available when you get a 10x multiplier) but to me, the punishing difficulty combined with an abstract art style and lack of progression or difficulty options means I'll be turning elsewhere for entertainment. The short play sessions where you get tossed back to a menu every few minutes makes me just want to head for the exit.", "timestamp_created": 1485098208, "timestamp_updated": 1485098208, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.363467", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29316646": {"recommendationid": "29316646", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020529863", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 283, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484658964}, "language": "english", "review": "\n - A ball instead of a space ship , you are attached to the ball physics,  you have to wait for the ball to turn.\nsimilar like controlling a wireless billiard ball,  you need to stop the ball first in order to move in  opposite direction.\n\n7.5/10 imo.  \n", "timestamp_created": 1484660794, "timestamp_updated": 1484660794, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.422234", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29219503": {"recommendationid": "29219503", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968587849", "num_games_owned": 717, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 54, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484342393}, "language": "english", "review": "Just a solid and maybe underrated twin-stick shooter on Steam.

La ayuda visual para alertar el lugar donde van a aparecer los enemigos es pesima y muchas veces terminas muriendo por falta de informacion. Por otra parte, el porcentaje del mapa que queda fuera del cuadro de la camara es tan grande que muchas veces perdes el chain porque parece que la arena esta vacia.\n\nArtisticamente el estilo chiptune (asociado a un estilo retro lo-fi minimalista) no es coherente con la estetica tron que propone el juego (asociado a algo abstracto, futurista y sofisticado). Los limites de la arena no son claras ni estan bien definidos por lo que es dificil calcular cuan cerca de la parede estas y si queda o no espacio para evadir enemigos por los laterales. Los pilares decorativos que aparecen alrededor de los limites de la arena se comen una parte de tu avatar.\n\nEl hitbox es enorme para la velocidad con la que se mueve el jugador. Mas alla de que el bullet time ayuda un poco para esquivar, el hitbox deberia ser un poco mas chico que el modelo para compensar el lento tiempo de reaccion propio de los seres humanos.\n\nLa cantidad de mecanicas aleatorias que tiene el juego es suficientemente abrumadora como para no considerar competitivo este juego. Los spawns son aleatorios, los tipos de enemigo son aleatorios, los movimientos de los enemigos son aleatorios, los spawns de los multiplicadores son aleatorios... la lista sigue.\n\nNo veo realmente razones para haber comprado este juego, realmente lo hice por impulso. Hay tantos otros juegos similares mucho mas entretenidos y bien logrados en Steam que considero que hice una p\u00e9sima compra.\n\nLos requerimientos para el juego son brutales considerando lo simple que son los graficos, la comunidad es muy peque\u00f1a y ya casi nadie juega... en fin. Lo unico positivo que le veo al juego es que lo tenga algun otro amigo y competir en la tabla de posiciones.\n\nCompren Geomtery Wars, el original, clasico, nada se le compara.

Is Waves worth a check out? You betcha.\n\nFor anyone that doesn't know, a twin-stick shooter is exactly that: the left stick controls you, the right stick aims where you shoot. Easy peasy. The arcade classic Asteroids can be seen as one of, if not the, first twin stick. So with Waves the premise remains the same: see brightly colored geometric shape, aim at it, and watch a pretty display of particles explode out from it. The more shapes you blow up, the more points you get. Blow up enough shapes in quick succesion, the higher combo you attain. High combo means more points. Points are life.\n\nWaves breaks up the monotony by implementing a slow down mechanic based upon an ever replenshing gauge: use it to get out of hairy situations or to rack up bonus points. Waves also utilizes a bomb system in which you're awarded bombs based upon your score, but only for a short moment. Miss your chance to use it and it's gone.\n\nWaves has a nice selection of gameplay modes, but if there was one issue I had with it, it's that they're all a little short (except for Survival of course.)

The game has a few interesting auxilliary mechanics. First is the buffer which is a rechargable bullet-time power that is a main panic button, and the second is bombs that become available based on your combo multiplier. If your combo breaks than the bomb disappears so there is an interesting anxiety if saving a bomb, and also a chance to chain together a large number of bombs for maximum efficacy. As difficulty ramps up and the chances of missing decreases due to the large number of baddies on the screen, bombs become more and more frequent, which leads to a fun chaotic dynamic when things get tougher.\n\nThis game has a small, understated, relaxing techno themed soundtrack that goes well with the hex-gridded environment and the polygonal, computer themed enemies. It took me a while to appreciate the game's design as there is quite a bit of subtlety, but in the end I appreciated the vision.\n\nThough ultimately enjoyable there are some minor gripes. First, I can't pause between death and respawn, though often I wish to simply restart the level after an early untimely death. Also, the challenge mode often perplexingly doesn't trigger success for the challenes appropriately. Further, the UI is a bit crowded and oddly designed. For example, a high score is often displayed proiminently in the middle right of the screen, while the current score is displayed on the middle left of the screen. There is a lot of data on the screen. Aesthetically it works in a sort of augmented vision manner, but practically I would like to reduce a lot of this clutter. My worst is criticism is Ithat he amount of content is limited. Many game modes play out quite similarly and there is only the one stage. After a few hours you've seen it all, and you may not want to grind the same set up repeatedly.\n\nThough unfair due Waves' differing mechanics, I feel this game asks to be compared with installments of Geometry Wars. If you liked Geometry Wars, then you will like Waves. If you didn't, you won't. If you've never played Geometry Wars than Waves is a cheap introduction to the genre when it is on sale. The game is a solid effort, and personally, I'm excited for the sequel, which as of this writing is in Early Access.\n\n[i]Waves are a physical phenomena resulting from specific excitation in a medium. Most waves involving the medium itself are limited by the speed of sound in that medium, while the travel of optical and electromagnetic waves depends on the speed of light in that medium.

Its key gimmick is the ability to slow down time for a few seconds. It\u2019ll kill an hour, but not much more.\n[b]Length:[/b] 1 hour\n[b]Genre:[/b] Twin Stick Shooter\n[b]Score:[/b] 5.5/10\n\n[b]Full Review:[/b] [i]Waves[/i] is a twin stick shooter in the vein of [i]Geometry Wars[/i] (the first two that is, not so much the third), from which it derives obvious influence. The core gameplay is much the same, pilot a shape with one joy stick, shoot with the other, and destroy different shapes on the map to earn points.\n\n[i]Waves[/i] has a few differences though. Instead of having a set number of smart bombs, you earn a bomb whenever you get a combo of 10, and you only have a few seconds to use it before it goes away. You also can slow down time for a few seconds, allowing you to pick off enemies that are too close or maneuver away with greater ease. You can only do this for a few seconds at a time, and then it will need to recharge before you can use it again.\n\nThe game features a few different modes of play, none of which are anything groundbreaking. A time limited mode to see how many points you can score in 3 minutes, a survival mode to see how long you can last before you bite the bullet, and a few others.\n\nI got about an hour of play out of the game before I got bored of it. So if you\u2019ve already played [i]Geometry Wars[/i] and need another twin stick shooter, this\u2019ll fill an hour.

I've already logged a few hours on it, and being the noob I am I die, a lot. But the visuals, the challanging but deceptively  simple gameplay, and the complexity of the enemies makes me want more. Slowing down time and setting off your bomb (completely controlled by building combos mind you) is the difference between life as death as the game goes on. Seven different game modes lets you choose what means of firey neon death you want to go out on. In short, the game is beautiful, insanely difficult, and heartpoundingly fun. On top of it all, it's probably the best bang for your buck you'll get in a long time, especially with the sale going on. If you don't have it, get it. Now. Don't even finish reading this. Buy. It's a 10/10 in my books, and by the looks of it I'm not the only one. Thank you Squid in a box.

This game is seriously fantastic. I don't have a ton of experience with twin-stick shooters in general, but I do have some time in them. This game, for me, blew Geometry Wars out of the water. This is mainluy due the different way Waves handles bombs compared to GW. \n\nInstead of having 3 screen clearing bombs, you get access to a bomb (for a few seconds, not forever) once your combo meter reaches a certain point. The bomb destroys enemies in a small radius around you. Since you can, in certain situations, build your combo meter very quickly, you occasionally get a short burst of bombs with each bomb killing enough enemies to get you another bomb. It may sound to easy, but it doesn't happen to often and creates a MASSIVE sense of power. It is so satisfying that I just can't get enough.\n\nMy initial gripe with the game was the fact that it has a slow-mo system that you can activate. At first I found it a crutch, but after the game giving me reminder's after each loss to use it more, I finally clued in. It doesn't last long enough to make it too easy as well.

Ok. \n\nThis game has no bugs and interesting, cool, futuristic Tron Legacy styled graphics. Unfortunately too much of this game is style and far too little of this little game is substance. Remember the old 1980's arcade game Robotron? This is a less fun, less complex version of of that game with less interesting graphics.

objectif est de faire le plus gros score et ce, quel que soit le mode choisi parmi les sept propos\u00e9s. Dans la m\u00eame veine que son excellent a\u00een\u00e9 Geometry Wars, vous incarnez une boule qui doit survivre, au sein d'une ar\u00e8ne d\u00e9limit\u00e9e, aux vagues d'assauts ennemis. Les ennemis \u00e9tant, tout comme dans le jeu pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment cit\u00e9, des formes g\u00e9om\u00e9triques aux couleurs et aux comportements variables. Par exemple : les sph\u00e8re rose se d\u00e9place lentement et al\u00e9atoirement ; les sph\u00e8res rouges sont rapides et vont tout droit d'une extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 \u00e0 l'autre de l'ar\u00e8ne ; les sph\u00e8res jaunes vous suivent constamment, les vertes vous suivent mais fuient d\u00e8s que vous allez dans leur direction etc. Tout l'int\u00e9r\u00eat du gameplay, qui se joue ici \u00e0 la manette avec les deux joystick (l'un pour tirer l'autre pour se d\u00e9placer), est de survivre \u00e0 ces vagues ininterrompus d'ennemis toujours plus nombreux pour ainsi faire le meilleur score. Il est important de toujours se d\u00e9placer, d'esquiver, de contourner et surtout, de ramasser l'exp\u00e9rience laiss\u00e9e par vos ennemis afin de monter en niveau. Lorsque vous passez un level, vous augmentez votre multiplicateur de point et de fait, votre score. La partie la plus subtile et la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 de Waves, c'est la capacit\u00e9 de votre boule \u00e0 g\u00e9n\u00e9rer une bombe d\u00e8s que vous atteignez un streak de dix ennemis tu\u00e9s. Cette bombe permet d'an\u00e9antir tous les ennemis autour de vous et se trouvant \u00e0 une port\u00e9e moyenne. Id\u00e9al de cultiver son streak pour se sortir des situations p\u00e9rilleuses ! Enfin, vous pouvez \u00e9galement, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l'une des g\u00e2chettes du pad, ralentir le temps pendant un temps limit\u00e9 afin de vous frayer un chemin parmi ce joyeux bordel ambiant ! G\u00e9nial !\nLes graphismes sont simples mais efficaces, toutefois j'ai pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 l'univers visuel de Geometry Wars, plus pr\u00e9gnant, m\u00eame si finalement les deux se ressemblent beaucoup. En revanche, l'ambiance sonore est nulle \u00e0 chier ! Quel g\u00e2chis ! La plupart du temps, les musiques sont discr\u00e8tes voire inexistantes ! Et les quelques musiques electro un peu p\u00eachues sont tr\u00e8s d\u00e9cevantes. Gros point noir pour Waves. Une musique entra\u00eenante est indispensable dans les jeux arcade de ce type. On regrettera aussi le fait qu'il n'y ait qu'un seul mode d'arme, contrairement \u00e0 son a\u00een\u00e9 qui en proposait plusieurs.

You can't pause while you're respawning, a process that takes like 5 seconds, an annoyingly long time if you've gotten a bad start to survival mode or something and just wanna restart. And to further the frustration, the menu takes a little too long to come up, and if you're trying to pause in a hurry and aren't sure it came up, you may accidentally unpause it by hitting it again. In a fast-paced game like this, pauses NEED to be instantaneous, nothing feels worse than dying because you were trying to pause.\n\nBut, it's $5, which ain't too bad, so unless any of those things are a dealbreaker, I still recommend it.

That exhilerating feeling of only barely being able to keep up, and the highly rewarding feeling of pulling of a sick run.\n\nMinimal, highly arcade, highly retro with cutting-edge PhysX graphics.

I really like the neon-looking style to fit with the theme of Cyberspace and errors & viruses overrunning the arena. The main objective in most modes is to last as long as you can and shoot your way through the waves of enemies, with each wave getting progressively harder. There are different coloured bugs which overrun the arena, each with a different movement pattern and there is also a virus of hexagons which grows over time filling the arena. These viruses are good for shooting to obtain a \"bomb\" which you can use by hitting the space bar, but if you wait too long it will wear off and you won't be able to use it.\n\nI love the \"Bombing Run\" mode, where you can't shoot at all but you have to roll and dodge enemies while going from red hexagons to green hexagons to set off a bomb, killing enemies near you. The dodging enemies can require some good skills but you also get a shield every so often to help protect you, the shield basically pushes enemies back if they hit you for a short amount of time acting like a instant second life.\n\nAlso - Achievements! ^_^", "timestamp_created": 1428532962, "timestamp_updated": 1428533150, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566667", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15269644": {"recommendationid": "15269644", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970258181", "num_games_owned": 884, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 60, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1429206385}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice game to test your reflexes :)", "timestamp_created": 1428527234, "timestamp_updated": 1428527234, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15263481": {"recommendationid": "15263481", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100564108", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 96, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458397904}, "language": "turkish", "review": "Bo\u015f zamanlar\u0131n e\u011flenceli oyunu :D", "timestamp_created": 1428496606, "timestamp_updated": 1428496606, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.955446", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15262882": {"recommendationid": "15262882", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042990480", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482774767}, "language": "german", "review": "Ich habe dieses Spiel damals f\u00fcr einen Euro erworben und ich bin sehr begeistert von diesem Spiel :)\nF\u00fcr das Geld ist dieses Spiel f\u00fcr zwischendurch sehr sch\u00f6n :D\nGameplay: Also im Gro\u00dfen und Ganzen ist dieses Spiel ein tolles Arcadegame.

Or 30 mins. Or 2 hours, Like me.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\n\nWaves controls extremely well, with a controller or not. You play as a ball, and your aim is pretty much to blow up everything in the arena to earn XP, to earn multipliers, to earn points. This ball that you play as has a couple of tricks up it's sleeve though, the first is the ability to slow down time, and the second is, after you reach a combo of 10, you can let off this  explosion killing everything within a small area. The scoreboard in this game is amazing, it clearly and neatly displays your friends high scores as well as your own when you end the game. It even displays  your friends high scores during the game to the right of the screen. This suprisingly doesn't interrupt gameplay at all. The game has several modes, Including: Crunch Time, Survival, Rush, Bombing Run, Challenge, Chase and Hold. Survival, which I would say is the main mode here, as it is just classic roll around and kill everything, you have 3 lives and unlimited time to post the best score and every 10 levels, you gain an extra life, in Rush, you have 2 minutes to earn points, and every time you die you lose 10 seconds from your time, Crunch Time throws you into the arena with infinite lives and 3 minutes to just have fun, and that is what you do in this mode, have fun, in Hold mode, you have 3 lives and have to to stay within a circle of light as it floats around the arena,you have to stay inside this as your guns won't work outside of it, Chase is an insane mode where you have 5 seconds to roll over to these red pads, which re-news your five seconds to live, Challenge mode gives you 20 waves of enemies, and 30 seconds to complete each one. Completeing the challenges, (doing it within an amount of time and stuff like that) will award you bonus points, finally there is Bombing Run, which  dissables your guns, and throws down these red pads, you then need to roll over them to pick up the bomb and then go to the green pad before the bomb explodes, when you get the bomb on the green pad, it explodes killing everything. Except you. \n\n[h1] Prettyness (or graphics/presentation) [/h1]\n\nWaves has an awesome art style, everything is very crisp and works well together with the amazing neon glow of everything. Sometimes the screen can get a bit crowded, but this isn't too bad.\n\n[h1] Sounds/Music [/h1]\n\nWaves has an amazing sound track wich fits in perfectly in the background of all this caos. there is also a nice robotic lady-like voice that tells you when your bomb is ready and stuff like that.\n\n[h1] Verdict [/h1]\n\nThis is a fantastic game for just 5 bucks considering the amount of content. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys, um, explosions, guns, balls, cool music and robot voices :).\n\nThanks for reading this!\n\nTL;DR\nHas explosions and guns.\nNuff said.", "timestamp_created": 1425639751, "timestamp_updated": 1425639751, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581749", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14710399": {"recommendationid": "14710399", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135459795", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1426739359}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0425\u0423*\u041d\u042f!!!! \n\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0439\u0434\u0451\u043c \u0441\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0443 \u043a \u043f\u043b\u044e\u0441\u0430\u043c ( \u0438\u0445 \u043d\u0435\u0442\u044e) \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0441\u0430\u043c! \n________________________________\n\n\u041f\u043b\u044e\u0441\u044b:\n\u042f \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043a\u043d\u0443\u043b \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0438\u0445 \u043d\u0435\u0442 !!!\n________________________________\n\n\u041c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0441\u044b:\n1) \u041d\u0435\u0442 \u0433\u0435\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u044f!\n2) \u0421\u043a\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0430!\n________________________________\n\n\u041d\u0443 \u0432\u043e\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u043c : \n\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0441\u043a\u0443\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f , \u043d\u0435\u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f . \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0442 \u043d\u0430 20-30!\n\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0435 \u044f \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044e 2/10 \u0431\u0430\u043b\u043b\u043e\u0432!", "timestamp_created": 1425221575, "timestamp_updated": 1425221575, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.326640", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14708088": {"recommendationid": "14708088", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009295311", "num_games_owned": 552, "num_reviews": 170, "playtime_forever": 168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1425211221}, "language": "russian", "review": "7/10", "timestamp_created": 1425211330, "timestamp_updated": 1425211330, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.464774", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14705042": {"recommendationid": "14705042", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161984527", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 490, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488212851}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u0443\u0431\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f)", "timestamp_created": 1425194330, "timestamp_updated": 1425194330, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516828", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14704511": {"recommendationid": "14704511", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031109983", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460788540}, "language": "english", "review": "So what so say about this game.

"english", "review": "This game is only good if you can buy it for less than the price of geometry wars: retro evolved. GW:RE outclasses it in so many different ways: better bomb system, better combo system, and better enemies; but, the problems that this game has can be easily fixed with one or two balance patches, but the devs seem to want to use their time putting in community reccomendations for game modes and shit instead of fixing these. \n\nSome specific gripes:\n\nBombs are terrible. They are never usefull when you can get them, unless you can kill a bunch of virus in a small period of time, because the enemies that you killed to get the combo to get the bomb were probably all the enemies in the bomb's radius. \n\nEnemies are unbalanced. The clustery things that turn red when you shoot them are a direct upgrade from the 3 little ball things, but they sacrifice speed for survivability: this means that it takes so much more effort to kill them than it does to kill literally any other enemy other than cubes. The green ball things that dodge your bullets are absolute bullshit; you could be in a perfectly fine position, then 4 or 5 of these fuckers spawn in, and suddenly you have to use all of your slowmo to kill each of them individually, and if you miss, you have to resort to killing them outside of slowmo, which poses the same problem as the clustery things- you're using more and more effort to kill something that shouldn't take that much. \n\nEnemies use too much rng to spawn. Enemies in this game spawn in seemingly completely random patterns, and take .5-1 seconds to spawn; this means that if you're being overwhelmed in a game and one or two dudes spawn right next to you, you either have to use your slowmo to move out of there, or you instantly die, and you've probably already used your slowmo to survive being overwhelmed. \n\nCubes have too much health for their size and impact on the game. The cubes in this seem good on paper, but when implemented, are absolutely fucking broke as shit in practice. They have the same problem as those other ones I put down, with taking too much effort to kill, exept these ones seriously punish you for not having the answer to them right when they come into play; they need to spawn in when you're in a position to get a bomb fast, otherwise you have this huge death-square coming for you and you can't deal with it without leaving every other enemy unattended. \n\nThe combo system is trying too hard to be original. Honestly this part could be very easily fixed if the devs understood why most games use either the 'combo is constantly going up as you kill enemies and resets when you die or something' system or the 'combo goes up pretty fast but instantly goes away in a small period of time after you don't kill something' system. The system that waves uses is trying to make the latter better, but fails miserably: you need to kill 3 enemies to get one stack, and that will only happen when you're being overwhelmed by enemies or during an ambush of like 10 dudes. It rewards you for being in situations any sane person shouldn't be putting themselves in, which results in you needing to be lucky/really really good at twin stick shooters to get high scores in survival. \n\nThe challange mode is absolutely infuriating for completionists. Not being able to go in and pick which levels you want to do and not do is just fucking terrible.

If you're looking for a quality twin-stick shooter, and you're sick of having so much free-time, then give this a look.\n\nPLOT: Roll around, shoot stuff, and don't die.\nWhile there are seven modes of play, there are some constants to be aware of. Waves emphasizes the multiplier-system. Every-time you level-up, a multiplier bonus appears on the field. Scores tend to be very top-heavy, the longer you survive, the better your score. However, by playing risky and using the limited slowmo ability, you can tack on another 4X bonus to every shape you destroy. Early on that doesn't mean much, but earning a 60X bonus by level 15 can be very nice. It also pays to keep combos going, because for every 10 shapes, you get a temporary bomb. For most modes, an extra-life is awarded every 10 levels.\n\nCrunch Time - You have three minutes to get a high-score. Since time is limited, this mode revolves around maximising the slow-down ability. This is a good mode, especially when you want to play a videogame, but only have a few minutes.\n\nSurvival - Self-explanatory. You're given a stock of lives and you have to go as long as possible. Every several seconds a wave of enemies surrounds you, which can mix things up a bit.\n\nRush - You're under a time-limit, with extra seconds only awarded through level-ups and destroying cubes. My strategy consists of moving in circles, only going for the multipliers if I bomb through the hordes. Honestly, I think I play it a little too safe, and my score tends to suffer as a result.\n\nBombing Run - No weapons and you have to keep grabbing and exploding bombs to destroy enemies and survive. Your only other means of defense is a shield. It recharges quickly when the action is hectic, but only activates once. I really enjoy this mode, because is focuses on almost entirely on proper maneuvering. \n\nChallenge - Destroy enemies as quickly as possible, get a high multiplier, achieve ratings of up to five stars. This mode consists of 20 stages. It's alright, if you're looking for something a bit more concise. The challenges have specific tactics so you're employing more thought into the game aside from: \"I better not run into this shape!\"\n\nChase - You have about five seconds to move from point to point while destroying shapes. I guess this mode is directed at guys like me who prefer to play the wall and take it easy. Due to the ultra-stringent time-limit, things will get extremely intense. It's easy to fall into despair, when you have only a second left, and a thick crowd of enemies have blocked off the next point.\n\nHold - You can only fire while in the lit-area. Keep in mind that this is a tight-space to be confined to. You might even have to leave the lit-area just to lure shapes out of your personal space. Those precious multiplier bonuses tend to spawn outside as well. This is a tough mode to play, simply due to how claustrophobic it is. I don't really care for it.\n\nWhile getting overwhelmed in this game is a constant, what actually kills you is usually the one shape that gets away. You're circling around, firing at a huge mass of shapes, but you're not looking at where you're moving to. Guess what happens next? An enemy spawns in your face and you die. Maybe that one shape matrix-dodges your bullets somehow. Yes the game can throw so many shapes on-screen that it'll cause your $1000 PC to freak out, but what kills you? That one shape. I shouldn't have to say this, but focus is the key. If you're distracted for 1/120000th of a second, you're done for.\n\nLike its inspiration, Waves has really good leaderboard support. If you have a lot of friends that play this game, all the better. The score of the next person ahead of you is always on display, giving you an incentive to work harder. \n\nThere's not much else to say really, you probably already own this game(via an indie bundle), but ignored it due its generic title. Definitely give this game a look, you'll likely have a lot of trouble putting it down though.", "timestamp_created": 1417467276, "timestamp_updated": 1417467276, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.648132", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13173055": {"recommendationid": "13173055", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991625636", "num_games_owned": 347, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 375, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1427868170}, "language": "english", "review": "Bitchin soundtrack and some great mechanics.

This ability recharges at a decent pace.\n[*]You have bombs, but they works rather differently: When you get a combo of 10 kills, you can use a bomb (you lose it if you lose your combo, though). As you can imagine, there can be a lot of enemies on screen, so getting a 10x combo is mind-numbingly easy to do again and again.\n[*]There is a Level & Experience system, which is used to scale-up the difficulty for a particular play-session. I find it adds absolutely nothing to the game, and there's no reason to even pay attention to it as you're playing.\n[/list]\n\nThat said, you can basically play it with your brain off by just going around in circles, and spamming bombs over and over again because of how quick/easy it is to constantly get 10x combos. And not long into a session, there'll be enough enemies to constantly net you those 10x combos that it won't even matter what direction you shoot in anymore.\n\nAt least, that was my experience playing it the other day, which was the first time in just under one year. I only played the main mode during that session (Survival mode), and on my very first try, got the achievement for attaining the highest score possible. So all Waves left me with was a main game mode that was way too easy to top-out, and a few other game-modes which I distinctly remember not liking very much.\n\nSo yeah, I feel that those looking for a Geometry Wars fix will find Waves somewhat disappointing. It's not a bad game at all, and might even be a decent distraction if you could get it really cheap, but it left me feeling really underwhelmed - both a year ago, and when I picked it up again the other day.\n\n[b]Edit:[/b] I made a silly.", "timestamp_created": 1415114414, "timestamp_updated": 1416938148, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.379604", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12786744": {"recommendationid": "12786744", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030785627", "num_games_owned": 617, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 9203, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486987997}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0414\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f, \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u044f, \u0441\u0430\u0443\u043d\u0434\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043a \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0445\u043e\u0434\u044f\u0449\u0438\u0439 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439. \u0417\u0430\u0442\u044f\u0433\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442.\n\u0412\u0441\u0435\u043c \u0440\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u044e \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0431\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f.", "timestamp_created": 1415110368, "timestamp_updated": 1415110368, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.408333", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12755124": {"recommendationid": "12755124", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044109240", "num_games_owned": 646, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 769, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512154859}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041f\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0445\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0443\u0431\u0438\u0439\u0446\u0430 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438. \u041e\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u0430\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0430, \u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u0438 \u0442\u0430 \u0436\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u043a\u0430 \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f, \u043f\u043e\u0447\u0442\u0438 \u0434\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0442\u043e\u043a \u0440\u0435\u0436\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u0441\u043e\u0442\u043d\u0438 \u043e\u0431\u044a\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0432, \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043d\u0430 \u0442\u043e, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u043e\u0431\u043b\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0432\u0441\u0451 \u0432\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0435. \u0417\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0434\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u0438 \u0431\u043e\u043c\u0431\u0430, \u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0435\u043c\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0434\u043b\u0438\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0431\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0430\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f. \u041d\u0435 \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0442\u044c, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0432 \u044d\u0442\u0443 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443 \u0432\u044b \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c, \u043d\u043e \u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0432\u044b \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u0432 \u043d\u0435\u0439 \u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u043e \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e \u043d\u0443\u0436\u0434\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f -

Killing enemies levels you up. Upon leveling, a score multiplier is randomly placed in the arena. Collecting this increases your multiplier by 1 permanently. Killing lots and lots of enemies in a short period of time also increases your combo meter. When your meter reaches 10 you get to drop a bomb that kills enemies in the surrounding area. You can also slow down time for a brief period if this get a bit too crazy. You add all of this together and you get a fun fast shooter .\n\n+ The game has plenty of interesting modes to keep you engaged. Each mode is vastly different from the last and offers plenty of different ways to play the game. \n\n+Great music\n\n+ This game is the definition of pick up and play if you are looking to kill some time. Lots of replayability\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- Some achievements are very hard to get \n\n- Can be frustrating at times\n\nConclusion\n\nConsidering I got this game for one dollar, it probably is one of the better purchases I've made. If you love the genre then this is a fantastic game to add to your library. If your just a casual fan like myself then you will also find it enjoyable. \n\n  \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1414527143, "timestamp_updated": 1414527143, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26,

I get chills thinking about times I cleared the arena with 3 consecutive bombs strikes just as i was getting overrun.\n- Has a good variety of distinguishable enemies, and the slowly-growing \"virus\" is a wonderful touch that allows you to turn an encroaching foe into an arena-clearing weapon.\n- I think the music is good. Honestly I can't remember it.\n- The game has the derisive sense of humor of an older brother.\n- It's made by a studio called Squid in a Box, which might be the best studio name ever.\n- The game menus are succinct, fast, and well-designed.\n\nThe Bad:\n- With everything going on around you and the colorful graphical effects it's easy to lose track of what's going on. \n- The leaderboards seem hacked.  Everyone in the top 10 or whatever has the exact same astronomical score.\n- Some people might be turned off by the pace of this game. \n\nOverall I recommend this game, especially if you like fast-paced arcade-style shooters where you die a lot but occasionally have those epic runs you want to tell you friends about.", "timestamp_created": 1412883595, "timestamp_updated": 1412883595, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501977", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12412972": {"recommendationid": "12412972", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026465332", "num_games_owned": 2280, "num_reviews": 147, "playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1411516762}, "language": "german", "review": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhB6-FJL4IE", "timestamp_created": 1412786043, "timestamp_updated": 1412786043, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12402489": {"recommendationid": "12402489", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997020330", "num_games_owned": 2155, "num_reviews": 87, "playtime_forever": 37, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1412039048}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041a\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0441\u044c, \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043b\u044f\u0439, \u0432\u044b\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0439! \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0430\u0440\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0430 \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442\u0430, \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0439, \u0432 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u043c \u0438\u0437 \u0440\u0435\u0436\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b \u0432\u0430\u043c, \u0432 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435 \u0448\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043a\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f, \u043e\u0442\u0431\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u043e\u0442 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u043e\u0446\u0432\u0435\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0446, \u043d\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u0430\u0433\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435\u0441\u0443\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0430\u0448 \u0448\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043a, \u043d\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0434\u0430\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0434 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u044f\u0447\u0443\u044e \u0440\u0443\u043a\u0443. \u0415\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0440\u0435\u0436\u0438\u043c \u0432\u044b\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f, \u0440\u0435\u0436\u0438\u043c \u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438, \u0440\u0435\u0436\u0438\u043c \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043c \u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u043c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435, \u0440\u0435\u0436\u0438\u043c, \u043d\u0430\u043f\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0439 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0438 \u0432\u0437\u0440\u044b\u0432 \u0431\u043e\u043c\u0431\u044b. \u0412\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u043c \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0430\u044f, \u0441\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u044e \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u043b\u0441\u044f \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e \u0432 \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u043e\u043c \u0440\u0435\u0436\u0438\u043c\u0435, \u043d\u043e \u0443\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u0432 \u0440\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0434\u044b \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0430 \u0443\u043f\u0430\u043b \u0432 \u0434\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044e \u0438 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0440\u044b\u043b \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443.", "timestamp_created": 1412706893, "timestamp_updated": 1412706893, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537123", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12393958": {"recommendationid": "12393958", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000811199", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 963, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501544157}, "language": "english", "review": "The twin stick shooter that I've been waiting for on the PC.

This has one-more-go hard-wired into its DNA.  It's brutally addictive.\n\nThe graphics, though lush and lovely, never get in the way of what's going on.  The colours do trick you sometimes.  You think you're heading for a green bomb pad, but no, it's a virus cluster of nearly the same shade.\n\nSlo-mo helps, but is in short supply.  The bomb mechanic takes some getting used to and doesn't always work.  One time, the voice started saying 'Bomb ready', but the combo had dropped (and with it, the bomb) before she'd even said the two words.\n\nI paid 79p for this game.

Geometry Wars is a damn good game, and honestly I think Waves is a far better game.\n\nA lot of that sentiment comes from how Waves differs from Geometry Wars in terms of its more nuanced mechanics. While both are minimalist twin-stick shooters with similar art directions (though not identical, since Waves uses 3D models), Waves and Geometry Wars have fairly different ways in which they handle their score multipliers and bombs. Waves also has a bullet-time mechanic that's based on a meter you fill as you destroy enemies, and enemies you kill while slowed down net you a point bonus. You can also get point bonuses from destroying enemies at point blank, in which you have a circle around your ship that shows you the radius enemy ships have to be within in order to get the point blank bonus. Overall I just prefer the mechanics in Waves over Geometry Wars.\n\nI haven't played Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved 2, but from what I've read about it Waves it at least on par as they both offer a good handful of game modes that the original game does not have. Some modes in Waves are pretty much identical to ones in Retro Evolved 2 (Waves' \"Crunch Time\" and RE2's \"Deadline\" operate on the same principle of scoring as high as you can on a time limit), others are mostly similar with a few added wrinkles that slightly change how it plays (\"Bombing Run\" in Waves plays much like RE2's \"Pacifism\", but with the added quirk of having to deliver a bomb to a specific point on the map before the bomb detontates on yourself, losing a life in the process). Meanwhile the \"Chase\" and \"Rush\" modes in Waves not like any modes in Retro Evolved 2 (funnily enough, the only mode in RE2 that Waves doesn't have an equivalent for is, in fact, called \"Waves\").\n\nSadly, Retro Evolved 2 isn't available on PC. I don't feel too terribly sad about that, however, as Waves is a fantastic alternative. I can totally respect a developer who decides that they want to make a game that's *ahem* \"heavily inspired\" by an existing title, but then they aspire to make it just as good or possibly even better than the game they're ripping off. \n\nAlso, the soundtrack has a track in it that samples Kefka's iconic laugh from Final Fantasy VI.

There are quite a few of them around, but my search has been to find something as close to the PSN great Super Stardust HD as possible. A truly amazing twin stick shooter that many of us even got for free after the infamous ApocalyPS3 where PSN got hacked a few years back. Our reward was free games for not being able to login for a month! I ended up with Super Stardust HD, Little Big Planet, and inFamous as mine so I did well, but Super Stardust HD was the big surprise of the lot and I have been searching for a similar twin stick shooter ever since. \n\nWaves may not be the same as Super Stardust HD, but I am very happy with the similarities and this style of twin stick shooter regardless. So my search for similar games to SSHD actually DOES result in finding some other greats now and then. In SSHD you played on a sphere where you orbited planets and destroyed asteroids and enemies with bombs and a boost. This spherical type of Twin Stick I have yet to find another one worthy of mention unfortuantely. In Waves you are inside a flattened circle,  but it does give me the close-quaters bombs and instead of a boost it gives us a \"Slo-mo\" feature to get out of sticky spots. \n\nWaves is easily one of, if not the best twin stick shooter on Steam imo. It has a similar graphical style of Geometry Wars where everythng is minimal, but that is perfectly fine and works well. It serves up massive combos like most shooters should have and has a great deal of different game types you can play. In fact I was very impressed by the amount of different game types avaialbe in Waves, and these have been doled out for free over the course of its life. \n\nThe main game type, however is Survival, and it means what survival means. Stay alive as long as you can and try to get the highest score possible. Unfortunately, the game has a max score limit of just over 2.1 Billion. It's not particularly easy to get here, but it is there. There are only a couple hundred Waves experts who sit a top the leaderboards with this max score so you aren't going to get to it without A LOT of practice and time played. I am not one of these experts who has achieved the score...yet. \n\nOther game types include Bombing Run, which you play with just bombs. Hold, which was just released in March, is a mode where you can only use your weapons when you are inside a designated area of the screen. So no flying all over the place to avoid things, you must get into the attack zone to keep yourself alive. Crunch time gives you quick events that you must beat from other game modes. This is just a few of the game modes and there are 6-7 total if I remember correctly. All with their own Steam Leaderboards for the community, friends, and Local. The Leaderboards actually work too unlike many of the other shooters on Steam right now. (ie. Scoregasm, although Scoregasm is a pretty fun TS shooter for a cheap price)\n\nWaves is definitely a GREAT twin stick shooter for any fan of the genre and I would highly recommend it. If you are one that wants to get massive scores and are willing to put in the practice and play time you can get there. With all the game modes available, and the time it may take to reach a score you can be proud of, you will be able to play for dozens of hours, if not 100+ hours. Waves is now a staple of my Steam gaming library for when I just want to jump in a game and start shooting things!\n\nSteam Achievements are plentiful and are broken down to each different game mode so you can only get them all by trying all the modes. They aren't particularly imposible to get, although your skill level must increase greatly as well as your undestanding of the mechnics to achieve most of them. \n\nGamepad support is fine (BTW...TWIN STICK Shooter means they are meant to be played with...TWIN STICKS, not a keyboard and mouse...lol) with the XBox 360 gamepad, although I use a PS3 Dualshock 3 Gamepad with the DS3 Tool. For me, I wanted to flip the buttons around for bombs and slow-mo so using the DS3 tool made that very easy to do without having to go into an .ini file to change it up. There aren't control bindings in the game options so you need to do it manually, or with something like the DS3 tool. DS3 Tool is faster and easier for me as it is just changing the buttons up in the 360 emulation config rather than having to update the .ini file anytime there is a patch, which could replace that .ini file. \n\nWaves 2 is now in the works as well and looks to be taking community suggestions of adding many different weapon types and other game styles. From videos I have scene it looks like it has some sort of \"maze\" style to some of the modes where you maneuver around walls and fight enemies this way. Oh yeah...Waves 2 also has a co-op feature it appears.

With your sphere you shoot plasma balls/beams that destroy other geometric shapes when you hit them. Those shapes spawn in intervals, depending on the level youve gotten to. You gain levels by destroying the shapes and collecting little blue orbs of EXP that conveniently home into you when you get close enough.\n\nThis is a greatly fun game in short bursts. Its simple to learn, but difficult to master.\n\nIt is also clear that this game is a fantastic way to increase your hand-eye coordination, multi-tasking potential, and accuracy of short-term logical predictions. As you gain levels it becomes exponetially more difficult to coordinate your spheres movement (cannot touch any other shapes or youll explode!), your plasma beams, and the path youll need take your sphere in the next 1 - 3 seconds to avoid the semi-predictable paths of the other shapes and avoid touching any of them, lest you explode.\n\nGraphics: For what the game is, Im satisfied with, and enjoy, the graphics. They are colorful, appealing to the eye, and mesh together well. 10/10\n\nSound: I have no complaints about the sound other than that there are not enough music tracks. I believe there are 4 total, which are nice tracks, but a little on the low side quantity wise, which can start to become repetative. 8/10\n\nGameplay: Intense, is the best way to put it. Perhaps even \"overwhelming\" at first once you get 8 or 10 levels into say \"Crunch\" mode (3 minute game, get highest score possible). But thats not a bad thing; as stated above, Waves really has awesome potential at training your hand-eye coordination, multi-tasking, and movement prediction capabilities. 10/10\n\nI got this on a whim while it was on sale, and I am very satisfied that I did. I would fully recommend this game to anyone who enjoys intense, even overwhelming levels of information that need to be dealt with immediately lest you explode. I also see this game as having the potential for being a training game for just about any other fast-paced video game out there.\n\nFinal score: 28/30 = 9.33\n\nPS: Ive seen reviews questioning if this game is OK to be played with mouse and keyboard instead of gamepad. I play with M/K, and I find no intrinsic problems using them as opposed to a gamepad. Ive used both on Waves, and prefer M/K myself, but it all comes down to personal preference. Im very adept at M/K, but not so great with gamepads that require stick usage. \n\nId recommend trying both, and seeing which feels better to you right off the bat.

You can also use your special power to slow down time like in The Matrix, allowing you to evade enemy fire or kill several of them in quick succession.  Kills in slow-time earn you more bonus XP.  As you level up the enemies get more determined to kill you, you gain access to bombs, you get time bonuses to keep the action going, etc.  Most game modes have a timer that you can recharge by killing enemies or getting special timer items.

This is just super great. In some ways it's just a very well done twin-stick shooter, which makes for a good game but doesn't really stand out by itself. It's polished, and all the fundamental mechanics feel and look and sound good. The things that really keep me coming back for a couple rounds every few days are the extra mechanics on top of the basic ones and the well thought out game modes (one in particular).\n\nA slow motion ability is not exactly a new or unique concept, but it's used well in this game, with a limited meter for it that drains VERY quickly and recharges moderately quickly, so it's very often available, but only in small amounts. You also get bonus points while using it, so you have to decide whether to trade off using it to save your life or be risky and use it to pad combos for more points. The other main mechanic is the bomb system. Your combo multiplier goes up as you kill more enemies without a break of more than I think three seconds in between, and at certain multiples you're awarded a bomb, which as in most games insta-kills anything in a relatively large radius around you. However, unlike most games, you cannot save it for later use. You have a few seconds to activate it, or it's gone forever. If timed/chained properly though, you can use a bomb to get you a good chunk of the way to your next bomb, then repeat. Of course, when there are enough things on the screen that you can get away with that, you need to be on your toes or you won't last long.\n\nIt has some common game modes like unlimited time with a limited number of lives, or infinite lives but a fixed amount of playtime, and some more exotic or panic-inducing ones like the one which lights up a small spot on the screen, and if you don't move to it within a few seconds you die. Once you get there, it picks a new random location. Oh, and you also have to keep playing the normal game while doing that. Good luck. The one I've really gotten stuck on is Bombing Run, which takes away your guns entirely but continues to spawn enemies. It places a bomb pad at a random location where you can pick up a bomb, at which point it creates a delivery point at a different random location. When you bring the bomb there, it detonates like a bomb in the other normal modes, and a new bomb pad is generated. If you get a high enough combo, you can get a single-use defensive shield, but mostly it's about positioning, movement, and reading patterns and paths through what becomes a huge, chaotic mess at higher levels.

You can take the game at your own pace, but only by pushing yourself to your limits will you achieve your best scores. In doing so it manages to avoid the frustrating \u2018brick-wall\u2019 that can hamper many other dual-stick shooters. Dying is more often a result of you misjudging your own skill, than it is the game throwing more at you than you can handle, and very rarely a result of anything \u2018unfair.\u2019 While as the genre-name suggests Waves works much better with a gamepad, I\u2019ve found it is easily playable with a keyboard and mouse, albeit at the expense of finer movement control.\n \nThe game provides six different game modes, which serve to shift the balance of different elements of the gameplay. Survival, Rush and Crunch Time alter the balance between the need for speed, power and survivability; Bombing Run and Chase require you to move quickly from one target on the arena to another, favouring those with manoeuvrability and path-finding skills. Finally challenge mode is all about accuracy, and conserving your shots for maximal efficiency.\n \nWaves is the first dual stick shooter that has really managed to capture my attention, managing to deliver on \u2018easy to learn, hard to master,\u2019 without sticking a vertical cliff in the difficulty curve.", "timestamp_created": 1328128525, "timestamp_updated": 1407525908, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "1508900": {"recommendationid": "1508900", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993964544", "num_games_owned": 299, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1389904415}, "language": "english", "review": "What an awesome game if you looking at killing time!

The small circular [i]'Neo-Cyberspace'[/i] arena to navigate, along with the swiftly increasing viruses, bugs [i](& other strange spawners)[/i]  that trigger [i]wave after wave[/i] make this a true challenge to survive for any extended period. This difficulty can be off putting to some, but I really enjoy the intense gameplay - it keeps me coming back .. sweaty palms and all!\n\nBeing a twin-stick shooter you are obviously able to move & shoot independently on each analog stick, but in  Waves you also have a slow-mo [i]'Bullet Time'[/i] rechargeable power-up which gives you those split seconds needed to make an escape or clear some spawners when things just become too hectic. You can use this strategically to boost your scores too, such as getting a combo to enable your timed [i]'mega bomb'[/i] or get up close & double your points with the [i]'Point Blank'[/i] bonus. Movement & aiming are fluid & these additional tactical features become instinctive to use after a very short time playing.\n\nEnemies are distinct, visually, clearly identifiable & have complementing attack moves. They have some cool mechanics, although you will learn there patterns before long [i](there aren't a lot of different enemies)[/i]. The sheer numbers in later waves & the combinations of enemies used negates their relative simplicity. When you experience these large number of enemies with the vast amount of effects & action happening on screen, it can be hard to keep track of your location. This is the only downside I have found overall, and is  really due to having such nice graphical effects [i](take the good with the bad I guess[/i] :) [i])[/i].\n\nOf all the modes, the classic [b]Survival[/b] mode remains my favourite, although there are another six unique modes also available to tackle. Some are harder than others. There is the [b]Challenge[/b] mode offering unique puzzle like waves to clear, [b]Crunch Time[/b] offers short burst 3min timed runs & [b]Bombing Run[/b] where you have no guns, only bombs to  defend yourself with. Destroy the Cubes as quickly as possible in [b]Rush[/b], try the [i]\u2018Run'n'Gun\u2019[/i] [b]Chase[/b] mode where you need to hit the spawning markers within 5 secs to continue & the newest mode call [b]Hold[/b] where you have a small moving circle to stay within to enable your weapons which I find perhaps the toughest of them all!\n\nBelow is straight gameplay footage of Survival mode -  A taste of what [b]Waves[/b] is like in action:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=325677941 \nAll these great modes, enemy types & overall challenge add up to a lot of replayability. When you wrap that up  in some smooth controls, gorgeous visual eye candy, pumping electro musical score [i](that has that tendency to get stuck in your head!)[/i], add online & friends leaderboards, a swag of interesting achievements & a big picture friendly design, you really have something special. You can see a lot of time has been put in to balance out, refine & improve the gameplay by the one-man development team @ [b]Squid In A Box[/b].\n\n[b]Waves[/b] has held strong against the tide of new twin-stick shooter titles over the years, remaining one of the best available on Steam. If you missed this when it came out, it\u2019s certainly worth a look now its half the price. It's great quality & great value!\n\nJust as much fun to play now as it was when I got it!\n\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/TrueBlueReviews#curation]If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow [u]True Blue Reviews[/u] for more recommendations![/url]", "timestamp_created": 1322033843, "timestamp_updated": 1453689314, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518967", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "3291869": {"recommendationid": "3291869", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020275445", "num_games_owned": 2450, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 725, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1446066945}, "language": "english", "review": "Great shoot 'em up with a similar voice as GLaDOS, great music and a British humour.

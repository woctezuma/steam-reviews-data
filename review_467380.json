The boss fights especially were very easy. Also, I do appreciate that it seems like the creator put effort to make it feel like the game doesn't do anything cheap like surprise spikes. It especially guides you to where the hidden stuff is in nice ways\n\nIf someone is interested in getting into platformers, I would point them to this game.

Now, I don't refuse to pay for people's hard work, I just understand the limitations of my own income. That out of the way, this game is absolutely superb. Growing up in the 80's and 90's, the 2D pixel game platformer genre is pretty much my favorite. I also enjoy games like that mixed with elements lifted from RPGs and Adventure games (but with none of the stat leveling or turn style or random battles). This game delivers much more than can be expected, especially for my own preferences. It is a casual action platformer in that levels are challenging but just short and easy enough not to take away from the enjoyment of completing a quick level, the RPG/Adventure elements of story, dialogue, upgrades, secret levels and areas, extra player outfits, and collectibles (including town NPCs) are well blended, town and house areas complete with cute and enjoyable to dialogue with NPC's are present, multiple endings (two) which is actually surprising, and let's not forget the catchy music that had me toe tapping from level one onward! This game is honestly too good to be for free! So I wanted to do what I could - I bought the $.99 Nurse DLC costume. Trust me, as a webcomic artist, it sucks to work this hard for no appreciation. And you have worked hard, Suits and Sandals! Well done! The game seems to reference a potential other game you've worked on - perhaps a witch named Friday? I'm guessing here - that I'd like to try to track down next. You've proven you're superb retro-style games are more than worth looking into!\n\nEDIT: No, I can't find more titles you've developed, so I guess I read too much into *SPOILERS* the witch in the woods, the Weekday Witches, and to the dapper ghost's story.

The amateurish art and $0 price tag were a bit of a turn-off. But many hours and 28 achievements later, I can safely say this game was worth my time. Khimera is a game full of love and charm that never feels like it's phoning it in. Instead of picking up hearts to extend your health, a fairy chef descends from the sky and monologues about food before shoving some down your piehole!\n\n[h1]THE GOOD[/h1]\nThe amount of polish that went into Khimera begins with the story. Every character and locale is brimming with personality and a lot of detail was put into this short game. The backstory is simple but humorous and a lot of the jokes struck a chord with me. None of the dialogue was \"cringey\" and most of it was spread among the game's optional NPCs. Speaking of which, I loved this game's hub town. Every character was unique and memorable from the pie-selling ghost to the diamond-encrusted skeleton who manned the town's treasury. Most NPCs have a purpose so overall it feels like a lot of time went into the worldbuilding.\n\nThis is enhanced by the collectable notebooks, each of which tells you more about the game's denizens. And can I mention how great this game is at rewarding you for exploring? Hidden stages, new powers, alternate costumes and a very cool reward for finding all 25 hidden fairies, to name a few. The game is not shy about challenging and rewarding completionists which was good news for me! The stages themselves are pretty replayable, too. Each one has a few criteria you can fill and an achievement to go with each. There are not many stages but the ones here are very dense and full of content.\n\nBefore I move on to the negatives, I'd like to comment on the game's music. It's never quite amazing but most of it is very catchy, especially Pumpkin Valley. The instrumentation fits the game's mood and nothing ever felt out-of-place. Overall, the sound design felt like the strongest part of the game's presentation. Good job to the composer!\n\n[h1]THE BAD[/h1]\nMy first complaint about Khimera is a pretty big one. The \"game feel\" of Khimera feels very...off. It's hard to describe in quantifiable terms but the controls feel very weak and stiff. And for a game revolving almost entirely around melee combat, this is inexcusable. The controls were never a barrier for me but they never felt \"fun\" either. On a similar note, I wish the game gave me better control prompts. I use a Logitech F310 and the whole time I was asked to \"press 2\" or \"hold 3\". I would not have minded if I were given Xbox prompts instead.\n\nMy second complaint is on the game's art. I know this is a free one-man indie game, but some small changes would've gone a long way. All of the colors in Khimera are straight ramps without any hue differences in shades or highlights. This lends kind of a desaturated and dead look to the tilesets. The contrast is also quite poor. I oftentimes found myself stumbling into the purple falling spike traps because they blended in with the gray background.\n\nLastly, a few nitpicks about game balance. The mage minibosses were very mediocre. It's very easy to interrupt them with a quick dash-punch and never see their attacks. Treasure Box is very broken and led me to quickly powering through every boss without any challenge. By contrast, Mermaid Anchor and Demon Fire felt useless compared to other powers. Ah yes, and there are a few bugs as of v2.5. Ground Slam stops screen-scrolling so if its used on a flying platform to check for secrets, you will die even if there is solid ground below the screen boundary. There is also a block lacking collision at the end of the 8th room in Brine path.\n\nAlso, that offscreen notebook. You know the one I'm talking about. Just...why?!?\n\n[h1]FINAL THOUGHTS[/h1]\nOverall, I really enjoyed Khimera. If you're into Mega Man-inspired platformers like Shovel Knight, this will be a treat. I'm surprised it isn't more popular considering it's better than a lot of freeware games I've played! There's a lot to Khimera and I would not have minded paying a little bit for this experience. As-is, I think the game is more or less perfect for what it aims to be.

works pretty well. it's easy enough to tell where it'll end so you don't have to worry about dashing further than you anticipated and falling off a ledge, and it's quick enough to not feel sluggish.\n\nlevel design isn't shovel knight levels of great, but it's still generally solid. it's a decent challenge, while still being fair. there's also plenty of secrets, some of which are well-hidden, while some are just outright obvious. sometimes these secrets are just upgrades or collectables, but you can also find a switch that activates a secret, somewhat shorter level, which i always like.\n\ni think the only thing i don't particularly like about the game are boss fights. most of them can be beaten simply by mashing the dash button and pointing at them. the only fight that really stuck out as a proper challenge was the final one. but that said, the bosses are ultimately the only really mediocre part of what is otherwise a well-designed game.\n\nand i mean, it's free, so theoretically you shouldn't even need this review. you could probably have found out if you like the game quicker just by playing it.", "timestamp_created": 1501879989, "timestamp_updated":

Khimera has a lot of similarities to Touhou Project -- low-fi retro presentation, charmingly wacky dialogue and plot, horn-heavy music, and a preponderance of monster girls. The core gameplay of Khimera is a lot closer to the Mega Man games, though, and that influence shows through too in the game mechanics, the level design, and the music.\n\nOverall while I was playing I kept thinking, \"why is this game free?\" The developer has clearly put a tremendous amount of love into the project and it shows. Unlike most of the indie platform action games I've played, Khimera has tight controls, fun level and enemy design, and even a considerable amount of polish. The dialogue text is free of distracting typos and I didn't encounter any glitchy or buggy behavior the whole time I was playing.\n\nThe game isn't super amazing considered purely on its own merits; it's pretty short, the character art is a bit mediocre (cute, in a pixely style, but everything is a bit formless and lacking in fine detail) and the stages themselves are rather obviously built from discrete tiles like an old NES game. The latter is entirely excusable as part of the game's retro presentation (not that that makes it any better), but the lack of detail in the character art is a little frustrating particularly given the quality of the writing and the designs.\n\n(Note that when I praise the game's writing I'm not trying to paint it as some deep dramatic story, because it isn't that. It isn't TRYING to be that, though; it's silly and cartoony and as long as you don't take it too seriously it's a lot of fun.)\n\nAnother major complaint I'll make with the game is that some of the level and enemy designs are frustratingly cheap. Khimera is not a particularly hard game overall; I think experienced platform action gamers will have no trouble completing it in 4-6 hours, or less if you don't bother to get all the powerups. Still, there are certain screens that are really set up to screw you if you don't know what's happening going in. \n\n(In particular, in the lava cave area there is a screen where never-before-seen hazards leap out of the lava with no warning a few seconds after Chelshia enters the screen; this is really cheap and likely to knock the player into the lava on the screen, an instant kill. There are a few others, but the majority of the offenders are in the last three levels, which are sort of the \"wily castle\" of the game. I suppose it's forgivable having some cheap shots there -- once you know what's going to happen, they're not too difficult -- but it's still really frustrating when it happens.)\n\nStill, even if this game cost $5 it would be excellent; as a free game it's sort of shockingly good. Chelshia herself (the player character) has a surprisingly wide range of moves even to begin with, and she picks up more as the game goes on in true Mega Man fashion. Some of these abilities are of questionable utility but others can really alter your playstyle. Moving through the levels is as quick as you want it to be for the most part (save for a couple of really obnoxious parts later on) and thanks to her dash attack, which she can perform in mid-air, Chelshia can go pretty fast.\n\nSo yeah, play this game. It's free and it'll run on basically any PC.

Stages can be completed in any order, with optional hidden stages branching off the main stages.  The game is relatively short, and very light on difficulty: platforming is simple, boss patterns are easy, the player character is extremely mobile, and health pickups are bountiful throughout.  These factors generally work in the game's favor, as casual players can sail through without much frustration, and hardcore completionists can go for all the achievements while still having FUN with the game for once, rather than the soul-sucking chore achievement-hunting tends to be.  Music in Khimera is a collection of chiptunes that gets the job done but isn't particularly memorable, and the 8-bit sprites, rather than trying to evoke memories of other games, goes with its own style that's refreshing in its uniqueness, though they're not exactly the prettiest thing to look at and takes some getting used to.\n\nWhere Khimera truly shines is in dialog and tone.  The entire game is light-hearted and never takes itself seriously, following a cartoonish plot of pirates stealing treasure and the hero punching them in the face to get it back.  Colorful NPCs of various monster girl varieties are scattered throughout the game breathing life into it, with chuckle-worthy quips at the ready even if they're a throwaway villager with no purpose; the dialog with bosses expounds on these quippy exchanges even more.  The writing can sometimes try too hard to be funny, and might be a little too referential for some players' tastes, but it's witty good fun throughout and makes the game just plain enjoyable to play.  The simple addition of jokey characters and dialog brings a unique relish to the table, something that wouldn't be hard for any no-frills platformer to add, but something that is often deemed unnecessary and distracting from the core gameplay.  Khimera opts to instead play to its strengths and commit to the levity, and it's this very levity that keeps the game from being just another generic retro platformer, instead creating something with real heart and soul.", "timestamp_created": 1499822294, "timestamp_updated": 1499822294, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33459403": {"recommendationid": "33459403", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962573019", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 788, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500761134}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of those rare indie titles that you can really tell the developer loved what they made and truly put a part of themselves into the game. The gameplay is most comparable to Shovel Knight (although a charged projectile weapon later in the game makes it feel very Mega Man-ish as well) in both controls and mood.  The graphics are cute, the music is good and fits well, and the controls are tight and feel nice for a sidescroller that is heavy on platforming and combat. I genuinely liked the humor in the game (which is rare for me) and I legitimately wanted to talk to each NPC to see what they had to say.

Even though this one is fun for the whole family instead of being one for adults or horny teenagers.\n\nGameplay\nAs stated in the begining, this follows the formula of the megaman platformer games combined with the money mechanic of shovel knight (even if you don't get back the money but instead you have to collect the money you lost after a checkpoint and the checkpoints can't be destroyed for more money). As far as these types of games go this is a solid good one, but not as much as the other games since this one is very simple with the powers that you have even if some are interesting.\n\nYou control a female khimera that has a last minute adition of a golem hand before she got made and with that you basically punch your way through the enemies, thus you have a short range to deal damage so while this might not seem as good in the beginnig it will let you do the following\n-Punch: Self-explanatory, it is weak but it does the job, although it can help you to deflect some bullets and in some cases reflect them toward your enemies.\n-Charged Punch: It charges in like half a second and it does twice as much damage as the normal punch, this can be useful against certain enemies and if well timed against bosses it can save you a lot of time.\n-Dash-Punch: You dash and you punch, by far the most useful move in the game and one you'll probably use a lot for many of the situations in the game.\n-Quake-Punch: Not that useful untill you get an improved version on a certain stage, after the improvement it does help a and can punch things below.\n-Ground-Pund: Another useful attack, this one can bounce on enemies thus leading more damage until they're dead.\n\nAs how the gameplay goes it is easy and fair, the enemies don't do that much damage (only a half a heart), they're some health items in the stage and the level design is sraightfoward and some of the secrets are easy to find (cracked walls, some open areas in certain places, moving left). The bosses might give a bit of a challenge, but they're moves are very predictable and some can be easily exploited.\n\nThere's not much enemy variation in the stages and you'll see most of them in the rest of the stages, they're a few enemies that are exclusive to that specific stage but not the point of making it completely different. \n\nAs far as the stages themselves they're the ones that you've seen them a bunch of times before in these games (forest stage, water stage (in an oil rig), castle stage, wind stage) and have the gimmicks that you're familiar with , though 1 of them has a variation (it being the ice and fire stage combined in 1 stage). Their level design is solid and you won't have much trouble beating them.\nAnd in secret areas you'll get health upgrades.\n\nSpeaking of the bosses, unlike the megaman games the moves that you learn for the other monsters don't have a weakness against them, so just use whatever move is best for the situation.\n\nThere's a good amount of collectables in the game and while you might not get them all in a playthrough there's an item that will help you on getting them (in the secret areas though) and one of them unlocks a gameplay style that is worth checking out.\n\nControls\nThe controls are very solid, responsive and you can repeat the dash as many times and needed (but in some cases the game won't let you spam that many). I do have to say that I had a little difficulty with a certain jumping move while i intended to attack upwards with an enemy move, but that could've been easily my case.\n\nStory\nIn this type of games the story is as simplistic as it can get (pirates raid the island and now you'll have to take the money back by beating the bosses) and it doesn't take itself that seriously because It does bring a bit of some references and internet humor and self referential humor, so be ready to expect some of them. A few of them do get subverted at a certain point of the game.\n\nThe actual humor of the game is funny (In my opinion) and it's mostly about the interaction of the characters and part of the traits of the enemies that you fight against.\n\nGraphics\nThey're the typical 8-bit esque design that you've seen in many of the typical \"retro\" games. They do look simplistic, but nice and it does give a different style of the typical 8-bit game. While i don't care about this and I accept the game for what it is, if you are into or aren't into that style, then take that into consideration.\n\nSound\nIt's quite good and while not all of the songs are memorable they do fit the stages quite well and are enjoyable to listen to and don't get that annoying (mainly because the stages are short). While it's not to the levels of megaman and shovel knight, it does show that its trying.\n\nOverrall\nThis game is free and is well made, the gameplay is solid, although a bit easy for my tastes, the humor of the game is funny, but some might dislike the references and internet humor that it has, the music can be quite memorable if you like these type of games.\n\nI'll personally give it a 7/10 because while it is very solid and worth your time it doesn't strive to be better considering the simplistic game design, the patterns of the bosses and it lack a bit of polish in order for the game to be a gem.", "timestamp_created": 1497840859, "timestamp_updated": 1497840859, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505778", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32491621": {"recommendationid": "32491621", "author": {"steamid": "76561198163886370", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 74, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497764981}, "language": "english", "review": "Think of Cat Mario, but without all the troll.\nIT'S A LOT MORE DIFFICULT THAN THAT.\nbut still with the same rage level.\n\nFeatures:\n\n+ AIR DASHING!\n+ PUNCH EVERYTHING IN THE FACE!

With no way to fight, a scientist adds fighting abilities to his about to be born creation, called Chelshia and now the newborn must kick the pirates off the island.\n\nWhile not the best or funniest story, I did like the characters and I did have a smile on my face when they interacted with each other.  Like in Shovel Knight, the game characterises the villains you face but unlike that game, you can talk to the bosses except for the naga and final bosses, which lets you get to know them. My favourite was Pacifica mainly because  of how blunt and honest she is.\n\n\n\nGameplay:\n\nSimple 2d platformer in the style of Megaman. While I never played Megaman, I have played Shovel Knight and I can say that they\u2019re both the same but different in several ways. First while Shovel has eight bosses before the final levels, we have four. Another is that while Shovel Knight gives you new powers that you have to select in a menu to equip, you can use all of the skills you unlock at the same time like the high jump, the charge shot and one of my favourites, turning into a treasure chest and using it to crush your enemies.\n\nIt took me a while to get use to controls like that punching dash which I didn\u2019t figure out how to use properly til the fourth level and makes some the secret areas easier to do. Also, not only do you find books that have fun notes about the pirates, you also find faeries and when you collect them all, you get something special and with all the upgrades you find, you feel like a complete badass.\n\nAt first the penalty for dying was like Shovel Knight where you lose some money but thought it was worse since you can\u2019t get the money back. Then I explore the town and found out there was no shop to buy upgrades. So no there\u2019s penalty for death except a lower grade at the end. So you managed to keep a star little game. And since you keep every collectable besides money when you die or quit, go nuts.\n\nAlso, there\u2019s a secret mini game. It pretty fun.\n\nPresentation:\n\nI know the art is suppose to be retro but I can\u2019t tell what kind of retro it is Doesn\u2019t look like Nintendo retro and it\u2019s clearly not SEGA retro. DOS retro maybe. That had a variety of style from good to bad.\n\nI think the characters look cute and cuddly. Not much to except I like them. The music is pretty but I felt they sounded similar after a with only the castle theme standing out. At least I had my head as I played.\n\nVerdict:\n\nSo yeah. This is very good. Not Shovel Knight good, but good.\n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1494674040, "timestamp_updated": 1494674040, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31717348": {"recommendationid": "31717348", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022107690", "num_games_owned": 176, "num_reviews": 108, "playtime_forever": 141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496705540}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun little piece of freeware well worth the miniscule time spent downloading it.

So this review comes from a fan of the genre. But you may be too, since you are reading this review, so...\n\nIt is a really good platformer, with focus on speed and melee combat. It has solid mechanics, re-using some well known fun moves as double jumps, high jumps, pogo jump (as in Ducktales or Shovel Knight), while also making some new of their own (or at least, some that I haven't seen before).\n\nBut where this game truly shines is in its personality. It is oozing personality right from the get go. The characters are funny and interesting, the plot doesn't take itself very seriously but just serious enough to keep going, and even the common enemies are a pleasure to watch. They even have in game descriptions (if you want to go hunting for them) that expand on the charm this game has in abundance.\n\nThis is not to say the game is perfect. Some minor bugs are present, mostly visual or going out of the map if you explore way too much. But this does not in the slightest ruin the game experience. They are few and far between.\n\nAll in all, I really reccommend this game for anyone that likes platformers, or who wants a quick free game to pass the time.

Stages have a lot of hidden secrets to look for, there's some pretty catchy tracks, character movement feels on point and it's free.  A play-through will take a couple of hours max but there's enough incentive here to replay levels to find all the fairies, notebooks, treasure, etc.  I thought most of the dialogue and npc's have a lot of charm and avoids most of the pitfalls of being too memey and referential like a lot of video game humor.\n\nThe downsides would be there are some tracks that a bit annoying (the haunted castle theme in particular), the bosses tend to be rather simple and can just be brute forced for the most part and the visuals are sufficient but nothing special, but hey it's a free game so I can't hold most of that against it.\n\nThe best thing I can say about Khimera is that I have a bunch of games I've payed money for and haven't touched and yet I've played through this freeware platformer twice in the last 10 months.

It uses the classic frame work of some of the best of those games tempered with some of the modern mechanics that curb many of those forgotten greivences.  The game it draws the best parallel to would be Shovel Knight.\n\nThe primary gameplay revolves around jumping and attacking with short attacks and a dash attack.  It performs solidly with a controler (requiring simple set up) and feels natural and responsive to control.\nThe light adventure elements and challenges give you some additional utility and mileage with the levels.  Exploration and secrets are rewarding.  Replaying areas as you gain additional abilities will probably be necessary if you aim to find them all.  The challenge level is pretty solid, with periodic checkpoints helping your progress as you become familiar with the levels.  They are also thoughtfully placed in key locations.\n\nThe music is a fine fit for the tone of the story, characters and presentation.  It is also fairly memorable in the same way as some of the classics.  Some of the graphics seemed kind of like chunky pixels to me at first but it didnt take very long before I started to become attached to them.  They make identifying things a snap when the action gets heated, and what appear to be simple shapes can convey a nice range of action and personality.\n\nThe comical bent to the story and characters doesn't take itself very seriously, and there were a few times it got a laugh and several more where it got a smile.  I found the story fun and engaging where it drove me as much as the gameplay to contine on to completion.  The characters were interesting and quirky in a charming way that made me want to keep interacting with them.  \n\nKhimera: Destroy All Monster Girls is a solid value experience that I could see spending $5 to $10 on and being satisfied.  At the $0 price point the game is a must play for anyone that enjoys platform games or just wants a good example of the genre.\n\nI hope that the developer Suits and Sandals returns to this world and characters.  I will be looking forward to future releases from the team.\n\nVerdict: Own it.  Play it.

More exactly, enemies have unclear amounts of health (usually three light hits, with a heavy attack being worth two), and deal contact damage, while your Dash Punch mandatory for platforming only deals one hit's worth of damage.

The game's extremely reminiscent of shovel knight, but with a more humorous and playful tone.

Nevertheless, the final fight provides a good amount of depth and challenge. Where the game actually shines is in the lead-up to the bosses; the longer roads with weaker enemies encourage a more \"war of attrition\" playstyle in which you have to decide how to pass through while losing as little health as possible. The game uses plenty of environmental hazards and inconveniently placed enemies to provide difficult precision platforming, and the tight controls support it.\n\nThe extra collectibles, score ranks, and alternate timed and berserk modes offer some good replayability and extra challenge. The secrets are all well hidden but choreographed in some way, so players can have an enjoyable time hunting for them. One issue I have with them though is granularity; Every collectible provides either essentially no benefit or a massively rebalancing upgrade. The game's difficulty plummets with a few health upgrades and the movement aid while the \"pirate information\" notebooks are more for a fun read than any sort of tactical advantage.\n\nGranted, the writing and gameplay are engaging enough that I wanted to collect the notebooks simply for the intrinsic experience.

That's the thought that keeps coming to my mind.  Not great, but not the worst thing I've ever played.  It felt like mix between Ducktails on NES and Warioland on gameboy, both games I love, but some really amatuer stage design kept me from really having fun.\n  Let's start with what I liked.  The character models were good.  I liked the enemy designs in both form and function.  The character interactions and dialogue were likable, though, not particularly memorable.  The soundtrack was pretty good at parts.  I especially liked the Oil Platform and the Pirate Ship stages.  I did like some of platforming in a few sections, namely the EX stages.\n  Now, for the stuff that didn't mesh well with me.  Occassionally the level design would just get obnoxious.  I'm a fan of tough old-school platformers, but there were a lot of moments that felt annoying.  In places, the background would be the same color as objects in the foreground.  There were inconsistancies between how you exited the screen (one stage had you drop down into the water, but on the next screen to it's left, falling into the same water killed you).  The checkpoint placement was also tedious, for instance: in the mountain stage, you got a checkpoint before fighting a miniboss.  After beating the miniboss you fall into a pit where you have to jump on some small platforms that are being guarded by some floating skulls.  Nothing extremely difficult, but it's easy to miss a platform, or be knocked into the lava.  If you make it past these screens, you are treated to an untelegraphed fireball that sends you into the lava.  I have nothing against the occassional instakill, but dying here puts you back before the miniboss, who you have to fight over again.  Forgetting the instakill fire, or messing up a jump on this path means you have to repeat the fight, which while pretty easy, does take up time, and gets boring fast.  It was on this loop that I asked myself \"is this what this game is going to be?  Am I having fun?\"  I also have to note that the majority of the bosses were barely harder than Knuckles from Sonic and Knuckles.  Get close to them and punch as much as you can.  That strategy wins most fights.  There were a couple that required a bit more strategy, but sadly they were the exception, not the norm.\n  At the end of the day, I beat the game, and asked myself again \"am I having fun?\"  I wanted to like this game.  I kept playing in hopes that there was better, but by the end, I was jumping over enemies to reach the end as quick as I could.  The story got me to smile a few times, but the gameplay just wasn't there for me.  Bad level design and poor telegraphing killed the fun to be had.\n  As a side note, if you do play this game, beat the airship first.  You unlock a double jump, which may save you from some of the frustrations of other levels.  I admittedly may have enjoyed the game more if I hadn't played other stages first, which begs the question, why wasn't this in the game from the begining?  If you can access the levels in any order you want, why not make sure that everyone grabs the thing that makes the game more fun first?", "timestamp_created": 1489617511, "timestamp_updated": 1489617511, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.559084", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30512619": {"recommendationid": "30512619", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003732441", "num_games_owned": 554, "num_reviews": 78, "playtime_forever": 56, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489517663}, "language": "english", "review": "Mediocre, not much to say about it. Don't play it.\n\nOne annoying flaw is the font used in cutscenes is a bit small and hard to read.\n\nHere's the moment where I gave up on the game: in the water level, there's a point where if you jump down into the water on one screen, you die, and if you jump down into the water on the next screen over, you go to the next part of the level. This is required to progress. The water looks identical between the two screens. This is a good distance from the previous checkpoint, as well. The water doesn't look inviting in either screen. However, one screen is a dead end and the other screen is not. It would make sense that you jump down into the water in the dead end, right? No other way to progress? Nope, that's the screen where you die. You're expected to figure out that you have to jump down into the water in the non-dead-end screen.

I don't know how it happens but some developers seem perfectly content to make something amazing and just give it away. That's certainly how I felt about Khimera, because the whole time I was playing it I was comparing it in my head to Shovel Knight. That should be pretty high praise, I think, but the comparisons aren't entirely positive.\n\nOn a remote island of monsters, a bunch of monster pirates haul off and steal all the money from town. The local maddish scientist lets his latest creation, a chimera girl with a big funky stone arm, run off to stop them before they abscond with the loot. That gives you a whole island of tricky levels to tackle, with trips back to Mr. Science to turn boss monster DNA into a new power for your patchwork body. There's also loot to score, fairies to free, trades to make, costumes to unlock, and a whole mess of chatty NPCs to get friendly with.\n\nIf this sounds like a load of content for a free title then your head's in the right place. Khimera is a full, feature-rich game that can keep you occupied for hours. While the levels aren't quite as long or numerous as something like Shovel Knight they hide a TON of secrets, and you'll need to do plenty of backtracking and experimenting with new powers if you want to unearth the many kooky sidequests hidden in the villages. Your efforts are rewarded with additional powers, costumes, and most importantly, charming dialogue from the island's colorful inhabitants. While there's a bit of internet humor that's certainly going to date it in a few years, most of the text in Khimera is plenty funny and keeps me going to meet more of the cast.\n\nLuckily the gameplay is able to keep up with the content, featuring some quality retro platforming across plenty of challenging levels. I know I can't shut up about Shovel Knight but that is absolutely the closest thing to Khimera in terms of challenge and level layout. Every stage has plenty of enemies, pits, spikes, and secrets to deal with, and while Khimera never gets as creative with its gimmicks as Shovel Knight it makes up for it with multiple paths through levels. The powers you get from bosses makes platforming a real joy here, starting with a versatile dash attack and expanding to winged double-jumps and shocking ground-pounds.\n\nI mentioned the challenge being similar because it is, though it might stray a little too far on the side of frustration. Checkpoints are sometimes sparse between difficult sections, with the hardest jumps and maneuvers coming at the very end of a sequence. The spikes are happily not instant death but they will mess you up plenty with how abundant and lethal they are, and every bottomless pit is a significant threat. Interestingly the enemies and bosses are probably the least dangerous part of the game, thanks mainly to your powerful dash attack that makes you invincible for several frames. In fact, many of the bosses can be offed by just smashing into them over and over.\n\nThe net result is an excellent retro platformer that'll take you upwards of two hours to beat, and plenty more if you go secret hunting. The graphics are finely detailed in their pixel style, though levels tend to have kinda bland tile repetition. Sound design is definitely more up to the task with memorable tunes and familiar-feeling effects. If this were a paid product I would have no problem at all recommending Khimera, so as a free game I feel justified in ridiculing you if you don't give it a go.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

You don't have to be a genius to realize that a strong punch is supposed to *feel* stronger than a weak punch, plus it seems rather unnecessary for it to be on its own separate button when you could've just made the punch chargeable. Aside from that, the controls are kinda slippery. It lacks the tightness of a good platformer like Shovel Knight. That'd be alright if the game was designed around this fact but it seriously expects you to get unto narrow platforms with these fucking controls. Hell, even the controls for the map are slippery, and that's so baffling to me that it's unreal. I have no idea how anybody could fuck up the controls for a goddamn map.\n\nThe level design starts off alright but takes a dive after just the first level. Shit gets way too hard way too quick, and not in a fun or fair way either. Sometimes you think you're stuck but you just gotta do a move to continue that wasn't explained before. You'd think the tutorial level would explain that *BUT NO*. There's not even a button prompt, instead you're expected to learn from TALKING TO THE CHECKPOINTS. Who'd even think of doing that?

The game wastes no time cutting into the action, 8 main stages, 4 optional stages, a ton of collectables, and a solid setting. The game wears it's megaman influnce on it's sleeve so expect lots platforming with combat mixed in. Took me about 4 hours to beat: I found the levels really challenging and the dash really helps the levels flow.\nThe dev is super friendly as well, when i brought up some questionable level design the dev actually patched my issues out (removed 2 instant death pits and lowered squids health to be one hit). My only complaint now: The dlc costume isn't as good as the witch costume IMO.\nThe story and characters were charming in a kid's superhero comic sort of way, so if you're into short colorful games that wish they were on the NES definitely check out this game.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1481951696, "timestamp_updated": 1481951696, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.575163", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28335074": {"recommendationid": "28335074", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972538083", "num_games_owned": 539, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 734, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493427092}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has so much to offer and you don't have to pay a thing for it. I've played all kinds of platformers and this is absolutely one of my favorites - definitely one of the best free games on steam.\n\nFirst of all, the gameplay is great, and the combat is well thought out. Your character starts with a good set of abilities for both platforming and fighting enemies, and you unlock more as you progress through the game. The dash in particular is a lot of fun to use, especially when you combine it with a jump and zoom across the screen much further than I assume was intended. The sheer number of abilities and the quality of their implementation really set this game apart from much of the competition.\n\nEach level is chosen from a classic overworld map. There is no limit to how many attempts you can make, but most areas will provide a decent challenge and encourage perfectionism. There are also many secrets to be found throughout the whole game, including collectibles, life upgrades and new optional levels. Getting all the optional extras is a lot of fun and added to my enjoyment immensely. There are some very creative challenges to go through to get some of the tougher achievements.\n\nThe whole game has a real charm to it. I found the writing in particular to be very entertaining and funny, and the many NPCs found throughout the game to be very likable. The music is fantastic - really catchy stuff that is well-suited to each level. Khimera's unique style of pixel art is simple, but complements the gameplay quite nicely. For a free indie game the entire package is particularly impressive. Furthermore, the dev is still working on extra content for this game and regularly responds to feedback.\n\nIf you like platformers you have no excuse to not try this game!\n", "timestamp_created": 1481586008, "timestamp_updated": 1481586008, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28314436": {"recommendationid": "28314436", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050626122", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3420, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481460925}, "language": "english", "review": "(Spoiler free)\nI was expecting a simple beat-em-up for some casual fun, ended up staying for most of the acchievements including one which I almost never go for - no in-level deaths.

When I downloaded it some months ago, I didn't think much of it; I saw it as another free game in which to get some achievements. In fact, it wasn't until last week that I started playing it, and I must say it blew me away. This game is tons of fun, and it reminds me of the challenging platformers I used to play as a kid, like the Megaman games. In fact, I'd say that Megaman is a fair comparison; even though you don't get a blaster, you still have to go through different stages, each with a final boss, and you get their abilities after you defeat them. I'd say this game pays a nice homage to the early Megaman games from the NES era.\n\nThe story of the game is simple, but good. It's set in the fictional Morgana Island, somewhere in the Mediterranean, which is inhabited by monsters. After some pirates steal the island's treasure, it's up to Chelshia, a synthetic chimera created by the Professor, the only human living on the island, to stop the pirates and recover the treasure. The dialogue in the story is hilarious, they did a fantastic job with the writing, and the level design is superb as well, with some cleverly challenging levels, with plenty of secrets to discover.\n\nThe gameplay, as I mentioned above, is similar to old platformers. You move around the levels as a 2D sidescroller, although there's a map of sorts between levels; you can replay levels you've already completed, and there's also a few locations you can visit, like Chelshia's home or the island's only village. The combat involves a lot of punching, although Chelshia can also dash, and you get new abilities after defeating bosses or completing special stages. There's also alternate costumes, with one of them unlocking a separate mode called \"Berserk Mode\", in which you are more powerful, but you also take more damage. Other than that, there's plenty of collectibles to find around the levels, most of which are hidden in secret areas: from health upgrades, to info cards on the different characters. The game also includes two extra modes: Race Mode and Berserk Race Mode; the goal of both modes is to finish the game as fast as possible, and they disable cutscenes and the map, playing more like a linear platformer, the main difference is that in Race Mode you get all your abilities except the Berserk suit; and in Berserk Race Mode, you are in Berserk mode with all the abilities unlocked, minus the health upgrades.\n\nThe art style resembles 8-bit games, and so does the soundtrack, with catchy tunes playing across the levels, and special music for boss fights. This all feels fitting with the nature of the game, which seems to be a throwback to the early days of gaming. It also supports controllers; I didn't try it out that way, since I played with the keyboard, but even then, the controls feel pretty good.\n\nWell, I don't think there's much more for me to say, other than to repeat myself, saying that this game really surprised me, and I'll add that I'm looking forward to a sequel.

This game is a solid Platformer with few RPG elements (you can conversate and wander freely in town)\n\nIn this game you play as a Khimera, the Monster Girl who is programmed to find and bring back the treasure from the pirates who stole it from your island. Even though story seems little bit dull and forgettable, interesting characters, bosses and extra stages made it interesting. Collectible cards are very interesting, they reveal additional info about characters in game, even though i dont always collect \"secret\" collectibles in games, i was interested in these.\n\nGameplay is pretty solid, features decent variety of mobs, there are also alot of special attacks and tools you will unlock throughout the game, even the outfits for Khimera. Stages sometimes can feel lenghty, but each can be completed in 5-10 minutes. Stages are also split into checkpoins, and each stage looks different and has different theme.\n\nEven though its good, this game still has some problems, main one being the controls. While you can change them, it is still confusing and hard to perform some combos (for example mermaid anchor attack can be very hard to perform). Also some attacks are basically useless while others are alot better and more useful..\n\nPros:\n- Around 5 Hours of gameplay (For Average Player, if you consider exploring for upgrades and talking to characters; it will probably take couple more hours to collect fairies and cards)\n- Interesting and Funny Characters\n- RPG Elements and few small side quests\n- Collectible Secret Cards (which acctualy reveal interesting info)\n- Decent variety of map and mob design and theme\n- Few different combos and attacks which you unlock through the game, also unlockable outfits\n- Race Mode and Berserk Race for hardcore platformer players\n- Achievements\n- Music is good\n- 3 Save Files\n- Cakeboy\n\nNeutral:\n- Falling off the map is insta death, while getting hit by enemy only takes half of heart (your default hitpoints are 4 hearts and they can raise up raise to 8 hearts if you collect special dishes). Not really a con, but it feels really weird so i just wanted to point this out, its just my 2 cents.\n\nCons:\n- Even though you unlock alot of different attacks, you'll be using just one most of the time (Dash Punch) because its alot better than others. Besides that there is earth breaker which isnt really useful for attacking, rather finding collectibles. Few other attacks are used for specific couple stages, but pretty much useless..\n- No difficulty settings (you cant choose between Easy,Normal,Hard...etc)\n- It could use better dimension settings\n- Its very hard to perform some combos, especially while jumping (Mermaid Anchor, Mimic box...),also Double jump (the one with wings) can sometimes be hard to perform\n- Bosses are pretty much powerless if you spam Dash Attack", "timestamp_created": 1476013737, "timestamp_updated": 1476013737, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500151", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25936113": {"recommendationid": "25936113", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121594693", "num_games_owned": 613, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 344, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475968842}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0425\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438 \u0432\u0430\u0441 \u0433\u043e\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0434\u044c, \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0447\u0438\u043a\u0438.", "timestamp_created": 1475968973, "timestamp_updated": 1475968973, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500416", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25845532": {"recommendationid": "25845532", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072716884", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 963, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485133378}, "language": "english", "review": "Worth the price of $0.00\n\nYou play as a lab experiment that has been militarized as the only defense of an island populated by friendly monsters.\n\nDo you like punching things?

Although I've never been afraid to diss his older games!\n\nI think Khimera is a really fun platformer. It can be really fast paced thanks to the dash, and it has a nice ranking system. The rank is purely based on the amount of money you collect, and you lose money whenever you die. It's simple but effective. I think the variety in moves is good too, and I really like the movement with the dashing.\n\nSomething I don't like about the game is balancing. With how it's set up, the intention is that new powers allow you to get more secrets. Unfortunately, the dash and double jump is so good that you never need the projectiles for any of the secrets. Since the game has been updated, this is no longer a complaint about one power being better than the others. I'm sure the bird power could still be the best, but now it's more of a complaint about not needing the power ups for secrets, ha. But that's not so bad.\n\nThere are two projectiles you eventually get. One is a weak short ranged projectile you can only use at full health and it only does one damage. The other is a projectile you can charge at any time and kill most enemies in one hit! That just doesn't make any sense to me. With the ranking system I mentioned earlier, time doesn't matter. If you wanted to, you could cheese every level by slowly killing every enemy from a distance with the saucy shot. There's way too much value here. (though this might make the game more inviting to players who aren't good at platformers)\n\nI do like the secret collectibles this game has. When you collect some of the secrets, they give you a vague idea of where the other one might be. For example, collecting the first and third collectible book tells you that the other book is between them. I think the one way this could be better is if the game told you what you had while in the level. (I don't think it does, but I could have missed something) The berserk costume reward you get is a good reason to play the levels again. Overall, I'd say that this a satisfying game to 100%, and I'm pretty picky about that with games.\n\nTo nitpick some more, some of the level design is weird to me. Mt. Afrokupa has a random room with bouncing fireballs, and they only show up twice. Why? All it serves is to be a potential cheap death to a player that's rushing. That level feels all over the place, although I do like the ice/fire theme. And I do feel like the Oil Platform level relies too much on spikes. It's a little dull. But everything else is fine, I think!\n\nThe bosses are fine. Though I have to mention that it's really weird that the best power to use against the mermaid boss is the weapon you get from the mermaid. The witch minibosses are easily cheesed by spamming dash punches, although I couldn't say how you could fix that. I don't have anything to say about the other bosses though. The final boss is a good one!\n\nThere's nothing amazing about the story and characters, but it's all simple and cute. There's some great jokes in there too. I do think there's nothing interesting about Chelshia herself, which is a shame since I like her design. It's like she's missing a personality I guess? Life is tough as a main protagonist.\n\nThe sprites are cute, and the music is pretty good. I haven't mentioned some extra stuff, but there's a fun extra minigame and also some speedrun modes.\n\nIn the end, this is a platformer you can play for free. This game is a good way to spend a day or two, and I'd say it's the developer's best game yet! You would most likely have more fun here than with Mighty No. 9. (and I actually like playing that game.

I love the every single character in this game even the normal enemies. You can even talk to the checkpoints.\nThe bosses are really fun (albeit a bit easy) , the music is catch as all hell, the level design is rich , and its just overall an amazing game. I can't believe its free. I mean seriously why is this game free?!?!\n\nIf you are a fan of Megaman , Shovel Knight , Ducktales or anything in this genre please try this game (its free anyway).

Chelshia can punch and dash, which makes for a very dynamic experience, and much like the classic Nintendo platformers, each levels has some sort of gimmick, keeping the experience fresh.  The game can be pretty challenging, but it is reasonably generous on checkpoints.  Defeating bosses gives you new powers, and unlike games where you have some weapon selection screen, these powers are automatically attributed to Chelshia and quickly become second nature, such as a double jump and a charge attack.\n\nMy only issues with the gameplay is that there were times where I didn't know which holes to fall into, other than try and error, and the Dash + Jump combo works about 40% of the time, it feels odd, but that didn't ruin the whole experience.\n\nThe game also has a lot of features for those who wants to get the most out of the game; there are 4 more levels, fairies to save, as well as collecting notebooks, and I left out some more.  I like it because it still provides a full experience for those who only want to complete the game, but still offers a lot more content for those who wants to [strike]get their money's worth[/strike] put more time into it, supporting both playstyles, such an underrated way to make a game nowadays.  It also has an adorable cast of monster girls and quirky dialogues.\n\nThis short game is worth the try for those who likes classic platformers.", "timestamp_created": 1471448845, "timestamp_updated": 1472255138, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520958", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24940719": {"recommendationid": "24940719", "author": {"steamid": "76561198245459744", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471332308}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Buen juego y lo mejor de todo es gratis papu v:", "timestamp_created": 1471290701, "timestamp_updated": 1471290701, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24933752": {"recommendationid": "24933752", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014521982", "num_games_owned": 356, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471194643}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun, funny and a great soundtrack!", "timestamp_created": 1471266879, "timestamp_updated": 1471266879, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500106", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24924190": {"recommendationid": "24924190", "author": {"steamid": "76561198233575124", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 322, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474764623}, "language": "english", "review": "very hard", "timestamp_created": 1471222738, "timestamp_updated": 1471222738, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24905263": {"recommendationid": "24905263", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994686280", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 813, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503461671}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow, what can I say that hasn't already been said? 'Khimera: Destroy All Monster Girls' is not only an amazing game with a ton of heart, it's really fun as well. This game totally caught me off-guard and came out of nowhere to be one of the most fun games I've played all year. So cool!\n\nPROS:\n----------------------------\n- Large, fun levels with lots of variety in the gameplay. (The levels kept introducing new mechanics to kept things interesting.) Very well done.\n- Considerable length (aka -- it's not too short).  I took 10 hours to beat the game! (I like to look for secrets ^_^ )\n- Great characters and dialogue. The charming characters and funny dialogue kept me smiling. I kept being surprised at how well the characters -- and there are a LOT of them -- were fleshed out. There's a whole world of character development here!\n- Great music! I often found myself humming the Oil Level's music as I fell asleep. Great stuff! \n- Lots of collectibles! This is a big one for me. I love games that reward exploration and this one rewards it in spades. Lots of cool secrets and hidden collectible to find. Love it!\n- Cute story with memorable characters. This kind of goes along with the third point. Just really well done.\n- One of the best compliments I can give is that I found the gameplay very compelling. Once I started, I just had to keep playing to see where it went. Just lots of fun. :)\n- It's free. Yup -- this costs a grand total of $0. I would've gladly paid $9.99 for a game like this -- but here it is, free. (It's so good that I had to buy the 'Doctor's Assisstant' DLC just so I  could give the dev *something*. I mean, come on! It's really good! >_<)\n\nCONS:\n----------------------------------------\n- These are more nitpicks than anything else. I think towards the end of the game I saw one grammatical mistake.\n- For a while, I thought one jump in the Oil Level (to get to a secret location), was a little too high. (Turns out I wasn't jumping properly -- so maybe that's on me).\n- I can't really think of anything else. >_<\n\nOVERALL:\n---------------------------------------\n'Khimera: Destroy All Monster Girls' truly is an excellent game. Others have compared it to 'Shovel Knight' in terms of gameplay, tone and scale -- and I think that's a fair comparison. It really is well done and highly recommended. If you're a fan of platformers (or games full of fun characters), I highly recommend checking it out. Also -- it's free!\n\nFINAL SCORE:\n---------------------------------------\n9.5 out of 10\n\n\nEDIT: 05.11.2017\n---------------------------------------\nI just played the 'Harvest Event' Update and it was awesome! I was like, 'Is this free game...that's really good..ALSO GETTING FREE DLC UPDATES WITH NEW CONTENT?!' This is insane! Much respect/love the this game and the dev behind it. Much respect indeed! :)\n\nFINAL SCORE: (updated)\n---------------------------------------\n9.75 out of 10", "timestamp_created": 1471158166, "timestamp_updated": 1494564595, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24820772": {"recommendationid": "24820772", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044242277", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 418, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470891479}, "language": "english", "review": "A wonderful little romp of a game.

This game right here, 'Khimera: Destroy All Monster Girls' is slowly becoming one of my personal favorites. I only found out about it a couple days ago, and it's practically all I've been playing since.\n\nThe story's that there's this island called Morgana, inhabited mainly by monster girls. These pirate monster girls come to the island and steal all of it's money. You play as this demon girl created by a mad scientist (he's not really) and you've been chosen to get back the island's fortune from the pirates with your new golem arm.\n\nThis is an action platformer which bears a striking resemblance in playstyle to Megaman, specifically the Megaman X games. You got your dashs, dash jumps, air dashs, shootin'... Well, maybe not so that. As well as dashing, you also have a variety of close-ranged melee attacks to pick off your enemies. From the world map you select stages to go to find and collect as much money as you can and fight a boss at the end. \n\nSimilar to Megaman, as you defeat these bosses, you'll gain their powers, making the next stages easier. Unlike Megaman, all these powers you get are passive upgrades to your already powerful golem arm cannon. As a result, there are no real 'weaknesses' to any of the stage's obstacles and or bosses, meaning you can go through each stage without feeling like you're missing anything you need to win.\n\nThe controls are tight, simple, and easy to get into. The buttons are also fully customizable to fit your needs for keyboard and controller. The graphics are simplistic and retro, obviously trying to capture the aspect of the good ol' 16-bit era. The music is very catchy, and the songs are fitting for their location. It's kind of a side thing, but the game has a very cutesy charm to it. Through the writing and characters, it's quite appealing to that demographic for old video game fans and fans of monster girls. I can't say I don't understand that demographic. *wink* Don't be fooled by it's looks though, this game is quite challenging. It has that happy-go-lucky feel when you're doing good, and the crushing feeling of defeat when you die and lose that 100% treasure collection.\n\nThe game is however, very short. You can beat it in little under 30 minutes if you're not going for any secrets or 100% completion. It does have that replay value of finding all the secrets, doing everything, and trying to get the fastest times on all stages. If not, you may not find this an appealing purchase. But wait...The game is completely FREE TO PLAY! (Unless you buy DLC that is)\n\nIn conclusion, I highly recommend you play this game. Even if action games aren't your forte, you should definitely give this one a go.

You aren't likely to walk off ledges or do something stupid too easy(except on the airship stage). And that said, the controls are very simple and easy to get a hold of, especially the game's incredibly important dash attack. It's just a simply dash like in any other game(with an air version too), but it'll always be there when speed running or you need to jump large gaps. It's chock full of oddball humor, especially durring boss encounters, which include things like a pizza slime, that always manages to be endearing or at least chickle inducing.\n\nThe only negative I'd have to say is level design. It's effective \"big brother game\" Shovel Knight, was always about making levels where if you messed up it was your fault entirely(some exceptions). The levels were designed percise and expertly. In Khimera, they are less so. They are a few jerkish designs for some levels(airship in particular) that just clearly shouldn't have been a good idea in hindsight. Like, areas where a mistake will cost you your life, and not by pits. They are plenty of good scenes, but occasionaly some stupid bits slip in and put a plug on the fun for a while.\n\nIn any event, this is certainly a game that could have been sold for 5 - 10 aproximate USD but chose to be a freebie.

The game itself is also much more forgiving then  most old school platformers. The stages themselves can be tricky, the pirate ship ones having lots of traps that need good timing to avoid. But the bosses are all easy. They leave themselves open for long periods which means rushing in and smashing them in the face is the way to go. The only boss to put up a challenge is the last stage of the final boss, and that's more due to the moving platfroms and the spikes you have to deal with.  The game is short, but that's to be expected when it's free.

This game was made with GameMaker, but don't be fooled, it's a good experience.\n\nPlay as Chelshia, a chimera who was created to accomplish household chores, but was modified at the last minute to stop some evil-doers with her \"Rock Arm\". Wait.....this sounds familiar........ You'll be facing off against monster girl pirates who have stolen from the town of good monster girls and....wait, this IS familiar!!\n\nThat's right, this game is essentially a fusion of Rockman (Megaman) and Shantae...only with a focus on monster girls! Face off against a naga, a harpy, a mermaid, a mimic (chest), a pizza slime (like...a slimegirl made of pizza) and a dridder (spider girl)!!!\n\nPROS:\n+ Retro gameplay\n+ Free\n+ Achievements\n+ Great humor\n+ Challenging start\n+ Occassional lesbian humor and tsundere humor\n+ Small download (51 MB)\n\nCONS:\n- Starts a bit hard, but rewards you a bit too much for collecting everything (Berserk's pros outweigh the cons)\n- Feels a bit generic in the beginning (but the game grows on you)\n- Dash attack can be spammed to win easilly.\n\n\nIf you want a free Rockman (Megaman) or Shantae, this is right up your alley. A free game you'll be surprised at for not having a price tag.\n\n\n8.5/10 A worthy addition to Steam. :) This game promotes violence against monster women and perpetuates the hurtful stereotype that skeletons control the world's banks. This game plays pretty fast and gives a good challenge. Character designs and music are also neat. Pretty worthwhile, even if it wasn't free. The story is somewhat simple but really well executed. The controls are a little wonky at first but you get used too it pretty quickly. It's really fun to play. It has a lot of unique characters, levels and music which keeps the gameplay interesting and exciting as it goes on. It also has a lot of replay value as well. Even after finishing the game, you can still keep yourself busy and entertained trying to get all the extra stuffs.\n\nIt's a good game, certainly better then a lot of free games out there. It's even worth paying some money for, in my opinion. Khimera: Destroy All Monster Girls is a fun and quirky platformer that reminds me of games from my childhood. Best of all is the price tag at the low, low price of free. The game is fleshed out with quite a few levels, each with their own themes and each containing various secrets, such as fairies to find. Upon completing levels you're given a ranking based on your performance.\n\nKhimera's difficulty level probably falls more in line with your own skill and ability. If you're impatient like I am, you'll find the game to be a bit more difficult because you'll hurry along. This leads to missing things like jumps, some of which are very precise, or running headlong into enemies. I will say I found the game a bit easier once I started using a controller. \n\nOverall this game is a lot of fun to play if you enjoy platformers and with the free price, what do you have to lose? It's not even a large download!\n\nI did record a few stages - completely intact with my deaths - so people could get an idea of exactly how it plays:  https://youtu.be/-6i5pkJjDxw An obvious labor of love that's a great break away from all the other stupid and easy free games on steam. Really worth it to get into the game and conquer it. This game has amazing concepts and mechanics HOWEVER the controllers and the boss fighting are a bit lacking.. You can literally spam the dash attack and win EVERY TIME, just throw yourself with the dash attack and you gonna win, except for Mimi since she has a special mechanic but still.. Other than that, fun game and since it's free why not give it a try? So far this game's playing pretty good. I like the star man, he's the real star of the show. \n\nOh yeah, All thes secrets and overworld design is neat.", "timestamp_created": 1464383445, "timestamp_updated": 1464383445, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506821", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23233608": {"recommendationid": "23233608", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040216870", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 823, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498331332}, "language": "english", "review": "Why is it that all the games i'd pay for are free? this was a good time, bad puns decent difficulty. still playing, those A ranks and no deaths wont get themselves", "timestamp_created": 1464353143, "timestamp_updated": 1464353143, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23229863": {"recommendationid": "23229863", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080837717", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1859, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493527287}, "language": "english", "review": "Khimera is a short and humorous beat 'em up that has interesting and fun characters, challenging but fair levels, and an amazing soundtrack.

If you like platformer games at all then you pretty much have to play this game since not only is it completely free, but it is also a very solid little game. \n\nI am not a platformer fan at all so I found the game to be a bit too difficult at first, but fortunately, with a bit of practice and some helpful tips I will get to in a second, you will eventually be left wondering why you were having so much trouble with these levels earlier.\n\nI'm not sure what motivated me to stick with the game despite my early struggles, it could be the nice looking retro graphics, the awesome music, or the excellent and funny writing, but there was just a charm to this game that made me want to keep trying. \n\nYou can tell alot of care went into it, definitely worth a try! I had alot of fun in the time I had with it.\n\nPros:\n- fast and fun gameplay\n- nice and unique character designs\n- really great music\n- lots of funny dialogue\n- surprising amount of secrets and extras for a free game\n\nCons:\n-some of the checkpoints are too far apart for my taste (I'm looking at you, oil rig!)\n-at the point where you can choose the order in which you will beat the next 4 stages, the game's 2 hardest levels (Mt. Afrokoopa and oil rig) happen to be the closest to your starting position.\n-a couple of the bosses can be cheesed pretty hard by your dash attack.\n-the new race mode achievement, while not impossible, is a bit too unforgiving.\n\nand finally, if you're like me when it comes to these kind of games, here's some tips I found invaluably helpful:\n\n-dash attack is your best friend, its not only awesomely effective against most enemies but there are a ton of jumps that require you to use dash. If you are having a hard time getting the dash to work properly on your keyboard then try using W for it instead!

Its style and personality counts for a lot, but the difficulty may not suit some players.\n\nPros: [list]\n[*] Really nice art style with a wide range of great character designs.\n[*] Amusing dialogue and an interesting plot.\n[*] Really nails that 'retro' feeling throughout.\n[*] A sort of mixture of Mario 3, Mega Man and Castlevania.\n[*] Some good platforming [i](see below)[/i] and plenty of hidden collectables.\n[*] It's free, so you risk nothing by trying it. [/list]\n\nNeutrals: [list]\n[*] Treasure pickups are your rank, and dying removes a chunk of cash. A single death will pretty much guarentee no A-rank, and almost all of my ranks are C. It promotes perfectionism and punishes the smallest mistakes (though there is no 'punishment' beyond the rank itself). [/list]\n\nCons: [list]\n[*] Insta-death platforming, where one mistimed jump will ruin your no-death run of the level and send you way back. Enemy hits stun you mid-air, too.\n[*] Sparse checkpoints and health pickups are extremely rare, so be prepared to replay 5-10 minutes over and over until you get it right. On instakill, two-block-wide platforming sections with wind, this becomes incredibly frustrating.\n[*] Enemies enter the space you occupy and damage you with contact. While your defence against this had improved since 1.2, it is still a major source of damage from enemies that attack you, remaining out of hit-range and stunning you from turning. This is compounded by flying, tracking enemies that are incredibly hard to hit --even pixels above your head-- if they're slightly off-center. Not only that, but it makes the dash-attack extremely risky, as it will usually result in you taking damage too. These might be fixed with enemeis being knocked back when they damage you, slightly wider range on vertical attacks, and some invunerability frames on the dash.[/list]\n\nIn summation, it's really cute and worth trying. The platforming is fun when it isn't a series of insta-death drops; the fighting is mashy and basic enemies can overcome you if you're not paying attention; and the difficulty is punishing, but levels are actually completeable now, so I can happily recommend this to everyone (but don't expect to fly through it).", "timestamp_created": 1463449591, "timestamp_updated": 1463920783, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23029455": {"recommendationid": "23029455", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996669936", "num_games_owned": 408, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 587, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493080754}, "language": "english", "review": "Basically somebody said \"What if Shovel Knight was monster girls???\".\n\nPros:\n-Interesting and replayable stages\n-Good bosses\n-Pizza is strong\n-Everything is animated nicely\n\nCons:\n-You're not going to have as much fun if you don't do the airship stage first.\n-Much better with a game pad", "timestamp_created": 1463442154, "timestamp_updated": 1463811684, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23028749": {"recommendationid": "23028749", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964619686", "num_games_owned": 978, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 512, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462313244}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a great, Shovel Knight-esque game.

It's also free so if you can just try it for yourself, watch the first cutscene or play the first level, and you'll probably be sold (or not) on the game, and then decide if you want to buy the Nurse outfit DLC. (which is only a dollar anyways).  Got everything in the game (except the speedrun challenges) in 8 hours which is pretty good considering this is free.  I also love games that give bonus entries on things, and this one gives entries for every boss, enemy, and most other characters in the game if you collect the journals.\n\nThe game's pretty Megaman styled with the basic formula being going through a stage, beat the boss, and get an upgrade.  There's hidden stages too which also give power-ups for completing them, and one sub-quest in the town that gives you one more.  Some of the collectables (as well as the detonators that unlock the other stages) are pretty well hidden, but you can get an upgrade which helps look for them.  The titular Khimera also has the same backstory as Megaman (A creation made to clean the lab, that must be hastily upgraded to be combat ready and fight evil).  The biggest problem is the bosses are a bit too easy, and you can often kill them before even needing to figure out their patterns fully, but the bosses include a slime made out of Pizza, and an engineer harpie that secretly like anime which is pretty great.  You chat with these bosses all the time too, even after beating them, and they're great characters to hang around.  If anything, the hidden boss, the Chi-bear-a, is the most disappointing because you don't do anything else with it besides the boss fight and the journal entry.  At least the last boss was a bit more difficult, and the secrets can be a bit harder to find (spoilers: the last two I got were the journal in the \"Cake boy\" minigame that appears in a later stage, and the tent on the World map that you can walk into).\n\nI'd easily recommend this game.  Primarily because it's free, but you can also get the Doctor's assistant DLC just to support the developers anyways.

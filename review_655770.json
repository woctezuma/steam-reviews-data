Although its far from perfect because of stuff like not having the best looks as in asthetics, the artwork is fantastic and the story is very interesting, having two people that suffer from severe mental illnesses help each other out gives the main characters that deep bond of trust and love. Many people may refrain from buying games such as this simply because of it having sexual content, but dont judge a book by its cover, there are only 2 sexual scenes on the whole game and they dont seem forced, one thing i love about Sierra is that his aproach to sex in most of his games isnt just a: \"Oh hey, i like you, lets have exaggerated sex about 50 times untill the game is over with a allways happy ending that the main player really has no controll over\", Sierra aproaches sex either as actuall love making (such as the two scenes in this game and some of the scenes in The Last Sovereign) or part of the plot (such as most of the succubi scenes in The Last Sovereign, in witch either the succubi are dying from sex deprivation, or they are unsuccubi that are on the verge of death), He never forces a sex scene that serves no purpose but fan service witch is one of the reasons that i love his work. All and all i sincerely recomend buying and playing this game, adult content on or off the story is going to get you hooked and youll probably have a lot of fun checking out Sierra's other work, i definetly recomend having a look at The Last Sovereign, i must have sunk at least 80 hours into that game, it has a very interesting story and gameplay, the game has it all, economics, politics, fighting, puzzles, mistery, war... the list goes on.

I've played through a number of endings so far, but haven't gotten the best ending yet.  I will get all of the endings one way or another.  If I have to, I'll download some sort of guide.\n\nYes, the game has a yandere, but this yandere is more likeable than most.  This game is very much a character-driven game, and the two main characters felt more real than visual novel characters usually do.\n\nI did see a couple reviewers complaining about a lack of choices.  That isn't entirely true.  I think there were a sufficient number of choices for the length of the game, but most of the choices individually have only a small effect on the story. \n The choices feel like they don't really matter because the story doesn't branch much until the end.  I wish that you could at least pick where to go when you go on a date or something, even if it didn't affect the overall story much.\n\nThis game seems like it counts how many \"right\" or \"wrong\" choices you make, and better endings are open to you if it's above a certain value.  Alot of other games do the same thing, but this game doesn't hide it well because of the lack of branching.\n\nTo be fair, I haven't found all the endings yet.  I expect the true ending is probably branches pretty significantly, but I don't know for sure.  I enjoyed this game enough that I will keep playing it until I get all the endings.\n\nEven so, buy this visual novel.  I bought it on sale, but, in retrospect, I would gladly have paid the full $10 to get it sooner.    You're better off paying $10 for this short visual novel than paying alot more for some of the garbage visual novels I see from time-to-time.\n\nI would very much like to see some sort of sequel, though the story doesn't seem to leave alot of loose ends to tie up later.\n\nEdit: Btw, you'll have to download a patch to make this game uncensored so that you can see all of the content.

We have John, the protagonist, who suffers from crippling depression and views the world only in the color grey. His life completely turned around when one day, he meets this strange individual. Next we have the main heroine, Lizzie, who is what is referred to as a yandere. A crazy, psychopathic murderer who will kill anyone in the way for her loved one (Including the one they love). However, without going into too much spoilers, there is more to her personality than it initially appears.\n\nThroughout the novel, there are many multiple choices that you can make. And to my surprise, many of the choices actually do have and affect on the outcome of the story. As the summary of the game says, some choices can lead you to happiness. Others can lead to your demise. Some choices can affect other minor characters as well. \n\nAbout the premise of the story and the main character. I found it to be quite realistic. Many people in today's society suffer from depression, so it can be quite relatable in that sense. But it's also not odd for someone to come across that one crazy girl in school that appears to be extremely fascinated with you. \n\nAs for Lizzie. I found her to be a very well written and great character all around. She was straight up a yandere, there was no doubt about it. She was ready to murder anything in the way, if she felt it was necessary to protect the protagonist. However, what I loved was that as you continue to read, throughout her insanity, there was still plenty of humanity in her cold, dead eyes.\n\nWould I recommend this visual novel? Yes, I would. If you're a fan of visual novels and looking for something less cliche, this is the one for you. The story and characters are both very well written. Keep in mind that this does contain possibly a touchy subject for some, as well as mature content. There are a fair amount of branching paths, many of your choices (even the tiniest ones) change how the game plays out. \n\nOh, there's also a [b]FREE[/b] 18+ patch provided by the developer themselves.

This story has some subversion of this, which I found satisfying.\n\nAlso, for a story in which the female lead has a fantastical mental illness, the male lead's depression is very realistic.\n\nI would not have picked this out on my own, especially since it's apparently one of those games with adult content you can patch in, so I'm very grateful to the friend who bought it for me.

They're not social people. They don't have a lot of interpersonal connections, and the fact that they can forge such a link with one another leads to a lot of self-exploration and self-discovery.

I'm not used to playing visual novels that offer you a good amount of choices to pick. Some of the outcomes that result from whatever choices I made actually managed to surprise me, and impressingly so. It's a short game, but, even though it is a short game, there's still a good amount of content packed in the game. I'm interested in unlocking all the alternate endings the game has to offer.\n\nI like how Lizzie is literally a yandere, rather than your typical wanna-be and \"cringy\" yandere. With the sensing aura this game contains, you play as an ill character, and you deal with an ill character who is attracted to you. You got a literal psychotic girl who is attracted to you, and your character is very self conscious. Oh, and literally your character sees the world as gray, except for the characters that he interacts with. How more mentally depressing could the game be?\n\nAs depressing, and eerie even, the game might be, I still found myself fascinated by its visual style. Usually the game's atmosphere is visually grey almost completely, the music can be eerie when things are getting creepy, and usually the character you play as is hopeless right from the beginning of the game, due to his depression. But that's what I really like about the game, that you can choose the way your character acts and thinks, and because of that, you can tone down Lizzie's psychotic acts. You can help Lizzie contain her mental illness, while she in return can tone down your crippling depression.\n\nIf looking for a not-so typical and cliche visual novel to play, you ought to try \"Crimson Gray\". Choices in the game do matter, you actually feel more in control compared to other visual novels, or hell, games remotely based on pure decision-making. I felt more in control with this game than I did with a game by Telltale Games. Though games like those are episodic, rather than a whole game like \"Crimson Gray\". As it's been stated, \"Crimson Gray\" contains mature themes, the game managed to actually make me feel uncomfortable. But even so, I appreciate how this is another game that tackles mental illnesses/psychological issues. This is one of the best visual novel games I've played.

I was truly interested in both characters for once in this kind of game, finding out what motivated Lizzie to do the crazy things that she does, while enjoying John's different dark take on the world. It is so refreshing not to play as some stereotypical handsome/somehow gets all the ladies guy like in many other games of this genre. And I was genuinely interested in learning about Lizzie as a character rather than just some copy/paste girl with an identifiable attractive trope which you might see in other games, romancing for the sake of it.\n\n I also find the dynamic between the characters refreshingly unique due to the sheer difference in contrast of yandere obsession combined with his inwardly negative/lacking any self-worth perspective of the world. Seeing the two of them grow/change over the story and discover the different endings was a treat as well as it helped me really connect more with both characters.\n\nIn conclusion, I think this is a remarkable story and would highly recommend you giving this a try for yourself!\n\n(As a quick disclaimer for transparency sake, I happen to have already played the game on the creator\u2019s Patreon, which is why my play time isn't that long.

No magical hug or a talk with a shrink would be able to cure her and make her 'normal'; as such, rather than changing herself completely, she constantly struggles to get our protagonist to accept her for what she really is.\n\nSpeaking of the protagonist, John, he also is perfect for this kind of story. It is exactly his crippling depression, that allows him to remain calm in face of constant danger - as he simply could not be bothered to care, whether he lives through another interaction with Lizzie. Very easy for all of us, edgelords, to relate to :D\n\nThe soundtrack, while not being too diverse, fits each scene very well, with several memorable peaceful melodies, as well as some intense atmospheric tunes.\n\nThe fact that CGs are only present for the extremely important events and all endings is complemented by the well-drawn sprites with a variety of facial expressions. Grey backgrounds also reflect the mood of the protagonist very nicely.\n\nI've played a ton of yandere VNs and watched a lot of anime with the trope, and still, this game managed to exceed all of my expectations.

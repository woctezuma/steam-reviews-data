What is it about this 1997/98 game that is so appealling?\n\n- Limited population. Manpower is a constant concern, and population growth is slow. Unlike other RTS where its simply a matter of gather resource and magically units are always produced at buildings by expending resource, in 7KAA the supply of people is constant concern and limitation. You must manage where people go. Do they work in the mines, or factories or science towers? Do they train in your forts or become spies? Will there be enough peasants to grow food? You need to manage and conserve manpower.\n\n- Expansion. Complicated and interesting. Play with neutral village resistance as high to get this point better. You can't just conqour a village at will. You need a plan. Will you build a linking fort with a high ranking general of the same nationality, and wear them down with offering good governance? Will you bribe them with grants (less effective if too frequent) will your good reputation help you? Will you sell them goods and give them jobs in a factory or science tower? Or will you just attack them and massacre all defenders? The last option means there are less peasants to make use of afterwards, but it is the quickest if your army is strong enough. Note manpower needed for conquest, and what manpower can be gained from the capture.\n\n- Loyalty and reputation. If your people's loyalty drops, they defect. Generals who go unpaid or are bribed can switch sides, taking all the troops in the fort with them. Leave people out in the open for too long and they get sick of the wet and cold and switch sides. Villages with low loyalty might defect, especially if not goverened by a general. If you run out of money or food, people willl quit your services very quickly, in addition to your buildings collapsing for want of maintenance.\n\n- Nationality and culture. Maybe since the late 1990's its become uncool to talk about differences in culture. In this game however it matters. Villages prefer a general of the same culture, and it is useful to have like with like for maintaining loyalty.\n\n- Taxation. Tax them too hard or too often and the loyalty drops and you might have a rebellion. Don't tax enough and you run out of money - very bad. You can set auto tax when loyalty reaches a level.\n\n- Trade. Best way to make money. Either mine raw materials and manufacture them, or buy raw goods and produce them for sale. You can sell to your own villages, to other kingdoms with a trade treaty, and to villages with resistance below threshold (50). You need to seize and hold resources, but be mindful that ungoarded mines can be captured if a village is planted nearby.\n\n- Espionage. Spies, everywhere. This adds interesting complexity. You need spies to counter-spy and also to find out what the other kingsdoms are up to. You can also use spies to lower resistance in neutral villages, and lower loyalty in enemy villages. There are nuetral individuals that might join your kingdom (immigration) and they might be legit or they might be spies. If I see any individual doing something I did not tell them to do, I get suss and execute them. If they were a spy this is revealed, and if not, then I have lost a person who could have been productive elsewhere. Spies can bribe an enemy general to become a spy and if successful they can defect taking the fort and troops with them. Spies can also attempt assasination but this is risky.\n\nSkill. People's skills improve over time. Soldiers train up in a fort. Leaders increase leadership. Workers, miners and scientists slkill up and produce more outputs, faster, and so do construction and spies. This is an interesting component where you can think into the future on what skills you need, or if you need to retrain people. Lower skilled generals are less effective at governing, and highly skilled spies are more effective.\n\nWar. While the combat is *very basic* and one of the least attractive features of this game, some concepts are interesting. An army can drop loyalty and switch sides. Proximity of generals to troops matters. Losing your king in battle can be devestating and cause general rebellion until a new high leadership general is made king. Seige weapons are overpowered, hoever they are balanced in that they are quite expenesive to build and maintain. Build too many and you'll run out of money, the machines collapse from lack of maintenance and soldiers defect for not being paid.\n\nFrythans. I don't find this feature all that attractive but it does add some fun to those interested in fantasy. There are monster lairs ad trasure to be found in them. One useful thing to look out for is if an enemy is fighting Frythans, it means they are not defending something or being weakened by losses or enriched by treasure. Something to keep in mind. While here, I'll comment on greater beings. I didn't find this much use other than it looks cool to build a temple and invoke a greater being from worshippers.\n\nMusic. I like the soundtrack. Nuff said. Sound effects are fairly basic but do the job.\n\nOverall:\n\nLooking past the graphics and the basic combat, its a fascinating game. Don't bother with the sequels, they're crap.\n\n8/10.", "timestamp_created": 1510377661, "timestamp_updated": 1510378068, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36418179": {"recommendationid": "36418179", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073092169", "num_games_owned": 617, "num_reviews": 599, "playtime_forever": 189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476249265}, "language": "english", "review": "ok", "timestamp_created": 1510320196, "timestamp_updated": 1510320196, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.438379", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36121221": {"recommendationid": "36121221", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091573374", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 202, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509451681}, "language": "english", "review": "My first RTS game growing up, this game was extremely immersive and ahead of it's time with a variety of features and complex mechanics, truly a masterpiece.\n\nI still get a rush of nostalgia whenever i play it. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1509304287, "timestamp_updated": 1509304287, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35004834": {"recommendationid": "35004834", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158630769", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 683, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503735169}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Todo un clasico del RTS.

First game i've ever bought (still have the huge box here), and probably one of my games i played most.\n\nIn this strategy game manpower is your primary resource instead of wood or anything. Also unit specialization is different from most strategy games i've played; every unit regardless of there profession can fight and improve combat skills up to the same cap, with their profession level improving the thing they were meant for (i.e. researches with a high research skill level progress your weapon development a lot faster when in a tower of science).\n\nWhat this game lacks in unit variety (7 original types of people with 3 new peoples added with ancient adversaries, and each unit from the same nationality having the same combat abilities; several boats and siege weapons and a few \"greater beings\") it makes up for with its more complex attributes like espionage which this game has worked out really well.\n\nThe game originated from 1997, it's graphics have aged a fair amount yet they did not do so in a horrible way. Also this game, and it's sequel (Seven Kingoms II; frythan wars) are nothing alike to the rather horrible Seven Kingoms: Conquest, which we should forget it was ever made.\n\nI cant truly recommend this game to anyone looking for a unique RTS experience, if they don't mind playing a game that is rather old.

This is my 2nd game EVER which I have ever ran on the PC platform and yes first RTS game which I actually ran on PC platform as well! Yes, you know - this game is a legend also.\nWhy? - Don't look graph. side, graph. actually doesn't so matter in this game, but gameplay does. And this is what is game bringing actually to the public.\nI was like 11-12 years old when I was playing this game on my (still working!) almighty Pentium 133 mhz with 48mb EDO ram and 3dfx Voodoo Banshee (with Win95OSR2). And yes I spent tons of time playing this game, and funny fact is when I bought this game on Steam, when I ran it on my new PC - actually I forgot how to play this, because actually 18-19 years have passed by (now currently in the time of writing this review I am actually 30 years old). Time is passing by - but believe me, the best games are immortal - like this one.\nPlease buy this - just not only because of nostalgia matter, but because this game has a strong legend status (at least for me). \nI don't like to write negatives about this game, but only one thing is little bit problematic, you can't actually change resolution in this game, since this game is running I think 640x480 resolution (more-less) - even in full-screen which is slightly annoying if you ask me. \nSo if you play this game on big-wide TV screen like me, then believe me - you'll have some hard times to find actually what it's writing on the screen, because font is too small because of small resolution. \nBut if you're still on good old CRT monitors (just kidding you know) then you can play this without any problems.\nBut I can't still believe one thing, that this game is working on modern systems - at least it's working on my Win10 with Annivesary 2016 update - it's working WITHOUT any problems. \n\nBUY IT - GAME IS WORTH OF EVERY MONEY!\n\nCheers!", "timestamp_created": 1477525379, "timestamp_updated": 1477525379, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.465686", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26134928": {"recommendationid": "26134928", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086850278", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477852029}, "language": "german", "review": "Damals ein gro\u00dfartiges Spiel in das bereits mehrere hundert Stunden Spielzeit flossen als noch lange nicht an Steam zu denken war.

I don't know what inspired me to grab Seven Kingdoms off the store shelf in 1998 but I still consider this game one of the best I've ever played and feel sorry for all the other strategy gamers who have probably never heard of it. Imagine the depth of empire building Civilization offers mixed with the fun battles of RTS titles like Age of Empires. out of all the strategy games I have played there hasn't been another game that made me feel more like I was actually ruling a country like this game does and that has been the reason I have played it regularly for so many years. Hell it's so good I bought it off steam even though I've always owned a physical and digital copy. You can win at this game in so many different ways depending on what  you devote your focus to espionage, economy, diplomacy, pure muscle, technology just to name a few. Feel lucky you stumbled across this game on steam because this game isn't main stream but damn sure deserves to be.\n\tSeven Kingdoms can be tremendously fun to play with friends and one of the most successful ways to do that with such an aged game is through game ranger but there are other methods out there. You may have to do some googling to get the multi-player going but is very much worth the effort if you happened to know someone else who knows how to play it or is willing to learn.\n\t It really holds up to the test of time because there still hasn't been another game just like it made yet sadly. The only negative thing I can say about the game is that there is so much depth it has quite the learning curve but couldn't be more worth it so don't give up on it. Hell I still feel like I'm learning things about this game after so many years of playing it. Luckily my physical copy came with a manual to help me along when I was just started playing and I recommend keeping your PDF copy handy.\n\tjust a side note if the game starts up all rainbow colored open up your screen resolution window and leave it open in the background and reboot the game. it should cure the issue (I'm using windows 7).

Un juego con un reconocimiento en la \u00e9poca injusto, pasando bastante desapercivido, quiz\u00e1 no fu\u00e9 gr\u00e1ficamente mejor que la competencia, pero su profundidad mereci\u00f3 estar en el top de los mejores RTS, ojal\u00e1 alg\u00fan d\u00eda haya un juego de estrateg\u00eda de esta saga sencillo como el primero, pero con profundidad, de momento a disfrutarlo de nuevo.", "timestamp_created": 1468838408, "timestamp_updated": 1468838408, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512195", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24300579": {"recommendationid": "24300579", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020061292", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1073, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 62, "last_played": 1515522217}, "language": "english", "review": "An overlooked classic shadowed by the simplistic RTS games of its era like Age of Empires.

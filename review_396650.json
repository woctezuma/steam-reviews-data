The mecha stuff is all pretty basic anime stuff too, and they don't actually play THAT big of a role. That being said, ACE Academy does do some things differently that other visual novels most certainly do not.\n\nLet's start with\n\n[h1] The Positives [/h1]\n\n- [b]Western writing[/b]\nThis might seem like a strange remark, but the writing is very obviously NOT done by \"professionals\". It feels a lot like a fan-sub or something, and some of the jokes are very off-putting at first, untill you get used to them at least. \n\nOne of my favourite parts about this, and why I consider it a positive, is that no jokes are lost in translation or anything like that. There are tons of refferences that any decently well-established anime and video games fan can understand, everything from Gladiator (movie), Power Rangers and Metal Gear Solid has a small refference, and while it does take out some of the seriousness, I don't think it goes so far as to disrupt the actual experience.\n\n- [b]Still anime[/b]\nThis might seem like a negative, but as I mentioned, it's really more a case of getting used to it. The writing can seem really chessy, clich\u00e9 and silly at the start but, at least in my case, you get used to it, and it actually becomes really charming and endearing.\n\nEspecially towards the end, the games actually becomes really wholesome, and a character that used to be comic relief, actually has some really touching moments, while still staying in character. When I thought back about it, it really reminds me of some of my favourite animes, and just like anime in general, you have to get used to the way the story is presented.\n\n- [b]Voice acting[/b]\nOriginal English Voice Acting. Few anime-related games with actual good English voice acting actually exist, most of them either go way overboard or fall completely flat, mainly due to most dubs being made by either pros who don't really know what they are dealing with, or complete amateurs who despite trying their best, end up going a bit too far.\n\nA few good examples, like the Full Metal Alchemist dub and Sunrider come to mind, and this game definetely makes it to the list as well. The voice actors manage to capture the kind of over-emotional nature of anime without going completely overboard. A lot of the voice acting was very impressive to listen to, and the actors really nail the anime tone, which I can definetely appreciate.\n\n- [b]Actually engaging writing[/b]\nWith all the unusuals out of the way, ACE Academy is also just a really well written visual novel! It's a bit cheery, sometimes I kind of missed some REAL tragedy, but it's good at what it does. One of the things I personally really enjoyed was the fact that your potential love interests actually find their own girl/boyfriends without you, and you get to watch it happen. This was, for me, one of the first times I had witnessed something like this, and I loved it! It's incredibly heart-warming, not to mention refreshing since for once the entire universe doesn't revolve around you.\n\nDespite not actually getting a girl in my first run (I stuck with the bro-dude), it was still such a warm and nice experience.\n\n\n[h1] The Negatives [/h1]\n\nThe two first positives could be viewed as negatives. It's a matter of taste, but I'm guessing most people even showing interest in the game will already be aware of the anime nature of it's being, so let's get to the actual negatives.\n\n- [b] It's too good [/b]\nEverything goes a little too well in my opinion, and making to go well is incredibly easy. Especially considering how open the ending is, with it cutting off right before any interesting drama could occur, the game felt a tad too sweet. I appreciate that there was no edgy under-plot (I think Doki-Doki drained me of my desire for that, even that game was a bit too far for me tbh), but I would have still liked some sort of hurdle to overcome.\n\nStill, the game does have its fair share of mysteries and drama, just nothing that wasn't resolved very quickly. The exception being the thing with your dad, which, again, you never really get to see the actual conclusion of.\n\n- [b] The Battles [/b]\nThe actual mech battles are incredibly dissapointing. Coming from a game like Sunrider or even Kamidori or some Rance game into this will leave you starving for a more interesting distraction from dialogue. Personally, I didn't mind it too much, since it fits the already light-hearted and casual nature of the VN itself, but I do feel like it's a missed oppurtunity. I sure as hell would have loved some Sunrider-esque turn-based mech action, instead of the incredibely easy timed choices.\n\nThe game focuses more on dialogue than this, and the art is still decent, so this might be more of a let-down for some more than others.\n\n\n[h1] TL;DR [/h1]\n\nACE Academy is a very wholesome and heart-warming experience, that still manages to not be too aimless and casual, having it's fair share of memorable, funny and/or thoughtful moments. The art is average in skill, but impressive in passion, the music is bland and unmemorable, but enhances the experience well, and the writing is fantastic.\n\nWhile it lacks any real tension, at least any that lasts for very long, it still manages to grip the reader consistently with great character building, passion and heartwarming moments! A real feel good game.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend ACE Academy to anyone who likes choose-your-own-adventure style visual novels. Plenty of routes to explore in this one, which adds enough hours to warrant the price tag, at least in my opinion.\n\nIf you liked the plot and feel of games like Sunrider, then you should pick this up immediately!\n\n[h1] Verdict [/h1]\n\nA solid\n\n[b] 7 / 10 [/b]\n\nA feel-good game that is excellently written, and oozing with funny and memorable moments that had me reacting in a way that few stories do.

The art style, voice acting, characters, and everything about it is phenomenal. This game has become my favorite visual novel and one of my favorite games I've played in 2017. There's a wide assortment of unique characters, and the romance was very well executed. Even if you already settle on a romantic interest, every other character still plays a big role in the story, which is something I respect. It gives off a Persona vibe, too, which the game actually even references! There are a lot of references in the game, some of them are of dead memes which might make you cringe, but I was laughing quite a bit through the game. \n\nThe game is also immersive. Meaning your choices ACTUALLY matter. You're not just watching and reading dialogue the entire time. You get to choose the direction the story goes in and there were quite a few decisions that left me stumped.\n\nMy only complaint was the ending, which was in and itself, a good thing.

First and foremost, I will say that this is s visual novel, so if that isn't you thing, or you aren't really into anime and manga, you probably won't fully appreciate the game. \n\nHa, now that those losers are outta here, I can describe why I enjoyed ACE Academy. It starts with a clever personality choice that grants access to a few different dialogues and changes elements about your character. You can name your character however you choose as well. The story sets up in an interesting way and it doesn't take more than an hour or so before you know all the main characters. The day to day ingame may seem like a dating sim more than a VN but after a little while, the story really picks up and gives an engaging plot for you to follow, while simulataneously persuing one of four female characters as a romance (or you can stay single and just be a really good friend, although there's bound to be one character you like). Each character feels like an expansion of tropes we've seen in other works but they all feel realistic enough. You've got the quiet, introvert character (who admittedly, I didn't spend much time with, purely personal preferece), you have the angry, competitive type who has a soft side with kids, there's the sensitive, intelligent girl (she was my preference), and finally you have the flirty, blond who happens to be a genius engineer. They all play their roles wonderfully, and don't feel ripped from other VNs and anime.\n\nAs it's a slice of life, you'd expect it to be funny. It is. For the most part. The MC gets the opportunity to say most of the funniest things if you so please, but for most of the characters, your jokes seem to fall flat. I wish there was a better response to humor with the characters but thats just me, probably. \n\nThere's an astounding number of references to everything included in dialogue too. For example, television shows in-universe include: Breaking GEARs, How I Met Your GEAR, That 70s GEAR, etc (all of which have some funny accompanying dialogue in reference to there real counterparts. Movies in-universe include: The Lord of the GEARS and the like. There's a sequence where one character dresses up as Yu Narukami from Persona 4, only to be ridiculed and compared to Yosuke Hanamura (I love Persona and freaked), and a little bit after, the characters play \"The King's Game\" from the same property (if you don't know what I am talking about, either play the game, its fantastic, or watch the anime, also fantastic. The specific episode to watch for the kings game is ep. 15). Even further, a character is a blatant reference to Alex Louis Armstrong from FullMetal Alchemist and it's remake, Brotherhood. There is plenty more and I'll let some be a surprise but know that the referencial humor is hilarious (to me, at least.)\n\nI was happy to spend the five dollars I had on this VN, as I was given an enjoyable narrative, accompanied by a compelling romance and will probably replay the game soon to see how else it could play out. It's a little long for a VN that you are supposed to be able to replay, but that's not really a problem, just an observation from my end.\n\nIf you're reading this, PixelFade, I'm waiting on ACE Academy: Supernova.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1513216328, "timestamp_updated": 1513216328, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38291287": {"recommendationid": "38291287", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096126925", "num_games_owned": 228, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 907, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 106, "last_played": 1514784195}, "language": "english", "review": "if i was to sum up this novel in a few words it would have to be how visual novels should be done but needs a better ending.\nthroughout reading Ace Academy i felt the characters to be pretty good and i actually felt pretty immersed in the story. the only thing i was not happy about was the ending i felt it needed a little bit more something i dunno something about it just left me feeling like i was missing something.

I was a little wary at first as this was my first VN experience, but I most certainly do not regret it! I can wholeheartedly recommend this to others, whether this be your first or 20th VN. It has a wide range of emotions, from elated laughter to relaxing family time, to more subued moments. In addition, I loved the amount of choices and how they had varying affects, some merely influenced lines or character reactions in that scene, and others had effect on the story itself later down the line. I feel the story had a perfect amount of interaction choices/sequences to make the novel engaging and entertaining. The only qualm I have about this is perhaps the voice acting which can be a bit stiff at times. Still, overall a fantastic job. I don't know if there ever will be or is (as I am writing this review before checking), but if there is another expansion or title that continues the story I will immediately buy it!

It's a fun premise that doesn't really go anywhere - It doesn't really build up to anything. There's no climax against a villain, or achieving a goal. The story ends abruptly without much payoff. This story is more about the journey than the destination. It's about individual moments, and the people in your character's life, which it does do well.\n\nCharacters\nThe MC is shaped by the dialogue and action choices you make through the game, so he can be anywhere from charming to pervy, cowardly to courageous based on how you want to play him. While many of the NPCs are tropes, they are familiar and well characterized. There are some genuinely funny and touching moments. I wanted to see them succeed and be happy.\n\nGameplay\nYou'd expect a game about giant robot battles to have more giant robot battles in it. I think in the whole game there is maybe three battles, which boil down to quicktime events. It would have been nice to have some impact on strategy or mech upgrades etc. The game has the dating-sim tag, but it's not really about buying them gifts, silly mini-games or anything tedious like that. Basically, when you have free time you hang out with your Waifu of choice and pick the dialogue choice you think they'd most like to hear. \n\nConclusion\nACE academy has some good ideas in it, and the characters are interesting. I like the artwork, the full english voice acting and the music is enjoyable. The problem is that there isn't a whole lot for the player to do. It's much more a novel than it is a game. I would be fine with that if the story was a little more intereting with a stronger climax and ending.

Well, kinda... Anyway, maybe all the reviews of VN's that are a point outside of the curve should begin like that, but that's what happens after having to carry a stigma related to the genre for so many years.\n\nWell then, the story is about this guy and his sister who have recently moved to Japan to live with their uncle after their parents' death. The guy you control is good with mechas and stuff, and the girl fulfills her role perfectly (like a real sister). Through this premise, you get to meet some people throughout the way (mostly girls, of course), and... Yeah, you know it. You get to choose who's the most interesting character and then you go chase after them.\n\nNow let's take a look on the game's aspects: The story is pretty basic (in my opinion). The soundtrack and effects are kinda decent, can't complain about them. The art is really neat, but I didn't really like the voice acting. As for the length, you can get to kill quite a good amount of time and try some different choices until you've done everything that's available. Even though this game has cloud saving, I'm still trying to understand why in the world it doesn't have achievements nor trading cards. Please try to implement these in the future, devs.\n\nOverall, if you're a fan of the visual novel genre and is the kind of person who'd rather play the games because of the story rather than the naughty stuff (which usually comes included in the package), then this is a good alternative for you.", "timestamp_created": 1510007241, "timestamp_updated": 1510007241, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496241", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36315385": {"recommendationid": "36315385", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046234847", "num_games_owned": 236, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 644, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498765570}, "language": "english", "review": "This game somehow manages to take mecha battles and make them incredibly boring. I guess that's what they call \"slice of life\" in other reviews; I found it dull. Some of the characters are vaguely interesting, but they play on the usual harem tropes without making them their own. We have a shy girl, a tomboy girl, an overly flirty girl, and a girl whose characterization is fully expressed in words \"nice with big boobs\". Oh and the little sister who is adorable and likes to cook. What an exciting line-up.\n\nSteam says I played this game for over 10 hours, but it felt like twice that. I kept waiting for the plot to actually pick up, but it just... didn't. It felt like it was just there as a vehicle for girl delivery. And okay, that's the case with most romantic-focused visual novels, but in this game it just felt. so. long. and. so. laborious. The writing itself is gramatically sound but bland across the board. Things that were supposed to be funny were not actually funny, and things that were supposed to be endearing were not endearing.\n\nOverall I could have spent those hours reading fanfiction for more entertaining results.", "timestamp_created": 1509947206, "timestamp_updated": 1509947414, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36256317": {"recommendationid": "36256317", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070130368", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1072, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511019365}, "language": "french", "review": "Premi\u00e8re fois que je me lance dans un Visual Novel.

I fully enjoyed this game, the concept of the game (people going to school to learn to pilot mechs) has been used loads of times already but despite this, the plot is really different from others I have seen in Anime and other Visual Novels. I really enjoyed how the main character had a more sandbox feel to his creation than most games allow too, made me feel more connected to the main character. \n\nGoing back to my point about the plot, not only was it different but also very interesting, a certain level of business intrigue and mystery with some really well laid out emotional moments. When you start progressing down a certain romance route you can see the progression as well, it's not just \"bam\" and you're all lovey dovey, there's a progression which culminates in the ending scene which I really liked.\n\nThe comedy in the game, I felt, was freaking amazing, all the references to really recent goings on and the like, the reference to Overwatch's Reaper tickled me especially. If I wasn't feely all happy from romance or sad from events going on I was laughing at all the shenanigans the gang got up to, it was great to play.\n\nOverall my only complaint is that there is no follow up out yet!

Hm, which one should I pick? \n\nDid I mention that I hate living in the MC's mind? He is about as bland as a sack of potatoes, with a personality that's even less endearing than one. I don't even have the option of NOT being a bro or a tasteless douche half the time. I can never get him to react the way I want, no matter which option I pick; from NOT being mad at one of the girls for [spoiler] breaking into the hanger to download and spy on his GEAR without permission [/spoiler] to him laughing it up with his uncle when [spoiler] the aunt and uncle seperated due to Uncle not wanting kids with her. That's a real life problem that people don't usually find a laughing matter. [/spoiler]\n\nIf the contrived plot and lackluster character interactions don't turn you off, maybe some of the background art will. The angles of the buildings are off and it looks like 3 or 4 different artists came together and couldn't agree on an art style and color palette. No idea why this game is overwhelmingly positive, but the interactions between characters don't always make sense and some of the scenes are cringeworthy. \n\nI really can't reccomend this game. The most positive thing I can say about it is  that the writing is grammatically sound, has good pacing, and the scene transitions seem natural. It's still not a good or even interesting story. I don't like how you can just mouse wheel back either and pick a different choice when asked a question.

However, I always liked those Chose-Your-Own-Adventure books as a child, as they gave you some agency instead of just passively consuming. \nWell, this is that but with way more focus on the characters, which I found to be actually quite believable, despite each of them obviously adhering to a common stereotype, though they each have their own bagckstory to discover, gaining some depth as the game progresses. \nThe story is basically a concatenation of mostly unrelated scenarios with the other characters in either your free time or during the mecha-fights, which lend the game its futuristic theme. There is somewhat of an underlying conspiracy plot going on, which however is resolved a little unspectacularly. It still kept my intereset the whole way, though. \nThe game has a lot of choices to make and most have three options to choose from. I do not think most make a big difference, but each one makes a scenario play out in a different way, making it your own expirence despite arriving at the same end situation. Mostly, your choice is to either relate to the character you're speaking to, make a reasonable argument or some quip/perverted remark. Although I found, that even the \"BOOBIES!\"-kind of dialouge choices were something I could see at least other actually saying. It was also a bit longer than expected at 14h played which was a nice surprise, although I might add I'd consider myslef a slow reader.\nIf I have one gripe with this game it is, that what is has in substance it lacks in resources and polish. Frequently reused backrounds often don't reflect what the story is telling (e.g. a crowded room is empty in the background) and charcters basically appear in a single standing pose except for some special occasions during the game. The faces of the girls seem to alll have the same shape with a pointed chin and the biggest difference seems to be in stature and attire. I'm glad to say though, that the faces nicely change expression in every situation you're in, so the focus of the budget was on the spot from my perspective. I would say that the voice acting felt very off at times, but english is my second language so take that with a grain of salt. I just turned it off in the settings and I was happier for it.\n\nIf you'd excuse me now, I need to revisit some choices I've made and see if I can romance the girl that always seems to hate on me for some reason. :-)", "timestamp_created": 1509225685, "timestamp_updated": 1509225685, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0,

Following your little sister as she begins her studies in a new country, you find yourself transferring to ACE Academy which is a premier school for Cenorobotic studies in Japan. \"Cenorobotics\" is a new academic field dealing with the study and use of GEARs which are giant mechanized robots originally developed for military applications. The popularity of arena GEAR combat has enveloped a number of different areas with engineering, sponsorship, entertainment and weapons development just to name a few. How will you and your sister adjust to life in a different nation, will you be able to make friends or possibly find love and most importantly will your piloting skills position you and your GEAR at the top of the Cenorobotics program? Welcome to Japan.\n\nUsually I skip the gameplay portion of a visual novel review because it's a visual novel and there is no gameplay...until now that is...sort of? Strangely enough, there actually is some gameplay involved in ACE Academy whenever there is combat with the mechs or GEARs as they are properly refered to. On the battlefield, as advances are made by you and your opponents you are quickly given a list of actions to make with your GEAR and you only have a very limited time, seconds at best as a countdown timer initiates, to make a choice which really adds to the tension of the battles. Do you block, evade, fire weapons or go in for a melee attack...it's all very well executed into the story quite nicely with animations during the battles. In summary, this additional dynamic really had me even more intrigued with the narrative in ACE Academy as I found myself eagerly looking forward to the next engagements with the GEARs.\n\nVisually, this novel is really stunning with it's top notch illustration and professional presentation. The manga inspired artwork is some of the best I've seen in any V.N. and is filled with bright cheerful colors and terrific shading. Even the menu screens are beautifully done which shows the commitment that this development team really put into this title. One very eye-catching feature is the animation of the characters in this story. They certainly aren't the static 2D figures that you see in most visual novels no. The people in ACE Academy are wonderfully animated. Their mouths move when they speak, their eyes blink, they even show different emotions with their facial features like blushing and getting upset or angry. Sometimes even cute little speech bubbles with different animations in them like a heart or a tear pop up over the characters heads depending on what they just said or what they're feeling it's all very manga-like and fun to observe as you read the engrossing narrative. They also change clothing on a regular basis, whenever you meet someone outside of the Academy for a social engagement they are always wearing something different. I found this to be a wonderful little detail and something that you don't often see in most visual novels. On another note, the sound is of the upmost quality. It's truly immersive as the development team has managed to include ambient noises such as doors opening/closing, phones ringing, birds chirping, vehicles etc., basically all the sounds you would hear as the characters interact with each other and their environments as the story progresses. I really love it when these sounds are incorporated into the V.N. because it truly immmerses me within the story. ACE Academy has voiced dialogue and typically I like my V.N.'s without it but I must admit that the voice actors in this title have done an impressive job with the script. I find them all endearing and quite believable in what they say and how they say it. Also, your little sister Nikki has the cutest voice ever. In conclusion, with all the effort put forth in just the visuals and sound quality of ACE Academy you would be hard pressed to find another visual novel with as outstanding a presentation as this.\n\nTo date, ACE Academy has been without a doubt the best and one of the longest visual novel experiences that I've had on Steam. The story is extremely well written and quite entertaining and some of the more emotional scenes will even bring a tear or two to your eyes. There are many unique characters to interact with and an abundance of choices to make throughout the branching narrative and let's not forget the fun GEAR combat. There is also a ton of \"pop culture\" references thrown at you in this V.N. so that was an added bonus as well. As far as options go, there are the basics for audio, video and text speed. Also included is an unlockable CG gallery and a very memorable original soundtrack with a few homage bonus tracks thrown in for good measure. Sadly there are no Steam Achievements or Steam Trading Cards to collect which is a shame because those would go over nicely with this title. As most of the V.N.'s that I've tried on Steam have been fantasy based or occuring in present day, it was very refreshing to finally get a quality title that was purely science fiction. In conclusion, featuring a truly intriguing story in which you actually get to pilot a mech, amazing artwork, a rich cast of memorable characters and a terrific O.S.T., ACE Academy is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to visual novel fans, anyone wanting to experience a great sci-fi story and definitely to anyone wanting to try a visual novel for the very first time.", "timestamp_created": 1508067462, "timestamp_updated": 1508067462, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 36, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.792983", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35737000": {"recommendationid": "35737000", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067812733", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 929, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508041692}, "language": "english", "review": "I came for the shy girl, I left with the tsundere.

Good art. Solid sountrack. And I enjoyed the premise of the story. The dialogue was well-written and I laughed more than a few times. However there is one pretty large caveat and there will be spoilers in the the full review. However, I would reccomend the game, especially if you pick it up on sale. It's a yes from me.\n\n***********************************\n\nFull review\n\nThe game is made in the Ren'py engine. From personal experience, VNs made in Ren'py tend to crash from time to time and have a few minor bugs. I found none of that in ACE Academy (known as AA from here on out) so that counts as major points in PixelFade's favor. Kudos on simply a *well-made* game. Can tell a lot of effort went into crafting this game. \n\nThe game also has English V/Os. Voice Acting in VNs is always appreciated as long as it doesn't detract/distract from the writting. And that's not the case here. At worst, it's servicable. The only way it could detract would be if it was bad and that's not the case here at all. I would say there's a standout, but the primary characters all good a good job. Some of the dialogue is cheesy, but I'm not going to hold that against the V/As. They made it work.\n\nThe dialogue is well-written for the most part. Standard cliches aside, there's a very intriguiging story here and I found myself getting invested in the characters. I wanted them to suceed. I was rooting for them, Some of the dialogue is genuninely amusing and I found myself laughing more than a few times. AA is also HORRENDOUSLY cheesy at times and I find real-world references tend to \"date\" games. It's fine to fill your game up with time period references if you're making a game that's supposed to have a retro-atmosphere or there's a particular theme you're chasing (such as a movie intentionally paying homage to 80s action flicks or B-movie shlock). GEARs of Thrones? How I Met Your GEARs? That doesn't even make sense.\n\nThe only negative is that for as much as I enjoyed the writting and the story in general, the ending for AA is absolutely a bust. The game unmistakably feels incomplete. There's is NO getting around it. The game just ends JUST as it seems the story is starting to get REALLY interesting. I understand PixalFade is not CDProjektRed or Bethesda or another AAA developer and you can only do so much on a given budget. It almost feels unfair because PixelFade seems like an Indie developer you should all support. It's clear that there's more story capable of being fleshed out and for that reason I hope to encourage people to buy this game and support this company. Maybe the project might have been a little too ambitious but they should be praised for their vision and AA is nearly a great realization of it.\n\nInstead it's merely good. But IS good. And occasionally great. But I won't hold their vision against them.\n\nSupport PixelFade, guys", "timestamp_created": 1507353511, "timestamp_updated": 1507443032, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35533136": {"recommendationid": "35533136", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137647467", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2688, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508471632}, "language": "english", "review": "I gotta admit I wasn't entirely sure what to expect when I got this, but I love this game, I couldn't drop the game at all when I started.

Unlike other VNs I read, their lives and interaction doesn't stop completely once you have picked out a route. I was surprised that other characters had found a relationship even without the MCs urging, especially since these other characters can be romanced as well. You could also hang out with them even after locking into another route which is a huge plus because in other VNs they fade into obscurity with the spotlight shining towards your route. (ehem Katawa Shoujo)\n- Comedy and Fourth-wall breaks.\n\nCons\n- MC's story was unsatisfying.\n- The final match was unsatisfying.\n- Some dialogues are different from what is said, to what is written in box below.\n- No explanation on what key is skip, auto mode, etc.\n- Backgrounds are recycled in some parts. When tutoring in the daycare you get the BG from the library at ACE, any lobby from other places gets you the Pilot's lounge, among others.\n\n\nRoutes:\nYuuna & Valerie>Kaori>Mayu\nYuuna and Valerie are my two favorite routes. Yuuna was just a sweet-heart and the comedy sprinkled during her route was just fantastic. Valerie, on the other hand was the best complement to the MC if you choose his flirtatious responses all the time. \n\nKaori and Mayu was meh. Kaori was just a tsundere and that was what she has going for her. Mayu would have been better had her father been introduced to the MC and an arc about how her father disapproves or something would be better, and the surprise Yandere Mayu was just too OOC IMO. \n\n\nRecommendation: If you like a VN that isn't heavily-focused on drama or a thought-provoking story and instead focuses on comedy, buy this game.\n\nPrice: Buy it during sales.

But even nuclear weapon itself varies in power, the most powerful is over 10000x powerful than the weakest, yet we don't have a nuclear war.\n\nGirls' plots don't make any sense. Some personal scenes, interactions, that is all. No depth, no ending, no nothing,\n\nThis game is unfinished.

Couldn't put it down and ended up wishing for more once I finished. Lot's of decisions, mostly related to the different dating aspects of the game (which girl you end up with). I've only played through once thus far (Yuuna), but there seems to be replayability to go the other routes/partners based on what I've seen and read. For those looking for anything more than a well written VN, you might be disappointed, as there are no mini-games or combat involved, despite the mechs. The art was vrty nice and the voice acting was really well done. The only things I can think of as less than great were the music (which was just alright) and the fact that the end seemed kind of rushed (maybe funding was getting tight?). Nothing major, but enough that it didn't really fit the pace of the rest of the story and left a bit of a flat feel to the conclusion.

If just want to know my true feelings about the game go ahead and just skip to the very end.My spelling is bad so bare with me ;p\n\nTo start with the that bugged me about this game is the music\n*it randomly cuts out in the middle of scene and wont start till the next scene begins or just starts over mid way through\n\n*couple of times got sad music during what should have been a happy moment and because of this kinda ruined it for me\n\nCharacters\n*while going through the story lines i couldnt really connect with the characters until you get closer till the end\n\n*as far as the which girl to date story lines you start to connect with the different girls but as soon as you choose one the story that you were fallowing with all the characters just disapers and goes off in a different direction and its kind of off setting at first although i know they did it so you would go through and play it again to see all the stories but i wish they would have made a more natural transition to the new story line instead of just cutting if off and starting new \n\n*when you do choose the girl you want to call your GF its kind of akward in the sense that neither your family nore your friends really acknowleg the newly found relationship which is once again off putting and cofnussing \n\n*when a scene would end with a character being busy and you having to wait for infromation from them and you would have free time to hang out with friends for the rest of the afternoon but when the selection would come up it would only be the one person you just left because they were busy and that would always kind of throw me off \n\nVoice Overs\n*while i thought the voice overs were good they were times where the voice wouldnt match the text or would only read one line of text and leave another two or three lines unread\n\n*some of the recorded voices at times were obviously recoreded differently because of the claraty and volume of it would be off copared to all the others in the scene but this would only happen for one or two lines then would go back to normal \n\nDecision Making\n*one thing and its small but there are some decisions where you have a time limit to choose an option(5sec) and i do like this its different and adds to it but the count down was hard to see on the background some times and i missed the time to choose an option leading to something that i wouldnt have picked\n\nGOOD NEWS FINALLY!!!\n\nAlright now that im done nit picking the hell out of this game i want to say that i loved this game. The reason i judged it so hard was because there was so much more that could have come from this game because the story line was great and when you did connect with charecters it made the story line so much better plus with the girl i chose to make my GF the first play though really made the main story even better but in all honesty they all add something to support the main character which added to the story. So to close this out i want to say that i thank for the small team who created this game that i really loved this game and i cant wait to see futur projects from you and while i understand that you were limited by what you could produce you did a great job. I would recomend this game to any one who is into VN or just getting into them you will not be disapointed with it as long as your not like me ;p\n\nPlus little side note they make refernces to some animes and i love it defently adds too it", "timestamp_created": 1503384208, "timestamp_updated": 1503384282, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34388454": {"recommendationid": "34388454", "author": {"steamid": "76561198173055039", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1245, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503345351}, "language": "english", "review": "\"With Big Ol Tittes\" Is how I write this review", "timestamp_created": 1503293143, "timestamp_updated": 1503293143, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34308927": {"recommendationid": "34308927", "author": {"steamid": "76561198369712813", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1860, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503753297}, "language": "english", "review": "Makes you wanna fall in love all over again", "timestamp_created": 1502982015, "timestamp_updated": 1502982015, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34267458": {"recommendationid": "34267458", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059320281", "num_games_owned": 193, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2709, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512659643}, "language": "english", "review": "Yep, liked it.

The game contains sufficient fan service to keep teenage boys happy. There is a sprinkling of quick time-ish events, which floats a few people's boats I imagine. And it's voice acted, which is always nice - I recognise a few - anyway, it's good to see (hear?) that these VAs are still in the game, so to speak.\n\nThere is something which I did not expect from this game - the pants-wettingly hilarious dialogue! A delicious combination of saucy and sly humour. Not to mention some clever fourth wall breaking...\n\nAll in all, a pretty solid game!

I had no issues with the game overall, being made by a Western team and having English dub as a base only makes it more enjoyable. The story is also alright, but there is much more to this game which I'll be covering.\n\n\nLike others mentioned, it's easily noticed that the cast has some very well-known anime trope characters, but that's not an issue (for me at least), and each cast member (even the side ones who also have voices!) was unique in their own way. Not wanting to spoiler the story and what you'll see for you, I'll just go ahead with the \"good and bad\".\n\nGOOD POINTS : \n\n+The overall design : Choices. That. Actually. Matter! A nameable protagonist! Fight scenes! Multiple romance routes! English dub with just about everyone voiced! These points pretty much explain it. [spoiler]some may say the fight scenes were mediocre but actually I really enjoyed them.[/spoiler]. Speaking of choices. there really are a lot of them, and choices made may, sometimes, affect the choices afterward! I won't be getting into these examples to avoid some major spoilers, but you'll see for yourself.\n\n+Price : With it's length, multiple romance routes and HUNDREDS of choices, comprared to other VN's, 20 euros is an extremely generous price. It sometimes even goes on sale (I got it for 5 euros), in which case it's basically a steal!\n\n+The characters : Some of the characters are easily recognisable anime trope style characters, others just go so overboard with their lines it's very funny. As an example, [spoiler]\"THE SUN SETS, AND SO WE DEPART!\"[/spoiler], and : [spoiler]\"TO SPROUT INTO A MAGNIFICIENT TREE, WE MUST FIRST WATER THE ROOTS!\"[/spoiler].\n\n+The story overall : Just go see for yourself. You won't regret it ;)\n\n+The interactions : Some bring joy, some bring tears. Go and find them all :D\n\n+Length. I played the game for 14.5 hours at the time of writing the review. [spoiler]Did two routes so far. About four to go. Got a lot to do.[/spoiler]\n\n\nBAD POINTS\n-The ending : [spoiler]Some people have already mentioned the ending being lackluster, and I'm no different. Without giving away too much, after how the game goes, the ending is just... there. Good buildup, but nothing exciting happens afterward, also making the choice before it kinda meaningless. Let's just hope PixelFade will do an ACE sequel soon ^^[/spoiler]\n\n-[spoiler]ACE Academy : Supernova not yet existing. Self-explanatory.[/spoiler]\n\n-This game has no more bad points/cons. That.... was about it. Seriously.\n\nOverall, it's a solid 9 out of 10 for me, the only thing that prevents it from getting a 10 in my viewpoint is [spoiler]the already mentioned ending[/spoiler].

There's a lot to like.\n\nYou make choice after choice after glorious choice as you guide your main character through his new life in Japan as a transfer student in piloting at ACE Academy (which reviewers call a high school but seems to me to definitely be a university). You join a team and pilot your GEAR (robot/mecha) through various battle matches, which are quick and simple to play and are bookended by strategy sessions and postmatch analysis. You go to classes and sit through or skip lessons and assignments. You adjust to a new family life at home with your charming little sister Nikki and your fun uncle Kaito. You have natural, rich, meaningful relationships with your friends and teammates. You crack jokes, play pranks, and encounter numerous weird pop culture references. And through all this, you learn about your GEAR and what connection it may have to the loss of your parents. All of this makes ACE Academy a fun yet moving game that took me about ten hours on the first playthrough. (Steam says I have 3 hours, but it stopped counting after the first day for some reason.)\n\nWhat this game handles best of all is the relationships between the characters. With so many choices, you have a lot of control over the main character (although not complete control: occasionally he does something I wouldn't do or chose not to do). The game is long enough for the characters to reveal their depth, to one another as well as to you. And the relationships develop naturally. \n\nOn my first time through, I decided not to pursue any of the four possible girls but instead stay open to whatever might happen. I spent time with the girl I liked the most, but then she signaled that she was uneasy about our feelings and didn't want to pursue them, so I backed off and we became great friends. Meanwhile, I was unsure about another girl, and I took things as slowly as I could... which gave us the chance to really get to know each other, until one day she said something that made me realize that what was happening between us was real, so I chose to kiss her, and we ended up in such a close relationship that by story's end, I felt sure that our characters would end up marrying each other after graduation.\n\nSome reviewers are disappointed with the story's ending, feeling that it's a big buildup with no payoff, but I found it satisfying. In my playthrough, the major plot points were resolved in a striking way [spoiler] (instead of a conspiracy to kill my parents and steal my GEAR's technology, it turns out to be the other way around, that my father put technology in my GEAR that he shouldn't have, and his death was an accident) [/spoiler], yet leaving the satisfying feeling that these characters still have their lives ahead of them. Even though our story ends, theirs will go on.\n\nThere are a few quibbles with this game. For example, some of the backgrounds get reused, the pop culture references can be a bit over the top sometimes, and I wish there were an option to make the main character's relationship with his sister sweeter and more supportive without the teasing. And the story is so deep that it might keep me from replaying the game any time soon. The game seems to let you skip scenes that you've played before, but I would want the whole experience again... and if I take another route it might be bittersweet to meet my girlfriend again knowing that we're not getting together this time.\n\nAll in all, ACE Academy is an immersive, intriguing, fun game with mostly likeable characters, and a story that you get to participate in with active choices rather than just passively observe. You'll have to decide for yourself if you like it, but I really do. Highly recommended.\n\n\n\n\n(I never guessed I would fall so deeply in love with [spoiler] Valerie Belle.

However, some of the build up could be improved (probably only noticeable because they expanded it). More so, the characters are great, perhaps a little stereotypical but really thorough and likeable.\n\nMy two biggest criticisms is the game is a little less interactive than I would hope. The character and backdrop detail adds where Great Games like Too The Moon lack. But having no ability to move around definitely made sitting still to read difficult at times (I don't think it needs it, but if it were a full 3D RPG it would definitely be a AAA title). If the battles were a little bit more of an arcade experience (even a really simple one) it would have filled the. Second, the ending. It didn't really resolve anything and there was no real climax (again, likely because they expanded it). It definitely seems like there will be a sequel... or there needs to be. \n\nOh and if I'm going to be nitpicky, it would've been nice for some of the female characters to sound less childish. They are in university afterall... on that note, the relationships were pretty highschool too (would you wait months to start dating a woman you like who's clearly interested in you?).

The short answer about this game is that if you like VN's, several choices of women in dating sims, a cute and funny slice of life story placed in the future you will like this game. For those who have come to this game to experience the \"story\" rather than the dating sim turn away now. Many parts of the story including the \"ending\" are driven by your choices in the datiing sim.\nAll in all I will reccomend this game, my full review is below.\n\nThe dating sim worked well, and unlike many other VN's of this type there was no question as to who you want to date. The game figuired that out based on a couple of your early game decisions. The way that they did it made everything feel very natrual. The dating sim portion gets a 10/10\n\nThe fighting sequences were easy, and the engine that they were using to program it doesn't usually support combat sequences so the way that they went about it was fairly smart, however there are other games that used the same engine that did it better such as the SUNRIDER series. Unlike the sunrider series though, if you fail by scrolling up you can try again. The Fighting sequence get a 5/10 for lack of action.\n\nThe story was amazing. It took me about 5 hours to complete one path and then only a couple of hours to complete the others. i skipped quite a bit on those other playthrough because I wanted to look at the ending. The plot was amazing however the ending left a little to be desired. There was no denouement or in layman's terms resolution to the story. The main conflict that drove a huge portion of the story is never resolved. For that I have to give the story a inc/10 for being incomplete.\n\nI give this game a 8.5/10 with 1 point being able to be earned back by either making a sequel or by adding onto the story, and .5 being redeemable if they ever fix their combat sequences.", "timestamp_created": 1501864112, "timestamp_updated": 1501864112, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34012521": {"recommendationid": "34012521", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085589342", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 325, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499767569}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best.", "timestamp_created": 1501840846, "timestamp_updated": 1501840846, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34008533": {"recommendationid": "34008533", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112440735", "num_games_owned": 142, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 435, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502103231}, "language": "english", "review": "Best game ever, good art.\n10/10 \nVALARIE BEST GIRL", "timestamp_created": 1501823942, "timestamp_updated": 1501823942, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34008276": {"recommendationid": "34008276", "author": {"steamid": "76561198217762151", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501806517}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a visual novel with a capturing story.

It doens't offer incredible production qualities, as it was made by an indie team and the story is not as expansive as in some top-tier games in this genre. The replay value is also a bit limited, as your choices in most cases don't radically change the storyline or provide very distinct endings like in School Days or Fruit of Grisaia.\n\nStill, while not as \"big\" as those Japanese games I mentioned above, it presents an engaging, well-written story with tasteful approach to both the main intrigue and the romance arcs. All characters are distinct enough and have intriguing qualities that makes you want to learn their stories and see different interactions protagonist might have with them. They do not deviate much from the typical tropes of the genre (a shy girl, a tsundere etc.), but they're done well enough to be entartaining and not completely predictable. The two romance arcs I've followed (Yunna and Kaori) were both really well done and compelling and the family storyline of the protagonist, especially his interactions with younger sister, were surprisingly good. The art and music complements the story properly and while the game would probably benefit from more sprites and more dedicated drawings for various scenes, it never felt \"cheap\" enough to make it problematic.\n\nAlso, as I suggested earlier, I very much liked the approach to romance it took, even though some my find it overly tame. I find this aspect of many visual novels rather exploitative than compelling and the slow pace of the relationships here felt very much natural and appropriate for the characters. Also, the \"dating sim\" component never dominated the story and rather complemented it, with benefits for both aspects of the game.\n\nOne negative I will have to mention is that with the limited replayability and around 7-8 hours for full playthrough, for many it probably won't be worth the full asking price of 20$.

Don't worry about needing to mash keys, monitor stats, or remember facts. You're mostly reading, and making dialogue choices. \n\n2) The game is mostly a dating sim, not a combat sim. - You'll play as a male protagonist who encounters four female love interests.

You'll instantly recognize the tropes, character types, stereotypes, etc. Even if you don't watch a lot of anime, you'll recognize some very familiar territory in this game.\n\n\n\nPlaying this game *(and enjoying it) comes down to which love interest you'd like to pursue:\n\n\n\nYuuna - standard 'good' girl anime girl. Sweet, caring, a little motherly, encouraging, and fun.\n\nKaori - athletic, spicy, hot-tempered, competitive, and VERY conservative.\n\nMayu - brainy, shy, a little nerdy, serious, soft-spoken, gentle, and creative.\n\nValerie - bombastic, larger-than-life, flirtatous, and a bit of a bad girl \n\n\nThe novel is super easy to enjoy, the characters all feel unique to each other, and part of the fun is playing it again and making different choices to see how it plays out.

There's plenty to like about it, but it's clear that it's PixelFade's first effort, and suffers from its original episodic release. I assume the latter was a budgetary requirement to raise more funds through Early Access, but it's probably responsible for some pacing and focus issues.\n\nFirst, I will elaborate on the \"pro\" above: you are not the center of the universe. You can pursue a variety of romance options, and beyond that choose which friends you spend free time with. I was pleasantly surprised to find that characters I didn't pursue still clearly had a life outside of the game's scenes. Girl who hit on me constantly that I rebuffed? She got another boyfriend. Standoffish teammate that I avoided until the end? All the while she was working at a daycare and has a heart of gold.\n\nNow, the \"con,\" which ties into my point about PixelFade and the episodic release. Story elements, like a big, brewing conspiracy and the fate of your family, are repeatedly teased and then tied up far too quickly and cleanly. There's some build up, but no climax, no payoff. So why include them at all, really? I suspect as they released episodes the game expanded in ways PixelFade didn't plan, and came to a point where their limited resources required they call it finished. So they did... but it's not satisfying. This seems to happen even with bigger-name episodic games, like Life is Strange. It is simply hard to maintain quality and cohesion this way.\n\nSteam tags call this an \"RPG,\" but ACE isn't and by trying to be (with a kind-of \"story arc\" and characters \"classes\"), it dilutes itself. In actuality it is \"slice of life\" and should have embraced that. Drop the abortive mystery and rivalry and just be about a schoolboy and his friends. As written, this practically begs for a continuation or sequel that seems unlikely. That's too bad, because the bones of a really compelling VN are here. I would love to learn more about GEARs and how they define people's lives. I would love to keep following these characters and their relationships beyond the beginning stage (but that's a general gripe for too many VNs).\n\nBut still, I do recommend ACE Academy, maybe with the caveat of waiting for a sale. If you like VNs (and if you're reading this, you very likely do), I believe this game will be enjoyable, but not mind-blowing, for you. It was good enough on its own merits, and has me interested in PixelFade's further work.

I will update it if my opinion were to change after I play through the others.\n\nI found out about this game through their initial Kickstarter, back when its name was something completey different and so was the setting. Little to say, I was really excited when they were finally releasing the final product but man... was I just so disappointed with how rushed and incomplete the game feels.\n\nLet's begin with the battle system. I understand it wasn't their focus at all, but that's no excuse to how lazily done it is. The player really doesn't have to even think at all, especially when you add options that are literally \"Get hit\". I think adding some depth to it would've been great, because the way it is right now it's so easy to beat that it's not even fun.\n\nThe background art is reused over and over and over again. The Pilot's Lounge and the Schoolgrounds were used for about 4 or 5 different locations EACH, with other beings used multiples times as well, though in less amounts. It just feels lazy, and ruins the atmosphere of the scenes when everything looks like it's happening in the same places.\n\nThe story.... oh god. Easily the biggest issue with ACE Academy. Honestly, the things I mentioned above could've been overlooked if the game's story didn't feel SOOOOO rushed. I won't go into specifics to avoid spoilers, but don't expect anything serious about this game. Any build-up it'd done gets killed completely, the problems are gone as quick as they appear. It honestly feels more like a joke and makes me feel dumb for even expecting something more of this.\n\nAnd that's just what I feel like going in-depth about. There's a bunch of other issues with this game too. Like how they introduce new characters but never bother to do anything meaningful with them; somewhat important side-characters just using the default black sillhouette as oppose to getting their unique art; humour being done through references and punsh like \"Ceonardo DiLaprio\" A LOT (it's funny at first, but it doesn't take long until it feels overused and boring); as well as voice lines not matching the dialogue.\n\nOn the positive side... the main characters were fine, I guess. The game never does anything mind-blowing with them, they're pretty generic overall but I enjoyed experiencing their backstories a bit. The soundtrack and CGI aren't anything outstanding either, but they're definitely not bad.\n\nI don't think the game is unplayable, I somewhat enjoyed and I do plan on playing through every route in hope that there's just something I missed that makes it good. But objectively, the pros don't outweight the cons, and it's definitely not something I'd recommend on my own accord. \n\nIf you're interested and don't mind paying its price, go ahead and test if it's your thing. But I'd honestly suggest spending the money on anything else if you aren't really that interesed.", "timestamp_created": 1500878497, "timestamp_updated": 1513248872, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.611251", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33710922": {"recommendationid": "33710922", "author": {"steamid": "76561198360286056", "num_games_owned": 300, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 2092, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499940167}, "language": "english", "review": "Great story and gorgeous art ! the personality of each character is apparent grossly, Yunna is so cute and I cant help myself !XD but there are also some drawbacks in this game, for instance theres no achievements and trading cards to get...", "timestamp_created": 1500691479, "timestamp_updated": 1500691479, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492321", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33665413": {"recommendationid": "33665413", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134944370", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 339, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501832499}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought this game during the steam summer sale and could almost not stop playing; I played well into the night!

Unique and overall lovable Characters, pretty humorous conversations and actions which made me laugh more than just a few times an hour, a nice backstory of the Main Character, whom i really liked as well, no matter how you play him, he's amazing, and well the Romance (Personally i chose Kaori) totally hit the spot for me. If she was real, she'd be 100% my type... which I thought was kind of impossible for a game to achieve, since games often like to objectify their characters a bit too much, also keeping them a little raw and one-sided. I'd probably feel bad about myself replaying with another option now though :/ \nIt was touching and really cute and I could absolutely relate to her, maybe due to experiences i've made IRL, which is always the best right? Certain nice things to relate to, stuff you know from your own life, knowing others and yourself well n stuff...\n\nIn any case there were a few downsides, particularly the backstory which sadly leaves lotsa questions, even though i did like it a lot, the overall satisfying, still slightly too quick ending, the lack of background art, which was often reused for different sites, and also the lack of artwork for different scenes. The artwork was beautiful tho, which is kinda why i would've loved to see more, especially romance ones. Heh >_< \n\nThose may be a few points but each of them is trivial to me, why i think the pro strongly overpowers the contra. Also let's be fair, there'd have to be a picture for each romance option everytime, which would've escalated quickly, and the game is pumped as it is, far longer than expected, must've been quite a piece of work. Also i suppose i missed a lot of artwork just by the variety of choices, and thereby scenes i have missed by playing it just once... and there were loads and loads of letters in between, too... my head is still spinning^^\n\nOn my opinion this is a must have for anyone who prefers quality story and characters over tasteless jokes and fanservice.

I expect them to be the modern equivalent of the choose your own adventures of my youth.  I like branching story paths.  How many hours did I play the origin stories in Dragon Age just to see if the scenes change based on different options?  At least 20.\n\nMost visual novels I tried are translated Japanese games.  Not localised, just translated.  That's never really worked for me.\n\nAce Academy does work.  Names are easy to remember and identify.  Game is loaded with choices.  About half of them matter for the ongoing story, but all change at least three \"paragraphs\" of the scene it is in. \n\nThis game doesn't force you to \"choose a path\" and lock out others like some do.  You have multiple chances at seeing the same scenes with characters.  As an example, you are given three options for who to hang out with.   Next day, you are presented with the other two, or maybe a another third choice.  Sometimes the plot in those other scenes make it pass by you.   It's not like you choose \"Shou\" and you're locked on the \"Shou Path\" for the rest of the game.  Even the breakpoint \"date\" scenes are based on the people you spent time with, so you can have several options.  \n\nThe characters in this game have their own plots going on.  And they will go on without your intervention if you don't interact with them.  It's pretty nice that your character isn't the prime motivator of all the plot.\n\nThe voice acting is decent.  The best thing is that it is in English, and the voices are not outright annoying to listen to. (an issue I have with most JP visual novels)  The actors are not superstar talents, and it shows.  Some pronunciations are suspect, and actors change how they pronounce another character's names partway through.  It's not recorded in a high end studio an A game would have.  I suspect that the developers did the voices themselves.  That said, the directing and recording quality is perfectly acceptable given the game.  I have heard far, far worse voice acting with bad direction and terrible studio recording.  Ace Academy's voice acting just seems \"off\" but you easily get used to it.\n\nGags are, for the most part, decent.  Plenty of room for improvement, but I like the humor style overall.  There is really only one part I dislike, and that is a fourth wall breaking anime convention where the devs tell you how the to make the game.  It's a little too far.\n\nSSparks is absolutely correct in that the plot ball is dropped often.  Narratively speaking, the main plotline is slowly built up during the game.  It is finally revealed, and the game ends ten minutes later with an unsatisfying climax.  The Secret Ending of the game even lets you, the player, demand to see the real ending.  The game explains they ran out of money, and gives a link to Patreon.  Seriously, that's how the game ends.  So much potential.  If you don't have the money to fit your narrative, make your narrative fit your budget.  \n\nThe mech combat isn't really used.  They could have removed it completely, and not much would change.  All it is is a timed menu choice.  \n\nArtwork is good, perfectly acceptable.  The only issue is that the \"Strange outdated American junker Mech\" looks pretty much the same as the \"Sleek Modern Japanese Mechs\".  In essence, the Japanese mechs should be sport bikes to the protagonist's beat up power cruiser.  \n\nOverall, while I am disappointed with the ending, I found the game to be strong and a sign that visual novels can work for me.  I want to see more western designed VNs like this, or at least fully localized Japanese ones.

The biggest part of this game is obviously the plot and for the most part it's quite good. The plot is a more simple mecha/romance anime not getting super complex with a tone of sequels which already makes it better for new people. This plot allows it to have a more peaceful yet action packed play through with romance sprinkled in. My only issue with the plot is the ending and not for the reason many think. I think the plot ended the best way possible in terms of story but failed completley in terms of romance. For some reason there dosen't seem to be a conclusion to the romance with the character of your choice (Maby there is but there was none in my play through). This bassicly makes it pointless for romance fans as this offers something much better than a dating sim overall but fails due to the lack of a romace conclusion. Although I can forgive this ending as it's not the worst I have seen and this was supported heavily by the fans meaning there was a cap for the length and quality of the game.\n\nOther than that the characters are all steriotypical but fun and well developed as expected of an anime game and the art is great even though many of the assets are used multiple times throughout the game.

There's so much worldbuilding, plot development, and even some drama, but it's all superficial. Mystery surrounding protagonist's parents? Solved in a few minutes. Mystery around the rival (who isn't even a true rival, he's just there undefeated and being cool) and the company that sponsors him? Solved in a few minutes too. Sister regretting past choices? SOLVED IN A FEW MINUTES! Some minor characters, like the rival sponsor CEO, got a sprite and only appeared for a few seconds. Meanwhile, others like Mitsuki in the Mayu scenes didn't. And if there's one thing that I take seriously, it's girls named Mitsuki.\n\nThe soundtrack was so forgettable I can't recall a single track. The humor was pretty much 95% references, including Ceonardo DiLaprio never winning a Moscar and the siblings watching series like Game of GEARs (or was it GEAR of Thrones) and Top GEAR. 4% was meta jokes (\"this isn't an anime\") and the remaining 1% was weebspeak. The artstyle is good, except for the faces. Those just feel samey. Speaking of faces, they blink. Not sure why this was added, it just made stuff more complicated. The sprites themselves didn't move, they could only blink for eternity. Not even mouth movement synced with the voices. Oh yeah, it was voiced in English. At first I liked it, but after a while they started coming off a bit unnatural, especially Shou and his Broseph, which is the way he called the protagonist to avoid having to say his name in a voiced line. Since, y'know, this is a self insert VN and you get to name him however you want. There's also a choice screen right in the beginning that lets you choose the protag's personality. From what I've seen, that only changes what kinds of choices are highlighted (basically an easy mode). The fight choices are pretty straightforward (even the timed ones, if you miss the timer just scroll one line up and redo it), and the same goes for the relationship ones.\n\nAs for technical issues, this is a huge memory hog. It hit 1.2 GB of RAM at some point, and I'm pretty sure it happened because there were six blinking sprites on screen at once. Not only that, but it also lacks a backlog. Now, both of these issues can probably be attributed to the engine used, Ren'Py, which is good for it's price (like really, it's free), so I'll just leave that aside.\n\nIt's still an enjoyable VN, but from what I saw, it's not worth more than a 6/10.", "timestamp_created": 1498446402, "timestamp_updated": 1498446402, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.603940", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32776982": {"recommendationid": "32776982", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120348301", "num_games_owned": 872, "num_reviews": 389, "playtime_forever": 750, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496137321}, "language": "english", "review": "Possibly one of the best western visual novels I\u2019ve played so far, even tho I didn\u2019t liked the ending too much.

GIVE ME MORE CONTENT! \n\nI just finished my first full playthrough of the game, And I am filled with a wave of sadness that I feel after finishing any DAMNN GOOD visual novel.\nI call it 'Visual Novel Depression'. And my emotions right now are sky high....\n\nI am struggling to put how good ACE Academy Is into words...\nIt can be funny at times, it can be absolutely hilarious at times, it can be serious at times, it can be saddening at times, it can be corny at times, and it can be downright heartbreaking at times.\nSo many emotions filled me when I played this game.\n\nACE Academy is set in the year 2049 and is the story of a young man (Name chosen by the player) who is an American transfer student in Japan and is sent into the country's most prestigious mecha pilot program at ACE Academy. The mecha in this game are named GEAR.\nI won't give away any more of the story, but there are a number of girls that you can romance, all followed up by a compelling story worth investing your time into.\n\nThis Visual Novel has a number of quirks that kept me entertained, and the thrill of jumping into the cockpit of a mecha is unmatched and it left me feeling anxious before every battle. \nALL the main characters have distinct personalities and for the most part are very likeable people (Yes, even Kaori), I wanted to spend as much time as I could with everyone. I will definitely go back and play the other routes.\n\nThe art quality in this Visual Novel varies. You can definitely tell it was crowdfunded. Some artwork can be absolutely outstanding, yet others lack appeal or variety. I guess it was smart use of the artist(s)' time but I would have liked to of seen more scenes and environments, and some characters are lacking models, being replaced with just generic silhouettes.\nThe music, while repetitive at times, generally fits the scene really well and can really drive home the emotion that the game is trying to project on the player at any given time.\n\nStill though, the game is fully voiced in English with exception to the main character. Which is rare to see in a Visual Novel.\nI thoroughly enjoyed the voice acting! It's great for the most part. Some unimportant characters lack enthusiasm at times, but I was generally impressed.\nSome of the voice actors definitely have a big future in the industry If they so choose to pursue it.\n\nThis has been one of the best visual novels I have ever played, to date, And the limited budget that this game was made on makes the achievement that PixelFade has accomplished even sweeter.\nTheir team has managed to create a memory I will never forget. A true experience.\n\nThe witty and creative writing pulled many genuine laughs from me, with many jokes and references from the real world included in the game's world.\n\nWhile a lot of the game's outcome is static, there are still a lot of great dialogue options, with some leading to absolutely GENUINELY FUNNY responses! I had to go back and select a few different options most times, as I wanted to hear what the characters had to say. \nFortunately the game's autosave feature makes this very easy to do, as the game will have multiple savepoints during choices requiring the player's input.\n\nThe Visual Novel is also not shy to make fun of itself as well, even breaking the fourth wall. All in good taste.\n\nThis VN sets the benchmark for the rest of the genre and is definitely worth the price. (If you catch it on sale then please support the devs on Patreon or something! They really deserve it)\nI didn't know this was an indie game until I realized it at the game's ending credits. I would have been led to believe otherwise if it wasn't mentioned.\n\nI can't believe I didn't pick this up sooner.\n\nWonderful!\n\nTL;DR:\n\n+ Story execution was totally nailed.\n+ Great humor, I laughed more times than I laugh at any 'comedy' movie, and the story still managed to be emotionally investing. \n+ Characters have genuine, likeable personalities.\n+ Fully voiced in English\n+ It's genuinely fun. I don't usually binge play or binge watch things. It usually takes me days to finish a full length movie. I couldn't stop playing this however!\n+ Quirky and very intelligent script writing.\n+++ You get to pilot a freaking mecha! Who doesn't love that?\n\n~ Artwork quality varies, Some characters are just silhouettes\n~ Music mostly repetitive, however appropriate for the situation\n\n- Full story only took about 9.5 hours to complete. (One romance route). Harsh giving this a negative considering the game's limited budget and resources.\n- There's so much more that could have been explored with the main story. A few things left unexplained.\n\nPLEASE OH PLEASE GIVE ME A SEQUEL ONE DAY.

You are a mech pilot coming over to Japan from the US after an accident kills your parents. At which point it's as straightforward as you expect. You meet a variety young ladies, a best friend and deal with your younger sister and go about choosing which one you like best and hanging out with them. \n\nDespite it's formulaic plot it is very well written both interjects humor both in it's situations and more importantly from the writing itself. While each girl in and of herself comes of as the tropes you'd see in an anime (The innocent nice girl, the kinda slut, the shy nerd, and the aggressive jock) all of them are infused with enough personality that I found myself overlooking the fact that they were all tropes. It also does a nice job giving them realistic backstories that don't come off as either \"really that bothers you,\" or \"why are all of your lives terrible.\" I found myself laughing out loud on a number of occasions in particular when dealing with the younger sister character who as an older brother myself understood perfectly where the main character was coming from so kudo's to the writers for doing a nice job with that dynamic. I also appreciated that the game would thrown in timers to force you to make quick decisions keeping the reader engaged and giving it a more game like feel than other visual novels.\n\nThe only drawback and criticism I have of this is the voice acting. While the characters Valarie, Nikki, and Shou are pretty good the rest aren't great. I'm glad the game decided to go forward with voice acting but takes a little bit of getting used to as it isn't great. \n\nSo if you're looking to get into visual novels a few things to remember. These kinds of games are meant for be replayed as a standard play through is between 3-4 hours. Which at $20 may be a bit high if you only want to play it once.

Det kunne sagtens v\u00e6re blevet en omgang engelsk, men jeg f\u00f8lte for at g\u00e5 lidt imod str\u00f8mmen.\n\nOBS: Det er reelt set en h\u00e5ndfuld m\u00e5neder siden at jeg faktisk spillede AA, samt jeg gennemfik kun 2 af de 5 \"routes\", som spillet indeholder. For de uindviede er en \"route\" eller rute, hvad der svarer til et sammenh\u00e6ngende handlingsspor, der for langt de fleste popul\u00e6re \"visuelle noveller/romaner\", er defineret ud fra hvem ens romantiske interesse er.\n\nIntro til AA: Ace acedemy er en vestligt(Can/USA/EU) udviklet visuel roman, der i mods\u00e6tning til de fleste andre af disse lader til at have haft et mere solidt \u00f8konomisk grundlag. N\u00e6sten alle st\u00f8rre og mere popul\u00e6re VN's er japanske. Derfor syntes jeg selv at AA er et frisk pust i en genre der kan syntes at v\u00e6re lidt for domineret af de samme clicheer og forudsigelige persontyper man finder i de fleste \u00f8stlige(japanske) VN. Ace Acedemy tager i stedet disse clicheer og g\u00f8r p\u00e5 egen m\u00e5de grin med de mange stereotyper og er i det hele taget fyldt med en masse popkulturelle referencer, memes og trolling af mange typer.\n\nRammerne: Ace Acedemy foreg\u00e5r engang om nogle \u00e5rtier i 40'erne eller 50'erne og der er en r\u00e6kke sm\u00e5futuristiske elementer, hvoraf det v\u00e6sentligste er eksistensen af mechs, dvs. menneskestyrede kampplatforme med 2 arme og ben. I AA er det dog kun i tr\u00e6nings og konkurenceregi at disse maskiner ses, da vores hovedperson er studerende og mech pilot p\u00e5 Ace Acedemy, som vistnok har et lidt mere fancy japansk navn.\nJa, spillet foreg\u00e5r p\u00e5 en japansk high school og hvis man i det hele taget er ret skeptisk hvad anime og dennes subkultur ang\u00e5r, s\u00e5 kan det godt v\u00e6re at man bare skal lede efter spil andre steder.\n\nHistorie/handling: Dette nok ikke Ace Acedemy's st\u00e6rkeste side, da det prim\u00e6re handlingsforl\u00f8b ikke rigtigt f\u00f8les tilendegjort, n\u00e5r man sider og bladrer gennem rulleteksterne. Man n\u00e5r simpelthen ikke at se konsekvenserne af de mange valg man tr\u00e6ffer i l\u00f8bet af historien. Handlingen er overvejende let og komisk i tonen, men form\u00e5r stadig at v\u00e6re rimelig seri\u00f8s p\u00e5 de rigtige tidspunkter. \n\nGameplay: Der er egentlig ikke s\u00e5 meget af komme efter, da det netop er en visuel roman vi har med at g\u00f8re. Man klikker sig gennem handlingen p\u00e5 samme m\u00e5de som man l\u00e6ser linjer i en bog, blot med computer grafik og musik til at forbedre oplevelsen undervejs. Sammenlignet med andre visuelle noveller foretager man i AA langt flere personlige valg. De fleste af disse valg g\u00f8r dog kun en forskel i dialogen og den l\u00e6ste tekst, men b\u00e5de ved de store og sm\u00e5 valg, f\u00f8les det som om at der fakisk er konsekvenser. Man har i det hele taget gode muligheder for at spille en \"role play\" som en bestemt slags person og f\u00e5 noget ud af det. \nI kraft af ens valg er det ogs\u00e5 at man kan tilbringe mere eller mindre tid med de 4 \"heroines/heltinder\" eller ens bedste ven der i udpr\u00e6get grad fungerer som comic relief. Alt efter ens prefer\u00e6ncer vil man l\u00e5se sig fast p\u00e5 et underliggende romatisk handlingsspor med en af heltinderne eller ingen af dem.\n\nPersoner: Personerne og udviklingen af deres indbyrdes forhold, er i kraft en det mangelfulde handlingsforl\u00f8b, nok Ace Academys st\u00f8rste tr\u00e6kplaster. Derfor en kort beskrivelse af de vigtigste personer:\nMC(main character): 21 \u00e5r, Amerikaner p\u00e5 xx \u00e5r, blond, atlestisk/intuitiv/klog(eget valg)\nNikki: 17 \u00e5r, Lilles\u00f8ster, s\u00f8d, manipulerende, blond, \nKaori: R\u00f8dt h\u00e5r, tsundere(arrigog vred det meste af tiden), arbejdsom,\nYuuna: 21 \u00e5r, Lilla/lyser\u00f8dt h\u00e5r, hj\u00e6lpsom, team maneger(eller noget lignende),\nValerie: 20 \u00e5r, Fransk, mech mekaniker/ingeni\u00f8r, klogere end man f\u00e5r indtryk af, flirtende, blond\nMayu: 20 \u00e5r, Bl\u00e5sort h\u00e5r, genert, venlig, if\u00f8lge spiludviklerens forum, den v\u00e6rste af heltinderne.\nShou: 21 \u00e5r, M\u00f8rkblond h\u00e5r, mech pilot, comic relief, baseret p\u00e5 Yusuke fra Persona 4, (over)entusiatisk, lidt pervers, etc.\nKaito: Yngre 30'ere, m\u00f8rkt h\u00e5r, onkel via MC og Nikki's mor, lidt en ungkarl.\n\n\nAndet godt: Mere eller mindre al dialog med undtagelse af jeg-personen selv, har engelske stemmer. I AA g\u00f8r stemmeskuespillerne et s\u00e5 godt stykke arbejde, at jeg vil vove at p\u00e5st\u00e5 at der ikke findes bedre indenfor visuelle romaner p\u00e5 engelsk.\nDe visuelle elementer er i det hele taget godt udf\u00f8rt, b\u00e5de sprites(2D tegninger af personerne), baggrunde og CG's(computergenererede billeder) er flotte. \nSoundtracket passer i \u00f8vrigt ogs\u00e5 godt sammen med rammerne og skaber en tilpas futuristisk, men hverdagsagtig atmosf\u00e6re.\n\nResten af det mindre gode: Man kan til tider godt savne at der m\u00e5ske var et lidt st\u00f8rre antal baggrunde. Det giver mening at bruge samme baggrund for f. eks hovedpersonens sovev\u00e6relse, klassev\u00e6relse og mech garage, men der er ogs\u00e5 enkelte gange hvor man bem\u00e6rker samme baggrund ved eller ret forskellige lokaliteter.\nSom tidligere n\u00e6vnt, skulle spillet have v\u00e6ret lidt l\u00e6ngere, s\u00e5 man p\u00e5 den m\u00e5de kunne f\u00e5 sluttet handlingen ordenligt af. Det f\u00f8les lidt som om at k\u00f8re rundt p\u00e5 en racerbane og s\u00e5 l\u00f8be t\u00f8r for br\u00e6ndstof en runde eller 3 f\u00f8r m\u00e5l.\n\nAlt i alt: Jeg vil da gerne anbefale dette spil til dem som godt kan lide en komisk og lethjertet oplevelse, inklusive et m\u00e5ske lidt \"fluffy/nuttet\" romantisk subplot. Langt de fleste der rent faktisk har en bruger her p\u00e5 steam burde finde is\u00e6r humoren tiltalende.\n\nLad v\u00e6r at investere eller vent p\u00e5 et steam sale, hvis en eller flere g\u00e6lder: \nDu er typen der resolut foretr\u00e6kker mere seri\u00f8se plotlines, \nikke kan fordrage MOE(japansk begreb, google det), \ner en weeb hater, \nsv\u00e6rt foretr\u00e6kker 3D gameplay, \nhar begr\u00e6nset tid at bruge p\u00e5 spil, visuelle noveller kr\u00e6ver relativt meget tid og er ikke egnet til en hurtig session p\u00e5 en halv times spil eller mindre.", "timestamp_created": 1497475660, "timestamp_updated": 1497475660, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32411648": {"recommendationid": "32411648", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971215858", "num_games_owned": 161, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 733, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502315741}, "language": "english", "review": "The game was a really fun experience that delved into a post-modern world full of mechs, forgetting your phone in a cockpit, and getting yelled at.\n\nP.S.

He recently transferred to a Japanese piloting academy because his parents recently died in a car accident and his Japanese uncle (mother's brother) has taken him and his little sister into his home (and also because Japan). The art is beautiful, the music is functional (and pretty badass at some points), the girls are stereotypical in a good way, and I could complain about the voice over, but that's just because I'm a total snob when it comes to that sort of thing.\n\nProbably the most stand-out feature of the storytelling is the frequent use of metahumor and internet memes. Anyone who has spent a significant part of their life on Reddit or something will recognize many phrases in the funnier possible responses. Additionally, there's a fair amount of lampshading and fourth wall breaking (including one particularly egregious example toward the end on one of the paths; you'll know it when you see it). If you're into that sort of thing (and I absolutely am), you will love it.\n\nAnother great thing about it is how frequently you get to make choices. This isn't even remotely like a kinetic novel. It isn't even like something like Clanaad, which does have plenty of choices but also has extremely extended periods of just following along with the story. This game frequently checks with the player for input, and I really appreciate that. Along with that are the time limited choices. For example, there are a number of combat situations (arena mech fights) in which the player has to pick from among a large number of choices, many of which are a fail, within five or so seconds. If you're a fast reader (as I am), you won't have too much trouble with this, but it does add to the excitement. It especially adds to the excitement when it is unexpected, as it is at those moments when the story decides it is time for the player to bust a move... but you'd better do it quick, before the opportunity passes.\n\nAnd if you find yourself having trouble with some aspect of the choices, the archetype you choose for yourself at the beginning (athletic, academic, or social) can help with those by highlighting the correct choice in green (or maybe giving youa choice you wouldn't already have; I don't know since I've only played once with the academic archetype).\n\nThe art is plenty ecchi (particularly on beach day), but there's no hentai, which is usually how I like it.\n\nI grabbed this in a Steam sale, but I'd say that even if it weren't on sale, it would be worth the price.

Shou was a riot, as is every secondary character/ comic relief haha & I love how he always gets the heat from everybody it's just too much. Everyone else had their own great quirks, but I love them all just the same. I also like how we gradually dig into the mystery of the deaths of the the main characters parents, that was really good. But I only wish the story didn't just end with the MC taking the core data into a drive & not persue further. If you guys can ever bring Ace Academy back with a sequel, I will definetely support it 100% And perhaps with the sequel, you guys could continue the story somehow from where it ended, as well as with whichever route we ended on. From there you could create further relationship development, maybe some struggles & whatnot. Any way, if that can ever be a possibility, I would be glad to help you guys out!

Not only can one inform or educate with a good story, but also entertain with it as well.  Video games are all about storytelling.  The most memorable games are usually ones that have a good backstory that draws you in to the action.  A very select few transcend even that remarkable achievement by creating their own realms and characters, with such rich detail and massive potential, you can't help but want to know more about them.  These games make you want to follow every adventure around every twist and turn, and wonder what the next chapters in the story might be, even if the story has already reached an ending.\n\nThis is one of those games.\n\nI'm simply amazed at the level of quality and detail that went into this.  I'll admit it isn't 100% perfect - no game I've played has ever been that way.  Still, the combination of a well-thought-out story arc, mecha action, plot choices, romanceable characters, artwork, and music make this VN well worth playing through multiple times.  I've already played through it a few times, and I'm continuing to do so, just so I can play through all the character romances.  \n\nWhat also makes this VN worth playing are the bits of comedy strewn throughout the story.  The character dialogue alone can evoke a few laughs, but then you can be faced with a choice of options, and one of them is 'Sniggity snooty, I'm comin' for that booty!'  I mean, come on!  That's comedy gold right there!  It's also a lot of fun to explore each of the characters' storylines, getting to know their traits and selecting choices that play into them.\n\nLike I mentioned earlier, this game has left me wanting for more, which is a really good thing in this case.  I know the developers have hinted about the possibility of revisiting this VN to do a sequel someday, personally, I could see a whole lot more being done with it.  A sequel has a strong chance of being commercially and critically successful; so does an expansion chapter to this existing VN.  I could even see this becoming an animated series, given the right resources and staffing.\n\nYes, it really is that good.  But don't just take my word for it.  96% positive ratings at the time of this review speaks for itself.  I'm looking forward to seeing PixelFade's next VN - Crystalline.  Given how wonderful this VN was, I'm sure Crystalline will be a mega-hit.", "timestamp_created": 1495253439, "timestamp_updated": 1495253439, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31835680": {"recommendationid": "31835680", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028809370", "num_games_owned": 156, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 294, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495176135}, "language": "english", "review": "tl;dr - ACE Academy was a very bipolar experience for me, with very strong strengths and very glaring weaknesses. If you're looking for a light, humorous slice of life with mecha elements, you're highly likely to enjoy the game. If you're looking for something deep, profound, or moving, with highly developed characters and an intricate plot, you probably won't. As long as you play to the game's strengths, I would happily recommend it. \n\n\nACE Academy's biggest strength is the humor. The game is hilarious as long as you enjoy memes, references, and trolling. I laughed a ton while I was playing it. If that kind of humor isn't your style, I wouldn't recommend it. I also thought the art was a strength (except for random NPCs being black silhouettes - I found it really jarring, but a friend told me that's a standard practice for VNs), but take a look for yourself. Whether you'll enjoy the art should be pretty apparent from screenshots. \n\nOther than the humor, the game is decently well done, but nothing exceptional. The characters more or less embody anime archtypes, but they're compelling enough to at least be likeable. The main exception is the little sister, who very much goes against common Japanese imouto tropes, and in my opinion she's the best character.  Family dynamics were definitely the strong point of character interaction. The rest of it is a fairly generic (but well executed) slice of life. \n\n\nThe biggest flaw of the game is related to the plot - it simply doesn't feel complete. The downside of a slice of life is that it's easy to fall into a trap where nothing seems to happen, and ACE Academy ends before any major plot elements are resolved. What could have been a great transition from a slice of life to a mystery thriller is simply left untapped. When I hit the ending, I actually thought the game had glitched for a little bit. Developing character relationships are left hanging right as they're starting to get good, and in general there's no sense of closure in any story element. \n\nI wonder if PixelFade is planning on releasing a sequel. They put a lot of work into setting up the world and characters, and as it stands it feels like wasted effort.\n\nEven with my negative stance towards the game's length and handling of the plot, I still would recommend ACE Academy. Its strengths are just THAT good, and as long as you play it with the right expectations, you'll find it to be highly amusing and entertaining. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1495177871, "timestamp_updated": 1495177871, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.736524", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31654050": {"recommendationid": "31654050", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068739145", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 460, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495122704}, "language": "english", "review": "this is a absolutely FANTASTIC visual novel that i would recommend to just about anyone who enjoys the genre! the characters are all loveable in their own ways, it has some suprising drama and some dark mysteries that i would not have expected from a slice of life game. probably the best thing about the game is it's sense of humor. the game is chock full of pop culture references and some of the diolog options are gold (I shit you not \"swaggity swooty I'm comming for that booty\" and \"are you not entertained?!?\" are fucking diolog options!). altho i wish the character path lock in was more obvious, and sometimes the protagonist acted in a way that i would have liked to prevent (for example, I hate the whole \"rude and overprotective big brother/ father fucks with sister/daughter's boyfriend\" trope and would have liked to have an option to at least be civil). also for some reason some of the voice clips didn't play at some points. all that being said it is a fantastic game that is well worth the 20 bucks to play! anyone on the fence with this game should at least give it a shot.", "timestamp_created": 1494362277, "timestamp_updated": 1494362277, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31644045": {"recommendationid": "31644045", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128902663", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1057, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1514532937}, "language": "english", "review": "Officially the best Visual Novel i have ever played with an amazing interface and the best part different than other games i played ,of scrolling back and exploring your options (as u all know we always do that).

It has it's flaws, and I'll get to that, but for the most part this is VN has been a blast to play. I'm not going to go into detail summing up what Ace Academy is about, if anything you've already read the synopsis, and now what you really want to know is whether it\u2019s worth your time, and more importantly, worth your money. I can safely say that the answer to both those questions are: Yes! and Yes! I got this for $10 on a Steam sale, and I would have easily spent the full asking price of $20 for this awesome experience, and the creator's deserve your support.\n\nAce Academy is funny, exciting, and even gives you some feels here and there. The art, while not amazing, is decent, and the CG\u2019s in particular are pretty good. The characters, if somewhat archetypical, are all endearing and decently voice acted (for the most part). Especially considering the cast is made up of mostly amateur, to semi-professional voice actors. \n\nTo top it all off, Ace Academy fulfilled my childhood dream of shouting \u201cSHINING FINGER!!!!!\u201d right before my transformed mech tore apart my opponent. That experience alone was worth the price of admission! \n\nOverall 7/10\n\n[Long Version]\n\nAce Academy is a rarity, in that it is one of the few visual novels that is fully voiced IN ENGLISH, and this is the first fully voiced English VN I\u2019ve played. I\u2019ve played a decent amount of visual novels, but all of them were voiced in Japanese, and at least one of them SHOULD have been voiced in English (for more on that check out my review of No One But You). \n\nThe characters and cast of this VN are, for the most part, very well done, and one of the stand out characters is actually YOU! Because you get to be the protagonist. When talking about the player character, one of the things that Ace Academy did well is the shear amount of choices you can make. This is a very interactive VN. Unlike some other VNs, where you\u2019re given maybe a couple choices that pretty much amount to: \u201cWhich character route do you want to play?\u201d Ace Academy has close to a hundred different choices that you can make at different instances throughout the story, and a lot of the options are pretty hilarious. For the most part, these just simply add to the story, giving you several options of how to react to events going on in the story, while a dozen or so directly affect the progression of the plot. You can also imagine my surprise when I was given a choice in a high intensity situation, and suddenly noticed a countdown timer on the screen. So, this VN will even make sure that you\u2019re paying attention at times when your character needs to make split second decisions. \n\nThis, combined with how the player character was written, led to an experience that I feel can be very personalized for every play through. The player character has enough depth that he doesn\u2019t seem too generic and boring, while also not being so intricate that he becomes unrelatable to the point where you can't see yourself as him. Since most of the aspects of his character are left for you to decide.\n\nIn regards to the other cast of characters, as this is a VN/Dating Sim, there are four heroines whose character arcs you can explore. I\u2019ll be honest, these four heroines are pretty archetypical, you\u2019ve got Kaori, the tsundere, Mayu, the shy girl, Valerie, the mischievous flirt, and Yuuna, the sweet girl next door. However, despite being archetypical, they do manage to have enough character depth and development where I can excuse their initial lack of originality. In addition, there are several supporting characters including the plucky \u201cbest friend\u201d character Shou, your Imouto, (your little sister, for all you uncultured plebs) and your uncle that you live with, that stand out, and that I really enjoyed.\n\nHaving just finished Mayu\u2019s arc, I will say that there are some aspects of her story that I wish had been handled differently. The whole progression of your relationship with her was somewhat anticlimactic in my opinion. I\u2019m a big fan of dramatic confessions, and passionate kisses, and I sadly didn\u2019t get that. There was also this whole aspect of her relationship with her father that was repeatedly mentioned in the story, but never fully explored. However, as a whole I enjoyed her arc. \n\nNow, as I get to some of my main gripes with Ace Academy, let me start by talking about the voice acting. For the most part, the voice acting in Ace Academy is fine. There are some moments, and one character in particular, that were a bit grating, but nothing that seriously grinded on my nerves. If I had to list the strongest performances they would probably lead as follows: Shou, Nikki, Valerie, and then everyone else did fine, but had a couple lines here and there that seemed to fall little short, and could have been delivered better...and then there\u2019s Kaori.\n\nI\u2019ll be honest, I don\u2019t like tsunderes to begin with, but Kaori\u2019s character was probably my least favorite from this story, and sadly I believe this is due in large part to how her character was voiced. I don\u2019t know where the blame here lies, whether it\u2019s with the director, or with Kaori\u2019s VA, but her performance was pretty grating at times. There simply wasn\u2019t a lot of range with Kaori\u2019s emotions. She simply sounded pissed off all the time, and delivered her lines basically with the same tone and rhythm every time she spoke. It was as if she was given the whole script and just told, \u201cOkay, read every line like you\u2019re pissed at someone,\u201d and she read the whole script like that, without actually reading the other character\u2019s lines for context. That\u2019s probably not what happened, but that\u2019s what it felt like. \n\nThe only other thing I would mention on the voice acting, was that there were certain lines that were just completely dropped, sometimes mid conversation. This didn\u2019t happen till more than half way through, but they did, and again I can understand that mistakes were made here and there, and they didn\u2019t happen frequently enough for me to become too upset. \n\nIn regards to the story, I really liked Ace Academy, I simply wish there was more, and to an extent I feel the people a PixelFade feel the same way, and they were simply trying to do the best with the resources available to them, and at the end of the day I\u2019m impressed with what we got. I really believe that the selling point of this VN is it\u2019s comedy. Like I said earlier, this VN has A TON of pop culture references in it. With Gladiator being one of my all time favorite movies, I appreciated the many Gladiator references. However, I will say that there are times when I felt that Ace Academy was a little too dependent on it\u2019s otaku and pop culture references for it\u2019s comedy. I personally love that kind of comedy, but I can understand if someone playing Ace Academy got tired of it after awhile.\n\nYou might feel after reading all of my gripes Ace Academy, that I\u2019ve been pretty harsh, but what I say, I say out of love, and I can tell that this was a labor of love for PixelFade. I really did enjoy Ace Academy at the end of the day, and I will definitely go back and play the rest of the story routes...even Kaori\u2019s. I am simply offering constructive criticism. I know it probably won't happen, but if there ever was a sequel, or remake of Ace Academy, I would love to see these aspects improved upon, and knowing that PixelFade is making more games, I hope they learn from both their achievements, as well as their mistakes moving forward, and make even better games. \n\nIf you at PixelFade are reading this, keep up the good work!

But without spoiling anything, a huge plot thread is gone unanswered. I don't know if the devs have a sequel planned, but in my opinion if they didn't have the time to flesh out the lore behind the protagonist's Core, they should have made less intrigue around it.

You see, I don't think any game could pull off the VN formula as well as ACE did, at least not for me. The story is emotional, beautiful, and brilliant, with lots of pop culture refs. Plus (and this is very important for me), the game wraps you up in the characters-- their flaws, their charms, their problems, the way they interact with the main character-- and then it's over, just as quickly as it started. Believe it or not, this is actually a key strength. People don't realize a lot of the time, but when a game is short and sweet, not only can it be better than a huge game, it is also much more RECOMMENDABLE, because it's something that someone can feasibly finish all the way through and still enjoy every part of it.

I have but one complaint with the game, and that is honestly probably because I misread something at some point. I initially thought the game has some turn based fighting elements (Like Final Fantasy, or another typical RPG) what with the giant robot matches, I was disappointed to find out that this was not the case, and the game is mostly a dating/interaction simulator. That being said it is an amazing one! This game was able to make my love of giant robots fighting each other the icing on an amazing cake! The game is hilarious at points, and the characters are lovable, generating situations that made me emotional in many different ways! Like *Super duper spoilers I shouldn't put in a review*! The characters are dynamic and interesting, instead of simply single dimensional side characters, and its awesome! I must say I could complain at times that some of the scenes were used in weird ways, and the game could have definitely benefited from more backgrounds and character sprites to help convey emotion, but it is understandable and in my opinion acceptable as is!

Just gonna list the pros and cons AND MENTION THEIR GAME CRYSTALLINE WHICH IS IN KICKSTARTER. \n9/10\n\nPros:\n1. Great english voice acting.\n2. Easy rollbacks, no more spamming saves on every important decisions to see the different reactions.\n3. You can be a complete smarta$$.\n4. Likable waifus (I had to try them all.)\n5. So many references, can't hate on that.\n6. You can learn about visual novels inside a visual novel.\n\nCons:\n1. Just me but it could be longer. Mainly because I'm needy.\n2. Somewhat predictable.\n3. This is towards the creators but they need more games.\n4. Crystalline's goal in kickstarter not met yet.\n\nAs someone who used to be really into visual novels and just recently started picking them back up again. ACE Academy was a good way to start again even though I'm not a fan of most of Steam's visual novels. Most visual novels I've been through was voiced in Japanese and I've heard not so good things about any of them being voiced in English but this one was wonderfully voiced in English.\n\nNow for the characters. Most of time I'd see a romance option I'd be okay without. I didn't have one in this, I needed to be with them all. I know, I'm a whore. Anyway, the romance options was a difficult phase, I was stuck between the French flirty blonde or the fiery aggresive red head in the end (I chose Kaori. She won my heart with that soft side and let's admit, anime. Girls enjoying anime is an instant 6/10 with only being able to score higher to me.) \n\nThe story was new to me. I'm not really into Mech or sci fi things, I enjoy the classic magic and steel sort of theme. But this thing got me wanting to play some Mech games, so big big plus. While the story is predictable in some things it doesn't make it any less enjoyable. Who wouldn't want to be in a family of wisecracks? And the numerous references makes the game memorable imo because you'll always remember the references you catch.\n\nIn the end, I would strongly recommend this game to anyone seeking to look into visual novels.

This was my first time ever playing or buying a visual novel and I was thoroughly impressed at the amount of content ACE Academy offers. As gamer new to \"visual novel\" games, I enjoyed being able to have the options to choose what the main character (the player) does to develop one's relationship with the other characters; I was met with heart-warming moments, comedic scenes, serious encounters, and an intriuging story that unfolded as I went further. I haven't quite played all the routes quite yet (only finished one so far), but I couldn't resist leaving a review before I went back and do the others. \n\n[b]Be Aware:[/b]\n~ The game does reuse scenery quite a bit\n~ So far I have done one playthrough of many to come and I am currently sitting at about 7 hours of gameplay for time estimate\n~ I bought this game when it was on sale\n~ The voice acting is pretty decent, but it is as most of the other reviews say \"It's just there to help with atmosphere.\" I certainly agree it does!\n~ I did notice a few grammer issues like past-tense and pretense errors during my gameplay, but should not annoy you too much if you aren't strict about grammer\n~ The art style is modern/contemporary and is easy to adapt to\n~ The music really kicks in at the appropriate times working with the other elements of the gameplay to create that comedic, serious, or warm moment in time\n\n[b]Genre's I Thought the Game Fell Into:[/b]\n~ Mecha\n~ Sci-Fi\n~ Romance\n~ Comedy\n~ Slice of Life\n~ School\n\n[b]Final Notes:[/b]\nI hope my review encourages one's decision whether or not if this game might be something one would enjoy. I watch anime myself and I love having the options to weave how the story will unfold, instead of having the story be one way. Definately would recommend this game to anyone who watches anime with the following genre tag combination I listed above. ^_^ I look forward to seeing a sequel and any new VN's the developers of this indie company will produce!", "timestamp_created": 1489726557, "timestamp_updated": 1489726557, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.570707", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30562943": {"recommendationid": "30562943", "author": {"steamid": "76561198145344303", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 765, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492251678}, "language": "english", "review": "I like VN but I love combat. If you want combat with a lot of depth this is not for you. If you want a VN with combat here and there then this is a good option. I bought the game because it's on sale and I was curious to how little combat this has. And the combat is basically Quick Time Events where you choose the right choice in the standard middle of the screen dialouge options with a timer on the side. To be honest, it works really well to simulate fast paced combat. The only down side is that you can't customize Eagle, your mech. But I guess it would be a lot of work to implement an actual combat system with stats and inventory. If ACE Academy have that I would give it 5 stars.\n\nHowever since it is a VN you can't just review it based on a side activity. The meat of the game is the VN elements and that I would give it 5 stars for. The English voice acting is excellent, although 2 of the characters sound a bit similar. The character CGI is beautiful, the writing is great, and the cute emotion-speech-bubble to highlight what the character is feeling is a nice addition. The writing though is what sets it apart from other VN games I have tried. The game doesn't take itself too seriously, so you have jokes and memes aplenty which not many VNs implement which is a shame. Here are a few of those memes, various alternate movies and tv shows, a certain ultimate from an edgelord from a very popular team-based first person shooter, and a globally famous meme from Dragon Ball. You can also name 1 of your own special attack and I legit named mine Falcon Punch :D\n\nSo this is a solid VN game with pseudo QTE combat which is great, but with a customizable mech, it could have been perfect. 9/10 would play again.", "timestamp_created": 1489726088, "timestamp_updated": 1511652457, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30548066": {"recommendationid": "30548066", "author": {"steamid": "76561198166828697", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1916, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505510179}, "language": "english", "review": "Lots of funny references xD\n\nAnd..lots of beauties..huehue\n\n10/10 Would grin creepily again", "timestamp_created": 1489697555, "timestamp_updated": 1489697555, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30547955": {"recommendationid": "30547955", "author": {"steamid": "76561198266917351", "num_games_owned": 392, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 361, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489867631}, "language": "english", "review": "2 many memes 4 me", "timestamp_created": 1489697133, "timestamp_updated": 1489697133, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30542780": {"recommendationid": "30542780", "author": {"steamid": "76561198312517562", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 1257, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 123, "last_played": 1514534930}, "language": "english", "review": "This is what could happen if you're born about 20 years later.\nwrite your name and read your line.\ngo after the option that suitted you.\nnever regret.\nnever be a coward(even it means you need to be a pervert and get wrecked)", "timestamp_created": 1489676909, "timestamp_updated": 1514556140, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30537498": {"recommendationid": "30537498", "author": {"steamid": "76561198260555401", "num_games_owned": 184, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489583759}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5728\u6e38\u620f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d \u4e00\u76f4\u6709\u4e00\u79cd\u8fdd\u548c\u611f \u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u4e60\u60ef\u4e86\u65e5\u7cfb \u5267\u60c5\u4e00\u822c \u53ef\u4ee5\u5c1d\u8bd5 \u4f46\u4e2a\u4eba\u4e0d\u662f\u5f88\u559c\u6b22\u8fd9\u79cd \u5df2\u5220", "timestamp_created": 1489648581, "timestamp_updated": 1489648581, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.346446", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30519583": {"recommendationid": "30519583", "author": {"steamid": "76561198223273108", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491319718}, "language": "english", "review": "So I was looking for Visual Novels on Steam which are on sale (Everyone wants sales) then I came across this VN.

Where many routes dont seem to affect the story in anyway there are still many choices that provide extra or different dialoge and allow you to further immerse yourself into the RPG experience which was a well done twist on visual novels. During my play through I focused on the Valerie route and was sucked into an emotionally fulfilling story between to students. This story was full of laughter and sly comments, but lets not forget about the real reason we play these types of games. Yes, the romance. Honestly fellas (and gals) this games romance was not lacking in any sence. I was immensely pleased how they allowed the dialoge to play out giving the player different options on serious or joking comments and event gave to opportunity to make physical choices as well. Every character had their own unique personality and makes you fall inlove with them. Even Shou, the well known comic relief is an amazing character shaping the story. I can't wait to play this game again and see what other choices I can make and how the story changes.

The rest are passable. Yuuna best girl, yeah I said it, fight me in real life.\n\nThe voice acting was a big part of the enjoyment for me, it was a welcome new addition, seeing as all the voice acted VN's on steam are spoken in Japanese. No offence to sub watchers, I just prefer dubs. Anyways the overall quality of the VA I felt was kinda low, I know that the people who made this are an indie company and you gotta start somewhere, but there were times when I heard echo, some of the lines could have been delivered a little better, hopfully there next game will be a little more refined in the VA department.\n\nNow I want to talk about all the choices and stuff. I was pretty let down by the abrupt ending, it felt like they where way behind and had to just push the game throught. They dident have to tie everything up in a little bow, I just would of liked a little more closure on everything, end the game on a more imperative note. Maybe i'm just salty because I dident \"get\" with any of the girls because I spread my time out with a bunch of different people. \n\nThe visuals are nice to look at, I don't think as nice as some of the other ones you can play on steam, but still ok for a indie company, I thought that the pictures of the mechs where pretty cool so I will give them props for that. This was clearly a passion project for the individuals involved in making it.\n\nOverall, I think you should give this game a shot. It will keep you busy for about 4 hours give or take, depending on how fast you read, and as comes with all the things associated with VN, a nice escape from reality into a world of cute girls and giant mech suits, even though it does have its faults, I gaurentee you will find yourself chucking over some of the jokes and references, and having a fun time finding your waifu.", "timestamp_created": 1485641992, "timestamp_updated": 1485641992, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29515000": {"recommendationid": "29515000", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089498051", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1359, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498358258}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best VR i played so far !! the story is really good at getting those deepen feeling come out and feel awesome!", "timestamp_created": 1485493030, "timestamp_updated": 1485493030, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29443372": {"recommendationid": "29443372", "author": {"steamid": "76561198249237304", "num_games_owned": 480, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 1670, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485178656}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]Just a fair warning, the review ahead contains some minor spoilers![/b]\n\nAnd finally done! That took me quite a while though. Bought this game around November 2015 and after a whole year, I finally got to sit down and play it on December 2016. After finally finished all the four routes, here's my thought about the game. It's great, it's charming, it's witty and the humor is great too, one that you may not find on the Japanese counterpart. Overall I'm really satisfied reading it. With that said, here's some quick pro and cons:\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Valerie\n[*]Great humor, the developer knew what they're doing with it, and you certainly won't be disappointed\n[*]A lot of references to some popular games and pop culture, I actually loved this part the most\n[*]Valerie best girl\n[*]Great soundtrack\n[*]Some amazing voice acting. I can't mention this enough, the voice acting on this game are definitely top notch, especially for Nikki and Valerie\n[*]Oh did I mention that Valerie is the best girl? I did? Good.\n[/list]\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Kaori. Her route feels somewhat...underwhelmed. I think it's because she got overshadowed by the main story and there's not that many room for her development. The only route that I can honestly say I didn't enjoy\n[*]The ending kinda ends abruptly, but it's understandable because they can only do with the budget they had and I heard the game is already twice as long than the one they initially planned for\n[*]The study part on the class serves almost no purpose, there's no pop quiz nor exam, save for that one part at the beginning\n[*]Some CGs are being overused a bit much, but this won't hinder you from enjoying the story.\n[/list]\nI think it's great what they've done and there's definitely a room for a sequel (when are you gonna release [b]Ace Academy: Supernova[/b], PixelFade?), so for now I'll just keep my finger crossed while waiting for their next work.", "timestamp_created": 1485181404, "timestamp_updated": 1485181546, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29409107": {"recommendationid": "29409107", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119598375", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 389, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487532753}, "language": "english", "review": "I was almost going to give this game a thumbs down for the unfinished/cut short storyline.

If your a fan of VNs i would say this games good and im watching the next game the devs are making tho i will be waiting for its full release rather then following it ep by ep and i do need to say this the ending FELT like an anime ending. We all know that ending where it ends on an arc but is clearly setting up the next one but the show ends and youd need to read the books or manga to get the real ending, However here you cant go to the source because this is it. The ending may be paramount but this game is still fun and i do feel i should support the team who made it as i have high hopes for them. Quick breakdown\n\nStory: Solid 8/10\nThis game has 4 main routes and friendship route if your too slow to get on any of the girls routes but their well paced enough to feel organic. One of the problems with this game is since you name your charecter none of the other charecters EVER call you by your name just nicknames.this threw me off at first but i got used to it after about an hour.Also quick sidenote the fact your sister is named nikki Was funny as hell to me since my REAL sisters name is nikki just a fun little note. I must say some of the side storys were ignored such as Strike X a team brought up a few times by 2 of your teammates and who was built up as a clear antagonist but is just ignored. their story and how it relates to your teammates isnt told, their written out by the writers as your preparing to fight them. This game lacks an antagonist as far as i can tell which was strange. No evil corperation or evil classmate to fight its just normal life excusing a single plot point brought up very early on and expanded slowly. Overall this game has a solid story and i hope the devs come back to this game and give it a real ending i do know their moving onto a new game for now and intend to check it out, however if this lack of ending becomes a norm for them i will update this review\n\nGameplay: 7/10\nits a visual novel with some QTE like events during the mech battles and while it was kind of cool i wish more of the battles were like the first one with mashing D to charge up and using a finisher move of your own name with a stupid catchphrase(WAY TO MUCH FUN DICKING WITH THIS XD). it was so cheesy but in a good way and i know if they put it in every fight it would have annoyed me but seeing it more would have been nice. \n\nWriting: 9/10\nTHIS STORY WILL MAKE YOUR LAUGH YOUR ASS OFF. its full of so many memes refrences to anime,other VNs, and japanese culture though the devs are american so remember they dont have a full grasp of japan which means their wrong on a few things but i only noticed when i went and looked it up. The options range from straight guy to clueless to flirty with every girl and i loved it all the way and the \"choice\" when your little sister begs your for something made me cry it was so true! If your an older brother youll get it i promise.\n\nRomance: 9/10\nall the girls feel somewhat alive, their tropes yes but they didnt feel stale each one has a few twists and diffrences that make them charecters not tropes. The routes feel natural its not Get girl to like you and sleep with her. you need to earn it and even at the end with certain girls they wont go all the way with you which makes sense since your dating for a max of a few months girls dont spread their legs at the drop of a hat gentalmen and i prefered it that way. However their are so very flirty and very implied lines of dialoge esspecially with val she wants it badly!\n\nDo i think you should buy this game? Yes i do i feel the devs deserve our support and with some more money can make something to blow us away theirs plenty of replay value with all the routes with each taking about 12 hours totaling 60 hours of gameplay, now i got this game on a steamsale for half price. If you can afford it buy it at full price i do feel its worth it but if your like me and short of cash wait for a sale then pick it up", "timestamp_created": 1483665802, "timestamp_updated": 1483665802, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29028090": {"recommendationid": "29028090", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004248928", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 550, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501018490}, "language": "polish", "review": "Je\u015bli kto\u015b lubi anime i ma niez\u0142y angielski (pisz\u0105c niez\u0142y staram sie przekaza\u0107 \u017ce hi i bye nie jest poziomem wystarczajacym do pe\u0142nego zrozumienia tre\u015bci rozm\u00f3w :D) to gra jest czym\u015b co poprostu musi sobie kupi\u0107 i po\u015bwi\u0119ci\u0107 na ni\u0105 odrobine czasu gdy\u017c jest naprawd\u0119 bardzo wci\u0105gaj\u0105c\u0105 produkcj\u0105 z jak\u0105 do tej pory jeszcze niestety nie mia\u0142em okazji si\u0119 spotka\u0107 a naprawd\u0119 warto.

And I was not disappoint!  I absolutely love the amount of choice this VN gives you.  You get to choose who to hang out with, you get to choose how to respond, and you sometimes get time-limited action prompts to make the mech battle matches feel a bit more interactive.  The story is nothing new- you're a prodigy mech pilot sent to a university in Japan and get to enjoy spending time with your uncle and sister and your new mech battle team including a best bro and two other female pilots, a manager, and an engineer.  You can go for a romance if you want, but it's not required.  There are a couple of VN troopes included (the bikini scene with everyone commenting on each others' boob sizes), but the devs make a note of self-awareness with these scenes.  The game has a happy and fun tone, and I genuinely enjoyed the interactions.  The plot is moved forward by your growing competition to get a sponsor and become the top ranked mech team, your growing relationships with the main characters, and an emerging mystery about the secrets installed in the mech that your father finished before he died.  The backgrounds and character models are rather limited, but the developers did the best with the limited resources they had.

This is, in my opinion, unusual for a videogame. It comes across well. You can play him as a chauvanist jerk and annul his charisma.\n\n-Shou- This is the 'wingman' character. Very outgoing, and likeable.\n\n-Nikki- This is the player character's sister. She is very likeable. She is the most endearing character in my opinion.\n\n-Kaori- She is the tempermental orange-haired and eyed authoritative girl. She is very likeable in my opinion. She likes anime, melee, and small children. Her route seems to have the most effort put into it, and doesn't have as many chances to implode.\n\n-Mayu- She is extremely shy, cannot stand to be alone, and has a very dark side you can see, at most, twice. She likes playing violin, comic books, and paintball. Mayu is the team sniper. Her route is the most difficult I've tried. You have to choose one dialogue option or the route will implode(She should be with Shou), and Shou will take her. I may or may not have been teary.\n\n-Valerie- The flirty French girl. She is extremely intelligent and self-sufficient. She likes doing things. All her activities are errands outside save a gym sparring room conversation. There is one possibility for the route to implode(kiss her you fool). This was my personal fav. It was like Mayu's route without the soul-crushing failure.\n\n-Yuuna- Yuuna is the most upstanding moral self-sacrificing character in the game. She likes tennis, nuturing things, and cooking.

One of the best, if not the best VN I have ever played. \nAt first I was unimpressed, the logo, while nice seemed very similar to other VN's and anime so I just put into my wishlist and waited for a sale or if I ever really wanted to play it, but what cought my eye was the english dubbing. At first I was reluctant, because I very much enjoy japanese dubbing, VN's and anime are usually just not right without it, but here, its almost perfect.

I loved just about all the characters and their VA's, they are well placed and do a good job, if there is anything to criticise about this, it is that the volume and clarity of the voice dips from character to character at times (Uncle Kaito, as hilarious as he is, he is somewhat muddy (?) I guess, not the VA's fault tho, I am sure) but that might be just me or my pc/laptop. The art is great, vibrant and pleasant (altho Mayu cg pictures look very different from her sprite :D) and the music is outstanding, landing the situation proper umpf! when needed. The overarching story is a bit weak, while I was not expecting actual investigation or anything, it was wrapped up very quickly, not badly mind you, just very quickly. But honestly I do not mind at all, the \"main\" story was there just to pave way for the everyday life and the interactions, and it did that splendidly.\nAnother thing that pleasantly surprised me, is that your friends have lifes even outside of you, which is very unusual. Normally in vn's or rom simulators interesting things happen only when MC is around, but here, if you are not spending time with certain people, they still have the same experience, you are just not there and only hear about it later. Girls start dating or have crush on other guys, they get more involved in their work or hobbies etc. its very cool to see and it does not happen very often in other games of this kind. Altho I do have to say I do not appreaciate my anyone getting close to my precious little imouto, that is something that needs to be fixed next time around! :D\n\nI have only two more things to say, firstly, with the budget and staff that pixelfade has available, what they did is nothing short of miraculous. You guys do not need to worry about black sprites or whatever, the enjoyment  you have out of this VN is immidiately obvious and it transfers right onto the player. And secondly, this VN is hilarious, I laughed out loud so many times at the small nods and weeby things from both cultures, it was just a blast. Embarassed Kaori si still amazing :D (And I generally dislike tsunderes!) So thank you and to everyone who likes VN's and does not have this one yet, GO GET IT! Yes, that is an order (altho you do not actually need to go out to get it, just click buy)\n\nNow, STOP.

It was a bit cliche for some parts and as much as playing through it was absolutely entertaining, I was a bit upset with the ending. I will not mention more to prevent spoilers.\n\nCharacters: 10/10\nIt seems like they covered every single type of character. The Tsundere, the goody goody, the shy, the flirty and that best friend \"Broseph\" (love the term btw) character. There isn't really much of a rival, but based on the way the setting and characters were presented, I did not fully see any reason for one. Each character sticks to their cliche personalities (and that is perfectly fine). A lot of humor is thrown here and there with many references to modern topics and shows. I especially liked some of the inuendos and dialogue options. These characters kept me grinning and laughting the majority of my game play and as weird as it sounds, I started to understand and think of the characters as friends I would meet in real life. The MCs characteristics were pretty good too. Although you tailored your character based off options made, I found myself closely resembling to MC in the way he would react and speak in certain situations (which is probably the point of this).\n\nVoice: 9/10\nI loved all the voices. For the most part they all seemed to match the characteristics of, well, the characters. I did remember some scenes where the voices seemed a bit odd or off to me, but to prevent spoiling I won't mention the scenes specifically. This is why I could not give a perfect score in this category.\n\nArt: 10/10\nArt is very bright and vibrant which fits for the anime feel of this game. I absolutely love the designs of the characters. Another thing I really appreciated was the clothing changes that a lot of the characters have. It may be a small thing, but to me it made certain scenes really stick and link you and the character's (the hero's) thoughts together. Example, when prompted with going to see a girl at a tennis match, she has a tennis outfit on that looks \"cute\" and the MC makes note of this too.\n\nMusic: 10/10\nI liked when music was used and cut out during certain scenes. It amplified the emotions and feels of the scenarios. On top of all that, the sound effects and setting music were realistic and if I had to use one word to describe it, \"Amazing.\"\n\nConclusion:\nLike I said, 13 hours got me through one playthrough. I truely enjoyed the time spend playing this game and would love to see more works from the creator. The humor is witty and, although it follows cliches, I loved having my thoughts and dialogues sync up with the MC. The two things I did not like were the battle system (which to this day still makes no sense to me) and the ending (which I will not spoil, buy the game and play it!).\n\nTL;DR\nGreat game, many waifus and jokes.

I really love the game, they really put in a bunch of content in the game that i genuinly liked, but at the same time, I felt it missed a few things. \n\nReplayability is really high. Not only are there four girls you can romance, but you can also do a friendship ending with your bro. I liked most of the characters, some definately more than others. Not just for the route choises, you also chose what type of person you are, from being an athelete, smartie, or a guy that is really observative. Athletic lets you accel at doing physical stuff, which could impress the more physical types of characters, and occasionally highlight quicktime events that'll let you do the best at. Intelligence was probably the weakest, since it was mostly for remembering things, but it did help with characters like Mayu and Yuuna that like guys that are more inclined to read. Intuitive gives you some extra conversation options that you wouldn't have otherwise, and I think it was my favorite of the builds for that. \n\n\nThe artwork and music is really good. They have multiple artists, and it definately shows, especially in the mecha section, but they all seem to kind of blend well together, and none of them look bad. Some of the music pieces I really wanted to jam out to, like the music that plays in mecha battles for one. The voice acting was also good, though there were some characters that sounded terribly directed, bored, and or had a bad mic. The main cast are all well voice acted though. I especially liked Nikki's VA. VA is in English BTW. So to some people that might be a turn off, but I like English VA, and have heard some of the actors in previous indie games, so it was nice to hear them again for me at least.\n\nThe bad points are, I think they put focus into some things, and ignored other things they could have done. The game is filled with memes and anime refferences, and a bunch of events that don't really have much substance other than \"spend time with your waifu.\" I was kind of surprised when the game ended my first time through, because it was really underwhelming for me on how it ended. Mecha battles weren't really as fun as the first match, which left me wondering why bother programming the prelims mash d to attack and all if it was never gonna come back? Not to mention, there were a lot of areas in the game that were really American. An example: Kaori's date at an anime convention. Events like that in Japan are much different than the ones in America, and the inconsistancies in Japan stuff rubbed me a little weirdly. It felt like, maybe, the most they knew about Japan, was from Anime or video games like Persona. \nThere were a lot of little things they put in the game, like the game creators in the game universe, that took away from the time they could have put into actually adding on to the plot. In the end, looking on the main plot, it was pretty underwhealming. I also wasn't very fond of the more perverted options you could have chosen but that's just me.\n\nDoes that make it a bad game? No. I think it was a fun game to play, it just had a lot of hit and miss moments. Even with the amount of filler content in game, spending time with everyone was still fun, and I liked coming back and seeing what each dialogue option did.  I do think, that if you're interested in the game, its a fun game, well worth your time... unlessyou hate open-ended endings.", "timestamp_created": 1482276390, "timestamp_updated": 1482276595, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541284", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28461432": {"recommendationid": "28461432", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075275256", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 516, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479358764}, "language": "english", "review": "Such a great game, but there are a few cons. \n\nPros\n- Funny as shit, you will be laughing throughout the game\n- Story has an interesting concept\n- All the charecters are really fleshed out and just fun to watch interact with one another\n- Killer writing\n- Nice art\n- Good Meta-humor\n- Good player control\n\nCons\n- Story is sorta bland in presentation\n- Story also ends halfway through, honestly I beg this studio to finish the story, I love these charecters so much.\n\nFinal Verdict:\nBuy it, play the 9 or so hours they have of one story line (I went for Kaori), be sad there isn't more, and then go back and re do some of your favorite scenes and make differnt decisons.", "timestamp_created": 1482122663, "timestamp_updated": 1482122663, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28439051": {"recommendationid": "28439051", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047656843", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 892, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481948848}, "language": "english", "review": "I cannot stress enough how much I enjoyed my time with this game.

All the cast is voiced acted in English and it sound professional and appropriate to each character. The characters themselves rely on established troupes, but I'll give it a pass since the writing is self-aware and isn't afraid to poke fun of itself.

It may not change the whole plot, but the little comments make the choices feel fleshed out. Buy this game if you're looking to interact with a fun cast of characters.

The characters I think everyone can like, and with the different developments in these characters they seem scarily life-like. Even if they're just 2-D images.\nThere have been many instances in this game where I have had to keep myself from laughing too hard, I swear if I had to hear another scene from 'Nikki Vs. Kaito' I would've probably had to restrain myself.\nBut, for those of you who like a good story, with likeable characters, amazing moments and great art, look no further than ACE Academy.\nI'm looking forward to PixelFade's next work", "timestamp_created": 1479675176, "timestamp_updated": 1479675176, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500012", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26652888": {"recommendationid": "26652888", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108164954", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1461, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492380707}, "language": "english", "review": "I genuinely enjoyed this game. I played few Visual Novel games before, but this game shot up to one of my favorites. Normally, I go through VN games questions as I, probably, would do in real life and usually ignore the other paths/endings. However, in this case, I binged through the game and experienced all the endings. For the most part, I liked all the characters that were introduced to us. I orginally ended with Kaori's ending then continued to move through the rest of the characters. And one character's CG scenes (not going to say who) actually made me feel unsettled and made my heart skip a beat, which was intended. \n\nAs I played through the game, I was always saying how certain scenes were \"cute\" or \"that's adorable\". What can I say, I'm a sucker for things that are cute. \n\nOne of my favorite things about the game were the hilarious choices you could make and the many referances that the game makes like celebrities, TV shows, movies, devices, a semi-direct referance to a game their currently working on, and even throws a light punch at VN game cliches. The game is packed with many choices compared to othere VN games, which I always enjoy in any game. The game is fully voice-acted and is pretty well done in my opinion. And something that I haven't seen in a VN game that kind of thrown me off at first were the quick-time-choices. I didn't expect that some of my choices were going to be timed, but you quickly get use to it since the game gives you plenty of time to choose. \n\nThey're four romance options in the game with personalities that are, somewhat, cliched but still enjoyable as you progress through the story. Speaking of story, admittedly, I didn't quite enjoyed it as much as I would have thought I would have. But is it bad? No. I just simply enjoy games with a really deep story line. Without trying to explain to much of the story, I would say it's average. And as for the battle scenes, it was I would expect it to be; not great, but not horrible either.\n\nAnd as for what's bad with the game, I don't think there's a lot to talk about other than personal preferances or nit-picky things. On a rarity, lines from characters aren't voice and sometimes doesn't match with what the text box says. I feel like they could have done something a bit more to the battle scenes. I know it's only a VN game and is limited to do so much, and I understand that. Just could have wished for more intriguing battles that were more memoribly. But, my major complaint has to do with the ending. It left to many questions and so little answers, which was probably what they were going for. Still, I'm fine with open endings, but this one left kind of left a combination of a sweet and sour taste that makes me can't tell I liked it or didn't.\n\nOveral, the game is pretty good and would highly recommend it to other VN Gamers out there that would just like to relax with a game like this. Good and fun way to spend some time on it. \n\nA definite score of a 8.5/10. \n\nAnd, as far as I know, this was PixelFade's first game that was punblished and am excited to play their new games that they are currently working on. I'm definitely going to keep track of their new games to come. And I know it was a joke thing they did at the end of the game, but I really do hope they make a sequel to Ace Academy in the future.", "timestamp_created": 1479424479, "timestamp_updated": 1479512226, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507401", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26652056": {"recommendationid": "26652056", "author": {"steamid": "76561198281501017", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499356686}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is good.", "timestamp_created": 1479420568, "timestamp_updated": 1479420568, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497738", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26639171": {"recommendationid": "26639171", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027808265", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 893, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478639492}, "language": "english", "review": "Most people would call this a dating simulator, but I'll go a different route and call this an anime simulator; anyone familiar with modern anime will be able to spot influences and archetypes with ease.

I\u2019ll probably go back and do a few more routes after I play some other new releases.  \n***POSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD***\n\n\nPros:\nSurprisingly wonderful story. It\u2019s rare to find a Visual novel with a focus on story.\n\nTons of dialog choices.\n\nLikable characters, which is also rare.\nComedy that made me laugh.\n\nSimple and easy to understand UI.\n\nLots of bang for your buck. I did one route and it took me almost 10 hours! Now I did get this game on sale, but I feel like the normal price would also be worth it.\n\nThe game is pretty solid, you get know and learn about each person before you decide who you want to go for. Now I know that\u2019s not something special but the way its presented here really reflects each characters personality more so than if it were to just tell you. Its almost like their actions and personality affect you too.\n\nCons:\nSometimes I felt like my dialog choices didn\u2019t matter. I felt like the only ones that did matter where the story line ones. Which were easy to pick out from the others.\n\nI\u2019ll probably get flack for this but, a little smut is ok! If you came here looking for animeboobafestu you\u2019re going to be disappointed. At first I thought it was a good thing, but as seeing as there might be none at all, it kind of leaves something to be desired.\n\nAnd like almost everyone else, the ending wasn\u2019t amazing. Its pretty obviously setting up for a second game. But that\u2019s not a bad thing! I feel like it could use a second one. The story defiantly supports it.\n\nI feel like the cons are something that can be easily solved. Given that the devs have the right tools and support, I know steam isn\u2019t very friendly to the nudity tag but I feel like the devs should at least consider something like that.\n\n\nTLDR: Solid game.

(Theres no eroge so they are sort of missing out there but thats not a 100% requirement, it would be nice though.)\n\nPros:\n\nA slice of life story that isn't boring. (This is hard to do for the most part, especially without eroge.)\n\nRomance that develops overtime and doesn't seem to happen too fast or in a stupid way. (Which can happen, expecially when a developer is lazy.)\n\nSome really funny references to other media (mostly japanese or online stuff) that really shows the developers know there stuff.\n\nSome really great art for the most part. (some of the backgrounds and male characters look a bit off but nothing distracting.)\n\nReally solid from a technical standpoint, at least in my case. No bugs or CtD's or anything like that, which can happen, even with Visual Novels made specifically for PC. They really put in the effort here.\n\nA really good if not large soundtrack!\n\nCons:\n\nThey could have spent more time in QA. There are several voice lines that are spoken incorrectly or the voice actors let there accents slip near the end of sentences. This isn't an insult to the voice actors, from there work in game to what I have heard on there patreon they are some of the very few western voice actors that seem to have passion for there work. Also some of the lines in game have some errors but the amount is small. (Less than half a dozen.)\n\nNow this might put some people off but I really urge you to reconsider, this is a con but one that could and most likely will be rectified by the developers in future. The game ends but the story doesn't really. The game is actually 4 chapters of ACE Academy. They finished these 4 chapters and left them open to return to later while they develop another game.\n\n[Minor Spoiler] One thing I don't particularly like but doesn't come up very often is the fact that they are in Japan and the voice actors are speaking English. Yet as it turns out they are meant to be speaking Japanese basically the whole time. I would have thought they could just get Seiyuus for this instead of getting English voice actors (like another company has done before.) It is to me at least, cringe worthy. But like I said it doesn't come up very often and from what I know of the developers they didn't have any shady intentions behind doing so (like some marketing trash to \"reach out to a wider audience\". Yeah I'm talking about you Moe Novel you pieces of human filth :D)\n\nSo in closing, if you like romance stories, a good slice of life (good because its not boring :P) and some mecha thrown in, this is a great little VN for you!\n\nI would highly recommend you check out there patreon and there next game! You can support them and get the first chapter of that starting in Q1 2017.

(I just can't understand why some certain VNs written in English went for Japanese Voice Acting. I really don't. If I want to listen to Japanese, I can read any of the many Japanese VNs)\n\n-Music is very nice to listen to, though rarely I do feel that the music playing doesn't match what was happening on screen.\n-Art quality is usually very nice, though I feel there's some inconsistencies in some scenes\n\nCons\n-The Dialogue choices aren't always representative of the Protagonist's choice of words. Most of the time, it's just mildly different and the choices I see could be seen as shorter versions of what he would say but in some cases the results give completely different feel than what I thought I choose to convey.\n-The ending, or lack thereof.\n\n\nAs this is, in essence a 'Novel', the most importance factor in judging it should be the quality of the writing and the story.\nThe writing passes with a flying colour, and I can't really recall any VN I have more fun reading in recent memory.\nWhat we have of the story easily passes as well, though if this was a play, I would say that it lacks the entirety of its third act, and I was shoved off the theatre in confusion right after act 2 ended.

So, this one came in as a complete surprise. I didnt expect much when i bought it, but boy was I wrong.\n\nTL;DR:\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]  Intriguing Story\n[*]  Good, genuinly funny writing\n[*]  Tons of choices, that also have an impact\n[*]  Unique and likeable characters\n[*]  Fully voice-acted\n[*]  Decent length\n[*]  Nice Artstyle & Soundtrack\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]  Abrupt, unsatisfying ending\n[*]  Minor: Artwork occasionally gets re-used\n[/list]\n\n[h1]In Detail:[/h1]\nPixelfade. Never heard of that Developer before, nor about the game itself. So I expected a pretty run-of-the-mill Visual Novel...This was not what I got.\n\n[list]\n[*] [b]The Characters[/b]\nThe character cast in ACE Academy was great across the board for me. The romancable characters are unique and differ heavily from each other, but all of them are very likeable.\nOther characters such as your best friend, or your little sister etc. are just as loveable. \nThe Dynamic between them is great and the game manages to convey a real sense of belonging. You feel like a real part of the group.\n\n[*] [b]The Story[/b]\nThe Story is what I would probably classify as mildly interesting. That doesnt mean it's bad, far from it. For a VN it's actually rather intriguing and does the job well enough. \nIt's nothing revolutionary, but compared to a lot of other VN I would say it is above average.\n\n[*] [b]Romances[/b]\nNow as mentioned before there are 4 romancable characters.\nEach of them has unique traits but all of them have very rewarding and heartwarming moments in their respective routes.\nThrough the excellent writing the progression of these romantic relationships also feels pretty natural and not forced.\n\n[*] [b]Game Length & Choices [/b]\nAfter doing all the routes I capped at roughly 20 hours. Now, I will not lie, I didnt really check my playtime after I first reached the ending , but it should last you a good 10 hours.\nHowever that is only if you play through it once, there are a lot of reason to play through it several times.\nAt the start of the game you name your MC and select 1 out of 3 personality types. Depending on your type you will get unique dialogue choices as well as different outcomes in some events.\nIn additon to that you also have the above mentioned different romances that I encourage you to explore.\nLastly this game throws a ton of choices at you from the get go. \nSome may just slightly alter a dialogue, but there are also a lot that affect the story and that have actual impact.\nOne important thing that I'd like to mention here is, that you also have the choice to be a total douche. \nYou may end up alone doing so, but hey - you can!\n\n[*][b]The Ending [/b] (Spoilerfree)\nWithout revealing too much - The ending is very sudden. I expected at least 1 or 2 hours more before reaching it.\nAlas the story came to a \"close\" pretty quickly. Now I say \"close\" because it is somewhat of an open ending. \nThat's the only real gripe I have with it.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Overall:[/h1]\nIt's funny, has great characters and gives the player a lot of choice, but the ending is a bit of a letdown.\nI'd say if you have an interest in VN this game is worth full-price. On a sale I would lable it as a must-have without hesitation.\n\n[h1][u]Kaori is best girl![/u][/h1]\n\n\n\n[h1]About the Developer:[/h1]\nI do want to take a minute to write about the developer. As mentioned above, I didn't know about them before.\nBut because the game was so enjoyable I checked them out a bit (mostly to see if and when part 2 is coming out) and I was very pleasently surprised.\nOriginally only 2 romancable characters were planned. 1 more was added before the Kickstarter stretchgoal was reached and another one was changed to also be romancable due to popular demand.\nI also checked out a dev stream they hosted and they seemed genuinly passionate about what they were doing.\nI'm writing this for 2 reasons;\n[olist]\n[*] I like what I found out about them. Listening to customer feedback is really important in my opinion and that is what they are doing. I dig that, and I want them to be successfull.\n\n[*] The ACE universe is much bigger than what is in the first game. But currently there are no plans for a Sequel. \nThat's a nono! I want them to get more money and make the sequel happen!

It had all the tools to be great and it has used those properly. \n\nThis game is awesome. It even made me write my first review after being on steam for several years and playing tons of games. \n\nFor those, who don't get its superiority, I will list the best sided of it:\n- voice acting - none of the voices feels out of place, they suit characters really well and make it wonderful experience;\n- character - they are just amazing. You can find the cliches if you are hunting for them. But that just means you are being stupid. This game has the perfect development of the character which is all based on your choices... which are MANY!\n- choices are everywhere. You can be total jerk. You can be the nicest person on earth. You can be whoever you want and the world will React hillariously!\n- all those little things - where else will you find a VN that lets you customize the main character's personality. Where else would you find so many off-route dialogs, memes, real life references. \n- no hentai, no perverted stuff. It is a BIG plus. Most of the games, who fall for the 18+ stuff lose a lot in plot and the characters. There can be no romance and intrigue, if all you are waiting for at one point is moar boobs (and boops). I recall the humor and the plot from Rance e.g. But when you compare, it becomes way more funnier and pure when no perverted stuff is involved.\n- the story. It is not that big and complex. And it leaves an open ending. But it is real. You can imagine such things happenning in real life. And that's as awesome as it's rare for any VN.\n- Yuuno. I just love her.\n- developers. They are just awesome. They care.

I am all about choices and consequences, backstory and the like. This VN has a lot of humor in it. At first I didn't want to do an early access for a game because I wanted a product first. But I was hungry for a new and hopefully better VN then the ones that I have played. I loved how they put my favorite actor in the story and put his first ever award in there! Just awesome! Which now I do not regret...well maybe the ending...\n\nWhen got in for the Early Access for this game and there was a lot of clamour for having the Nikki as a romance option. I loved how the devs trolled on that and said it was strictly a big bro proctecting his little sister. Then they put a teaser of the main character with her in certain outfit in story and then proceeded to squash all the critics. But to me it just felt like they could have added more to it; just seemed like a very minor side-story.\n\nThis VN had very good humor in it. At times I felt sorry for Nikki and Kaori. But they are some issues that needs to be addressed. There were some unvoiced dialog or the dialog was read differently or backwards (The last two sentences were spoken then the first two senctences were spoken, which made it very confusing). Also for the choices on who to spend time with, there should be more instead of two or three everytime (should be all options).\n\nMinor characters were represented by silhouettes. Minor grammatical errors. When it states the chacater(s) are roaring with laughter I expect that sometimes the voice overs were melodramatic when it came to those lines. The Black Screens....really? Oh and using the same artwork for different locations such as the Cafe and Bookstore (how are they the same?).

The game is not perfect and could use more customization, but it is one the most fun VNs I have ever played. The description is pretty straight forward in the store page. Just a quick summary, it is boy moves to new country, he is the star Mech Pilot at the academy, he mets \"the girl\", he searches for answers about his past, and makes friends in the process.\n\nArt\nBeatiful and well developed. It was a little more westernized than the usual anime/manga style of VNs I am used to.\n\nSound\nThe soundtrack was appropriate for every scene and really enhanced the experience. I am a native English speaker and I appreciate the excellent voice acting. This game is in a small market for native English VNs. \n\nGameplay\nIt was originally point & click, reaction time, and ASWD pushing for battles, then they changed it to reaction time and choices. I found it different from the Alpha play-throughs, but it was transitioned gracefully. It also has the tradition choice screens to dictate the next scene or action.\n\nStory\nThe story doesn't break any grounds on originality. Although, the story flowed well. I just finished the final release a few days ago and I'm hungry for more content. It is a typical VN story, sprinkled with the typical tropes. I find that it was well put together and not boring. The story was simple and easy to follow. I have played the Sunrider series to put into contrast. That was a good game too, but it often felt a bit too grindy between choices. Just put the girl you want in your choice and whammy you get the girl. I had suggestions for trolling and picking the inappropriate lines. Maybe I will next play-through.\n\nIf you are on the fence about this game and you are looking for a quality VN, then this is your game. I am looking forward to their next project Crystalline to add to my collection. Happy Gaming and Cheers!\n\nSpoiler\n\n[spoiler]The end was abrupt and left me wanting more story.

entertainment/gladiatorial sector, instead the standard military path most stories take.\n\nACE Academy is fully english voice acted visual novel that manages to do something rare : Not to get me vomiting when I hear the voice acting ( exclude one person, that seems to have bit different recording method than others,hurting the quality,  you will notice it when you get there).\n\nOverally it's an on rails story with fake choises that add flavour to the game, you more or less meet most of the non specific events on all routes and only major choise you have to do is to pick who you favour the most, setting your specific relationship routes to stone.\n\nBiggest downside to this game is that while most of the charecters are adequetly different overally it has no difference in the story, ending is essentially same on every path you take no matter what you do, also all choises you think will matter do not overally do anything.\n\nNever the less, this game is an ok single or double read story, if some of the charecters spark your interest to merit further reading, also messing with \"little sister\" is always fun.\n\nIt's one of the games I'd like to lean on the \" midway\" vote area if possible, but I'd say the good english voice acting tips it to positive.\n\nPick it up if you are interested in non japanese visual novel that has that Japanese vibe, you won't miss \"original\" voice acting as this game was made in Canada ( I belive in Toronto).\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1474044628, "timestamp_updated": 1474044628, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0,

The characters are very well voiced, and their stories and personalities are interesting and quite funny at times.  I was suprised at first to hear english voice acting and it did take a few minutes to get used to it at first, but I really enjoyed listening to everyone talk. Never did I feel like I wanted to rush through certain dialogue or skip through anyone's lines. \n\nSome of the jokes in this game had me almost rolling on the floor laughing (Ceonardo DiLaprio scene). The memes and references included in some of the dialogue choices were HILLARIOUS (at one point there is an option to say something like \"much fall, very dissapoint.\") of course there are much more serious choices too.\n\nOn that note I think the game does a relatively good job at transitioning from comedic scenes to neutral to serious scenes. There are a few points where you go to bed on a serious note and wake up kinda ignoring last nights mood, (possibly where an episode ended? I bought the game after it had been fully released so I'm not sure) however this is nothing to be bothered with really, it might not even be noticeable to some people.\n\nThis game really got me invested in the story and the characters (most RPG's do, such as mass effect) where I really felt my choices mattered (unlike mass effect grrrrr LOL) and I absolutely love the main characters relationship with his little sister (kawaii~desu!!) and their uncle. The scenes with her in them kinda made me wish I had a little sis too! (N-no I'm not a sis-con!! Baka!!)\n\n\nTL:DR\n\nGreat game!! 11/10 bought it while it was on sale (had it in my wishlist for a while) for $19 I would easily pay the full price for this game. Honestly gave me more enjoyment then many full priced retail games did!  Kudos to the devs, voice actors, and everyone else involved for an awesome game!!

Please disregard the time played, I've gone through multiple runs and gotten 90% of the content, but for some reason my timer is stuck on 44 mins.\n\nThe big draw for me is that you get to make lots of choices throughout the game; a lot of them are minor dialogue changes only, but there are enough more substantial ones mixed in to keep it engaging. You keep making choices until the very end, unlike a lot of VNs where you pick your route in the the first quarter of the game and then spend the rest of it reading without any further input. Being able to choose your characters reaction to events, even innocuous ones, also helps from the common pitfall of a main character thats thoughts don't reflect your own like the common dense and or self absorbed VN protagonist.\n\nThe game isn't perfect; I feel like the robot battles were a bit underutilised, and the without going into spoilers the pacing felt a little off at times, especially when something fairly significant happens in your first big match and then you kind of just go on with day to day life and aren't given the option to investigate further until the rest of the plot catches up. These are minor points, but if there is a sequel or even a seperate VN by the same group, it'd be good to see these worked on. The ending also fell a bit flat for me, it really felt like the game had just hit its halfway point.\n\nOtherwise there is a lot to like here. The characters are all walking archetypes, but thats not such a bad thing in a product like this. They're all likable and engaging and none of the routes (such as they are, though its more a case of getting extra and more involved events with the girl of your choice while the main story continues than actual routes) felt like they were unnatural. \n\nI also really liked the fact that depending on your interaction or lack thereof with some characters they would grow and have relationships of their own, which you could also encourage or not. This was a really nice touch; doesn't it always seem weird in these games that your character is the only one looking for love and everyone else is in stasis until you set your eyes on them? ACE Academy neatly avoided that pitfall.\n\nThe artstyle is functional. I don't mean that dismissively, it does the job but it isn't as high quality as some other VN's. It's never bad though, and theres a reasonable quality bump in the more important scenes. The voice work is surprisingly solid, with a few very good performances in Nikki and Valerie, but no one really stands out as bad. Lots of little references and nods towards other media entities (Japanese and otherwise) as well for those of you who like spotting things like that.\n\nAll in all I liked this a lot and was sad when it ended. I'll definitely keep an eye out for further releases from this company and recommend it to anyone who's in the mood for a VN with some dating, some light robots and a lot more input than your standard VN.\n\nAlso Yuuna best girl but only because dating your sister would be weird.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1472786169, "timestamp_updated": 1472786169, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500167", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25296258": {"recommendationid": "25296258", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042093302", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1374, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "last_played": 1514753538}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

Its characters are generally funny, and their struggles and emotions feel genuine and sympathetic. The CG artwork generally looks great, especially the mecha scenes, and the music services the experience well. It's got some decent length to it, and the characters are all charming enough to make the routes worth playing, so there's good replay value here. Even the stock tsundere archetype character feels charming when you get to know her, though she only really opens up on her own route.  \n\nOne particularly good thing about this game is how it's fully voice acted (there's a few lines by minor characters that aren't voiced, all the main characters are fully voiced, and most of the minor characters are too). As in, it's all in English. Now the voice acting isn't perfect, but it's not bad either and it lends a tremendous amount of flavor to these characters and makes them come alive in a way that a lot of other visual novels don't. After seeing how well it worked here, I definitely hope more western VN devs spend money doing this, because it adds tremendously to the game experience.\n\nI didn't experience any technical glitches or issues during my playthrough, so that's always a plus, and it's a pure VN running the renpy engine with no oddball code tricks so it should run nicely even on low end systems. \n\nI also particularly like how certain choices, especially during fights, are time limited. (You generally have ~4 seconds to make your choice in these situations.) It really keeps you on your toes and sells the notion that this is a tense situation that needs quick thinking. \n\nThere's no stat management or other gameplay mechanics here; it's a pure visual novel, executed nicely.\n\nThe devs also seem pretty responsive to the community, and they do stuff like give you the OST for free instead of making you pay extra for it like most devs do. I get the feeling that they care a lot about the story they're telling and care about the craft, rather than nakedly grasping at profit. \n\nThat's the good, but no review is complete without talking about the bad. \n\nSo, the plot itself is not hugely meaningful or nuanced in its own respect. It's a guy's life as he tries to become a mecha pilot. It's mostly slice of life (very enjoyable slice of life, mind you), with a serious plotline in the background that starts strong but doesn't go the distance. If you like slice of life with enjoyable and charming characters, you'll love this game, but if you're looking for a serious business story, you might not enjoy it so much since there's not much seriousness and what serious plot there is fizzles out in a fairly unsatisfying manner.\n\nNowhere is this more apparent than the ending. It has a serious emotionally high stakes premise that builds up in the background for a fair part of the game, but ultimately when it comes to a head, it feels unsatisfying and doesn't have much emotional payoff. Worse, you get invested in all these characters and hope to see what happens with their lives and relationships... But the game just ends and leaves you hanging.  \n\nDon't get the wrong idea. We're not talking about a [i]terrible[/i] ending like Mass Effect 3, Fallout 3, or Sunrider Liberation Day's pre-DLC ending. It's just a disappointing ending because the conflict \"resolves\" itself too quickly (but doesn't really resolve itself), leaving everything open ended and hanging. Some people might enjoy an open end that they can fill in with their own imagination, but I prefer a little more structure and would have really liked an epilogue to see what happened to all these characters I grew to care for. It's like... \n\nImagine a burger that's delicious up until the very last bite. Then that last bite is bland and unseasoned. Not bad, just... Meh, especially in context of a burger that was until then juicy and delicious. That's this game's ending. \n\nThere is also a slight problem - more an annoyance really - where if you choose to spend time with a character you haven't spent much time with up until that point, the game will give you a tell rather than show summary of what you would've done together if you had spent more time with them, and then lead in to the event you would've seen at that point if you'd been spending time with them all along. (Example: Mayu likes music, but I'd been focusing on Yuuna so I didn't know this. When I chose to spend some time with Mayu late in the game because everyone else was busy, the game told me I'd been spending time with her in the music room helping her set up a band, then had me helping her with the audition for her band's vocalist even though I knew nothing about this beforehand.) This is better than just assuming stuff's happening without telling the player anything, but it still tickles the back of my mind.  \n\nBut beyond that, there's not many other flaws. I mean, I could always ask for more CGs, more content, but it's not like there's not a decent amount of content here already. I could ask for AAA quality voice acting, but that's unreasonable given the game's budget and the voice acting we have is charming, flavorful and nice in its own respect.  \n\nAlso, I should give my above criticism a caveat. While the serious plotlines generally don't go anywhere, some of the individual emotional scenes are very touching - the scene with your little sister in the park late at night comes to mind immediately, and generally all the scenes where the girls talk about their innermost feelings are good too. This is a game that is driven by its characters, and it's at its best when showing these characters. It's not a plot driven game.\n\nTLDR: Great slice of life visual novel with appealing, vibrant, and fun characters and a great deal of humor, let down only by meh ending and its main serious subplot fizzling out in said ending. Definitely worth the money they're asking for. 9/10 would buy again, likely to buy these devs' next game if it's as good as this one.", "timestamp_created": 1472672546, "timestamp_updated": 1472672546, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528026", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25254784": {"recommendationid": "25254784", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061234075", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485468148}, "language": "english", "review": "Love this VN.

The novel is quite a bit shorter then most of the novels I've read however, I never really felt there were any points that dragged and it kept me engaged throughout. \n\nLike the three novels I listed at the top it has branching paths. Ace Academy does a good job of making the choices feel rewarding and interesting. The visuals are well done, the music is fitting, and the humor is excellent and the game is very self aware of what it is. The female leads are well developed, although they do all fall under the typical tropes you'd expect from this type of game. I didn't feel any were weaker then the others, there's also a decent amount of fanservice for each of them if you're into that sort of thing. The game also does a good job with the protagonist and family, they felt realistic and easy to project onto while still feeling like an actual character.

The cast is voiced impressively in English and the art of the game was stylish to me. The choices in your decision making are diverse and will affect whatever route you plan on playing through. This game was originally an episodic visual novel, however I picked it up when all 4 episodes were released so I didn't have to wait to keep playing it. This game will surely entertain you, it contains romance, drama, comedy, and some sci-fi action to go along with it. I've already played through all the routes so right now I'm just waiting for a sequel (if there's gonna be one). PixelFade Studio did an amazing job with this game, there are a few flaws like re-using backgrounds and having a slight linear path for each route, but the game is still entertaining. The game is entirely in English but it is set in Japan, so it does kind of give you an animeish setting/aura. I HIGHLY recommend this game if you want an entertaining visual novel to play.

The VN pokes fun at tropes even while following them, which works out surprisingly well.  It is absolutely worth the asking price.

Everyone is physically, mentally, and emotionally fit.  Name any hobby or activity, you and all of your friends are good at it.  You might wonder how well this dynamic works when the plot ostensibly revolves around a fighting competition.  Well I'll tell you.  It works by keeping the stakes low and having the characters overcome any minor obstacle that appears in their way within five minutes of its introduction to the plot.\n\n\"But you can't have EVERYONE be exceptional,\" you may say.  \"Story quality aside, having everyone be 'exceptional' literally defeats the meaning of the word itself.\"  Well you see, ACE Academy is the perfect demonstration of why you are wrong.  Even though all the people in this story, including your rivals, are talented and super-cool nice people, you are still the BEST at being talented and super-nice.  But that's the thing.  The winner is YOU.  You are ALWAYS the winner, \"you\" meaning \"every single person who plays this game\".  You are all white guys, and you are all winners.  It works.  The system works.\n\nBy the way.  I've heard it said that there is a basic premise behind every harem anime, and that is that the harem is always focused on a particular fetish, and all the girls within the harem are just variations of that fetish.  I believe that is at least true for this game, and in this case the central fetish is \"being normal\".  Of course, all the girls are exceptional at everything, but that IS normal in this universe as I already stated.  Their personalities are otherwise consistently plain and reasonable.  And within that central fetish of exceptional normalcy, you have your standard variations:\n\n- Shy normal\n- Loud normal\n- Sexy normal\n- Normal normal\n- Siscon lolicon\n\nAnyway, I hope this review has helped you determine whether you are a member of the intended demographic for this game.

I really like this game.\n\nThere's a few misspelling in the game. Being french canadian I normaly don't see that kind of thing, But i was able to notice 2 of those, so far. It's no big deal tough...

I think its strongest point is its humour, the characters are quite funny.  The story is also interesting, I'm looking forward to what's going to happen in further episodes.  Having to respond in seconds brought in some excitement, although I was hoping for just a little more interaction in the mecha fights, maybe more strategic choices, not just finding the right button.\n\nThe game's only big fault is that it feels slightly unfinished.  I think showing silhouettes is even worse than not showing the minor side characters at all.  (Not to mention one thing I've never understood in VN's: in public places, why are there no people in the background?)  And it's an even bigger problem that there were small errors in the consequences in my choices, for example with the girls I dated the least it would immediately jump to the second or third one, and I had to figure out some information out of the context.  I also had information repeated, or some information I've received would not change the behaviour of the MC.  And there were a few typos.  I want to be clear about that the plot flows well most of the time, but there are occasional glitches.\n\nIf the minor side characters get drawn, and the plot glitches get fixed, then I'll be very

Ils vont maintenant vivre chez leur oncle et tenter de repartir en avant. Nous, on est un pilote de GEAR, de grands robots initialement destin\u00e9s au domaine militaire mais qui font \u00e9galement l'objet d'un sport. On rejoint ainsi la ACE Academy, grande \u00e9cole japonaise sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e dans tout ce qui concerne les GEARs, et int\u00e8gre une \u00e9quipe dont les membres vont progressivement devenir nos amis et plus si affinit\u00e9s en fonction de nos choix.\nOn retrouve dans ce jeu tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments d'un bon VN, c'est-\u00e0-dire une histoire tr\u00e8s riche, plusieurs romances possibles, une superbe palette artistique avec notament de superbes d\u00e9cors, des musiques magnifiques, un doublage de qualit\u00e9 pour tous les personnages hormis le h\u00e9ros, et des choix \u00e0 faire en pagaille. Mais vraiment beaucoup de choix, de quoi nous donner une grande vari\u00e9t\u00e9 de dialogues diff\u00e9rents. Les int\u00e9ractions entre les personnages, avec notre personnage notamment, sont \u00e9galement excellentes, tr\u00e8s adapt\u00e9es au moment. Concernant le temps de jeu, en lisant tranquillement, comptez pas loin de 10 heures pour le premier playthrough, ce qui est plus qu'honorable. Et l'un des points o\u00f9 ACE Academy se d\u00e9marque le plus pour moi : il y a beaucoup, beaucoup...beaucoup...d'humour dans ce jeu, c'est tout simplement g\u00e9nial.\nL'autre point qui fait briller AA (je ne sais pas pour les autres VN, mais je le sais pour celui-l\u00e0 \u00e9tant moi-m\u00eame \"backer\" du jeu via Kickstarter) est que les d\u00e9veloppeurs et leurs collaborateurs se sont vraiment appliqu\u00e9s et impliqu\u00e9s pour am\u00e9liorer leur jeu au possible. On sent bien qu'ils aiment ce qu'ils font et qu'ils veulent r\u00e9pondre au mieux aux attentes des joueurs et de leur communaut\u00e9. Ainsi, le personnage de Val\u00e9rie (personnage suppl\u00e9mentaire obtenu via Kickstarter) a r\u00e9ellement \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9 avec les backers. Et le plus important pour moi : Mayu, dont la route ne devait pas exister au d\u00e9part, peut finalement \u00eatre s\u00e9duite ! Cela gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9 (je pense particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 l'Empereur Astrea qui s'est d\u00e9men\u00e9 dans ce but, et que je salue et remercie chaleureusement) qui s'est faite entendre, et pour qui les d\u00e9veloppeurs n'ont pas h\u00e9sit\u00e9 \u00e0 rajouter du contenu non pr\u00e9vu pour rendre cette route possible !\nBien s\u00fbr le jeu n'est pas parfait, il y a certaines choses qui auraient pu \u00eatre mieux. Un exemple : on est avec une fille, on doit se retrouver dans genre 3 heures pour un rendez-vous concernant l'histoire et elle dit qu'elle doit aller voir quelqu'un. Elle s'en va et on a donc du temps libre, on va choisir avec qui le passer. Et l\u00e0...on peut (voire \"doit\", car il se peut qu'elle soit le seul choix disponible) choisir d'appeler cette fille qui vient de partir...nous disant que justement elle voulait nous appeler puisqu'elle \u00e9tait libre... Voil\u00e0, des fois il y a des mauvais raccords. On peut aussi regretter le manque de d\u00e9nouement dans les histoires personnelles des personnages secondaires. Il reste malheureusement plusieurs \"questions\" sans r\u00e9ponses \u00e0 la fin de l'aventure.\nToutefois, pour conclure, ce premier Visual Novel de PixelFade Studio est une vraie r\u00e9ussite. Malgr\u00e9 quelques imperfections, le rendu est excellent, parcourir le jeu est vraiment un plaisir. C'est le travail d'une \u00e9quipe qui aime ce qu'elle fait, qui se donne \u00e0 fond pour sortir le meilleur jeu qu'elle peut faire, et qui prend en compte les attentes des joueurs pour y arriver.

The plot was good, characters were good, art design was good, and everything was good! And in some cases, even great! But I personally believe that there could've been a little more in the story than what it actually gave us. Now, I may be wrong and it may have been the perfect amount for everyone else, but I personally believe that it had more to it, but they just let it slide. I know I have over 20 hours on record, but most of that was me skipping in order to play different routes that the game had to offer.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I really liked this game and found it very good! But there were some parts that I found unfinished and a little rushed. If those factors weren't in play here, I would say this game smacked it out of the park. But buy it and experience it yourself to see.\n\nBut overall, for a price of $25, I would say wait until it's on sale. I'm not saying it\u2019s bad in anyway; I'm just saying that you could spend that $25 on a different game than this. When it's on sale, however, I would recommend getting it!

But what started as an impulse buy to pass the time quickly became a solid favourite of my steam library the more hours I sunk into it.\nFor starters, the game has a solid story to it. In a Gundam Build Fighters-esque setting where the world has become obsessed with giant robots called GEARs, you are a nameless protagonist (named by you) recently transferred from America to Japan to the pilot program of titular ACE Academy following the death of your parents.  It hit the right points throughout and kept me engaged through multiple playthroughs . And while it does flit more with the tropes of the high school romance side than the mecha side (Beach episode, hot springs episode, etc), there was enough science fiction here to keep it fresh. There are moments when it gets a too meta though (Less leaning on the fourth wall, more smashing it and then crushing the pieces into a fine dust), which while they made me laugh, also pulled me out of the story a bit.\nThe characters are also a decent bunch, filling the usual tropes sure (Mayu is shy, Yuuna is kind, Kaori is Tsundere, etc), but giving each character their own strengths and flaws. I was also surprised to find the characters were all fully voiced too, and while some of the lines were strangely silent (It was still in Early Access as of writing), the cast is diverse enough that each and every character had their own unique voice, including the one-shot background ones.  It was all well recorded and well-acted too, which is always a bonus. The protagonist too is just enough of a blank slate to be relatable, but still has enough of a personality (some of which is dictated by you) to make it easy to relate to.\nThe event CGs and music are also well done, with a good variety of pieces that for the most part fit in well with their respective events.\nThere are some problems however. While the game is still in Early Access as of writing, I\u2019m not sure how many have been, could be, will be or can be addressed, but I would at least mention them to give my honest opinion.\nThe biggest flaw is the mecha combat. While I wasn\u2019t expecting Titanfall for a VN, I was sort of expecting some kind of turn based system based on the screenshots, as opposed to the quick time sequence in the build I played. While this isn\u2019t a game breaker for me, I can\u2019t shake the feeling that mecha combat had a larger role to play in earlier ideas. There is, for example, a loadout screen filled with empty squares that is seen exactly once, and you go through several lessons that feel important to the mecha piloting process, but ultimately just serve as world building information. While the mecha aspect is a focus of the storyline, it feels a little under loved by the end of it as a result.\nThere are also a few odd choices for who of the secondary cast gets to be shown, and who doesn\u2019t. The VN goes the RWBY Volume One route of having most of them silhouetted, and while that makes sense for one scene unnamed characters, there are a few, such as the professors and your sister\u2019s friends, who appear multiple times and whose appearances aren\u2019t revealed.   On the flip side, there are characters that appear exactly once that are fully revealed, only to be never seen or heard from again. There was one character that was even shown using CG pieces instead, when having a silhouette with Yuuna giving facial reactions instead would have looked just as good, perhaps better.\nSpeaking of CGs, while as I said before they are well done, there doesn\u2019t feel like there\u2019s enough of them. This might just be a personal issue of mine really, but I felt several times certain scenes needed more than just the text. This partly manifested as black screens with text describing interesting goings on, but also scenes that I\u2019ve seen to be important in other non-eroge romance VNs (e.g. kissing) that are just described here. And while they're described well, it falls slightly flat when all you\u2019re seeing is your girl smiling at you. A few more backgrounds might not go amiss either (An alternate library/study background, especially in Kaori\u2019s route, was the most glaring one.)\nIn the end though, these issues don\u2019t really take away from the game as a whole.  These are just things that I think would make a great game greater. ACE Academy is still worth the asking price. If you\u2019re looking for a good story and strong characters to while away some hours with, this game will definitely be worth your time.", "timestamp_created": 1471435439, "timestamp_updated": 1471986827, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.633990", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24941135": {"recommendationid": "24941135", "author": {"steamid": "76561198178892237", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 763, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499245235}, "language": "english", "review": "Arguably one of my favorite VNs available right now and I haven't finished it yet! The voice acting is superb and fits each character and their archetype nicely. Usually visual novels have that Japanese humor that you'd only find funny if you were, well, Japanese. I was surprised to go through this and find genuinely funny moments that made me laugh. For example, if you choose to hang out with one girl at a certain point, you and her hold tryouts for a singer in a band. A British student with a name obviously a play on Simon Cowell enters the room and harshly critiques everyone. Plenty of cool choices too, though not all of them make a difference (understandably). Anyway, yes you should buy this game. \n\nEDIT: After finishing it today, I want to thank the creators of this game personally. While I won't go into spoiler territory, there's a scene near the end of Episode 4 involving the hero's father. My own father passed away a few months ago and I felt I could really relate to my character and his feelings. The part that really got to me though was finding out that your father's name is James. James was my own father's name, and this really struck a cord with me. While I know that this is pure coincidence, I thank the creators immensly for this game.

First off Id like to say that I have read plenty of VN's both from steam and off the platform. I have seen the good, the bad, and the excuse to make a porno versions of VN's. That being said, through all of the stories ive read through, writing that I have critisized and had to re-read , and Listening to my fair share of \"interesting\" voice acting I have come to one conclusion. This VN is HANDS DOWN the BEST Visual novel I have EVER read/played. The Story itself gripped the MC with intelligent writing, great pop culture refrences (hello ceonardo dilaprio), plenty of moments of teenage hilarity that caught me with my pants down and gave me a good laugh, and in tandem with brillant voice acting it pulled at my heartstrings in both the sad and the warm fuzzy moments. you would look at this game showcasing different girls routes like its a dating sim and it kinda is, however it revolves around the main characters story and the relationships that the player can CHOOSE to develop or not makes it SOOO much better. Now that ive ranted I want to break down what makes this game so good.\n\n\nFirst: writing and plotline \nIm very impressed with the quality of storytelling in ACE and through my reads the writing was always clear and there were no mispellings or incorrect uses of the english language during any of the parts 1-4. The story made me laugh, feel like a badass during the mech fights, feel warm and fuzzy during the moments you spend with the S.O you have chosen and with the family members that surround the MC throughout the game.\n\n writing gets a 10/10 for adding the choice \"swiggity swoogity, im comin for that booty\" <-- seems perverted? nope, it makes you laugh and allows the MC to display a more animated personality than whats usually thrown at you.\n\n2nd Visuals and music:\nfirst off the character sprites are all well detailed and each with their own clear persona defined in how they look and act. I found each supporting character to be in sync with how the devs made them look and even when that transferred to how each characters gear was visually designed made it that much more in sync. The music was a nice add on to the game that never got in the way of the gameplay or voice acting. It pumped you up during action scenes, made emotions come out more in both sad and happy moments and overall was just great to listen too. \n\nvisuals and music, 10/10\n\n3rd isnt something thats directly part of the game but rather focuses on the people behind it. While this game was in early access the devs of this game set out to put it together in parts of 1-4. I joined in the game when they had just added part 3 a day after I had bought it. going through the news and seeing the release of part 4 I was very happy that these devs were constantly communicating with players through feedback and were very timely with content releases. Oh and another thing about each release, these guys didnt charge any more  money for each new release of content! you buy it at the beginning for the reduced price and you get the full package the second it comes out. This kind of loyalty reward is something that most devs overlook or try to exploit in players who want their games so Im just giving a shoutout to the guys at pixelfade for doing it right!\n\nIf you have doubts about this game or wether or not Its truely worth your money Im here to say that you need to stop doubting and just jump in already, your going to love the ride!", "timestamp_created": 1470549779, "timestamp_updated": 1470549861, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.999905", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24753710": {"recommendationid": "24753710", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055985807", "num_games_owned": 619, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1037, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471160154}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like dating sims and like to make constant choices of what to say and how you say it then this is the game for you.

I'm always overwhelmingly relieved to see (hear?) voice actors from the West (Canada in this case) doing their jobs well. It's not as glamorous as hollywood, but it's still an acting job!\n\nThe combat you get involved in during the game doesn't have wiz-bang animation, but you have to button mash or lose so you don't really notice that anyway. The characters are drawn very well, the scenery is futuristic and artistic on its own, so its easy to get into the world they want you to see.\n\nAlso tons of choices, some are timed forcing you to make a decision quickly...

Now this is my first time actually engaed in a visual novel, most of my gaming came from playing First.Person.Shooter as a kid, like Halo, or Medal of Honor. The game, story wise is incredable, with its cast of lovable charcters that grow onto you as you progress as a male transfer student to the ACE Academy in Japan. \n\nThere is combat during the mech matches (ie. you fight in giant robots \"plot of the game\"), but in reality its mostly quick time events, and choices that requires you to press an option in about 3 seconds or else it will pick randomly or fail you on it.\n\nRomance is prevelent as theres a total of 4 girls to choose, each with unique personalites and the small decesions you make with them if you want to be friends or more.\n\nVoice acting is great although you may here when the voice acter speaks a little too far or close to the mic giving them an echo effect sometimes, but really its nothing that ruins the game. As for the art its very sleek and clean and has lots of details in it. Although background charcters like workers, gaurds, generic college students and professers are just black cut outs, yet they have voice acters, so they're not just black silhouettes  with nothing to say but text.\n\nAs for the story its really engaining with the occasional pop culture refrences to anime tropes, popular animes, memes and movies like the God Father hidden in the dialouge. Each charcter has a hidden past you must pry into as everyone even your self is getting to know each other and part of the game is to interact with everyone but becarful of what you say and risk hurting relationships with others.\n\nPrice value is a bit high for a game I just played for 5 hour (till Ep. 3, game is still incompelet at the time of writing this), but its worth it as theres animations, insted of still art charcters, some 3d modeling, and great moments that will make you just laugh.", "timestamp_created": 1467696157, "timestamp_updated": 1467696157, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502724", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24054654": {"recommendationid": "24054654", "author": {"steamid": "76561198201655361", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 418, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467565585}, "language": "swedish", "review": "fun^^", "timestamp_created": 1467565631, "timestamp_updated": 1467565631, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500225", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23936201": {"recommendationid": "23936201", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063310201", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 875, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471928375}, "language": "english", "review": "Okay, what can I say that I like about this game\n\nPros: The soundtrack isn't half bad, it is not the best but it is really nice and upbeat like the story. Fact that your character can either be, sport, nerdy or good with people (Not the words used) and that can effect a  few of choices in the game. The voice acting is well done for most characters it is also in english and that is nice, some I was not too sure of but most are nice. You are the name character, you can name them and everything. Fun minigames in the story. It is not actually short at all. The characters are more than just a basic trope and seem to all be more than what they are at first. The art is really nice and those who made this game did put in alot of effort to it. Now I have 4 hours clocked and I haven't yet finished the game, but I am sure that one can if they speed read and type and what not. But for me I like to take it slow. Also it is one of the VNs that I will actually consider starting right from the start again, even though it is not mandatory for you to do so to get another route.\n\nCons: Some lines skip ahead, such as narration. Side characters are just shades of a character outline. Combat can be a bit dull. At some choices you have a timer that some times you can't even see at first or react to in time or read all the choices. Also it is still in early access so that is a big down side that it is not the complete game. There are a few other things but that is just nit picking.\n\nMy verdict on this game is to buy it, but if you can you should buy while their is a sale on for it, or when it is just discounted. Not saying that is not worth the full price, just while I do recommend this game, I can't tell you to go buy it for its full price.\n\nThat is all for me see ya later.\n\nUPDATED\n\nNow that I have played through the game I still stand by what I said before, it is still in early access so there are a few things that are not yet complete (very minor lines) but like nothing else.\n\nIf you ever wanted to go to a Gundam Pilot School minus the actual war, then this is the VN for you.", "timestamp_created": 1467233615, "timestamp_updated": 1470646908, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.555707", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23883121": {"recommendationid": "23883121", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107622813", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 404, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466950785}, "language": "english", "review": "A really interesting story highly reccomended, waiting for the episode to be released T.T", "timestamp_created": 1467089694, "timestamp_updated": 1467089694, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476614", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23866709": {"recommendationid": "23866709", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033250948", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3047, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500996097}, "language": "english", "review": "Before this game, I tended to avoid early access games. However, the premise and visuals swayed my decision and I gave it a shot.\n\nWhat followed was the most entertaining visual novel I've played.\n\nThe story is very sound, with a appealing theme (you attend a school that lets you pilot giant robots. What's not to like?) and plenty of interesting characters to interact with. On those characters; they're very fleshed out and each have their own funny quirks, even if they do tend to follow certain stereotypes (tsundere, shy rich girl, mary sue girl, seductive girl and goofball best friend). But rather than drag the experience down, these characters help make it that much more entertaining. Shou is by a big margin one of the funniest characters I've seen in a VN, and yet despite that even he has a level of depth that helps you fall for these characters. \n\nAs far as voice acting is concerned, there were only one or two that could potentially be annoying, yet I found these negligible. Also noticed however that some of the silhouetted characters shared voice actors. I can understand why but it was noticable. The music was good too, and fit the scene, though could get repeditive at times. The art design was pretty cool and, for the mechs at least, improved greatly after episode three. As far as mech battles are concerned, they were nothing more than quicktime WASD segments before becoming timed choice options. While a part of me wishes the battle system could be a little bit more advanced than mere quicktime events (maybe something like from the Sunrider series), it's only a minor complaint, given the mecha combat isn't the main focus of the story.\n\nAnd as for the story, while it does have choices, the game will eventually steer you back onto the main story path. That said, the options you're given are interesting to discover, leading to a greater replayability than most other VNs I've played. Plus, with four possible love interests (the fourth added after community pleading), it opens story options up even further. While the story did end with much less oomph than what I was expecting, it was still a satisfying ending well worth the wait.\n\nTL;DR\nThis is a great VN, very entertaining and you'll be replaying it again and again to experience all it has to offer. A few nitpicks here and there, but overall one I'd highly recommend.\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1467046185, "timestamp_updated": 1501057343, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523386", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23772474": {"recommendationid": "23772474", "author": {"steamid": "76561198199079706", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 964, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508043060}, "language": "english", "review": "I have to say this is a really cool story.

I like to say it was a good investment for Ace Academy held my attention by the end of the demo.\n\nRarely do you get a fully english Visual Novel, and it feels a bit more interesting to me than a regular japanese subbed one. It probably helps that all the characters are well voiced and that you can hear how well they suit their characters. Like Shou Shinjirou, the male best friend. If I didn't know better, I'd say he sounded like Yuri Lowenthall (particularly Yosuke from Persona 4). And it feels fun to hang out with him despite the obvious dating sim with other girls, if only because he seems to have his own romance subplot that you can either help out in or watch from the distance as he remains oblivious.\n\nIn fact, the whole slice-of-life story is quite enjoyable with all the characters. You have the cute but at times annoying younger sister, the laid back uncle, and the kind and popular ace Ace pilot. And then you have a bunch of girls that you can date; there's the mean captain with a soft side, a smart and shy support with an obvious crush on Shou, the shameless flirt of an engineer, a kind stickler to the rules manager, and possibly a friendly rival to the captain but with bad history. As vague as those descriptions are, that's the gist of the cast.\n\nIt's actually hard for me to pick which one girl to follow at first, because they're all likeable in their own way. They have layers to them that only through extended hang-out sessions can you see and also realize in how to nurture your friendship with them. Of course, I might have cheated because there's a \"rollback\" system, or at least being able to load to an earlier save or autosave file before picking a different option. \n\nAnd the music is top notch. The instrumental version of the trailer song as you load it up is very catchy and seems to capture the general feel of the game. Upbeat and awesome.\n\nOf course, I wish the game would make some changes for the full release. While the slice-of-life aspects are fun, I have little to no understanding of the world lore, despite the little sprinkled in class scenes talking about Gears. Gears are a big deal in the world; there are even movies and TV shows that are like ours but have the world Gear in them; That 70's Gear, The Gear of Thrones, The Lord of the Gears...\n\nWe hear so much about Gears on a technical scale from their tools to their weapons, including the safe \"recreational\" ones. And yet at the same time don't know a thing. They're a common thing in this world, have their own toy line, and yet there doesn't seem to be any sort of big scale robot war with them. Why do college students have to fight each other? Why are there sponsors for so many pilot teams? What's the benefit of being a Gear Pilot? What do Gear Pilots do when they graduate? It's not like we have Gears of our own in our world so it would help to get some context. It can't be exactly as the same as running tanks or planes because we don't use those to beat the snot out of each other.\n\nAnd what's more, I like to agree with the general consensus that the fast reaction time keys of WASD is kind of bland for what I'd expect in a visual novel with actual gameplay. For the first few matches I wasn't even sure if I was doing something right because there were two points where the gameplay elements screwed with you; first was when you had no weapons and could only dodge and block as your HP dwindled down and your enemy was completely fine (not to mention you couldn't even choose the action; it was automatic after pressing the button indicated). Then there was a match where you DID have weapons, but you got your scrap ass kicked anyway because the weapons weren't calibrated. I thought it was another mistake based on the weapons I could choose (and you only get to choose once in this Early Access, between three sets of guns and three sets of swords).\n\nThey were all story-based defeats that meant to drive the plot a bit more, but I thought I was actually doing something wrong. There was little to no explanation in how to fight other that \"use the weapons at the right time\". But you don't get to chose to go all sword akimbo because the 4 button commands change it every time. You have no control of your protagonist's Gear so it feels less like a cool robot fight and more like a game of slap the coin before your opponent does.\n\nMy suggestion is that if there is going to be fighting that incorporates the swords, guns, thrusters and shields, let the player make their own choices. Make into rock-paper-scissors, kind of like Fate/EXTRA. There are four buttons, so each one can make a command. Gun beats Sword, Sword beats Thrusters, and Thrusters beats Gun, with the Shield command as an all purpose guard. You still take damage, but not as much as if you got hit with the wrong counter. \n\nStill, I was hooked until the end of the 3rd Episode; where it literally ended on a rather tense cliffhanger. Up until then, there wasn't any sense of drama or tension aside from school related problems, and most of those were easily resolved in time. But I think after all the build-up and introduction that there might be a change in the story, as well as an answer to most of the question I listed here.\n\nAce Academy is a very fun game. I would have kept playing until the end and/or got bored if possible. I'm not sure if I can recommend this to anyone, but I certainly enjoyed running at least 5 and a half hours in it. It sounds short, but with a lot of choices to build your camaraderie and possible love interest, as well as some hidden choices depending if you picked a strong, smart, or charasmatic build when you start the game, it has the potential to go on even longer by the time it goes full access.

I feel like this game deserves better.\nACE Accademy is a Slice of Life / Romance / Giant robot fighting Visual Novel (A game in which the primary aspect of Gameplay is dialogue). If you watch Anime you'll feel right at home. However, You don't have to love VNs or Anime to enjoy this. It's a wonderful game all on its own.\nThe basic plots is this: Your character and your (adorable) little sister move to Japan to live with your (awesome) Uncle. You've transfered into ACE Accademy, a school that teaches people to work with GEARS. Giant robot suits that we fight for sport. You join a team consisting of a great cast of characters, your romance options and a loveable goof. Not all of them are introduced right off the bat but your choices are: A shy girl, A nice girl, A flirty girl, and a... quick tempered girl. They aren't that simple though, each character is deep and very interesting, with their own quirks and flaws.\nThe romance is very well done, quite adorable, and a huge draw for me. However, if that's not your thing, this game still has content for you. The main content is just as well made as the romance subplots.\nThe game is full of funny moments and interesting character development. It also has a lot of pop culture references, which while entertaining, we'll have to see how well they age. Even if they don't age well though, this will still be a great game.\nThe game has a bit of exta gameplay in the form of combat which they described as trying to be \"DDR like\", but they've recently stated that they're going to redesign combat in general.\nThis brings me to my penultimate point: The game is still under development, so the end isn't known yet. But I have high hopes for it. Parts are going to change, and I don't know what E4 will look like, but everything up till now has been incredible.\nFinally I'd like to say that this game has become my new go to VN to recommend to people who want to try out the genere. It's easily accesable, funny, fun, mixes things up a little, has a great cast, great art, basically it's over all a great starting point.", "timestamp_created": 1461448182, "timestamp_updated": 1461448182, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.999905", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22587719": {"recommendationid": "22587719", "author": {"steamid": "76561198220442605", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 349, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461355479}, "language": "english", "review": "great game wish to play the fighting and romance till the end", "timestamp_created": 1461417975, "timestamp_updated": 1461417975, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22518749": {"recommendationid": "22518749", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148103240", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 982, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488210282}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm very excited to see this VN be finished.\nI was really sad when I reached the end of episode 3, which in turn, means I'll be looking foward to the next episode.\n\nI've only played through the game once as of writing this review, but it's easy to see just how much replayability it has; there is quite a lot of decisions to be made. \nI was pleasantly surprised to see how good the voice acting was for the main cast, with a solid performance by the occasional side-character as well.\n\nThe artstyle grew on me very quickly; I think it's quite warm and smooth. \nThe story is simple, but very effective. Given the course of episode 3, it appears as though it'll become even better.\nThe true substance of ACE Academy, however, lies with it's characters and the dialogue pertaining to them. \nDuring my first playthrough of ACE, I found the cast to be very likeable; there is a pleasant amount of depth to each character. The writing throughout the game is also quite good.\nOne of my initial surprises of ACE was the addition of atmospheric sound, which really is a nice thing to have in a VN.\n\nThat about sums up my broad review.

I think I'll become more interested in visual novels overall.\" I say up to this point, because this game changed that. I finally see what it is that some people find so enthralling about visual novels. This game made me laugh, worry, plan strategically, get nervous, blush, get frustrated, ponder wholeheartedly, fall in love, think of witty comebacks, and experience a whole heap of other emotions and experiences. It was fantastic. This game is so well written. There's real personality to your possible choices, and there are a plentiful amount of choices for you to make. You really dictate what turns the story takes, and how different characters' storylines develop. Sure, the game is still kind of short and so it's probably not currently worth the full $25 price tag, but that's because the game is still in early access and only halfway completed. I have no doubt that by the time the remaining chapters are added, I will have definitely gotten my money's worth out of this game, and then some. The mini games are fairly basic, but also decently enjoyable. I hope there are a few more matches in the future chapters, but so far the mecha aspect of the game has been done decently well, especially as it ties into the storylines overall.

Like most good things in life though, it isn't finished yet.  I've gone down a couple of routes, and one route in particular seems like it would be painful to read.

Seriously, that is the only drawback to an otherwise promising start.  C'est la vie.   \n\nThere is a fair amount of humor to be had.  As far as a visual novel goes, it is very polished.  \n\nThough there are a couple of mini-games, it really does not affect much.  Maybe they intend to fix this in the next release?  \n\nOne final warning though, is that writing a review for a heavily-based story element is somewhat premature, since the biggest part of it is yet to be completed.  That said, there is a fair amount of work already done, and what they have looks promising.  \n\nWhat I've seen so far is worth it.  I would reccomend it, but as always buyer beware.

Next thing you should know is that I am incredibly picky with what VNs I even consider reading. Now that that is out of the way, to the review itself.\n\nThis VN is an incredibly quirky and funny story about a guy who ends up moving to Japan, for reasons that are hinted at in the story (As of the time of this review, only episode 2 has been released). The charecters that you are to interact with throughtout the game are at first glance set into one troupe or onother, but quickly begin to get depth to them. The amount of dialogue options in the game give it a very personal and individual experience, something many other VNs in the industry lack, stacked on top of being able to name the main charecter and give him a strength allow for one of the best experiences I have had to date.\n\nThe actual layout, structure, and the pacing of the game are all very well thought out. Nothing feels rushed, events don't just happen out of the blue, and it has a very authentic atmosphere. All in all, I consider this one of the games I am looking forward to the most in the coming year. If you are someone who has an interest in NVs but has always been scared away, I have confidance that this is one of the best games to get into the industry. I personally started with Fate Stay Night, and have no qualms about putting the this game right there with it.

Story is nice, it goes nice pace, and there is a lot choices. Even if story is 2049, giant mechas etc, story is realistic and heart warming. This is keeping up with If My Heart Had Wings, which I think is best visual novel on Steam so far. I might gives this even more credits, but because Early Access, I don't want to rush, but if story is written as well as first 2 episodes, my god they should nearly make anime or movie about this.\n\nArt is awesome. People look good, backrounds are realistic and nice. Big bonus is that eyes moves, which makes characters realistic and some what interacticve. I just wish they could use E-mote so whole character could move. That would make even more realistic. \n\nAbout music, it's good. there are few songs what I hear again and again, but they are not too bad. Sountracks know their place, but few more songs would be nice. \n\nVoice acting... This is were ACE Academy shines like a diamond. Voices are so believable. Voice actors really capture their characters personality. This is maybe the main reason why you should buy this.\n\nFor those who needs score: 8/10\nI really like to give higher score but since it's early access, I don't want to rush.

Also the more detailed Mech artwork; superb, simply superb.

I've honestly been having a hard time enjoying other VN's due to the fact \"eh, it's not as good as Ace Academy\"..

My favorite part about it, I think, is that in structure it's more similar to a choose your own adventure game than it is to most visual novels (that I've played at least). The sheer breadth of choices for simple things is something I really really appreciate. Too often I've been told that \"this person is you\" but have felt a profound disconnect between their actions and thoughts and my own; not so here. In fact, there was only one point I ever felt like my reaction wasn't amongst the choices and one point where I felt a choice was so VERY correct that I laughed and whooped, both a product of my strange sense of humor. (Small spoilers in the next paragraph) \n\nThe only disconnect occurred when your sister gives your bike a little makeover. I wanted to laugh my ass off, own it, and then proceed to drive that shit everywhere. Every time someone made a remark about it, I would proudly proclaim that my sweet little sister wanted to help decorate my bike and I just couldn't say no--she really loves unicorns, can you tell? I would keep doing that until SHE was embarrassed and BEGGED me to let her clean it off. The very correct choice was when asking your Broseph to go to the arcade with the \"The time of cyber skirmishing is upon us.\" choice. \n\nAnyway, the visual novel itself is wonderful and I love all the characters (I still can't choose a best girl). I don't think there were any of them I didn't like. I kept wanting a button to affectionately pat Nikki (the sister) on the head when she was being adorable. The setting itself is really interesting and a welcome departure from the standard faire (and the option to  name your special move was something I adored). I, quite frankly, can't wait for the next chapters, though I'll probably wait until they're all out and the game is 100% done to play again. \n\nI only have two criticisms. The first is that, while I adored all of the memes and little in-jokes, I have to wonder to what extent they're applicable in, y'know, Japan. For example, though I can't be certain as I've never been there, I don't think Japan has stereotypical American fratboys like the kind Shou lives with. It seems to me like the setting would have been better-served with simply having the initial move be one, say, across to the other coast of the United States. I imagine this is simply an artifact from when the visual novel was Kendo Crush and more fully Japanese in setting. Still, this is a minor complaint. \n\nMy big one is stuff like [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=594618585]THIS![/url] Look at it! Look at that shit! And it doesn't end, there are more later! And I can only imagine there will be more still in the future chapters! This is just revolting, insane! These writers just have no respect for the laws of nature or man. They're sick and they need to be put down like the sick dogs that they are. Some men just want to watch the world burn. \n\n(jk ilu <3)", "timestamp_created": 1454278822, "timestamp_updated": 1454278822, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20817784": {"recommendationid": "20817784", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157203708", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3750, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503385699}, "language": "english", "review": "This is my first review so I hope I'm doing this right.

However, ACE Academy includes certain features that go a step beyond other games in the genre. The main character can be named, and you can choose a \"specialty\" for him, such as athletic, intelligent, or charismatic. These affect events in the game. You can also choose which weapons you load on your Mecha (AKA GEAR), which actually affect your GEAR's statistics. These minor features add up to a better experience and a more content-rich game.\n\nThe characters are fun and entertaining. Most of them seem to settle in to standard anime roles, but they may surprise you. On the Romance side of things you have \"Tsundere Girl\" Kaori, \"Nice Girl\" Yuuna, \"Shy Girl\" Mayu, and \"Refreshingly Horny Girl\" Valerie. They are not one-note characters, and even Kaori's hostility is more than just anger for anger's sake. For the Supporting Cast you have \"Best Little Sister Ever\" Nikki, \"Best Uncle Ever\" Kaito, and \"Broseph\" Shou. Unlike most stories with a Harem setup, ACE Academy's supporting characters are vital to the story and have just as much characterization as the main girls. I see it as one of the game's unique strengths.\n\nThere are currently two chapters in Early Access, and it's a nice amount of content especially with the game's branches and reactivity. If nothing else, it should be more than enough to tell whether you will love the game or not.\n\nI highly recommend ACE Academy. It is actually the first game I even bothered to post a review for. If you are reluctant to enter Early Access on principle, I would still recommend Bookmarking the game so you know when it's released.

But not really as much as those in fuwanovel forum. At least i've read some of the best and popular ones like, KnS 1 &2, Fate, Hollow ataraxia, Katawa Shoujo, G senjo, Majikois, and some others. So i can assure you that this review is not coming from someone who just got into VNs. And also, i didn't really into mechs so i never read something like muv luv or watch gundam. But ACE Academy for me i think is an exception to that.\n\nNow, lets talk about this VN. \n- The most important part is story, for me its considerably a bit lighthearted. You know your typical romance/school/sci fi/mech, etc. Those kind of genre that is pretty familiar with some of the recent anime that just came out.. But to be fair it's not bad. actually not bad at all. Cuz it's more like real life experience. That is what i like about VNs. Most of the stuff is relatable to us because we can choose how the story is going to progress. And even more in this VN, because you're dealling with your daily college stuffs, friendship, business(maybe?), family stuffs, and romance ofc. Unlike other hardcore VN that will just throw us into some unknown situations to us and let us decide on things that we didnt even know what to do about it. \nBut in ACE Academy, it's not that hard to understand what's the story will progressing if you choose a certain choice in the game.\n\n- The humour is so good, i fell of my chair once. \n\n- The graphic/artstyle is decent, 7/10 for me. I just don't really like something that is too bright or too colorful. Maybe bcuz there are a lot of them in the recent animes. They're getting annoying, you know.  It's fine tho, it fits the theme very well. One of the coolest CG is when you see your Mech or in this case GEAR do some cool stuff. \n\n- The Music. Good enough, it's certainly fits most of the situations pretty well. But sometimes it can also be so annoying, because of it's so repetitive. Not really a bad thing since every single VNs out there do the same thing. Just my personal opinion tho.\n\n- Voice Actors. This is a litle bit hars but,\nMy GOD! You western devs! You need to do a better job than this! I know you're a small team. But, really?? It's like an EAR R4PE! This VN don't have a Japs dub so i can't really compare them. Just think about it, the first time you watch DB or Naruto or One Piece or Fairy tail, Bleach or whatever.. and it's in English or in your native language, you'd still think they did a pretty decent job right? But this is just a complete mess! Only Valerie is good, great even.\n\n- Characters are all great. No comments about them :))\n\n- The Ending?

Even if you're focusing on one character to get to know them or get romantically involved, at some points you HAVE to talk to someone else and it shows character development for all the characters.\n3. Not just a date sim, just because it has a date sim doesn't mean that's the focus of the story, in fact some of my FAVORITE dialouge is silly banter between Shou, the male friend, and your character.\n4. Character artwork is JUST as good as the character personalities.\n5. Full cast voice acting. We have voice acting  and not just for the main characters like your family and friends, even the faceless background characters like classmates and teachers have voices.\n\nCons:\n1. Again with Artwork, some of the full cut scenes are not necessarily poorly drawn, but they need to be redrawn if nothing else for the sake of functional anatomy. \n2. Voices, some of the voices for the main characters sound... off, not necessarily bad, some just don't fit the characers, and others just sound like they were recorded on a terrible mic. Other than that voices are great.\n3. The \"Gears\" I am 100% fine with the name, but the mech suits, in my opinion, look very bland and need a little bit of visual flair. There is one acception being somthing that happens to the main character's Gear after a certain point in the game BUT that new look is temporary and I don't want to spoil anything more.\n4. Combat, Quick time events are used throughout the game including quick reaction dialogue and such, but  the combat mechanics are severely lacking. it's just a mater of you have about three to four seconds to press either w,a,s or d as it appears on the screen, you fail to press it in time or press the wrong one, you take damage. As a counter to my arguement, this game is 1) still in early access, and 2) not a fighting sim. I know this, but I feel once the game has a bit more story done to it they should go back and refine the combat system just a little bit that way it's more fun to fight in your big robot.\n\nAgain all of my complaints are either only a problem because the game is early access, or can be fixed in an upcoming update due to the fact it's in early access. Over all for an uncompleted game with a few quirks that may bug me but Certainly don't take much away from the game if at all, I give this game a 9/10.

Und ich habe auch noch keinerlei Bugs bemerkt.\nDie Sprecher sind \u00fcberdurchschnittlich, die Zeichnung sind auch sehr sch\u00f6n. An manchen Ecken merkt man halt das begrenzte Budget, aber das streicht f\u00fcr mich nur die Ambitionen der Macher heraus und ist kein Qualit\u00e4tsverlust.\nBis jetzt musste ich dreimal durch das \"Minigame\", das ist nicht wirklich fordernd, aber es st\u00f6rt auch nicht gro\u00df. Vielleicht wird das ja noch im Laufe der Entwicklung verbessert.\n\nWas mich an diesem Spiel aber wirklch begeistert sind die vielen M\u00f6glichkeiten.

I'm happy to tell anyone who's reading my little review that it has definitely realized the potential of what it could be, and I can absolutely recommend it!\n\nStory:\n\nThe story is nice. It doesn't follow many conventions you would see elsewhere in the genre. You play as a foreign exchange student from New York, moving into the Mech Pilot program at ACE Academy. There's some drama and intrigue, but it's mostly slice of life goodness. All of the characters are executed very well, and they come off as very original. The individual routes are sweet, and the worst points of the story fall straight to mediocrity instead of actually being bad.\n\nIt has lots of good humor in it too, and references to other games and media are a plenty. Maybe someday, if you wish hard enough, Ceonardo Di Laprio will win the Moscars. Maybe someday...\n\nMusic:\n\nVery nice. None of the tracks get boring to listen to, but they aren't particularly super memorable either. That works well for the title though, and they all accentuate the scenes they're in well. Kudos to the composer!\n\nVoice Acting:\n\nThis is really one of the defining features of ACE Academy. it's a western visual novel that has full voice acting, and not only that: It's good! Really good! Special mentions go to Nikki's VA, Yuuna's VA (Who got better as development progressed! She did an excellent job.), Shou's VA, and Yuri's VA because Yuri is a russian character and that's cool. Everyone else did a great job as well. Kudos, guys!\n\nArt:\n\nThe art in this game is just wonderful. I love the style, and althought it sometimes varies a bit it's all wonderful. The character art is really good in particular, and the variety of different clothes the characters wear throughout the game did not go unnoticed. Really, it's insane just how much variety there is! I think that Yuuna has around 9 different clothing styles or something. It's nuts, and pretty much all the characters are like that. Really excellent choice, and I'm very pleased that it was made.\n\nThe background art isn't really anything to gush about, but it's good as well. You'll notice that some Background art gets recycled, but for the price of this title it's understandable. \n\nGameplay:\n\nGameplay, you might say? This is a Visual Novel! Why is there a section about gameplay?\nWell, this part of my review exists solely for me to praise the decision to remove gameplay.\n\nIf you hadn't played Ace Academy before the final release, you wouldn't have known that originally it had QTE gameplay and the skeleton of an RPG equipment system. It's better that way too, since the glory of ACE Academy is and was it's characters and story. Good job, PixelFade Studio! The decision to cut the gameplay was smart, and the game is better without it.\n\nFinal Verdict:\n\nBuy this game. It's excellent. If you've played any Visual Novels and liked them, this game is for you. The closest analogue to this game I can think of is Sunrider Academy. I'm happy to tell all of you that have played that game that ACE Academy throws it to the ground and smacks it around when it comes to quality: and sunrider was no slouch, either!\n\nI'm very hopeful that PixelFade Studio will release another visual novel. Which they basically say they'll be doing in the post credits blurb. I'll be keeping my eyes open for the next title! I bought this game once for myself, and another time for a friend. I'll probably be buying it again for someone else! It's that good and you've set a standard for quality.'\n\nOther Thoughts:\n\nThere are some interesting artifacts still left inside ACE Academy. They don't diminish from the experience, but are just kind of funny overall. For example, selecting your main characteristic. It's completely useless! LOL. But you should smart mang like me, and choose Intelligent because it's da best characteristic. Also, on a very rare occasion there will be a voice line missing. I've also noticed at least once that a voice was attached to the wrong line. There are probably a few kinks like these to work out, but I'm sure this game will get a 1.1 patch at some point smoothing out any remaining QA issues. Like I said, they don't take away from the experience. In fact, I've found them to be charming!

This game has amazing replayability value, as I constantly found myself wondering what would happen if I said or responded differently (There are quicktime events) and making different save files to find out as many differences as I could.\nOverall, this game is well worth the money and if you're interested in visual novel type games, then I highly recommend this one.\n", "timestamp_created": 1446678902, "timestamp_updated": 1446678902, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547040", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18871331": {"recommendationid": "18871331", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017662551", "num_games_owned": 246, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 2853, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494999244}, "language": "english", "review": "Well Ive had my eye on this sence it was know as Kendo Crush.

Am really disappointed that the protagonist dose not have a character spirt instead they do a first person view rather third person a lot of VN have the protagoinst in first person and when i played Kendo Crush and saw that the protagonist was viewed as a third person i thought that was really cool but when i played Ace Academy and it went with the tradisional first person i was really disappointed in that i played a lot of VN you can say am a veteran VN player  3. For music it fit fine but not it was not that amazing to say 4. For each character personality excluding protagonist there personality was fine there was nothing wrong with them 5. As for character introduction kind of disappointed in that as how the protagonist met with the first heroin it was just too simple depending your choices of course but still it was way too simple for a introduction for example in Ace Acadamy the introduction was spoil alert here ( met on the bus..... really thats how they met just like that) for Kendo Crush the introduction was introduce better example spoil alert ( first met in homeroom but was not considered a introduction as the protagonist did not intract with her he only intract with her after he saved a neko from a tree is you don't know what a neko is is basicly japanese word for cat.

Its combo system seems a bit broken too. It depends how you finish the attack phase and not your maximum combo, so if you mess up immediately, you're fine but if you get 19 perfect hits and mess up to start a new combo, it'll act like your max combo was 1 which is a bit frustrating and does lead to save scumming.\n\nThe character choices seem a lot of fun and each interaction was pretty different.\n\nTotally need a sister route though, Nikki is definitely one of the funnier characters.", "timestamp_created": 1442621565, "timestamp_updated": 1442621565, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513970", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17988238": {"recommendationid": "17988238", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120928428", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 370, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472648960}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a really good first look at what this game will give us in the future, I'm not going to lie I was really hesitant to even buy this due to the changes that it went through in development such as the name change from Kendo Crush to ACE Academy and the genre change from a modern day high school and a 3rd person perspective to a futurisitic high school in a 1st person perspective but I'm glad that I bought this as it is really entertaining.\n\nI really like the characters personalities, voice acting and design, the story is fun to read through with all the different references stuck in throughout to show the comedy and the conversations the other characters have such as Shou and Kaori's arguements.

Kind of wished the MC's GEAR was namable (or it could be after the game's finished for all I know) but being able to name the MC is a nice touch...although they (the makers of the game) may not want to ask what the players named the MC as you could name them anything. ANYTHING.\n\nFor some reason I, other than the MC's, hate the look of the GEARS and the AI's. They seem so...pointy? I don't know.\n\nMusic? Eh, It works and it plays...good enough for me.\n\nPeople probably would complain at the current cost ($25) but I figured that it's to at least pay for things like the voice actors for example, so I hope the story is at least slightly better than average as this is all currently character establishment at where they stopped.\n\nEdit: Alright, its been a while and the full game is out of course...time for a somewhat bigger review. \n\nThe QTE battles from the beginning is mostly gone now (in fact you now just press 'D' a few times, then spacebar when prompted and words for the finisher) and in its place is mutliple choices with a (if non-athletic I'm guessing) limited amount of time.\n\nEven without one of the three traits (which is basically, fitness, intelligence and...sensitivity?) that you can choose from the beginning, the game was fairly easy to guess if given a second to think about it. Either I spent too much time playing (hentai) Visual Novels or it was that damn easy of choices to make for this character or that.\n\nIt's a fairly into the 'slice of life' genre that makes fun of itself, with small bits of seriousness here and there. Nothing overdramatic like 'what happened to me in the past, I must get vengance for it' kind of thing and somewhat more (considering that it IS a Visual Novel with mechs and future technology in it) down to earth focus on friends and family. A fair amount of choices that you can choose are silly enough to warrant a (save first) pick just to see what could happen.\n\nThe voice actors were not horrible to listen to and I was very surprised at recognizing of a certain singer that I know of in Youtube playing a (supporting) role in this game.\n\nNow, I still like the game, although I now wish for the little sister DLC.

Yes I do.\n\nThe scores below are from 1 to 10, 1 being terrible, 5 being average and 10 being excellent. I am confident in this Visual Novel and I think it can be one of the best Western Visual Novels. Keep in mind that the scale I am using is the same that I use to evaluate japanese visual novels (like Grisaia no Kajitsu):\n\n[h1]Story: Not rated at the moment (episode 1)[/h1]\nSince this is only the first episode and was pretty much about introductions (and there's still another girl to be introduced in the next episode), I can't rate the story. My personal thoughts are that this is going to be a straightforward comedy slice of life romantic visual novel, so I don't expect any serious developments or mind blows.\n\nThere's not really much I can say about writing. It focuses on the dialogue and the protag thoughts, and doesn't waste time in detailing objects/sceneries. It's an easy to read writing and direct to the point.\n\nThere are some references and easter eggs. One of the best scenes in this visual novel is a small battle between the MC, Kaori and a Tech Gosu. Their battle is a little parody between Android, Apple and Microsoft. Another is when choosing a movie, you get to choose a movie of a list of movies that all are based off real movies, and the characters leave their comment on it.\n\n[h1]Visuals: 7[/h1]\nThe backgrounds are just too good. The artist makes such a good job of using lightning to give more life to the backgrounds.\nThe characters also look good in my opinion. The big drawback here is that, probably due to financial limits, secondary characters don't have fully drawn sprites. Meaning that their sprites are just black figures.\n\n[h1]Gameplay: 9[/h1]\nThis visual novel, just like many others, is about making choices. Difference is that this one has tons of choices that drastically change the story, while the others only have a few. If you need a comparison, compare it to Walking Dead videogame from Telltalles games. Some choices only change a few lines, while others change a lot of what happens. For example, earlier in the game, you can choose to go to school by bus or with the bike. Depending on what you choose, it will change what characters you meet first and what will happen in the next day. Not only that, but if you decide to be an A hole with someone, that someone will remember it later and act accordingly.\n\nThere's also the rollback feature. Rollback is the feature that allows you to rollback to your previous choice and choose another option. In this VN, you are asked in the begginning if you want to disable it. If you do, you will get achievements and \"other possible goodies\".\n\nYou can also name your protagonist and choose his background trait: athletic, intelligent and intuitive. If you choose to be athletic, you will have no problem carrying luggage, if you choose to be intelligent, other characters might ask for your help with the studies, etc. This also sometimes highlights the best options in some choices, for example, if the teacher asks a question, the correct answer will be highlighted if you chose the intelligent trait.\n\nThis visual novel also features mini games. In the first episode, there are two type of mini games, if there will be more or not in the future I don't know. One is a simple press the right combination of 5 buttons scattered around the screen. In this episode, it appears only once to callibrate the MC's mech. To be honest that minigame feels unnecessary (especially because your penalty for failing is just repeating the mini game), however one of the devs said that he plans to use it again later, so I assume that this one can serve as a tutorial kind of thing.\n\nThe other mini game is the combat. I am pleased that they improved it a lot since the alpha. Now it's a lot better and it feels like I am actually doing some damage. This mini game is simple: Just press WASD according to what appears on the screen. If it appears W, press W and your combo will go up. You have limited energy and the enemy has HP. Depending on how well you do in the combat, the other characters will react to it (if you did well, they will praise you, etc). However, the bad side is that the mini game is too easy (for me at least).\n\n[h1]Sound: 7[/h1]\nThey really did a good job here. The music is good and one of the tracks even got stuck in my ear (it's one that plays when riding the bike if we choose to go to school with it). That's a lot more than I can say for many visual novels. You see, I am like this: if I like the music that is playing, I continue to play the VN with it on, if I don't, I turn off the music and play my own. I didn't turn off the music in this VN.\n\nThe voice acting is also good. The voices match very well with the characters (Shou especially). Obviously, we are talking about low budget voice acting, so don't expect voice acting on Morgan Freeman level (aka God level). It's good, but not something that will blow you away. But considering that one can count english voice acted visual novels with just one hand, this is a really good effort from the devs.\n\nHowever, there are at least two moments where secondary characters don't have voice. Considering that I reported this in the last alpha, I am going to assume that their lack of voice is intentional and not a bug. This is weird because everyone else is voiced. I will update this if they add voices later.\n\n[h1]Characters: Not going to rate yet[/h1]\nSome of the characters are inspired by your usual japanese anime stereotypes, like tsundere. However, they don't shamessly try to imitate them to the letter, which is good, because english voice acting + japanese stereotypes = usually not a good idea. It's not by chance that \"Idiot!\" doesn't sound as good as \"baka!\" at the end of \"I didn't do it because I like you, baka!\"\n\nIn the first episode, you are introduced to an uncle (Kaito), sister (Nikki), friend (Shou) and the romantic options: Mayu, Yuuna and Kaori. There's also a french girl appearing in the next episode, Belle (Ooh l\u00e0 l\u00e0). And there's also other guy that you may or may not meet in this episode depending on your choices, Akira (I got my eye on you, you white haired *insert swear here*)\n\nBecause we are only in the first episode, and also because I'm lazy, I will refrain for now from talking of each one individually, but what I can say is that they feel compeling and I want to know more about them.\n\n[h1]Enjoyment: 9[/h1]\nI am a sucker for choices. I am a sucker for consequences. So I had a blast replaying it multiple times and roleplay differently each time.\nThe only complaint I have is that this episode felt a bit shorter compared with the original demo, but other than that, it was fun.\n\n[h1]Final rating: 8 (episode 1)[/h1]\n\n[h1]TL;DR:[/h1]\nJust buy it! \n\nI kid. You should buy it if:\n- You like light hearted stories;\n- You like mechas;\n- You like tons of choices;\n- You like easter eggs/references;\n- You want to support western VN's.\n\nYou shouldn't buy it if:\n- You want a serious story (again, this is based off of the first episode, it might get serious moments later on for all I know);\n- You don't like any kind of mini games in visual novels;\n- You prefer more linear stories.\n\nIf you have any questions or you want to point out something, feel free to comment.

However, I have since given up support for the project, through no reason other than the unfortunate issues the development staff encountered at many steps. What was originally intended to come out fully in June of this year, is now still in early access.\n\nHowever, this is to be expected. They have changed the game considerably, and picked up new staff, despite the issues encountered. As a mid-tier backer of the project, I was given early access to builds of the new \u2018Ace Academy\u2019 game. All I can say is I found the quality of the writing to be greatly diminished from that of the original demo. \n\nWithout spoiling anything, certain character interactions with a girl named \u2018Kaori\u2019. She\u2019s quite temperamental, and I was originally satisfied with how much you were able to tease her. From what I played of the current game, there have been far less options to do this. In general, I found the comedy of the original to be much more prominent. \n\nThere are some improvements over the redo. The art is much better, and I\u2019m sure the futuristic appeal of the game will be more enjoyable to some, over the original Kendo focus, which some might have seen as boring. I must admit, that it was probably a better move for the game to be redesigned, but that doesn\u2019t change my opinion on the matter.\n\nWhile I can guarantee the game is worth the price, it just isn\u2019t there for me.", "timestamp_created": 1441325435, "timestamp_updated": 1441325865, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 84, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.609312", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17869683": {"recommendationid": "17869683", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043733203", "num_games_owned": 246, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1441322222}, "language": "english", "review": "Firstly I\u2019d just like to say as this is the early access and still has a lot more to come I thought it was extremely good. The story was enticing and kept me very interested in the characters throughout the first part of the game. I also enjoyed little mini games within this visual novel which kept things interesting. \n\nSecondly the music to this game is very good and fits the rhythm of what is happening and the mood that goes with it. I was very surprised at how well it was done for a company\u2019s first work.\n\nFinally all the characters to this game have a lot to them and are all very likeable. This made me enjoy the story so much more and felt more connected with each character. The voice acting is also good and fits the characters all very well giving them all their own great personalities. There are also many different choices you can make which help keep the game fresh and mean there is much more replay ability. \n\nIn all I feel ACE Academy is definitely worth a buy! It\u2019s a lot better than most other visual novels I have played on steam. Especially seeing as the first part is longer than most of them, it is defiantly worth the money! If visual novels are your thing I think you will enjoy it as much or maybe more than I did!\n", "timestamp_created": 1441323340, "timestamp_updated": 1441323340, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.720883", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}}}

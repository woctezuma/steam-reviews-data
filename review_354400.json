Well, it has words. Heck, the singing in this game is fantastic. You're lamented by a male tadpole trying to get a mate, and warned of the dangers ahead by a snail, if I recall correctly. If you're not going to get this wonderful experience, at the very least listen to the soundtrack.

You can clearly hear the passion Matthew Taranto, the creator of the game and music, had while writing it. And his music sheet BECAME the stage you are playing on, with the obstacles being the notes themself! But that is not all!\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe music lines in perfectly with enemies in different themes of music and style, from Chiptune 8-bit stage to Crabs-and-snails western. There are also some twists in the core mechanics here and there for a neat surprise.\nBut be warned, this is not a rythm game per se. The core mechanic is that you dodge the notes that make up the music while collecting stuff, you are not required to press the keys all the time in rythm like you may know from games like Rythm Fever.\n\n[h1]Time[/h1]\nSadly, this game is rather short. You can play through all stages in 1 - 2 hours, but the wonderful music and style makes them very replayable, so you can play them over and over again.\nAlso, this game features a in-game composer for your own levels, akin to Mario Paints composer but fit to the games style and mechanics. And with a Steam Workshop integration coming up, this means you will have plenty of more stages to play.\n\n[h1]Price[/h1]\nIt costs 5 bucks, during the 2017 Summer Sale 1.25 bucks. That's somewhat as much as 1.5L of Coca Cola or some chips. But this game provides you with 1000x more fun than potato chips! Trust me, I did the SCIENCE! \n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nEvery frame is hand-drawn in a colorful, quirky art-style. The game plays in 60 FPS and obviously doesn't need much to run well. The games engine is Unity, so, yeah. \n\n[h1]Difficulty[/h1]\nIt can be quite challenging at times, but you can play through the game without dying more than 5 times in total. And I suck at video games. So, it's not too hard. But for that, there are \"Challenge Flies\", which can be quite a deal to collect! So there is something for the people who like challenges as well!\n\n[h1]Final words[/h1]\nAll in all, I rate this game a solid 9 out of 10 refrain-loops ;).", "timestamp_created": 1498258965, "timestamp_updated": 1498260014, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.781960", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32656871": {"recommendationid": "32656871", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055401923", "num_games_owned": 299, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498496485}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome, short game", "timestamp_created": 1498175189, "timestamp_updated": 1498584362, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31535997": {"recommendationid": "31535997", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056642090", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 386, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490149219}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a great little indie rhythm game.\n\nThe music in this game is simply the best in any rhythm game that I have played...\nWhich is the most important part of a good rhythm game.\n\nIt was entirely made by two brothers.

Do you like retro homages? Do you like Brawl in the Family? Play this game.\n\nThe long version:\nI discovered this game through Brawl in the Family. If you like Smash Bros. and online comics, check it out. It's ended now, but it's got some good stuff. Don't worry, this review will still be here when you finish. Anyway, I spotted the trailer for Tadpole Treble in the suggestions after watching their History of Nintendo music vid. I watched it, and thought it was a cool concept. It was also an indie, and as an aspiring game developer myself, I decided to cheer the game on. Since I didn't have my own credit card, I grabbed the game as soon as it came out on Early Access (which was actually the full game sans achievements). It was worth every penny--or peso, in my currency.\n\nTadpole Treble is part rhythm game, part \"platformer\" (without any actual platforms), and part music lesson. Levels are built on a musical staff with the notes as obstacles. Cymbals, reeds, and mushrooms add some percussion when whacked, while bubbles, sparkles, and food put some life to the background when touched. The general rule is dodge black, whack gold, and collect purple. The game starts off on a welcoming stage with a calming melody--perfect for learning the basics. The later levels vary in musical genre, theme, and, of course, difficulty. From the suspenseful snaps of Barracuda Cavern to the relentless munches of Piranha Jungle, from the soothing ballad of Midnight Bayou to the shocking chorus of Thunder Creek, from the retro beat of Chiptune Lagoon to the booming orchestra of Con--oh, wait, that's a secret. Anyway, each level is unique and has its own charm, and is worth beating a few times, especially if you're a completionist. Speaking of which, each level has five medals: one for completion, one for gaining an S rank (the highest), one for gaining an F rank (the lowest), one for collecting all the bubbles, and one for nabbing the level's challenge fly (a unique challenge for each level). There's no way to get all these medals in one go, since F and S are opposites, so you'll have to play the level at least twice, and possibly a third time after you unlock something special for gaining a specific medal. You'll probably also enjoy one level so much that you repeat it over and over again. And who knows, you might nab that #1 spot.\n\nThe plot isn't anything special, but it's still heartwarming. It's mostly about growing up and determination and whatnot, but it also has some environment stuff, which is something I feel everyone should learn from. Each level has its own miniature story, while finishing certain levels progresses the main. The way \"cutscenes\" are presented, in comic panels with accompanying sound, is positively adorable, and gives me memories of the old BitF. But hey, that's just me.\n\nOn a personal note, as I said earlier, I plan on making a game one day. And watching these devs, I can't help but wish for their success.

Tadpole Treble is the debut game by Bitfinity, which among others includes Matthew and Michael Taranto. The former of those two is the author of Brawl in the Family, a really good webcomic I urge you to read. It unfortunately ended before Tadpole Treble came out, so you can treat it as the comic's successor.\n\nNow, I mentioned Brawl in the Family because it had a handful of strips where Matthew got to show off his skill at composing music, and his great singing voice. Since Tadpole Treble is a rhythm game - sort of - these two are both used to full effect. You play as Baton, a newly-hatched tadpole who finds herself abducted from her home at Tadpole Pond by Coda the Pelican (you may be noticing a pattern here). She escapes, but unfortunately finds herself at the tip top of Opus Island. To get home she'll need to swim through all of its waterways, and evade everything that wants her for a snack - which is a lot.\n\nGameplay is a mix between a rhythm game and an auto-runner, with the twist that you need to avoid the notes making up the song instead of hit them. It has a pretty forgiving difficulty curve, and there's usually multiple safe paths, not to mention a super mode you can trigger that lets you plow right through them (but not other obstacles) after it's fully charged. The stages have a great deal of variety, and all of them feel like they have their own identity. In one you have to deal with a barracuda pursuing you through a dark cavern, in another swimming backwards as you head down a waterfall. \n\nAnd the songs! Not all of them are voiced, sadly, but they're as unique as the levels, and fit them all perfectly. I saw a comment comparing them to the Kirby series in how they evoke different emotions, and that's pretty accurate. These guys definitely have talent. \n\nTadpole Treble only spans twelve levels and they're all only about three minutes, same with the songs that accompany them. That's not a problem for me, since it's priced accordingly, the levels are fun, and there's a decent chunk of replayability to them as well. There's the obvious S Ranks you can acquire for perfecting a level, and uniquely, F Ranks you can get by skillfully being as bad at it as possible. Each level also has Challenge Flies you can collect by performing a specific task, and bubbles you can exchange for extras like bestiary pages of all the animals you encounter in the game.\n\nI don't think there's a game on Steam quite like Tadpole Treble, and while it's not exactly a rhythm game I'd recommend it to fans of the genre anyway, or just to anyone looking for something colorful, happy and humorous.", "timestamp_created": 1475220169, "timestamp_updated": 1475220169, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.591207", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25719346": {"recommendationid": "25719346", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012248506", "num_games_owned": 8232, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 325, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474933757}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]Short Version:[/b]  Charming little game starring a teeny tiny tadpole in a big watery world filled with danger, adventure, romance, badgers, and of course, music!   Squirm your small squiggly self up and down the treble clef to fight off pelicans, lightning, bears, magical mayan deathtraps, horny tadpoles, obese amphibians,  and the supreme enemy of all things... a poor sense of rhythm!\n\nTadpole Treble is a short, but absolutely adorable game featuring one brave tadpole in her quest to return home / save the world / not get eaten like a bite sized frogsicle.    The core of the game is a rhythm-platformer of sorts;  As a tadpole, you swim up and down an underwater musical staff to avoid rocks and things that want to eat you, while collecting bonus bubbles and accenting the rhythm with tailswings in order to perform daring dives and Ecco-esque superjumps.\n\nEvery level in Tadpole Treble feels like a brand new experience.  Each area features a unique musical piece (in a variety of styles), along with new enemies and dangers - and often a playstyle gimmick to boot (from playing in darkness to swimming backwards to warping through Mario pipes and whacking Duck Hunt ducks in a pixellated wonderland).  The levels are all accompanied by charmingly catchy background tracks - some purely instrumental, others featuring pleasantly amusing lyrics.  Clearly, the developers put a lot of love into designing the different areas of the game as well as the thematically appropriate musical accompaniment.  Each and every level feels individually special, and playing through them is a joy.  \n\nThe basic game is rather short (you can probably rush through it in an hour or two), but the online scoreboards and unlockable extras for performing certain feats and collecting ALL the bubbles may keep you coming back for more.  Additionally, there is a composition mode for those who wish to create their own musical adventures.  Currently the composition mode seems a bit awkward (both to use and to share your creations with others), but at least it's an option.  Additionally, the developers recently announced that they're looking into Steam Workshop share-ability, so it may be easier to find new levels to play through in the future.\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b]  \nTadpole Treble will stick a smile on your face - and then continue sticking with you long after you play it.   There are a few minor negatives to the game (the controls felt a bit loose to me, the story mode is rather short, and some of the gameplay mechanisms aren't explained very well in game), but these are easily overlooked in favor of the unusually delightful experience that Tadpole Treble provides.\n\n[i]10/10, would squiggle through childhood piano lessons again.[/i]\n\n[quote]Received a free copy for testing/reviewing purposes.

Tadpole Treble is the story of the life of a newly hatched tadpole that swam a little too far down river and was as a result, eaten by a hungry bird. Luckily, after a bit of a struggle and a few thumps and bangs, the tadpole was ejected back out of the birdies mouth and narrowly escaped the miserable fate of becoming bird food. Unfortunately, now because of her carelessness, the little tadpole was sadly lost and trapped far from her home pond. You must feel terribly sad and worried about the poor little thing. Won\u2019t you take the job of helping the young tadpole find her way back home? You will struggle with the daunting task of collecting bubbles, challenge flies and dodging enemies such as the dreaded music note rocks!\n\nA developer who was formerly a popular webcomic artist made Tadpole Treble. He became well known for \u201cBrawl in the Family\u201d, before retiring the comic series and turning his attention to game development.  Part of the charm of the old comic series is when the artist would break out into a song. Ode to the Minions is always good for a laugh and remains one of my favorite musical pieces. The song can really make you rethink some of your actions in games to date. How, without a second thought, you slay the various creatures you encounter for no other reason than they are there and they might have some money on them. Do you ever think or do you even care what you are doing to those creatures\u2019 families\u2026 you really are heartless when playing a game. Tadpole Treble keeps this tradition alive by breaking into songs on a few of the stages as you play.\n\nTadpole Treble appears to be a rather simple, auto-scrolling, rhythm game on the surface. You actually only have three buttons to worry about Up, Down, Attack. That\u2019s pretty much it. To complete a stage all you need to do is avoid hitting enough things that will damage you so that you can make it to the end. If you do a decent job as you progress, you will even charge up a meter. When that meter is released, it will give you temporary invulnerability that allows you to get revenge on those spiky music note rocks. You can also attempt to complete the various optional challenges on each stage as well. Collecting all the bubbles, smacking things with your tail, unlocking the challenge flies, getting a high/low score, etc. will yield you badges on each of the stages to see your past accomplishments and earn you most of the Steam Achievements as well. As you progress through the game, the stages get more difficult. Now you are no longer just avoiding the spiky music note rocks; you also have to avoid being eaten by various creatures who think you would make a nice appetizer. \n\nThere are not all that many stages in the game, but that actually isn\u2019t such a bad thing. Each stage you play has its own unique theme and accompanying tune. You can see the five line music staff that contains the spiky music note rocks. You are able to move along any of the lines or the spaces between/above/below the lines in order to avoid coming in contact with the spiky music note rocks. As you pass them, they change colour and sound their note which accompanies the background tune of the stage. On occasion you can add to the beat of the stage by attacking optional gongs with your tail which plays their note and tosses you out of the staff for a while before returning. Sometimes you need to time it just right so you can keep out of the water as you fly majestically though the air over the obstacles in the water below.\n\nIf you are so inclined, there is even a level editor included so you can start making your own levels. It seems to be quite powerful too! They are currently looking to add Steam Workshop support so that people will be able to share their new stages more easily rather than having to use QR codes to share levels.\n\nPresentation wise, the game looks cute. It has a colourful, hand-drawn, cartoon style to it that is absolutely charming. Each of the levels have their own separate background and theme so very little looks like it was recycled from level to level. The music in the game is all original content and passes through several genres. The notes of the theme being the obstacles you face made an especially interesting and unique twist for the game. It even has the added bonus that if you are handy with an instrument yourself, you could play along just by reading the spiky music note rocks on the screen as you watch someone else play.\n\nWould I recommend you get it? It is incredibly short. My playtime was at 4 hours at the time of writing this. That included me playing each of the levels at least twice, attempting the single life challenge mode, sitting idle listening to the songs in the music player, making and trying my own levels and attempting to do some of the challenges to unlock more things. There is plenty of replay-ability and it will take me a while to unlock everything. This game was crafted with the intention that you will be replaying all the levels multiple times in order to truly complete the game. If you like rhythm games, Tadpole Treble is definitely one you will want to pick up because it isn\u2019t really like any of the other rhythm games that I have tried. Tadpole Treble is unquestionably unique.", "timestamp_created": 1474066520, "timestamp_updated": 1474066520, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583479", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25483211": {"recommendationid": "25483211", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014061166", "num_games_owned": 380, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 299, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503076144}, "language": "english", "review": "A truky fantastic experience.

This game really surprised me.\n\nI received a press code for this and had zero expectations for it. I heard it was a rhythm game (which I like) but saw the art style and characters and assumed it was made for kids. I was totally wrong. Tadpole Treble isn't a long game but I had an ear-to-ear grin on my face the whole time I played it.\n\nThe story is that you're a newly hatched tadpole who is separated from her family and must try to get back home. Your journey takes you through a variety of environments, each of which have their own original songs and level specific challenges. The songs were composed and largely performed by the game's developers, some even have lyrics and they're fantastic. They're cheesy and goofy but are purposefully so and that makes them endearing. They mix up genres and themes and every song and the level its associated with feels unique and fresh.\n\nThe game isn't super difficult if you're just aiming to get through the story but you do have a score and are graded on every level, plus there's additional challenges and leaderboards so if you want to replay it, there are reasons to. When you beat the story, there's also an endurance mode where you attempt to play the entire story non-stop to see how far you can get and how big a score you can obtain.\n\nBeyond this, there's an entire composition and level editing tool included! You have all the tools the developers had at your disposal and they tell you right off the bat that you have full ownership of anything you create. The one glaring omission here is Steam Workshop support. You can generate a QR code for your levels that you can share on forums and stuff but come on, something like this is begging for Steam Workshop! I really hope they're able to patch that in later as I could see a real community forming around it.\n\nOverall, Tadpole Treble is fantastic and one of my biggest surprises of this year. It's a rare opportunity when I can go into a game knowing zero about it and be so pleasantly surprised in the end.

There's so much character within every nook and cranny of every stage, and even the menus and extras have a lot of love poured into them.

That's not even to mention the easy-to-use song/level editor, which is really fun to mess around with, at least if you have music-reading experience. I've really only got two complaints: keyboard controlling is a little fiddly (I honestly didn't try to make any music puns in this review, but there we are!), and my computer lags quite a bit on the faster levels if I leave resolution and visual quality high (though my computer was about the cheapest one at Walmart, so I doubt many others will have this issue).

My favorites are Midnight Bayou for being a rather novel addition to a video game, and Thunder Creek for the excitement factor. Other highlights include the winter themed Snowfall lake, and the suspenseful Barracuda Caverns. Given all the different themes, however, I hesitate to call any of them better than another.\n\nTo summarize, Tadpole Treble has a few minor bugs, but more than enough content for a $10 pricetag and is an overall memorable, enjoyable experience.

A game I have been waiting for since BiTF finished quite a while ago. As somebody who highly enjoyed the musical strips, I was looking forward to see what Taronto would do with his own game. And what do I think of it?\n\nFirst off, lets talk about the absolute best feature of the game: the music. It's such a wide variety of genres, and yet EVERY one sounds good. All of them. I suspect witchcraft was involved. Obviously, being a music-based game, this is fantastic, as you're going to be hearing those tracks a lot. Which brings me to...\n\nThe Gameplay! It's all well and good having good music, but is the game itself any good? Well, I think so. The main gameplay revolves around obstacles and items being placed according to the music, much like other rythm games. What separates this rythm game however is that it effectively takes place on a musical score, with the things being placed according to their note. You move your tadpole up and down the score, and can occasionaly attack things in front of you with your tail.\n\nSo that's the basic gameplay, but each stage has its own gimmick that makes it unique to play. It could be going backwards, or being chased by Pirahnas, or losing health in the salty water... you get the idea. There's also a lot to do in each level. Each level has 100 bubbles for you to collect, which are the main collectable of the game, a challenge for you to complete, and several medals for you to achieve. And of course, you're scored in each level - with both high scores and low scores being recorded. Trust me, there's a lot to do.\n\nThat is, if you're going for completion. This brings me to my first gripe with Tadpole Treble: it's pretty short. I completed the story in about 1 1/2 hours, only really getting stuck on one stage. Beating levels is pretty easy for the most part, so bear that in mind.\n\nThe second gripe I have is with the controls. They're simple enough: up, down, and attack; but (at least on my keyboard) the movement felt very loose. I had to tap super quickly to make sure they only moved one layer, which became particularly egrigious when I was forced to carefuly manouver through dense layers of obstacles.\n\nThe final gripe I have is with the final boss level, which was very unclear as to how you beat it. I only beat the first phase completely by accident after I'd wasted several minutes waiting for something to happen. The second phase was admittedly fine, but the third phase... I'm still not sure if I was always doing it right and it just took an inordinately long time, or if I was doing something minutely wrong then got it right by accident. Oh well, at least I don't have to return to that level any time soon.\n\nDespite my gripes, I still had fun with Tadpole Treble, and will likely play it again to complete some parts of it. I feel it's definitely worth the price, as long as you enjoy rythm games.\n\nOh yes, and the art is adorable. :)\n\nEDIT: On replaying to try and complete the game I found out why I was having so much trouble with the Pirahna level: it lags like crazy. This not only makes controlling slippery, but sometimes it can even muck up the scripted cymbal events. Seriously, the second cymbal causes me to hit an obstacle when I land a majority of the time. And this isn't an isolated incedent - I've seen plenty of other people having the same problem. This kills the replay value, since it makes it impossible to complete the game. Which is a shame, as the rest of the game is really fun. I still recommend the game overall, but it's a shame I can't fully enjoy it. :\\", "timestamp_created": 1472952258, "timestamp_updated": 1473106127, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25336619": {"recommendationid": "25336619", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095907159", "num_games_owned": 133, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 188, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473039068}, "language": "english", "review": "Its fun, has smooth controls, nice art style, and amzing sound design.

Heh heh...\n\nThe review:\n\nIf you\u2019ve heard the name \u201cMatthew Taranto\u201d before then you must be a fan of his Brawl in the Family webcomic series. I know I certainly am, so I was one with that crowd when it was announced Tadpole Treble would be Matt\u2019s (and his brother Michael\u2019s) direct entry into the development part of the industry. It doesn\u2019t have Kirby eating something funny or comedic shots of Solid Snake\u2019s butt or Waluigi\u2019s horrendously drawn face. However, what it does have appeals to my love for cartoons and music in a truly mesmerizing manner.\n\nGraphics\n\nGiven how adorable the Brawl in the Family comics look, it\u2019s no surprise that the Tarantos would deliver a similarly charming original world.  What makes Tadpole\u2019s presentation stand out is just how kinetic and synchronized the action is. It almost felt like I was playing through a cartoon musical; there are events that would time themselves with the music. The backgrounds are fully loaded with animation and scenery. Tadpole Treble is the most visually interesting game since the day Parappa the Rapper birthed the modern conventions for a rhythm game.\n\nAudio\n\nOh\u2026my\u2026God. This soundtrack. THIS soundtrack! It partially seems to be there to complement the stylistic gameplay, providing melodies that people could hop on board with. It\u2019s not a bad thing by any means, since the general compositions fit the concept like a glove. However the highlights of the soundtrack come around when the music goes above and beyond to be as diverse and catchy as it could. Each level has a unique piece, and the instrumentals can range from piano melodies to drums and bass to full-on lyrics!\n\nThe music is in complete control of what goes on in the game, and players have no choice but to go with the flow. Because they\u2019ll be having fun anyway. If anything, there is one level that (while the song is still solid) has a portion in which the mood changes rather abruptly. It kind of makes the song lose its momentum the tone had prior to the moment it changed. Other than that one nitpick the audio is an A+ in my book.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe gameplay is easy to grasp. As the plucky little tadpole, you move up and down to avoid the black notes and instead collect the purple bubbles. Sometimes you\u2019d need to whip your tail at particular timings for extra points or to keep away from certain level-specific dangers. While rhythm games often rely on the music to be the basis for mechanics revolving around matching button presses, Tadpole Treble\u2018s gameplay is pretty much in the music\u2019s hands. It\u2019s fun to keep at the given pace and collect the bubbles as they are synced with the background piece. The graphics also come in to play in the form of surrounding animated animals serving as unique gameplay obstacles. There is life created through the musical gameplay and it does a darn great job at embracing it.\n\nYou too can embrace the lively musical cartoon vibes as well via the game\u2019s Composition mode.  You can even make your own levels! And since this is a music game, that means you can make your own songs and share them with others. This is where the game\u2019s inspiration from Mario Paint becomes a lot more evident. That\u2019s because the music creation is intuitive and fun, much like Tadpole Treble\u2018s own levels. The tools are easy to learn, and the results are ultimately effective.\n\nVerdict\n\nGuys, I freaking love this game. Heart and soul is visibly poured into every detail of Tadpole Treble and all I can really think to do is obsess about those details. It\u2019s like my interests in music and cartoons had a night out and partied at a multimedia theater. As much as I\u2019d want to dish out a couple nitpicks (which I just barely managed to do), I have had too much fun mentally dancing along and playing through the game to care. Seamlessly synchronized and filled to the brim with charm and personality, Tadpole Treble is unquestionably a must-have for your Wii U.

So I might be a bit biased!\n\nOne of my favourite things about videogames generally is the music, and while some of it took a little while to grow on me, the more I've played this game the more I love its soundtrack.  I guess that's the nature of game music - it really helps to hear it in context, at least at first.  And since this is a game where you have to really think about the music to play the levels well, that probably goes double.  I've had a soft spot for Chiptune Lagoon ever since it featured in the demo, but for me there's also a great stretch of level music for the levels from Snowfall Lake to Thunder Creek.  Then again, ask any fan of this game and they'd probably pick out their own faves.  I dunno.  Music.  It's good stuff.\n\nThe gameplay is solid, with a good difficulty curve.  I'm not generally a fan of rhythm games, but the decision to make it a game about dodging the notes (for the most part) rather than hitting them allows for a lot more freedom for the player - and creativity for the level designer.  The gameplay varies nicely, with some levels focusing on gimmicks and others just focusing more on hitting you with increasingly complex songs.  There are even boss battles every third level or so!  The main game is quite short, but there's plenty of replayability if you want to gun for challenges or high scores - which also adds to the good feel of the difficulty curve.  The game is easy to learn, reasonable to beat (heck, I've beaten it, and that's saying something) and pretty darn hard to master.\n\nThe art style is simple, cute and effective, and the game's writing has some nice humour, as you might expect from Matthew Taranto - make sure to chat to Etude whenever you get the chance :).\n\nAs it stands, the game's only real weakness is with Composer mode.  It's a brilliant idea - a toolset that allows you to write your own tunes and, in the process, design your own levels for the game.  The way that you transfer your saved levels to other players - QR codes - seems really clunky though, and if you try writing a long or high-tempo piece of music you quickly exceed the game's ability to generate QR codes for sharing.  Steam Workshop integration would be a huge deal if it could be implemented.\n\nOther than that, the game's a pretty great deal.  I don't often write Steam reviews, but Tadpole Treble feels like it could use some more publicity, so I'm poking my head over the parapet for it.\n\nPS: one great little joke in Composition Mode: the symbol for bass (the guitar) is a bass (the fish).

Typically, in rhythm games, the goal is simply to time you're button press correctly.  Games like Guitar Hero, Rockband, and Rhythm Heaven are great examples of this.  The other way these games usually play is having you move around.  That encompasses your DDRs and Just Dances.  Tadpole Treble doesn't fall into either of those two categories.\n\nIn every level of Tadpole Treble, your goal is to dodge the notes as you swim down the river.  You can ascend and descend the scale to avoid danger, nab collectables/health, or simply to position yourself.  It's an incredibly fun way to play, and every stage has it's own way to keep things fresh and interesting.  A few worth noting are travelling in reverse, changing the theme to 8-bit, and giving you a tadpole partner who serenades you as you swim.  These gimmicks give every level its own unique feeling.\n\nThe aesthetics to this game aren't overly complicated, but they're pleasant to the eye.  Colors are well used to contribute towards the mood of each area.  Everything you need to know is quickly communicated to you, with enough time to react accordingly.\n\nThe music is excellent.  If you've seen Matthew Taranto's work on Brawl In The Family, or the Ace Attorney Musical, then you'd definitely see this coming.  I don't know much about his brother Miechal, but I'm sure they both contributed greatly to the final product.  The songs have very nice rhythm, and match their areas perfectly.  My personal favorite is Midnight Bayou, as it has vocals by Matthew (He has the voice of an angel).\n\nThis game is definitely worth purchasing, even in the early access phase.\n\nUPDATE:  For anyone who cares, I personally recommended this game for the \u201cI Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award\u201d Award.

It's just that charming.\n\nI've been a big fan of Matthew Taranto's work for a few years now-- Brawl in the Family was one of my favourite webcomics,  and I've stumbled upon some of his musical work as a result of it. When he announced that he was working on a game of his own, let's just say, the hype was real.\n\nI'm glad to say that my faith was not misplaced. The game's art style and music are top-notch, as to be expected from Mr. Taranto and Co. Perhaps more importantly, however, the game is incredibly well designed.\n\nIt's one of those games that's easy enough to beat, if all you want to just to rush to the end (aside from the last couple of levels). But for those wanting to see everything Tadpole Treble has to offer, it's got just the right amount of challenge for old salts like me. It's like the lovechild of Audiosurf and the musical sections from Rayman Legends, and it nails the blend perfectly.\n\nHave I mentioned the grin I was wearing from beginning to end? The game has TONS of character, and even more heart. It's clear that this was a labour of love, and love is the operative word here. Charm oozes out from every pore, the artstyle is adorable (as to be expected from the hand that brought us Brawl in the Family, one of the best gaming comics of all time and easily THE best family friendly one)\n\nIf there's any complaint I have so far, it's that, occasionally, the screen comes across as a bit \"busy.\" With notes to avoid, bubbles and health to grab, stage specific obstacles to navigate, and often some other sorts of things to keep an eye on, it can be a little difficult to keep track of it all. It's also a bit short-- clearing it will only take a bit over an hour, though completionists will have a field day and the level editor should help it last longer.\n\nTadpole Treble is a great game in its own right, but as a first foray by an independant studio, it's absolutely fantastic. BitFinity is going to be a studio to keep an eye on in future years, and I, for one, am looking forward to every step they take.", "timestamp_created": 1462823373, "timestamp_updated": 1462827324, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22884551": {"recommendationid": "22884551", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001383621", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 68, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472887224}, "language": "english", "review": "So let me preface this by saying I'm not very good at things that require quick reflexes.\n\nThis game is fun.

Every little detail of this game has obviously been carefully hand-crafted, and you'll find little tidbits of style to enjoy all throughout Baton's adventure. (If you're not aware, one of the primary developers of this game is Matthew Taranto, creator of the webcomic Brawl in the Family, and the style of that comic has very much carried over into this game.) I found myself smiling at little details like how Baton's facial expressions would change in response to events in the level around her, or little moments of synergy between the level design and the music. \n\nThe music deserves special attention, as it's one of the primary focuses of the game. I personally highly enjoyed the soundtrack throughout - I never had the impression that a song, or even part of a song, had been composed as filler, sound to fill a space where it seemed sound should go. Note that this is not the typical electronic-music heavy material you tend to get from music games on Steam. I would actually peg this as closest to high-quality children's music, not unlike the music of old Disney films or one of Sandra Boynton's albums.\n\nTadple Treble is short, but offers considerable replay value - and it's in that replay value that the gameplay is at its best. Your initial runthrough of the game's 12 stages will likely take you a little over an hour. Most of my deaths on my first playthrough came from an unusually punishing scenario involving shaking off a pack of piranhas - otherwise, simply completing the game usually just requires staying out of the way of obstacles. The interesting challenges come when the game requires you to start taking risks to meet more completionist-style goals.\n\nIt should be noted that Tadpole Treble is Bitfinity's first game, and it ocasionally shows in small rough patches - an occasional not-quite-intuitive menu, or a loading screen where it seems odd that the game should need one. Composition mode probably shows this most clearly, with understandable but less-than-ideal limitations to sharing levels, and controls that work well enough but fall a little bit short of a smooth level/music-creating experience. Overall, however, these issues are small, and shouldn't dissuade anyone interested in buying. \n\nLong story short, if you were a fan of Brawl in the Family, enjoy music games, or even just think the screenshots look appealing, Tadbole Treble comes highly recommended.", "timestamp_created": 1462662964, "timestamp_updated": 1462662964, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22852081": {"recommendationid": "22852081", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061613423", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 575, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477829800}, "language": "english", "review": "I wrote this review to tell you the truth about this game.

It's full of personality, the characters are adorable and hillarious in turn, and the soundtrack would be amazing even on its own. (Thunder Creek is my new favorite song.) The Treble Charge mechanic is tricky to pull off, especially in the faster paced songs near the end, but it's very rewarding to be able to plow through everything that's giving you a hard time. The final boss battle is a joy to behold, if a little confusing your first few attempts. The art and musing being from the genius who gave us Brawl in the Family is just the icing on the cake!\n\nSadly, it's not without a few flaws. Despite the obvious amounts of polish that went into this game, there are a few bugs that can't be eaten by Etude. Firstly, I noticed a few times that a cymbal would project a location, only to send me a half-step just above or below where it was listed. In a game where positioning is everything, this can very easily wreck a run of a song. In Piranah Jungle, this happens consistantly on the second cymbal, completely preventing you from grabbing all the bubbles! This needs to be fixed ASAP! Also, I noticed occasionally while talking to Etude that his text would bug out and skip a line of dialog. This isn't too bad, as that option is just there for fun and flavor, but it is frustrating to miss the setup to a punchline.\n\nAnother little detail is that it can be somewhat tiresome on the later songs to sit through their intros whenever you have to restart, due to missing one lousy bubble. That's more a problem with trying to be perfect in rythm games in general, though, and the songs are so good, It's not like it's a chore to get to hear more of them.\n\nOverall, definitely worth the money.

Each stage has some other animals and marine life that you interact with in some way, save for a couple, and even though everything except Baton really only shows up in one stage, everything is so expressive that you can get a full feeling of each of their characters. However, I should note that the game itself is fairly short, at 12 songs long.

That's all I have to say.\n\nA little bit of backstory: I was reading BITF (Brawl in the Family) almost every day since around #100 when I heard that Matthew (the developer of the game and comic) was making a game, I was really hyped for it. I waited a long time, some people criticized him for taking so long but I waited patiently. The wait was worth it.\n\nThen I got an email from Steam, the message was clear. Tadpole Treble was out. Instantly bought it and started playing it. The game seems pretty short but is really fun (and challenging), but I'm planning to complete it.\n\nWhen you open up the menu you see Story, Composition, Extras, and everything else you'd expect on a menu.\nStory is, well the story mode. Short but fun (I haven't quite finished it yet).\nExtras, I haven't checked them yet to see if I've unlocked anything\nAnd Composition mode, a mode where you can make your own stages using almost everything in the game. Currently I'm working on some songs to have for friends or when steam workshop support comes out (I wouldn't be surprised if they added it). The song I'm working on now is the original Legend of Zelda Dungeon Theme. It's going really smoothly, the UI for composition mode is very simple and easy to use.\n\nI highly recommend this game to music lovers, BITF lovers, or just about anyone.\nThe game is currently on Steam and Wii U.

Each world encompasses a completely different genre and theme that throws a new challenge at you keeping each level fresh even though the gameplay is simplistic. Backwards levels, giant turtles, angry piranhas; I\u2019m hard pressed to find even a single level that is the same as another.  But what really separates the levels is the music. Almost every song in the game is of some of the best written music I have seen in an indie game. Most of the songs are extremely memorable, so much so that I\u2019ve actually downloaded a few of my favorites for personal listening. My only real issue is that the composition mode could be more user friendly, but gameplay wise for 10$ the game is definitely worth a play.\n\n[h1]EXTRA NOTE:[/h1] Game was provided by the developer solely for review purposes with no compensation or incentive to give a positive review.

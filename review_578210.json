An automatic reloading would not be bad either.\nPartly hordes of enemies came running towards me, so I had no chance, because I had to reload or lost the weapon.\nThe escape is sometimes difficult in the rush. Coverage options are few.\nPartly it is very dark - without a flashlight no chance.\nPlease build bright, exciting levels (like AS), I've seen good ideas to make the Gameflow different. It does not always have to be dark.\nI'm looking forward to the further development of the story and greet the developers.", "timestamp_created": 1515957610, "timestamp_updated": 1515962169, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39340975": {"recommendationid": "39340975", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006791429", "num_games_owned": 606, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 125, "last_played": 1515940249}, "language": "english", "review": "Disclaimer: Early Access Review! Subject to change as the game gets more polished.\n\nAllow me to start by saying that [i]A-Tech Cybernetic (ATC)[/i] is a worthy opponent for [i]DOOM VFR[/i], and I have played the hell out (pun intended) of the latter. For being an Early Access VR title, [i]ATC[/i] showcases a pretty polished experience in every single one of its gameplay elements and being the devs so responsive about their community feedback could make this title stand out among the very best of VR.\n\n[i]A-Tech Cybernetic[/i] puts you inside the body of a former scientist, and I mean that in a literal way. You will posess him, and he will complain about it being your \"conscience\", a voice in your head that will give you advice about your surroundings along with a balanced mix of complaints, humour, sarcasm, lore explanations, and sometimes 4th wall-breaking comments. Your objective is clear: Escape from the A-Tech facilities alive.\n\nGameplay-wise, this game is reminiscent of how [i]Doom 3[/i] should be if it gets a VR remake. [i]Doom VFR[/i] is a frenetic gun & run experience, something that [i]ATC[/i] is not, and I like it because of that. [i]A-Tech Cybernetic[/i] offers a slower pace version of its counterpart, where not every single room has to be a combat area. Also, [i]ATC[/i] features a set of jumpscares and unsettling moments that will give you goosebumps at certain times. As I wrote before, it is an atmospheric horror shooter, much like how the original [i]Doom 3[/i] was conceived.\n\n[i]ATC[/i] also features a nice set of different enemies and weapons. Each enemy has an attack pattern that you should learn in order to escape an ambush or a massive attack. Also, you will have a versatile arsenal that will make your life easier if you manage your ammo. Should you get a second gun because you have a lot of ammo, or maybe you will risk to take up a machine gun, despite its high-consumption bullet rate? Strategy is something to take in account inside a facility that is crawling up with monsters that want to eat your brains out.\n\nGraphics are gorgeous, even in their current state. Lightning and particle effects, combined with high-quality meshes and animations, achieve a futuristic, yet opresive atmosphere. Something that, for an Early Access title, is not an easy task.\n\nThe sound quality is also pretty good. The ambience music and the environmental effects perfectly fit the dark sci-fi mood of the game, and I have to confess that I found myself turning around more than a few times because of hearing something at my back.\n\nVR-related, it features both teleporting and a locomotion system using one of the trackpads. You can holster two weapons and take another two with you in each one of your hands, although you will have to drop one momentarily to pick up any other item. To reload, you just have to move your weapons to the ammo belt, making it a fast and intuitive way of managing your magazines. [i]A-Tech Cybernetic[/i] features close combat techniques and weapons, wheter hitting an enemy with your bare fists or with a metal bar is just a matter of choice. Finally, it also allows to launch grenades by picking up one, pulling out its ring and throwing it away, releasing a big ka-boom that might save your life if you ran out of ammo.\n\nI totally recommend this game for its current price, even being in Early Access. I am eager to see what the devs have in storage for us at the A-Tech facilities, because everything I have seen so far looks promising.", "timestamp_created": 1515943238, "timestamp_updated": 1515948571, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39328149": {"recommendationid": "39328149", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021766012", "num_games_owned": 258, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 44, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 44, "last_played": 1515897894}, "language": "english", "review": "\ud83d\udca9Man, Doom Who ?

(Early Access)\n\nA narrative-driven full locomotion/teleportation shooter available on Steam VR for the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive.\n\nGreat voice acting.\nGreat asset/character design.\nAwesome graphics.\n\nLove the concept \u2013 trapped in the Antagonist\u2019s head.\n\nThe mild tongue-in-cheek humor brings balance to the scarier, more intense moments of the game.\n\nThe \u201cvoice\u201d assists with the current mission, directing the player in a humorous/aggressive manner.\n\nNavigate through a map, directed by a voice in my mind (or vice-versa, lol).\n\nEncounter a barrier of some sort, get directed by the \u201cvoice\u201d, fight monsters on the path, encounter a terminal and enter a puzzle mini-game, then proceed down the route to the next barrier.\n\nLooting is a vaguely strong dynamic in the game, as ammo and life can be an issue.\n\nYou must actively holster your weapons, and will lose your weapon if you drop it and walk away.\n\nYou can directly pick up, or \u201cforce-grab\u201d ammo, health, armor, and weapons.\n\nYou drop these items into your waist and leg holsters.\n\nCombat involves melee and ranged \u2013 no scopes, sticking to iron-sights on the weapons.\n\nI encountered an iron pipe, crowbar, shotgun, pistol, machine-gun, grenade, and \u201cdark\u201d variants of a few weapons. Time slowed down twice during my gameplay, but both times were narrative driven, activated by the voice in my head. There is no way to directly slow down time. It would be nice to do this as a power, perhaps.\n\nYou find yourself moving around a level, picking up ammo, finding and holstering appropriate weapons, and looking for keycards. The design on the key-cards is pretty cool.\n\nThere are scary and intense moments as enemy numbers can get overwhelming, or the area can get pitch black. The sound of a door closing is the spookiest thing in the world.\n\nThe game feels like a futuristic house-of-the-dead mixed with Doom.\n\nFeatures a Mission mode and \u201cSwarm\u201d (wave) mode.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\nOverall, I recommend this game - it has a great creepy vibe highlighted by the narration to balance things out. I love the graphics and the theme of the entire environment. A very visceral journey into the bowels of some un-godly facility. I look forward to updates as they come, as the game is still in Early Access. Can't wait to master this game!\n\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/videos/217671834", "timestamp_created": 1515751197, "timestamp_updated": 1516200059, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39256591": {"recommendationid": "39256591", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983689849", "num_games_owned": 363, "num_reviews": 102, "playtime_forever": 64, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514872778}, "language": "english", "review": "A solid, and creepy, story based FPS that felt more Doom like than Doom in some parts. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/GDCrLgSFaS8\n\nA-Tech Cybernetic starts you off with a Solid tutorial that runs down the basics of the game. Not much to say here. It did its job.\n\nReloading mechanics were not as in depth as I was expecting however the combat was fairly arcadey. More Raw Data than Onward or H3vr. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, just some of the wording had my expectations set differently.\n\nA-Tech Cybernetic uses both Teleport and Trackpad locomotion. Teleport feels a bit more like a way to climb over obstacles than a standard locomotion option however I didn't try to play pure teleporter. I do like both options available at all times though as there are situations where a good teleport can be extremely convenient or life saving.\n\nUnfortunately waggling seems to be at least partially effective with melee weapons however the number of enemies and the number of ammo drops you get make this somewhat of a moot point. Also, while I can technically waggle and do damage, a full bodied swing carries a lot more force with it. Enoug to lift enemies off their feet and send them flying. So while you CAN do it, you're not really rewarded for it. This seems acceptable to me.\n\nThe light play in spots was really well done and I would have liked to see more of this used. Dark tunnels and glowing eyes make for some creepy firefights.\n\nOverall the atmosphere of the game was very creepy and had me jumping at every closing door sound. Even managing to legitimately scare me when the teleporters showed up. I don't jump easily so props to the designer who placed that surprise there.\n\nI loved the voice acting and by that I mean I hated the guy stuck in my head. Which as far as I'm concerned is how you're supposed to feel about the guy so great job there.\n\nMy biggest complaint/request is that: Holsters need haptic feedback to inform you that you've placed your weapon in the appropriate slot for holstering your weapon. Too many times did I drop my weapon to the floor when i thought I should have holstered it. A simple, on enter volume, vibrate for a half second line of code would go a huge way towards QoL improvement.\n\nI would have also liked to see a two handed grip for the rifle. Even if it didn't provide a benefit. It just feels better.\n\nWhile very well done, the chapters feel fairly short. The current story content is on the light side at the moment. You're buying into the promise of future free content updates. This has it's pros and cons and depends on your past experiences... You're going to get about an hour and a half to 2 hours give or take depending on how much you rush vs explore. I tend to explore more and want to see all the things. Someone who just wants to rush the game is going to probably be able to clock in around an hour or so. Thus is the risk and drama of EA.\n\nThe swarm mode seems like it could be fun if they added a multiplayer component to it but I don't see myself spending a lot of time in there. I strongly prefer the story content.\n\nUltimately I had a hell of a lot of fun with this game. I can't wait to explore the rest of this story. XReal Games. More please.

Poco dopo aver preso familiarit\u00e0 con il sistema di controllo, che include sia il free movement che il classico teleport, ci ritroveremo di fronte ai primi scontri a fuoco, combattendo contro decine di temibili robot in un contesto a met\u00e0 tra il Terminator di Cameron e il terzo capitolo di Doom.\n\nNonostante il titolo si presenti come un FPS story driven, con mappe di discreta dimensione completamente esplorabili in cui dovremo trovare chiavi e risolvere piccoli enigmi, il cuore del gameplay sta chiaramente nei sopracitati scontri a fuoco. Questi ultimi si rivelano estremamente soddisfacenti grazie ad uno splendido gunplay dato dall\u2019ottima responsivit\u00e0 delle armi, un bell\u2019impianto scenografico ed una fluidit\u00e0 impeccabile, contando soprattutto l\u2019abbondante quantit\u00e0 di elementi contemporaneamente su schermo.\n\nLeggi la recensione completa su [url=https://www.vr-italia.org/a-tech-cybernetic/] VR ITALIA [/url].", "timestamp_created": 1515075466, "timestamp_updated": 1515075466, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563492", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39035650": {"recommendationid": "39035650", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972427569", "num_games_owned": 215, "num_reviews": 85, "playtime_forever": 61, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 16, "last_played": 1516064341}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic!

It's very easy to forget you're just standing / sitting there playing a game. The screenshots above make it look like a balls-to-the-wall action / shooter. They don't really do it justice. The trailers are quite a bit better, but still don't quite capture the feeling of actually playing it. The actual game is a lot creepier and more atmosperic than they would lead you to believe.\nAs far as the game itself, there's a lot of good things that can be said about it. Even the \"zombie\" type enemies are quite a bit more interesting as far as look and animations go. The controls are extremely precise, the guns feel great to use and the game preforms very well.\nIt should also be said that this is exactly what an Early Access game should be. It seems to be in constant, very active development. I guess they've even gone so far as to completely revamp all the voice acting for the story mode, and completely rebuilt large parts of the levels because some people prefer walking to the standard VR teleportation movement. The devs seem very active in the community and very open to suggestions and discussion.\nOverall, I really hope more VR games turn out to be what A-Tech is becoming. If you're on the fence, you really should try the demo. I think there's a good chance you'll end up with the full game, especially considering how low the price is for what you're getting.", "timestamp_created": 1514994507, "timestamp_updated": 1514994507, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39001922": {"recommendationid": "39001922", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202562568", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514963020}, "language": "english", "review": "This is for Doom fans.

Lots of good implementations. Overall feel and immersion is nicely done. With the amount of experiences out there, I have a few things I would personally like to see for me to fully recommend. \n\n\nFull locomotion. It\u2019s almost there! Would love to see an option (keep those who don\u2019t prefer it happy) to turn the right joystick from teleport to full locomotion. When you get rushed it would be nice to be able to pivot with full loco than have to remember to press the buttons for a turn. For me, its an immersion breaker. \nSounds from gunfire feel flat. Voice is yelling in your ear but gun shots seem muffled and unfulfilling. I had to turn down the volume to start with the voice over. Then maxed it out when I fired my first shot to max the sound out but it just wasn\u2019t there. \nBetter use of storage belt. Maybe I would see more in the full version but the storage belt seemed under utilized. I could add ammo to it but I never needed to take anything out. Also, things like a flashlight/grenade would be great to have another spot on the vest to store. I really wanted to carry the flashlight for immersion and to appreciate details of dark areas etc. However, I also wanted two guns and had to drop my flashlight and remember to pick it up when rushed by enemies. I wish I could place it (on my chest maybe) and reach for my guns and then holster my gun to grab it off my chest rather than looking for it where ever I dropped it. Same with picking up ammo. I would have to drop something to grab the ammo and then pick up what I just dropped. It seemed like more of a chore than it should have been. \n\nKudos to the developer(s) though.

The weapon handling is good, except for the missing recoil which makes the guns feel less \"big\". Melee is an option you always have (either using melee weapons or just your fists), but for the most part I just used guns. The locomotion system combines direct locomotion with teleporting allowing you to use both at the same time and it feels great. The only issue is that direct locomotion currently is always relative to your head, not to the controller. There are a few different enemies in A-Tech Cybernetic (I think I've encountered 5 different types of enemies) which is enough for the current 2 chapters, but for further chapters I'd hope for for diverse enemies.\n\nThe story mode is nothing special, but still enjoyable, even though the voice acting is a bit too loud and quickly gets annoying. The levels are built mostly linearly with a few detours for finding the next keycard, but you're never wondering where to go next (also because the direction of your next goal is always visible).\n\nThe biggest issue A-Tech Cybernetic currently has in my opinion is its inventory system. Each ammo pickup needs to be picked up and placed in your inventory manually and you have only two holsters available for the 4 different guns I've seen until now. Taking a shotgun, a rifle and a backup pistol with you just about works with two holsters and a hand, because you always need a free hand for picking up ammo and interacting with things. Dual-wielding the same gun is nearly impossible because there's not enough ammo to use only one weapon type and thus you need the inventory space for backup weapons. Melee weapons and grenades can't be holstered/stored in any way, so you're not going to be able to effectively take them very far when finding them.\n\nA-Tech Cybernetic is still in Early Access and it shows, but the developer is pretty active and the issues I've pointed out here are all currently being worked on. More chapters of the story are to come, but even right now for the current 2 chapters I feel like the 15\u20ac pricetag is definitely reasonable.", "timestamp_created": 1514316272, "timestamp_updated": 1514316272, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38697599": {"recommendationid": "38697599", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122849392", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 81, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514863032}, "language": "french", "review": "si vous aimer doom 3 ,  vous aimerez A-Tech cybernetic ,jolie et tres bien optimisee (pas de resolution dynamique ) il est aussi sympas que fear effect 2 ou doom mais avec un soup\u00e7on de frayeur par moment car vous serez parfois surpris ,il possede sa propre aventure qui est ajoutee au fur et amesure des mises a jour qui ajoutes des missions du scenario ,3 niveaux de difficultee ,le mode swarm ou on extermine les vagues successive a la maniere du mod zomby de call of duty , et a un prix tres bon vu la qualite du jeux ,les dev sont douees .pour voir ma video du test : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCagRv3bPFbY3ljfnIy4iARg", "timestamp_created": 1514296811, "timestamp_updated": 1514296811, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38645143": {"recommendationid": "38645143", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038714319", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514173592}, "language": "english", "review": "i now have over 2 hours playing A-tech. so,..i thought it would be a good time to write an early review.\nthere are some things you need to know about this game. first off at this point if you are expecting a complete polished product...well this isnt it....Dont get me wrong this is a good game..the level design is topnotch...the monsters look great..the weapon modles are near perfect..the locomotion gives you both walking and teleporting in an excelent format using one hand to walk and the other to teleport...they set the mood of the game using first class skill...and i cant recomend  getting in on a project of this caliber enough..as early as you can for 2 reasons first is to fund the development...the dev teem working on this game is world class and it shows in their work..the second reason is you will end up with a AAA title for durt cheep in the end.\nI am running an I7 2700k (OC to 5ghz) ..an invidia GTX 1080 founders {OC +100mhz) and 32GB DDR3 @ 1600mhz with a raid-0 hdd array {2 x 7200rpm)\nthe game loads quickly runs smoothly ..and doesnt tax any of my system resources more than 60% on max settings so it would probably run fine on a gtx 970.\nwith all that there are some bad things about the game...the holsters are easy to miss..the health bar would be better if it was lower on the hud or even movable..and the voice acting is sub par but starting to grow on me..also grenades dont belong in your holster lol..so yes the good far out shines the bad...and the game is still in development so some of this may change..(for the better)...so yes i recomend this to evryone looking to get in on the next AAA title because this is it.", "timestamp_created": 1514175800, "timestamp_updated": 1514175800, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38625807": {"recommendationid": "38625807", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972090300", "num_games_owned": 987, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 78, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514146670}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow...

Here at VR Galaxy we were granted the opportunity to play and review this game for Free. We though this game was a total blast and a lot of fun. You can tell that the developers put in a lot of time and hard work to create the environments and make the atmosphere feel spooky and tense. You really feel like you are on a Outpost or base in deep space or on another planet. The lighting, textures and sound design are all top notch. The enemies are creepy and they run fast. There is a nice variety of weapons to choose from, including a pistol, assault rifle, shotgun, special weapon, grenades, etc. I like how there is smooth locomotion and teleportation support, so people who are prone to motion sickness can still enjoy this game, but those who can use locomotion feel more immersed. Right now there are 2 chapters to the game and a Horde mode. We played most of the 2 chapters, pretty close to the end. This game offers a lot of fast action and immersion and does a great job of keeping you entertained and on the edge of your seat....even though you're standing! There are a few things that we would like to see chnaged or added into the game. We would like to see a faster speed of locomotion movement, because when there are a lot of enemies chasing you, they can catch you too easily, especially if you run out of ammo. Speaking of ammo, we would like to see more ammo placed around the levels. Often times, it feels like you don't have enough ammo and you just die, because you are overwhelmed by so many enemies all at once. You might want to space out the enemies a little more. At times it feels like there are no enemies in some places and then there are a ton, all at once. Also, the big doors always close on you after you press the button to open them. They seem to be glitchy and enemies sometimes get stuck in the environments and \"clip\" out. Overall, these are minor issues and we would highly recommend this game.

It's a bit linear, in that aside from going up and down a flight of stairs, everything seems to take place ona level floor (kind of like Doom 1 & 2).  Having the ability to shoot from a different floor than what the mutants are on would be a welcome change.\nThe controls are very decent as it mixes both locomotion and teleportation. What the controls lack (for myself) is the ability to smooth turm (instead you press buttons to rotate in 45 degree increments).\nThe weapons, although pretty to look at, lack any 'oompf' to them; it just has no recoil/kickback to make you feel like  your handling a weapon that allows you you to go medievil on a mutant.  Whether you use the pistol or pulse rifle, it feels exactly  ther same.\nMelee weapons (pipe, crowbar) are as lethal as the guns, which should not be the case.  There were a couple of hordes to where only a crowbar was needed to get the job done.  The game also has grenades you can use, but I could not find a way to store them to use later, I just left them on the floor (the crowbar kicks butt).\nOverall, the default difficulty is very easy.  Only a couple of times did I take some damage, and at no time did I really feel threatened.  It took me around an hour to get through the level.\nWhile it seems all I've done is gripe, the overall presentation is solid, and I want to give the developer a chance with Chapter 2, before rendering a final verdict.

The devs have turned things around and we've got a very solid game building here. The graphics have been improved with more varied room designs and furnishings and excellent lighting. Flashlights now illuminate correctly and melee combat provide more damage.\n\nAfter replaying from the start I can tell the revised chapter 1 is an overhauled version of the previous design and it plays much better than before. And the new story does a good job at motivating you through the levels. I really enjoyed playing to the end of chapter 2, though I haven't managed to get past the epic fight at the end of this chapter which I'm finding pretty intense.\n\nI've changed my opinion to a thumbs up and now feel I'm getting a proper game for my money and definately looking forward to the next chapter.\n\nOld review:\n5.4 out of 10\n\nUpdated EA review, chapter 1 story mode:\nI've just completed the first chapter; indeed the only available chapter of the story mode as now. It's okay, not great in any respect. The environment is corridors, rooms, locked doors and cyber zombie hordes. Find the keycards to unlock doors to rooms, then find the next keycard, etc... While fending off the enemy along the way. There is a story, which you get an introduction to partway through the chapter.\n\nSo far nothing to blow your socks off, the level design is average, average visuals, average combat. And the story backdrop, well that's average too, backed up with average voice acting. No major bugs, some cyber zombie pathfinding stuttering when a group of enemy run into each other or the environment. The melee combat feels weak, but you'll generally avoid that as much as possible. Flashlights are useless, they illuminate nothing at all.\n\nI'm somewhat disapointed having previous high hopes of the potential before the first chapter arrived. The game has underdelivered, all the parts fundamentially work but all those parts feel just passible and lazily combined with just the most basic level of effort.\n\nWhat a shame!\n\nOldest review:\nMy EA impression is that the overall presentation, graphics and gunplay is outstanding. The game is gorgeous, however the actual meat of the content is lacklustre at this point in time as it's missing the real reason to play this game which is the story mode. As of now it just contains the wave based survival mode, and it's mearly passable. It's a worthwhile element to flesh out a VR shooter which has a story mode, but it just feels like a secondary element rather that the reason to own this game. The wave action is bland, it's challanging but repetitive, and certainly boosted by the exellent visuals.\n\nI picked this up when the price was reduced, which at least is more fair to match the content included right now. The promised roadmap from the developers is interesting and this 'could' be a must have title if the finished product lives up the potential you can already experience in the game so far.\n\nNot recommending now based on the actual playable content available, but will revise my review when we get the complete game.", "timestamp_created": 1494777471, "timestamp_updated": 1513548149, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553823", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31648023": {"recommendationid": "31648023", "author": {"steamid": "76561198293324932", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 343, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514490094}, "language": "english", "review": "Definitely the game to get for the vive.\n\nExtremely fun to play, jam packed action and enemies from all directions.\n\nDespite being a wave-shooter I never felt like it, because I was immersed in a total action-horror world.", "timestamp_created": 1494342649, "timestamp_updated": 1494342649, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31582138": {"recommendationid": "31582138", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044896484", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 291, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494083700}, "language": "english", "review": "Currently it's like the good old Call of Duty zombie mode (not the crap new ones), just in VR and in Doom-ish style.

I enjoyed the gameplay a lot, and I think this VR title has great potential with future updates adding story-mode, challenges and more content. Check my first gameplay video of A-Tech Cybernetic and you may probably understand:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp9n3edzPDE\nMy thoughts:\nWell yes, so far A-Tech Cybernetic is far from finished as its in an Early Access stage, where only a wave-based mode is available together with a tutorial. But the wave-based mode is quite challenging after a while, and will probably take some skills to complete. There also seems to be a locked level that unlocks when you reach a certain amount of points in first level, I haven't reached so far thou, so I dont know what the locked level is about yet.\n\nAnyway, the developers are promising both more levels as well as a story mode, more weapons and challenges coming up during april-may 2017, so I guess soon we really can see this games real potential. If you want to buy it now, or wait until then - well that's up to you, but I think definitely you should give it a try at some point.\n\nThe graphics are stunning, and environment gives you that DOOM-feeling with good immersion and atmosphere. Bullet time feature is working nicely and adds a lot when the game becomes intense, and it also look quite neat as well! Big plus for the tutorial as well, that is well-made and appreciated by most people I guess, especially people new to VR. The physics seems nice, even thou I think it will be more polished in upcoming updates as well. \n\nAll in all, an entertaining Early Access VR experience that probably gets even better very soon!\n\nThe good stuff:\n+ Graphics are really great - good VR immersion!\n+ Sounds and music fits this game\n+ Good weapon handling and easy to aim\n+ Love the Bullet-time feature\n+ Challenging after a few waves\n+ Running smooth on High settings on GTX 980 Ti\n+ Nice tutorial\n+ Wave based shooter-mode not bad at all!\n\nThe bad/less good stuff:\n- Lacks content (but updates are coming up soon with story-mode etc)\n- No manual reloading with magazines/clips (hopefully added later)\n- Only teleportation movement, free touchpad locomotion would have been nice\n- The price for the content

Not enof screaming from dying comrades. btw -no dying comrades for now.\n\nDeveloper is still here. \n\nNot scary. (personal opinion)\n\nFirst good VR horde shooter, Really makes you swing your arms. \n\nIt nails DooM atmosphere, of lonely, hopeless, metal corridors, filled with blood and guts of your victims.\nNo one there for you. \nThis futuristic hell, is now your life. Enjoy.\n\n(But all aside, it feels like KillingFloor had a baby with DooM.  )", "timestamp_created": 1516565585, "timestamp_updated": 1516565585, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505495", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39519019": {"recommendationid": "39519019", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053575547", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 26, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 26, "last_played": 1516560920}, "language": "english", "review": "Some feedback. I hope it may be valuable and can help make game better:\n\n1. Sometimes hard to holster a weapon, very easy to miss and drop the gun to the floor (larger hit area for the holster?) The same about reloading.\n2. Hard to look down at holster to actually see whats inside (yes, there is also an icon in a hud, but the weapon should be observable in a holster too)\n3. The very first level looks to dark with no reason. I am not talking about really dark areas where you have to use flashlight, but about regular rooms. They may look and play better if made out of light colors. And overall darkness does not makes game more scary (if that is the case).\n4. Shooting a pistol does not requires actual aiming??? Was pointing the gun very losely towards mosters and still get consistant hits.\n5. The game design as a whole feels outdated: going back and forth for keys is very demotivating. It may be OK to get one key to open one door at some point, but N keys in a row??! It is not 1993 - by today's standards it feels very dumb. It destroys the feel of progress and achievement. Ambushes and jump scares are not very good too. After a couple of times they just stop working on player: you see a corridor with doors and instantly know there will be an ambush. Very predictable. IMHO it is better push \"shooter\" aspect of the game, not \"horror\": it already got a lot of enemies and envolves a lot of combat - it is a shooter in a first place.\n6. The feedback of shooting the gun and killing the monsters is not very good: the sound of shooting is not \"crunchy\" and not loud, the impacts on monsters gives very basic feedback and no noticiable satisfaction. And this is not a small detail - this is one of a core part of fun in a shooter games!\n7. Melee weapon: wish there will be some indication the monster is knocked down, but still alive. For now it looks like it falls dead, but it is not. The knockdown mechanics itself is quastionable too.\n8. One click to grab item and one more to finally collect? It feels excessive and does not adds fun. Yet the ability to grab from a distance is awesome!\n\nI personally wish more open spaces, more situations when enemies walks from one side. There still can be ambushes and jump scares and they will work much better, if NOT happens in a row.

You have transportation and locomotion movement to choose from which is more than some other games already released are doing. The story starts off somewhat cheesy, but it picks up and I feel like it delivers on a better stand alone story than even VFR did and I haven't had any of the technical issues I had with VFR either. The only issue I had were with the weapon holsters movinng with the headset and the dev already said they are working on fixing it. \n\nI'm looking forward to see how far this one goes, its good to see more good games developed for VR!", "timestamp_created": 1516640626, "timestamp_updated": 1516640626, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 80, "total_negative": 2, "total_reviews": 82}}

If so, well, then this is the game for you.\n\nHarvester tells the story of Steve, a young man who wakes up in a surreal 1950's town with no memory of who he is or where he is. Such mystery! As Steve is guided through the town of Harvest, he slowly uncovers the dark and dastardly forces at work and how he's involved with all of it...\n\nIn case the trailer didn't clue you in, and if you've never heard of this game before, Harvester is notorious for its violent content. But straight up, this game is no where near as shocking as it was when it came out in the 90's. The special effects in the cutscenes range from passable 80's practial effects to Microsoft paint doodles. And the violence is the focal selling point of Harvest because it really doesn't have much else going for it. \n\nEver play a point and click before? Then you've played this. If not, you point, you click, things happen. The problem with this - and especially with Harvester - is that oftentimes the things you need to interact with are so miniscule, so tiny on the screen, that it becomes almost impossible to know what to do next. It doesn't help that because 90% of the visuals in Harvester are super grainy and pixelated; trying to find key items or objects to interact with in the environments becomes extremely difficult. But as you manage to find things and use them you'll learn that 75% of Harvester is just that: clicking on stuff. There aren't any real puzzles, the little combat it has is stiff and unfair, and most of the game takes place in the same few screens. \n\nSo why am I recommending it? Because if you play it with a guide (which I did), you can strap yourself in for a wacky ride. The content is graphic, but stupid and over the top. It's a satire/commentary on the rise of graphic violence in pop culture that dominated the 90's. If something could go from 0-10 in a second, Harvester takes it to 11. The actual story itself kept my interest enough to see where it would go and the ending was stupidly satisfying. I can't reiterate this enough: play this with a guide. No shame. It's not that long, it's dated, but it offers goofy thrills if you're willing to give it some leeway.", "timestamp_created": 1518469248, "timestamp_updated": 1518469248, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39944003": {"recommendationid": "39944003", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983378241", "num_games_owned": 1873, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 453, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518328406}, "language": "english", "review": "The \"Troll 2\" of 90s adventure games!", "timestamp_created": 1518143134, "timestamp_updated": 1518143134, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39754980": {"recommendationid": "39754980", "author": {"steamid": "76561198799795654", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516771011}, "language": "english", "review": "That gum you like is going to come back in style.", "timestamp_created": 1517430801, "timestamp_updated": 1517430801, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39698677": {"recommendationid": "39698677", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143490250", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 533, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517550589}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best games i've ever played.

I didn\u2019t have many expectations, other than hearing that the game was extremely gory, disgusting, and funny. Seeing as all of these things appeal to me (and it was relatively cheap), I decided to give it a go.\n\nRight off the bat, I warn that this game is NOT for everyone, in fact, I believe a lot of people will hate this game. It is very retro (at times outdated), time-consuming, the puzzles are sometimes ridiculously complex, and this game can be downright frustrating (e.g. I started playing  the game, got an hour deep into it, died, and Oh-Silly-Modern-Convenienced-Me, forgot that AUTOSAVE did not exist in the 90s, and was brought back to the very beginning of the game). All that being said, however, I absolutely loved this game.\n\nIts vintage graphics have a lovable charm, the FMVs were outrageously fun, the dialogue was humorous (and sometimes surprisingly deep), and overall I enjoyed playing. Even when I was cursing in frustration. The shock value gore was, admittedly, not as \u201cdisgusting\u201d as I was expecting, but was still good fun and good for a laugh. I found rather than the gore being disturbing, sometimes the atmosphere and content was the more unsettling of the two.\n\nAs for the puzzles, I am not a \u201cgamer\u201d, I am not seasoned in virtual puzzles, and quite frankly, I was lost very early on. When I played with a friend who DOES consider himself a gamer, he was also lost. But! Do not fear, a walkthrough exists on the internet and helped immensely.\n\nOverall, this game is now one of my favourites and I make a point to play others of the \u201c90s point \u2018n\u2019 click horror\u201d genre.

Movies that used color and sound to express new feelings and ideas, music that used synthesizers to push boundries. When games get new technology they don't know what to do with, you get Harvester. Harvester is half Point-and-click FMV Madness and half side scrolling beat-em-up with even more madness. It's what happens when you write a game story after marathoning the entire first season of the Twilight Zone while high on ketamine.\n\nThe story is probably the most entertaining part of the game, as it does attempt to gently ease you in to the mania of Harvester. Your name is Steve, you've awoken in the town of Harvest, you have one week to join the mysterious Lodge. The whole town of Harvest is like if you let William S. Burroughs write the scripts to Leave It To Beaver, it's 50's America with a bag of dark twists thrown on it for good measure. The town has a missile base run by a batshit Air Force General who rigged the launch control to a literal big red button, there's a mysteriously large amount of random hobo deaths and of course, the Lodge that you have to get into.\n\nGameplay is a 50/50 split between the story's main arcs. The first half is a stock standard point-and-click game where you can either do the story missions or google all the weird conversation trees you can start. And that's not even counting how weird some of the actual trees you use to get items are. I highly reccomend you get a basic walkthrough for the early half because the puzzles the game throws at you are some of the most obtuse I've seen in a game. The other half is a broken and yet still entertaining beat-em-up as Steve navigates the Lodge. How entertaining? It's where you fight bellhops, walking pieces of ancient art, chess pieces and yourself. Also there are more puzzles, so do keep that walkthrough on standby.\n\nHarvester is like a really entertaining B movie and I have no idea if that's what the devs intended it to be or not. Regardless, I can't help but reccomend this game just because it's entertaining in the depths of its madness. One can't help but laugh as you watch Steve just act so normally in a town that is definitely not in the realm of normal. It's a game where you electrocute a random Italian barber and his pet demonic sheep so you can steal his prized barber's pole, you can inadvertantly cause World War III and global annihalation for accidently talking about llamas, and where you solve a puzzle by beating a guy at chess so an axe falls on his head and reveals a key hidden in his head.

Cheesy FMV graphics, very basic point-and-click controls; what really makes it a great play is the story, characters, and environment. Solid 8/10. Kids, stay in school, eat your vegetables, and save this game for when you're older, mmkay? Maybe stay away from whatever this game's developers were on, too. Weed is good enough.\n\nNow for the full review, let us first address the elephant in the room: this game probably no longer possesses the title of \"the most violent adventure game of all time.\" So if you're like me, a jaded 3dg3l0rd looking to push yourself to disturbing new boundaries and discover just how far you're willing to go, this game probably won't satisfy that perverse itch much. However, I don't consider myself disappointed since the game offers up more than only people bursting like gore-filled balloons when you stab them. (Yeah, just as a heads-up: while this may no longer be the most violent adventure game of all time, it's definitely still not for the kiddies. Unless you were brought up by Charles Manson, in which case: charge forth, young psychopath; this will probably feel right at home to you.)\n\n\"What could possibly be in this game that would cause a reviewer to compare it to the thoughts you have while on questionable substances combined with the acts of a murderous cult leader?\" the 25% of you who wandered onto this Steam page fully blind may ask. Well, I'll do my best to break it down for ye wee few without giving away any spoilers.\n\nFor starters, what's this game about? You play as a man named Steve who wakes up one morning to find that not only has he lost his memory, but home and the people in it are all a little \"off.\" And by \"off,\" I mean that the entire town of Harvest is inhabited by exaggerated 1950's charicatures, each with a rather psychotic and sociopathic edge. As it turns out, Steve only has six days to uncover the mysteries of this surreal little town and find a way to escape back to normal society, all with an ominous-sounding blood drive looming on the seventh day.\n\nThis game is bizarre, to say the least. It does a good job of making sure nothing feels right from the second you enter the world, though I think the lovably outdated FMV style graphics and slightly off-kilter soundtrack do a lot to build the weird atmosphere. It keeps you on your toes and questioning everything, since nothing about this game is predictable if you're a first-time player. It's rather like being in an excessively dark, twisted version of Alice in Wonderland: nothing is logical or makes sense, and the world and its inhabitants follow their own set of senseless rules that endlessly baffle, annoy, and even horrify your main character. Yet, much like Alice in Wonderland it manages to find its own strange balance in that the world is surprisingly well fleshed-out (no pun intended, har har): there are no inconsistencies to the world's logic, or lack thereof, and nobody acts out of character. This, combined with the everyman protagonist, make the kooky environment just grounded enough that you can follow along, while also being wild enough to keep you intrigued.\n\nLike with most FMV games, the performances given by the actors range from patchy to perfect. However, if anything I feel like the uncanny blend of mediocre and semi-professional acting works in this game's favor. These characters are supposed to be strange, sometimes to the point where you begin to question whether or not they're even people, so the unusual behavior is only fitting and helps add to the purposeful unease the game works so hard to instill in you, the player. A lot of the dialogue and cutscenes will make your skin crawl and send a deep discomfort twisting in your belly.\n\nUnfortunately, the playthrough does get a little marred by its dated, simplistic mechanics, particularly in the last third which is oddly combat heavy. Sorry, DigiFX Interactive, but it's just not all that interesting to walk back and forth click-spamming literally two-dimensional baddies. What makes the game so fun, interesting, and unique is interacting with the wacky characters and seeing the effects your actions have on Harvest. Take that away and a little of its charm is simply lost. However, it doesn't render the game unplayable by any means and doesn't serve to dampen much of the experience, so this is more of a nitpick than anything else.\n\nBelieve it or not, this game is actually far smarter than you would expect. Granted, the commentary and message it's trying to get across are somewhat jumbled and hard to interpret, but when you play you can tell that a lot of effort and attention went into making each detail precise and perfect. It's obvious that the people who made it did so with a great deal of loving care, which is something that I feel is rare and precious, particularly in a medium that can make modern Hollywood's oversaturation seem tame by comparison. It's impressive what they managed to accomplish with limited technology and a budget that one imagines was probably less than overly generous.\n\nThe only thing I really have left to say is that this is not for the politically correct at heart. Seriously, if this game was released today, Tumblrarians and hysterical mothers would be out in full-force boycotting any store selling it, burning every copy they could lay their hands on, and marching in neat little circles outside the developers' houses, screaming lynch mob-style threats. In my opinion, this game is broadly offensive to all and doesn't really focus on targeting any one group in particular, so no demographic comes across as hated or particularly contemptuous; rather all are worthy of judgement in their own ways. Speaking as an LGBT+ Tumblrarian who's quite fond of keeping things fairly PC, I honestly admire this balls-to-the-wall, \"0 **** given about your sensitivities\" attitude, and rejoice that this game came out in the 90's when it was more acceptable to call out the flaws in both minority and majority groups alike.\n\nOverall, an intriguing experience, and one that I would highly recommend for the brave, weird-seeking, and strong-stomached among you.", "timestamp_created": 1511812980, "timestamp_updated": 1521149850, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

The conversation method can be rather odd, in that options you initially had, but never follow, will mysteriously disappear. If your memory is good (or you have the foresight to note things down on notepad), you can get back to them later on, but I found myself missing large chunks of conversation because of this.

Eso s\u00ed, a m\u00ed me ha encantado.\n\nEs un point&click en FMV como corresponde a 1994, pero en este caso, por su car\u00e1cter de serie B, ha envejecido bien. Normalmente las producciones de este estilo que eran \u201cserias\u201d ya destilaban un aroma kitsch a los pocos a\u00f1os de su lanzamiento y hoy en d\u00eda son consideradas como algo simplemente rid\u00edculo por la mayor\u00eda de jugadores. Este no es el caso, porque al igual que ocurre con las pel\u00edculas de terror de bajo presupuesto, su cutrez no hace m\u00e1s que darle encanto. Lo mismo pasa con el doblaje. Viene con voces en castellano y ese toque espa\u00f1ol tan noventero con sus limitaciones t\u00e9cnicas, lejos de da\u00f1arlo, lo convierte en un juego m\u00e1s entra\u00f1able.\n\nSe juega como una aventura gr\u00e1fica tradicional y desde el principio puedes recorrer libremente todo el mapa. Es un pueblo con sus calles, casas, establecimientos y un mont\u00f3n de personajes, que si bien no llegan a ser rednecks, son ciudadanos norteamericanos de los a\u00f1os cincuenta tan cortos en su forma de entender el mundo, aficiones y opiniones pol\u00edticas, como s\u00f3rdidos, retorcidos y malas personas. Creo que es mejor no contar nada m\u00e1s sobre ellos ni sobre la historia. Solo dir\u00e9 que cada di\u00e1logo y cada descripci\u00f3n de los objetos son dignos de captura. Tambi\u00e9n tiene escenas de v\u00eddeo bastante potentes, de esas que no se ven en un videojuego.

Si fuera un periodista de videojuegos gafapaster de la nueva ola, os dir\u00eda que es un ensayo filos\u00f3fico sobre la violencia y los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n y sus influencias en la sociedad norteamericana de los a\u00f1os noventa, ampliando su cr\u00edtica a la pol\u00edtica, la educaci\u00f3n y las tradiciones culturales y familiares.

Sin embargo, jam\u00e1s hubiese imaginado que lo que vivi\u00f3 en su pesadilla fue sin duda m\u00e1s agradable que la realidad que tendr\u00eda que enfrentar. No pasa mucho hasta que nos damos cuenta de que vivimos con una extra\u00f1a familia en un pueblo llamado Harvest (que parece un calco del lado oscuro de Twin Peaks), y que para colmo tenemos amnesia y no recordamos qui\u00e9n somos ni d\u00f3nde estamos. Por si fuese poco, todo el pueblo parece haber complotado para tomarnos el pelo. Todos excepto la hija de nuestros vecinos, quien adem\u00e1s es nuestra futura esposa y tambi\u00e9n sufre de amnesia. \u00bfQu\u00e9 hacer ante tal situaci\u00f3n? Todas las respuestas parecen estar en la logia, una extra\u00f1a organizaci\u00f3n local a la que los pueblerinos parecen guardarle una fascinaci\u00f3n irracional. A consecuencia, nuestro objetivo ser\u00e1 unirnos como sea. El precio a pagar ser\u00e1 alto. \n\nY luego de la intro llega el momento de poner manos a la obra. Se nos presenta una interfaz point & click de lo m\u00e1s usual. Podremos mover el puntero e interactuar con los escenarios para mover al personaje a un punto particular o para activar puntos sensibles. Lo que no es tan corriente aqu\u00ed es que no se nos permite inspeccionar los objetos del inventario como en casi cualquier aventura. Pero curiosamente desde este men\u00fa si se nos trasmite el estado de salud del protagonista \u00bfC\u00f3mo? Si, Harvester incluye secuencias arcade donde el combate es crucial y nuestro protagonista puede morir. A diferencia de otros juegos del g\u00e9nero, este no recurre a puzles complejos para aumentar su dificultad; m\u00e1s bien lo hace a trav\u00e9s de su no-linealidad, la repetici\u00f3n de acciones impensadas y la posibilidad de morir. \n\nEl resto de sus elementos jugables son m\u00e1s cl\u00e1sicos. Dispondremos de un mapa de todo el pueblo que nos indicar\u00e1 el lugar al que nos podemos dirigir. Visitaremos as\u00ed distintas tiendas, edificios administrativos y las residencias de los pueblerinos. El interactuar con otros personajes dar\u00e1 lugar a di\u00e1logos de m\u00faltiples opciones. Los temas disponibles para abordar y las respuestas que proporcionen los interlocutores cambiar\u00e1n de forma din\u00e1mica dependiendo de cuando hables con ellos. De todas formas, me veo obligada a citar un punto molesto de estas conversaciones: se hace muy f\u00e1cil perdernos partes de las charlas ya que una vez seleccionado un tema de conversaci\u00f3n, los dem\u00e1s temas no aparecer\u00e1n nuevamente a menos que el escogido se relacione con los dem\u00e1s. El mismo juego ofrece una soluci\u00f3n a esto y es la de dejarnos tipear el nombre del tema del que queremos dialogar en un espacio de la interfaz de di\u00e1logo. Se agradece la opci\u00f3n pero no puedo dejar de considerarla innecesaria y rebuscada. Al fin y al cabo se hace bastante molesto andar recordando o adivinando sobre qu\u00e9 temas quiere hablar tal personaje. \n\nA pesar de ser un poco retorcido en mec\u00e1nicas jugables, su argumento es lo suficientemente interesante e inteligente como para querer seguir jug\u00e1ndolo en todo momento. Incluso hoy en d\u00eda, casi veinte a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s de su lanzamiento, sigue sorprendiendo y divirtiendo por igual. \u00bfC\u00f3mo lo logra? Gracias a estar construido como una cr\u00edtica abierta a la violencia en sociedad; una parodia c\u00ednica y sin escr\u00fapulos que nos confirma que la forma elegida por muchos para responder a la violencia es con m\u00e1s violencia. Tanto el gui\u00f3n como la construcci\u00f3n de los personajes se desarrollan de forma tal que sirven a dicha cr\u00edtica en todo momento.Por consiguiente, casi cualquier elemento narrativo del t\u00edtulo resultar\u00e1 chocante y hasta ofensivo para casi cualquier ser humano civilizado. Encontraremos decenas de di\u00e1logos sobre los que ser\u00e1 imposible no pensar \"\u00bfRealmente acaban de decir eso?\" y ni hablar de las situaciones planteadas: todas una s\u00e1tira en si mismas. De todas formas, quiero aclarar que su enfoque principal es humor\u00edstico. Es crudo y negro como pocos videojuegos, pero no deja de ser un entretenimiento en ning\u00fan momento por lo que quienes disfruten de un humor m\u00e1s negro, adem\u00e1s de sorprenderse con la inteligencia y el rigor de su gui\u00f3n, realmente se la van a pasar riendo.\n\nEl apartado gr\u00e1fico ya se mostraba atrasado para su \u00e9poca por lo que hoy en d\u00eda habr\u00e1 quienes no puedan verlo con buenos ojos. Se presenta como una suerte de FMV donde las animaciones in-game son m\u00e1s bien precarias y los fondos, a pesar de ser fotorealistas, en muchas ocasiones no exhiben gran nivel de detalle. Por lo tanto, uno debe prepararse para una aventura con mucho pixel-hunting donde muchas veces no ser\u00e1 f\u00e1cil dar con los objetos interactivos.\n\nContrariamente a lo que muchos puedan esperar de \u00e9l, Harvester trae consigo algo m\u00e1s que una dosis de violencia y buen humor negro. Tanto su gui\u00f3n como su jugabilidad son absolutamente divertidos y constituyen un gran soplo de aire fresco, no s\u00f3lo dentro del g\u00e9nero de horror sino adem\u00e1s dentro de la aventura gr\u00e1fica en s\u00ed.

Not because of the gameplay, but the subject matter. This is an adventure game for the first 2/3rd's of it. The game uses FMV videos so you will see very campy acting from human characters, however I think this fits perfectly with the games unsettling tone. The sound is fine, nothing stands out, but nothing bad does either, it's perfectly fine. \n\nThe gameplay starts as a point and click game and a good one. You click to navigate and to pick up and use objects. It has nice puzzles and although it can be hard to know where to go next, the town is small enough that it won't be for long. The last 1/3rd of the game is the stumbling block though, as it focuses on action. It's really bad. It felt too random, like I wasn't in control of the outcome. To be fair some of the best puzzles are in the last parts of the game, I just wish it wasn't bogged down by awful combat. \n\nThe story is the real star here. It was so interesting that I kept going even in the worst parts of the game. Everyone was weird in their own way and I really wanted to know why, as the town gives a weird vibe from the moment you step out of your room. And without spoiling anything the game dives into subject matter that can get...uncomfortable. While the game isn't the goriest ever, it was still hard to get through some of it.

Full Motion Videos were a new thing: the first time I saw them was when playing Command & Conquer. They gave you a movie-like experience (at the time these videos had an extremely low resolution, though). The way it affected the point-and-click adventure game genre was the inclusion of a lot of cutscenes in between stages and regardless of how serious the characters looked they were ultimately acting in a very cheesy way. It was as if you were taking part in a B movie.\n\n[b]\"You killed your family?\"\n\"What of it?\"[/b]\n\nHarvester is on par with games such as Phantasmagoria 1-2 or Dark Seed 1-2. These were all games that tried to look like an interactive movie experience. And while Dark Seed introduced the unique vision of H.R. Giger into the gaming world Phantasmagoria and Harvester showed you something violent, something brutal that nobody had ever seen before. Your protagonist could die in many ways depending on the trap or enemy it faced. These cutscenes always depicted something horrible, something extremely gory. \n\n[b]\"You always were a kidder, Steve!\"[/b]\n\nOur protagonist, Steve, wakes up one day only to find himself in the '50s. He does not recognise the town of Harvest; in fact, he has no idea who the people are in his house. As much as they claim to be his parents or younger brother he has no recollection of them. Amnesia or not, Steve has a big day ahead of him: he is soon to marry Stephanie and just as the future in-laws Steve's parents, too, expect him to join the Lodge. The Lodge is where the Order of the Harvest Moon is found and in order to join them Steve must complete the process of initiation. This consists of several tasks that are, unfortunately, violent things. These initially seem to be just pranks but will soon get out of control.\n\n[b]\"This town won't be the same without DNA's Diner. Or DNA, for that matter!\"[/b]\n\nOnce we leave an establishment the game shows us the map of Harvest. We are free to move anywhere we please. As certain activities are completed the game switches the day-night cycle. It's always worth returning to the same spot to speak with the same people. We can find out how they feel about the things happening in town and each day brings us closer to the Lodge and a truly horrifying, long sequence of gore-fest. During my playthrough the Lodge always reminded me of Twin Peaks' Black Lodge as some of the dialogues were similarly cryptic, nonsense mumbo-jumbo.\n\n[b]\"What're you doing, Steve?\"[/b]\n[b]\"Playing Harvester.\"[/b]\n\nBeside picking up items, using them, solving puzzles, interacting with people we also fight others ranging from people to the supernatural. A handful of melee weapons as well as guns are available for us to do so - these sequences can easily make us lose the game. Our health indicator should be checked manually by opening up our inventory. Remember: this was the '90s so no checkpoint system existed; a lost battle means game over once and for all. Make sure you save regularly especially in the last half an hour or so.\n\n[b]\"You've always been a kidder, Steve.\"[/b]\n\nAlthough it received mixed reviews 20 years ago Harvester managed to become a cult classic. Frankly, I don't know if I should recommend this to kids from the new millennium. This is a must if you were born in the '80s and played many games in the '90s. You can give this one a try if you love point-and-click games and would like to get to know some of the gory ones from the '90s.", "timestamp_created": 1498413574, "timestamp_updated": 1498413574, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.809908", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32683779": {"recommendationid": "32683779", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045153595", "num_games_owned": 298, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 669, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498241199}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm so intrigued by these incredibly unique cult-classic 90's games.

The whole game reeks of this seemingly innocent 50's atmosphere, but beneath the surface, theres much more than meets the eye. Basically coming off as an overly edgy Twin Peaks, chock full of gore, some much needed 90's angst, and hilariously outdated social commentary, which is seemingly a total recipe for disaster, ends up being the most enjoyable and entertaining point & click I've ever played. From the get-go, literally the first conversation you get engaged in, just immediately shoves some not-so-subtle social commentary right in your face and forces you to choke it down. You converse with your supposed \"family\", complaining of amnesia, but Steve being the kidder he is, is ignored and pointed in the direction of the lodge. On your way, you meet a quirky and demented cast of characters that (barely) help you along the way.

Acudiendo al celuloide, podemos decir que se trata de un cruce entre una pel\u00edcula de David Lynch (Twin Peaks) y una de las primeras que hac\u00eda el ahora muy popular Peter Jackson, con cuatro dolares, llenas de v\u00edsceras pero a la vez divertid\u00edsimas (Bad Taste, Braindead). V\u00edsceras, violencia, gore, sexo s\u00e1dico, asesinos en serie, mutilaciones..., ya digo que hay que tener fuerte est\u00f3mago y cero prejuicios ante muchas de las situaciones que se dan en el juego.\n\nAclarado el primer punto, el argumento, esencial en toda aventura gr\u00e1fica que se precie; se recurre al tema de la amnesia, donde encarnamos a Steve Mason, que se encuentra en un peque\u00f1o poblado de la Am\u00e9rica profunda, rodeado por seres a cada cual m\u00e1s perturbado, y que al parecer iba a casarse con Stephanie, la otra protagonista que parece encontrarse en una situaci\u00f3n similar a Steve. Para ello debe unirse a la misteriosa Logia de la Hermandad de la Cosecha de la Luna, una misteriosa instituci\u00f3n de la que nadie forma parte pero todos quieren, as\u00ed debemos cumplir una serie de objetivos para ingresar y desentra\u00f1ar el misterio que asola a Harvest y sus protagonistas.\n\nNos movemos en tercera persona por los entornos renderizados como en cualquier aventura de hacer click, examinando objetos, utilizando algunos y charlando con los personajes del juego. En esta parte, cabe destacar el elenco de tipos estereotipados al m\u00e1ximo, cada uno mostrando lo peor de la sociedad norteamericana en alguna de sus facetas, un guardia xen\u00f3fobo, un actor racista, amas de casa s\u00e1dicas...lo mejor de cada casa vamos.

It's a cheesy satire on violence in media and video games. It's weird and full of bizarre characters. But if you can accept 1996 FMV graphics and you like point-and-click games, you can really enjoy this game.\n\nResponsive interface, good acting and voice acting (remember, it's satire, it's supposed to be strangely cheesy!) and LOTS of locations to explore - full recommendation.\n\nGAMEPLAY 8/10\nGRAPHICS 7/10\nAUDIO 9/10\nSTORY 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1485873869, "timestamp_updated": 1485873869, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.572270", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29575279": {"recommendationid": "29575279", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014988667", "num_games_owned": 1093, "num_reviews": 91, "playtime_forever": 580, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485726064}, "language": "english", "review": "\"The most violent adventure game of all time\" Yup this game live up to its reputation.\n\nA great humoristique satire on the greath american culture of the 1950.\nYou can kill anyone in the game (If you want to kill your anoying brother you can just beware of the Electric hair). \nYou basicaly have the freedom to wreck a havoc in your town which is a neat feature that was and is rare in the point and click genre.\nThe character are greath and terrifying in there crazy way, from Steve hysterical mother to his insane pedofile step father every caracter take his crazy role seriously which make the experience some much more memorable. \n\nThe Fmv video feel cheap and unessasry (But that not a huge complaint since it a promblem with most FMV games).\nThe voice acting is solid in it's gameplay segements.\nDialogue choice don't offer much diversity at all. When taking a critical decision most of the time the outcomes stays the same which is disappointing, more variety would have been appreciated. \nSome of the violent encounter that are render in the FMV video format could've been more memorable whit the use of more practical effect.\nStory wise it does start strong but sadly stumble in it's last act.\n\nI can definitely understand why harvester has a fanbase and deserve more appreciation for what is has achieved.\n\n8/10 Verdict: It is not a perfect game, surrounded by design flaws and some aspect of the gameplay have not aged well since it's 1996 release.

There will be spoilers ahead so be warned\n\n\nNow Harvester is an old Dos game from the \"weird\" era of PC gaming where the games weren't limiting themselves from offensive content to reach a mass audience like they are today. Games like Fallout and Phantasmagoria really worked to bring a creepy realism to the game. Harvester clearly does the same and quite well to be honest. The atmosphere is quite creepy and character interaction feels real yet slightly off (as intended,) and the town, which is named Harvest, feels like it's something out of a parody. The game itself goes from weird and zany to downright creepy. \n\nLet's get on to the story and there are heavy spoilers within, the story itself is quite well written in the beginning, and the end but the middle feels slow in my opinion. It starts with your character, Steve,  being an amnesiac, people don't believe it because \"You always were a kidder.\" You find out you are engaged to a woman named Stephanie. Talking to the townsfolk, you find information about this so called \"Order of the Harvest Moon\" which most people just call the Lodge. They implore you to join as if your life depends on it. You have to join for the story to progress of course, and in order to get into the lodge you must pass these daily tests, starting at harmless pranks like scratching a car to burning down a woman's diner, quite the escalation. You can check on your bride-to-be and tell her what's going on, yet eventually she is murdered with only her spinal cord left behind along with a lodge invitation, You gain entry to the lodge, after giving the Sergant of Arms Stephanie's spinal cord, and the surreal elements of the game start to pick up again. You go through trials, killing monsters, learning about life and death along the way.\n\nThis game is quite creepy, and is actually quite fun but there are some problems with it. As i mentioned the story loses itself somewhere in the middle, a lot of the well written dialogue and character development can be completely avoided, even parts of the game can be avoided and sometimes I feel like they didn't even really program them into the game. This is a point-and-click, and wonky at that. It could be this version of the game, I've head the GOG version is much better. I would recommend this game if you're looking for something to really give you the willies, but I wouldn't reccomend this game if you don't have patience for outdated gaming styles or outdated story telling.", "timestamp_created": 1478455143, "timestamp_updated": 1502368281, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26409968": {"recommendationid": "26409968", "author": {"steamid": "76561198192298191", "num_games_owned": 297, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 846, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478227759}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Recomiendo ver un v\u00eddeo del gameplay mientras te \"deleitas\" con las escenas violentas ocurridas en el \u00faltimo tercio del juego.

Como las aventuras gr\u00e1ficas estaban de moda a mediados de los noventa, pues se cre\u00f3 esta \"obra\" que buscaba tocar las narices a la censura(rid\u00edcula en muchos de los casos) que sufr\u00edan videojuegos, pel\u00edculas y dem\u00e1s obras.\n\n\u00bfNi siquiera merece la pena como aventura gr\u00e1fica? Tampoco. Puzzles sin sentido y rebuscados, sistema de combate p\u00e9simo que hace bloquearse al juego durante unos segundos, la mitad de las armas no valen ni para rascarse el culo, bugs destroza partidas que como no tengas un guardado antes del error la cagaste pero bien... encima todo lo \"interesante\" est\u00e1 por el final, ya que el comienzo es tan sumamente lento que 3 de cada 4 jugadores abandonar\u00e1n el barco a los pocos minutos.

Es m\u00e1s, es el juego m\u00e1s raro y bizarro al que cualquiera podr\u00e1 jugar jam\u00e1s. La raz\u00f3n es simple: ya no se hacen juegos tan sumamente inadecuados en la industria del videojuego.  Durante el juego se tratan temas tan variados como el asesinato, la pederastria, la brutalidad infantil, y as\u00ed un largo etc\u00e9tera de situaciones politicamente muy incorrectas y, en ciertos momentos, de muy mal gusto.\n\nPoco importa que creas que has jugado a cosas parecidas, donde la sangre habitaba por doquier y la psicopat\u00eda estaba a la orden del d\u00eda. No sabr\u00e1s qu\u00e9 significa la incorrecci\u00f3n moral y \u00e9tica en un juego hasta que no disfrutes de Harvester. Como he dicho, hoy es francamente complicado poder encontrarse algo parecido a lo que ofreci\u00f3 este t\u00edtulo en 1996.\n\nEsta aventura gr\u00e1fica de estilo Full Motion Video (FMV) que tanto estaban de moda con la llegada del DVD a mediados de los 90 nos situa en un t\u00edpico pueblecito americano de los a\u00f1os 50 donde nos despertamos en nuestra habitaci\u00f3n despu\u00e9s de sufrir una horrible pesadilla sin saber d\u00f3nde estamos y qu\u00e9 hacemos en esa casa. Nuestros padres no parecen ser nuestros padres, y lo mismo pasa con el resto de la familia y habitantes del pueblo. Y para colmo vamos a casarnos en dos semanas con alguien a quien no conocemos de nada!!!\n\nEste es el planteamiento inicial del juego, comenzar a deambular por Harvest para descubrir qu\u00e9 nos est\u00e1 pasando. El pueblo no puede ser m\u00e1s raro y bizarro. Gente realmente extra\u00f1a puebla ese lugar, donde las situaciones m\u00e1s extra\u00f1as se ven como algo totalmente l\u00f3gico y normal. En este sentido recuerda mucho a esas pel\u00edculas de serie B de extraterrestres, donde los humanos no son m\u00e1s que carcasas vac\u00edas controladas por poderes superiores. No van por ah\u00ed los tiros, sin embargo.\n\nEl juego como tal, aparte de su rar\u00edsimo argumento, muestra una jugabilidad al m\u00e1s puro estilo point & click. Recogemos objetos y los combinamo o usamos con el entorno. En este aspecto nada nuevo. Los puzles no son excesivamente complejos, pero tampoco hay excesivas pistas o indicios en algunos momentos, sobre todo al principio, provocando que el jugador pueda sentirse un poco perdido.\n\nPor otro lado, el aspecto sonoro el juego es realmente bueno. Tienen una m\u00fasica que le viene como anillo al dedo y un doblaje en espa\u00f1ol de gran calidad, sobretodo si tenemos en cuenta que est\u00e1 realizado en 1996.\n\nTodo lo comentado configura una aventura gr\u00e1fica realmente \u00fanica, incluso con su dosis arcade, donde lo que m\u00e1s brilla con luz propia es su argumento, el cual es realmente sosprendente. Para bien y para mal.\n\nEn definitiva, si te gustan las aventuras gr\u00e1ficas y quieres probar algo totalmente distinto que no te dejar\u00e1 indiferente, Harvester es realmente un juego que merece la pena. Sin lugar a dudas.\n", "timestamp_created": 1477920535, "timestamp_updated": 1477920535, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.633305", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26309968": {"recommendationid": "26309968", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015213200", "num_games_owned": 1009, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 332, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458274286}, "language": "english", "review": "Firmly in the \"So bad it's good\" territory.

It's easy to dismiss it as just another zany product of the failed FMV phase of video games, especially with the game proudly and shamelessly wearing its exploitation label like a medal. \"The goriest game of all time!\" It says, sometimes coupled with screenshots that appear to show more gore-for-the-sake-of-gore. This is just the most obvious basis one can use to write Harvester off, but if you're willing to venture beyond that, you'll find many more.\n\nIt's pretty meta, because Harvester throws the player off constantly. This in itself is one of the entire points of the game. The bizarre characters, the seemingly unclear satire on violence in video games, it's all there for a reason, and it took me several playthroughs to get the full meaning. The first time through it's just plain-old bizarre and enjoyable, though I recalled being intensely disappointed by the final act, especially the endings. Up to that point I had loved it in a purely \"interactive B-movie\" sense, but the game decided to throw even that away at its conclusion. Bundled with the atrocious combat system, it seemed like a wasted opportunity.\n\nExcept... Maybe not.\n\n*Spoilers*\n\nHere's the method to its madness: the main character of the game is not only Steve, but also you as a player. Steve is believable on his own, but he serves mostly as a stand-in for the audience. The goal is for Steve (you) to slowly become desensitized to violence over the course of the story. This is achieved first by amnesia, so this new environment you absorb shapes your worldview. Then you're pushed to do trivial tasks that quicky escalate in intensity and depravity (scratching a tucker to burning down one's livelihood). This is why Steve begins to act out-of-character, because by choosing to progress, you and him both are on the path to becoming a cold, detached serial killer.\n\nOnce you enter the lodge you actually begin to start killing. First with monsters, then to creatures that are more humanoid, then finally people. You target bad people, those viewed as \"righteous\", and ultimately those that are entirely innocent. By the time you've reached Stephanie, you've become a serial killer.\n\nThis is all an elaborate play on the claim that \"video games make people serial killers\", as parodied in the \"bad\" ending of the game. The over-the-top gore is there to eccentuate that, and to draw-in the kinds of people who are offended by it. Too bad it missed the peak of that controversy by two years (1996 vs. 1994), but with our current political climate it's become surprisingly relevant again.\n\nThe remarkably surreal \"age-of-innocence\" 50s atmosphere is a direct juxtaposition to all this, and it really, really works. Never have I played a game that gave me a more palpable sense of bleakness and entrapment. The peculiar soundtrack, hammy acting and unrealistic FMV only enhance it; the town of Harvest truly feels like a prison. And it's for good reason - the townspeople are weird and act like artificial caricatures because you're supposed to feel like an outsider, like the world is conspiring against you. By inflicting a sense of otherness it's supposed to make you (Steve) hostile against and distrusting of people in general.\n\nThe comparison to the works of David Lynch, Twin Peaks especially, would be the easiest to make. Besides maybe for \"Bad Day on the Midway\" there's no game more Lynchian that I've ever played, and (aside from Eraserhead) I don't even like Lynch. I believe this is a testament to how well Harvester stands on its own two feet.\n\nBut it's far from perfect. In terms of gameplay the puzzles are merely tolerable, and as mentioned the combat towards the end is inexcusably bad. You get accustomed to it eventually, but no doubt it should have been better-implemented. At least it serves its purpose for the narrative, unlike the game's dialogue choices, because...\n\nIt's a huge, gaping contradiction that the game's \"better\" ending even exists. The dialogue choices are essentially the player's conscience actively going against Steve's conditioning, but being offered an alternative ending after all that dulls the whole point of them as well as everything else the game built up. Perhaps if the player picked the more \"morally-right\" choice every time, and the \"better\" ending was the result, then it'd make a bit more sense. On top of being a lazy design choice, it's a totally inexplicable flaw.\n\nNot to mention it's also a definite fault of the game that it requires this much unnecessary analysis to grasp the points I elaborated on above. Seeing as they're pretty much integral to understanding the game they should have been far more fleshed out, as they're only glossed-over on their surface level. But at the very least, they're still absolutely there, and they're fascinating.\n\nHarvester had potential to be a prime example of artistic satire in video games, but it ended up instead being an often screwy and sometimes chilling journey into absurdity. As is, it's still excellently written, with an incredibly effective setting and oddly memorable characters. But beyond that are glimpses of what it further could have been, and while you have to look pretty hard to see them they should still be recognized for genuinely being there. I see this game get unfairly stigmatized all the time. People go for the easy targets (i.e. ham-fisted meat symbolism) and fail to examine the underlying bigger-picture. Huge applause for the effort made by the writer and director, Gilbert P. Austin.

Si algo de sangre, violencia, temas sexuales (no hay escenas con desnudos) y s\u00e1tira sobre la violencia en los videojuegos y como esta afecta a los que interactuan con las mismas podria recomendar ampliamente jugar almenos una vez Harvester ya que podria considerarse una experiencia que vale la pena como algo extra\u00f1o y unico en el mundo de los videojuegos.\n\nHarvester utiliza DOSBOX para funcionar pero no causa grandes problemas con sistemas modernos, lo termin\u00e9 sin muchos problemas en Windows 7, si deseas tomar screenshots y utilizar la interfase de steam mientras juegas asegurate de utilizar la segunda opci\u00f3n que te lanza el juego al ejecutarlo desde tu biblioteca de juegos.\n\nPros:\n+ Una clasica experiencia de un juego de aventura point and click de los 90s.\n+ El peque\u00f1o pueblo de Harvest esta lleno de amplia atencion y detalle en cada una de sus esquinas y habitantes.\n+ Buenas voces y cuenta con doblaje en espa\u00f1ol, recomendaria jugarlo en ingles pero en caso de no saber el idioma la opci\u00f3n debe de estar disponible.\n+ Lleno de humor negro, no se detiene o nada lo frena en expresar el mensaje que quiere dar al jugador.\n+ Funciona sin problemas mediante DOSBOX reduciendo casi al 100% los posibles problemas con equipos modernos.\n\nContras:\n- De la misma manera que no se restringe en dar su mensaje claramente puede que sea mucho para algunas personas que sean sensibles a muestras extremas de violencia.\n- Trata temas que pueden ser polemicos para mas de uno como violencia, suicidio, canibalismo, vouyerismo, violencia a menores, crimen, vandalismo entre otras cosas perturbadoras no aptas para menores o personas que se puedan ofender facilmente con algo como esto.\n- Al ser un juego de aventura clasico puede ser algo criptico y requiere mucha prueba y error para progresar en la historia pero hay varias guias disponibles para estos casos.\n- De igual manera al ser un juego de los 90s su control puede ser algo complicado en algunos casos sobretodo en la parte final del juego donde se convierte en algo mas de acci\u00f3n donde el personaje principal tiene que defenderse de enemigos, curarse y demas. Altamente recomendable guardar tu partida constantemente en diferentes slots.\n\nCalificaci\u00f3n: 7 de 10.\n\nRecomendado para fans de los juegos de aventura grafica que buscan algo diferente y perturbador.", "timestamp_created": 1473466478, "timestamp_updated": 1473466643, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563924", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25338371": {"recommendationid": "25338371", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088566858", "num_games_owned": 235, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 486, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479924891}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the most underrated games ever, some people just play and thinks the story and everything else is trash, but this piece of gem is so much more than that, is sooo deep, and all of those hidden messages are soo great even for nowadays, well i was suspicious when i first played, but now that i finished(actually it was a long time ago), so i can say that if you like games with story, a meaning behind, and don't care about graphics, go ahead and don't think twice, you'll not regret....\n\n\n\nand dont forget to put the papers out for jimmy, trust me....", "timestamp_created": 1472960653, "timestamp_updated": 1472960653, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500684", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25315896": {"recommendationid": "25315896", "author": {"steamid": "76561198175833253", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1249, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 66, "last_played": 1520911612}, "language": "english", "review": "A STORY ABOUT A KIDDER THAT DIES PLENTY OF TIMES. \n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1472866218, "timestamp_updated": 1472866218, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503332", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25048650": {"recommendationid": "25048650", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138726046", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 692, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471785875}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ub4a4\ud2c0\ub9ac\uace0, \uc794\ud639\ud558\uace0, \ube44\ud310\uc801\uc694\uc18c\uac00 \uac00\ub4dd\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\uc791.\n\n\uc601\uc5b4 \uc548\ub418\uace0 \uba38\ub9ac\uc4f0\ub294\uac70 \uc2eb\uc5b4\ud558\uba74 \ucd94\ucc9c\ub4dc\ub9ac\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \n\ubb34\uc12d\uae30\ubcf4\ub2e4\ub294 \uc5ed\uacb9\uace0 \uc9d5\uadf8\ub7fd\uace0 \ud610\uc624\uc2a4\ub7ec\uc6b4 \ubd84\uc704\uae30\ub85c \uc2ec\ub9ac\uc801 \uacf5\ud3ec\ub97c \uc790\uc544\ub0b4\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \n\uc774\ub7f0 \ub958\uc5d0 \ub0b4\uc131\uc774 \uc5c6\uc73c\uc2e0\ubd84\ub4e4\uc740 \ube44\ucd94\ub4dc\ub9bd\ub2c8\ub2e4. \n\n\ub108\ub294 \uc5b8\uc81c\ub098 \uadf8\uc9d3\ub9d0\uc7c1\uc774\uc5c8\uc9c0, \uc2a4\ud2f0\ube0c!\n", "timestamp_created": 1471767404, "timestamp_updated": 1471767404, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505544", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25025633": {"recommendationid": "25025633", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963877789", "num_games_owned": 755, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 440, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471667404}, "language": "english", "review": "TLDR: Only recommended for hardcore old-school PnC Adventure Games or gore fans.\n\nI love adventures...been playing them for a solid 25 years.

This game was well beyond anything in the 90s.\n+ The acting is awesomely bad (to me this was a plus.)\n+ There is definitely a great dose of dark comedy.\n+ The message is an obvious but strong one.  I do think it serves a very important part of gaming history because of this...especially when you get to the endgame.\n+ This game works really well as a horror game.  The scenes and FMV shots can be very gruesome, which are generally very well done for the time.\n- but is a terrible execution of an adventure game.  \n- The pacing, puzzles, continuity of dialog/characters is so broken, it feels uncompleted.  The interface is terrible.  \n- The combat is atrocious in terms of controls (but oddly fun to choose your weapon of death.)  I mean it's really bad.\n- Truthfully, I used a walkthrough for a good portion of it because I found myself lost in the myriad of things out there without any good direction.

When it originally came out in 1996, many critics said that the game felt dated due to its delayed release, but these days gamers can't seem to get enough of this gore-soaked B-Grade title; save for the prudes who don't enjoy cheesy horror like Evil Dead, Basket Case, or even Silent Night, Deadly Night. \n\nDuring the game, you play as an 18 year old guy named Steve Mason; trust me, you were always such a kidder, Steve. It turns out that he has severe amnesia, to the point that he doesn't even remember that he's engaged and set to be wed to a woman named Stephanie in three weeks time. No one in the town of Harvest believes that he has amnesia, which frustrates him to no end. During the time that you will spend in the small town of Harvest, population 51, you will meed a variety of wildly eccentric and somewhat wacky characters, all who have their own personality quirks; a deputy who is obsessed with jerking off to nudie mags, Stephanie's father who is off his rocker about meat, a crazy school teacher who thinks that the best way to discipline her students is by beating them with a baseball bat, gay firemen... the list just goes on and on.\n\nWell, it turns out that Stephanie has just as severe of a case of amnesia that Steve does. The goal of the game comes down to getting in to this mysterious, secret organization known as The Order of the Harvest Moon, whose headquarters are located at the Lodge. Steve needs to join them prior to the Harvest Annual Blood Drive Donation at the end of the week, which is mandatory... and perhaps deadly. The gameplay is separated in to days, and as such you will play through a total of six days (some with night events) and three levels of the Lodge. The entire game, if you're using a guide, will take around 7-8 hours to complete; if you're not using a guide, it could take you upwards to 20 hours to figure out the complex puzzles and how to initiate the game moving from one day to the next.\n\nHarvest is a fairly large town for having such a small population, it has 18 locations to explore; although some of them you will only end up visiting once or twice. There are just as many characters to interact and converse with, as well as to potentially murder. That's right, Harvester also features a fighting mechanic; left clicking lets you examine, pick up, and use objects, while right clicking lets you attack. You will find a large amount of weapons to use during the course of your playthrough, all which can be individually equipped via the inventory screen. Not only are you able to kill people, but once you reach the later Lodge levels, there are monsters that you will have to take out as well.\n\nSurprisingly, this title has aged incredibly well in both looks and functionality. The abundant FMVs are riddled with gore, cheesy dialogue, and bad acting; even though they're low quality and slightly pixelated, they're still incredibly enjoyable to watch time and time again. It's even worth it to go out of your way to explore all of the different ways that Steve can die, and to interact with all of the characters as many times as possible to view all of the cutscenes. Talking with people in the town of Harvest will show \"key words\" that you can select that act as topics for discussion, though some disappear after speaking about another subject you can type in any keywords that were available; this is one retro game where keeping a pen and paper handy is actually still useful.\n\nI could go on singing praises about Harvester all day, but sadly the Steam version has a few kinks that will most likely never be worked out. For some people, the game crashes often; this did not happen to me. For a lot of people, the FMV cutscenes, which are arguably the best part of the game, will refuse to play; this actually did happen to me, and you do miss out not on just a lot of the fun stuff, but a lot of the story as well. There's only one known fix for the latter issue, and that's to lower the frame cycles in DOSBox to 8000. Doing so makes the gameplay infuriatingly choppy and sluggish, fortunately most of the FMVs are located on the sixth day, and only sporadically throughout the rest of the game.\n\nEven with the problems that weigh this port down, Harvester is an amazingly fun, low-budget horror title that's seething with blood, gore, intestines, crude phallic jokes, bad acting, cheesy dialogue, and hilarious FMV cutscenes. Some of the more memorable moments for me were when the deputy was caught jerking off, and finding the children eating their mother; not to mention the countless sessions of dialogue that will stick with you, such as the meat obsessed father of the bride. If you're a fan of old B-Grade movies like the ones I listed in the introductory paragraph, or if you played and enjoyed games such as Sanitarium, Phantasmagoria, and I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream, then you will absolutely dig Harvester. However, for a dollar more you can purchase it on GOG and avoid any potential issues that the Steam version has.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]5.0/5.0[/b] - An astonishing achievement, this game must be played.[/h1]\nThe Horror Network [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28221963/]Curator[/url] | [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thehorrornetwork]Group[/url] Click for Gore", "timestamp_created": 1471528123, "timestamp_updated": 1513693162, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.604542", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24980408": {"recommendationid": "24980408", "author": {"steamid": "76561198324925228", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 844, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507369931}, "language": "english", "review": "Admittedly I hadn't heard of this game when it was first released, and no doubt would have been too mch of a wuss to play it (The 7th Guest used to terrify me) but am glad at having a second chance to play it here.\nLove;\nThe sense of humour\nThe fact that it is based on the creator's hatred of censorship.\nThe gore obviously\nStill looks ok considering it's from 1994.\nFun\nEntertaining\nTwisted\n\nDidn't love;\nMusic was irritating\nSome of the things you had to do with items seemed completely random\nThe ending was a bit of an anticlimax (maybe there are other endings?)\n\nThis game was a lot of fun and holds up well for its age.

Although the gameplay is a typical object hunting puzzle game, the characters, story, and premise is very interesting.  It has a quirkiness and intrigue that makes you want to see the story through.  When it comes down to it, I couldn't be bothered.  Being from the 90's, it put my patience to the test as I had to run back and forth through the same still-picture locations pixel hunting and working out 90's adventure-puzzle logic.  That being said, it is far better than many of the modern \"adventure-puzzle\" games out there, so if you have the patience, the story seems well worth it and the characters are creepy in a funny way.  To its credit, I was so interested on what the hell was going on and where the story would take me that I watched a playthrough on Youtube.  It is a very interesting idea and was actually some decent satire of the early censorship and view towards violent video games back in the 90's.\nSpoilers:\n[spoiler]\nBasically, the game is a \"Harvester\" to find and train the best murderers.  Your character has a crucial choice to make at the end that decides if you have the cold ability to murder without remorse, and by extension, the player themselves.

It's a game that suffered a lot from being in a transitional period for computer hardware and software, and the manufactured controversy angle it went for completely fell flat on its face as Harvester missed its initial release date by two years.\n\nHarvester does a lot of things other games get credit for but all the way back in 1996 (technically as early as '94 if you cut the developer some slack). While it's under developed puzzles and ludicrous content (the gay firehouse and ability to kill children strike me as two elements definitely unlikely to fly in modern times) make it hard to recommend for gameplay purposes, and the end 'boss rush'-sequence borders on unfair, this game does three things well: metafictional commentary, ludonarrative harmonium, and actually interesting content (the aforementioned boss rush has one fmv sequence that is genuinely disturbing and I really dug that). \n\nThis game taunts players and crafts a self aware and self reflexive narrative that is enjoyable for its timeliness. This preceeds many great games that experiment with the meta, such as Metal Gear Solid and Undertale for two easy examples. It's also a lovely time capsule in how to approach these elements and how public thinking on video games was truly absurd at one point. \n\nIt is also a game that possess very poor gameplay. It wasn't good when it came out and it isn't interesting in retrospect. That said, many of the gameplay choices are fascinating \"in concept\", but more importantly, and especially with the game's central twist in mind, many of the design choices make sense within the context of the game world. This doesn't make it fun to play as the combat is bad and the puzzles are lazy, but in more capable hands some of it's more noble failures could have been executed interestingly.\n\nLastly, this is a game that is full of schlock and absolute trashiness. My brother and I actually played through this whole ordeal together, and for large parts it fails to be horrifying and it fails to be shocking. Even at time of release, much of its most disturbing content was at best in poor taste and at worst completely uninteresting. That said, this gives is a b-movie kind of charm. Scratch that. It gives it a z-movie kind of charm. The terrible fmvs are enjoyable kitschy, but on the rare occasion this games content actually works in its intended fashion (off the top of my head, the peeping tom next door dad is a sequence that is gross but deservedly so, and the trials of the lodge have a few moments of actually dark content) by George it actually works. And you almost want to root for the game for that.\n\nBasically, if you have a Sunday to kill, maybe a few beers, this is a game worth playing for that kind of \"are you kidding me, this is so stupid\" kind of entertainment. I'm solidly recommending it because let's plays exist and the game also goes on sale frequently.

But Harvester just doesn't cut it. To review an adventure game, we need to talk about the setting and the story a bit, so the following may contain small spoilers, but don't worry: real spoilers will be hidden like so [spoiler]yup, like this[/spoiler].\n\n[u]The story[/u]\n\nYou play Steve, who wakes up in the town of Harvest with amnesia. He doesn't remember anything or anyone, but everyone seems to know him and everyone seems to know he has amnesia before he tells them (\"they heard about it\"). On top of that, everyone looks bizarre and everyone acts completely psycho. Everyone except Stephanie, who's supposed to be Steve's fiancee, but they both don't remember anything. You see, Stephanie has amnesia just like Steve. Steve will go explore the town to find out what's going on.\n\nAt first, it's fun to explore the town and talk to the people, who are all complete nutjobs. But soon, the behavior of the main characters becomes outright unbelievable and you won't care much what they have to say anymore, you will just keep playing because you're curious to know what is going on and what type of creatures these so-called townspeople are. To discover that, you need to gain access to 'the lodge'. \n\n[u]The gameplay[/u]\n\nGameplay is classic point and click. Find items, combine them in your inventory and use them on things or people. There are a few points in the game where I had to look up a walkthrough. When I read the solution I never had the feeling it was completely impossible to guess, but it would sometimes have taken me hours to come up with it myself. \n\nOnce you enter the lodge, the gameplay changes drastically. Fighting becomes a large part of the game. Now in my opinion, an adventure game shouldn't become a fighting game all of a sudden, especially when it has a combat system that's just awful. And the most infuriating part is [spoiler]that the last part of the game is just one fight after another. No more story or anything, just about a dozen or so fights. It feels like a bad Mortal Kombat or Streetfighter game. And because healing items are scarce, you will need to reload almost every time you get hit or you won't make it to the end.[/spoiler]\n\nBut you persist, because you're almost at the end of the game and you haven't even received the smallest bit of information about what the hell is going on. And then, the final cutscene explains the plot, and it's the biggest anticlimax in an adventure game ever. [spoiler]It turns out none of it was real. Everything from the first second of the game up to the end was just a virtual reality, an illusion. This made me yawn in anger. A long time ago, a tv series called Dallas pulled this off and really pissed off the fans by stating the whole previous season was just a dream. More recently, the tv series Lost pretty much did the same at the end of their final season. Well, here you play an adventure game wondering what the explanation is for all the weird things that happen and for the weird behaviour of the people, and the explanation is: \"It didn't really happen. Roll the credits!\" Bah![/spoiler]\n\n[u]Conclusion[/u]\n\nNah, I don't recommend Harvester. The first part is somewhat fun, but the second part isn't and the ending just makes you want to shout cursewords at your screen. If you're looking for a good FMV, I recommend Gabriel Knight 2. Phantasmagoria isn't bad either. I even enjoyed Phantasmagoria 2 more than I did Harvester, and people who played both these games will know that's a bold statement ;-)", "timestamp_created": 1464904544, "timestamp_updated": 1464904544, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537510", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23342047": {"recommendationid": "23342047", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019276577", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455543843}, "language": "english", "review": "Best gore horror game!\nPlease just try this i really enjoy this game\nI remember old FMV times...", "timestamp_created": 1464864551, "timestamp_updated": 1464864551, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493528", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23298932": {"recommendationid": "23298932", "author": {"steamid": "76561198169661975", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 73, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1445726951}, "language": "english", "review": "A good feature of this game is that you can [spoiler] kill a child [/spoiler] and some funny conversations.", "timestamp_created": 1464646369, "timestamp_updated": 1464646420, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515056", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23163288": {"recommendationid": "23163288", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013134168", "num_games_owned": 225, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 436, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463952916}, "language": "english", "review": "Bery good", "timestamp_created": 1464043990, "timestamp_updated": 1464043990, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.470316", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23058889": {"recommendationid": "23058889", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072450805", "num_games_owned": 197, "num_reviews": 449, "playtime_forever": 367, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463590628}, "language": "polish", "review": "Jednym zdaniem:  Harvester sprzed 20 lat to nie jest gra dla ka\u017cdego - seks, krew, przemoc, czarny humor, satyra obyczajowa na USA, elementy z tandetnego kina klasy B, w\u0105tki fabularne z horror\u00f3w Stephena Kinga. dziwne klimaty jak z film\u00f3w Lyncha....

Relying on satires and parodies playing a very good black humor, full of unexpected reactions and macabre elements (loved the scene of the nuclear disaster by mistake), but the problem is the gameplay that leads to these moments: out some scenes that player uses the logic to solve situations (normal in every point and click) most situations requires that the player leaves acting like crazy, clicking all on the scene to solve (if get lucky) a given situation.

I was never able to even get to the lodge.  How could this be?  I was stuck.  I had to go look for a walkthrough.  I realized the first problem.  I didn't pick up the pen and quarter from the drawer.  Of course, I should have been looking around my room, and opened the drawer.  Well, I did.  I clicked on the bookshelf, and I only got a description and I clicked on the closet next to my bed, and I only got a description.  I assumed that everything that can be examined would only be examined.  To prove my (incorrect) point even more, I tried to open the oven and cabinet in the kitchen.  None were able to be opened.\n\nSo, how could I differentiate between stuff that can be opened, and stuff that can't?  Well, there isn't any way.  I can\u2019t even have my mouse over the drawer to know weather it can be opened.  I always get the \u201cexamine\u201d cursor, so I would have to click on everything that has the examine cursor.\n\nThe same thing goes for items, but there aren\u2019t that many items that are able to be picked up, so it\u2019s not that bad.\n\nIt's not that the game is too hard, but if I have to click on every possible thing that can be opened (or look at a walkthrough), it just becomes tedious.\n\nThere could be a way to make it possible to know weather something can be opened after being examined, or if it would just be able to be examined.  A glow could be possible.\n\nIt does take a little bit of realism out if there is a way to know weather something opened or not.  It is needed to examine everything to know weather there is something important in it.  Then everything that can (in real life) be opened should show the contents, but since that would take too much time to program, and it would have nothing to do with the game itself, it would be good to only let things that are needed for the game to be able to open.  Since it takes a little bit of realism out, it would be a good idea to go a little bit further and have a way to know weather something can be opened or not just by looking.\n\nThe game has good graphics for it's time, and even though it was from 1995, it can still be ran with modern computers.  The game starts of slow, but gets gory fast.  I would recommend this because someone looking at this game would want something gory.  If I would review this game for the average person, I would not recommend it.\n\nThis game is great, but it's not for everyone.  If you want an interesting storyline, and is very gory, this is right for you.", "timestamp_created": 1462062279, "timestamp_updated": 1462062279, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531738", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22654049": {"recommendationid": "22654049", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016529253", "num_games_owned": 186, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463579519}, "language": "english", "review": "\n\n\nI must say I'm highly suprised,\nNever played this game before and I only watched just a couple of screenshots or random short gameplay.\nThe story is very interesting and has a creepy atmosphere and feeling around it. The acting/ voice acting is pretty good for it's time. I see alot of reviews complaining about the acting but honestly... It's from 1996 and I think it's impressive for a game of that year.\n\nThis version plays in a DOSBox, and for some reason steam overlay won't work with it. So not really a differents in getting the GOG version besides the trading cards and the steam game time counter.\n\nOveral the  game has no bugs besides the ocation where the FLV cutscenes freeze for a while before they start or they just skip (if the cutscene is like one second, so nothing valuable lost.)\nAnother slight problem is that somethimes the game could freeze, this happens often while being in dialogue with people after their last sentences. A right mouse click will unfreeze it.\nThe game is also forced 4:3.\n\n\nThe gameplay is fluent, altough the game is very hard to figure by yourself out. There are moments when you HAVE to look up a guide. Just because you can get easily stuck. Also if you want to buy the game and want to play for the first time a blindly walktrough then I recommend you to save the game often. If you pick a wrong choice in the storyline then you could be f*cked for the rest of your game, or the storyline might just be stuck forever.", "timestamp_created": 1461712068, "timestamp_updated": 1461712068, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467396", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22642319": {"recommendationid": "22642319", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013954938", "num_games_owned": 576, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 565, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461704512}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0413\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e!\u041f\u043e \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0434\u0430\u0440\u043a \u0441\u043e\u0443\u043b\u0441 \u043e\u0442\u0434\u044b\u0445\u0430\u0435\u0442!\u0428\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0432\u0440 \u0438\u0437 90-\u0445 !\u0423\u043c\u0435\u043b\u0438 \u0436\u0435 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0432 \u0442\u043e \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f!10 \u043c\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0448\u0435\u043a \u0438\u0437 10!", "timestamp_created": 1461657335, "timestamp_updated": 1461657335, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.559748", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22485096": {"recommendationid": "22485096", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043108500", "num_games_owned": 404, "num_reviews": 195, "playtime_forever": 599, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460920788}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is really REALLY creepy, and there are some very disturbing scenes that leaves you in shock.

He grabs the magazine, rolls it up and starts hitting him with it.\n\n15/10\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnyway, this is an extremely strange retro horror/adventure game with a KILLER( ba dum tsss) sense of humour. You walk around different areas looking like a character from Mortal Kombat and you can access the map at any time to travel to different parts of a small, weird town.\n\nThis is one of those old games where figuring out what you are supposed to do is next to impossible and a walkthrough(at least, for me anyway) is almost mandatory to beat the game.\n\nYou play as a young man of nonspecific age who wakes up not knowing what the hell is going on. All around town the people are really creepy and weird. There's a military guy who has no legs or groin who guards a nuclear missle base sitting in town, there's a house with some old wasp lady(who doesn't factor into the game's story at all. you don't even have to go to her house to complete the game), there's a butcher shop with blood everywhere and dead cats all over the place and there's a giant druid-looking building called \"The Lodge\".\n\nYou find out that you're supposed to try and become a member of The Lodge by the end of the week and to do so you have to complete tasks for the really cool guy who runs it. A guy, who talks with his mind in an awesome voice. \n\nI don't think I would have been able to figure out what to do honestly but basically in completing the tasks you will talk to all kinds of people and the story is littered with creativity and incredibly dark campy humor. In this story you will see many cutscenes with the bad actors being hilarious in front of crappily animated early-3D backgrounds and it's a wonderful sight to behold. It seems as if the developers thought of everything as there are so many secrets to be found through dialogues and doing things in certain orders that triggers funny responses and, in some cases, exclusive death cutscenes. Any time you die it will trigger a cutscene of the main hero being brutally murdered in whatever manner you managed to die in the game.\n\nI think that if you like the early Peter Jackson films like Bad Taste or Dead Alive(known as Brain Dead in some countries) then you should really consider giving Harvester a play and maybe even look at walkthrough to see what this game has to offer. Once you complete all of the tasks and get into the lodge finally you have to complete the \"trials\" of becoming a lodgemember and it's really cool to see what lies inside. It's a huge building with so much personality and creativity around every corner and once you get through it you have access to an awesome twist that explains what is going on and a choice between two solid endings.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nAfter hearing things about this game I always thought that it would be worth a look and boy, was I right. Now this game probably isn't for anyone, as people seem more sensitive these days(no offense) but the non-pc humor happened to be right up my alley. \n\nI do feel bad for the original makers of Harvester as, after they had completed the game it took them a year or two to finish the programming and by that time the it was already outdated as technology was rapidly improving around the time this game came to fruition and the game didn't sell very well.\n\nNightdive Studios made the game accessible without using DOS and polished up a bit for easy use and I really love them for redoing a bunch of retro games and selling them on Steam. They did System Shock 1 and 2, Turok, Shadow Man and on top of that they're doing their own modern sequel or remake of System Shock!\n\nWhile I do wish the original creators of Harvester could be getting more money for their game on Steam(I am almost positive they are not but correct me if I am wrong) I am definetely happy to give my money to the great Nightdive Studios.", "timestamp_created": 1455574376, "timestamp_updated": 1481377685, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21237298": {"recommendationid": "21237298", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069593223", "num_games_owned": 142, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456104619}, "language": "english", "review": "I may have always been a kidder, but this game is the bomb!

So I have decided to try it now. I thought that it would be good adventure with quite abstract story, but I was wrong. Yes, the \"story\" is really abstract. But the game is not good at all. I don't care too much about obsolete graphic, clunky controls, but I care about gameplay in general.\nThis game can be completed without walkthroughs/hints only if you have at least some skill in telepathy, because gameplay here consists only of searching items that you will need in future. And you rarely know what developers want from you right now. For instance:  [spoiler] Day 5, we need to commit arson in the Diner. So, what options do we have: 1) We have the man, that commited arsons in the past. Maybe we need to speak to him. No! 2) Maybe we need to lure the Diner owner outside first. No! 3) OK, maybe we try to talk to the man that feels lust for the Diner owner. No! ... khm, what must we do then? We must go to the church and randomly click on the coffin, suddenly there we see a deceased man. But we have been here before and coffin was empty. OK. We must take a photograph of the deceased and exchange it for glue. End of Day 5.[/spoiler] And the whole game consists of similar \"puzzles\" - click every screen over and over again until you'll suddenly find something new. I know that developers intentionally made this game nonsensical. But nonsense in plot has nothing to do with the nonsense in gameplay.\nLet's conclude: this is absurdly illogical game and if you want to look at walkthrough every now and then, than you might try this game.

The town is populated with a couple dozen people, most vastly differing from one another, producing a nice cast of memorable and unique characters. Steve, the main character, is personally my favourite. I love his dialogue and I found myself connecting to him and his situation -- something that doesn't usually happen for me.  \n\nThroughout the game you will uncover the secrets of Harvest, most opening up more questions than answers. This adds to the mystery of the town, producing a nice spooky vibe which fits it's horror genre. While playing I found myself simultaneously laughing, crying, and cringing; it's the perfect combination of humour and disgust. You can't help but feel pity for Steve, who like you has no idea what's going on or why he's there. \n\nA warning to anyone squeamish: This game is not for the lighthearted. Though the graphics may be older, some of the cutscenes are surprisingly brutal, and without going into too much detail, very gory. There's no real jumpscares though, which is nice. Just be wary that at any second a cutscene could come out of nowhere. There's child/baby death in this game too, which may (understandly) bother some people. In general, the farther you progress the more gory it gets. So if you are faint of heart, I advise you not to play this game.\n\nPROS:\n-Great story with somewhat satisfying conclusions\n-Amazing characters\n-Not afraid of it's audience\n-Decent voice acting\n-Great cutscenes\n-Graphics aren't bad for an older game\n-Steve\n\nCONS:\n-Fighting is lackluster\n-Some may find endings unsatisfactory\n-Gets pretty weird (it's for you to decide if this is a good or a bad thing)\n-Dead babies, mutilated children, wounded cats, blah blah blah\n-Too many wasps\n-Steve is a kidder\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend this game to people who enjoy classic horrors with unique charm and a weird, crazy plot. If you're looking for a game that'll make you question what the f**k is going on, then this game is for you. If older graphics really bother you then they may be a problem, but personally they were good enough to make me genuinely scared at some points (which is good enough for me). Basically, just buy this game. I promise you you won't find another one like it. \n", "timestamp_created": 1446705486, "timestamp_updated": 1446705486, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.748001", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18850663": {"recommendationid": "18850663", "author": {"steamid": "76561198195042190", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 274, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1446441956}, "language": "french", "review": "Point positif:\n+Jeux d'acteur tellement mauvais qu'en s'en deviends dr\u00f4le (comme les nanards).\n+Tres bon point and click!\n+Une histoire tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressante.\n+une tres bonne satire sur la violence des jeux-vid\u00e9os\nPoint n\u00e9gatif:\n-Jeu tr\u00e8s court\n-La difficulter des enigmes ou des ennemis sont d'un simpliciter par moment!\n-Des cin\u00e9matiques qui apparais que quelques frames en version fran\u00e7ais\n-Des fins pr\u00e9visibles mais qui reste bonne (j'ai une pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour la mauvaise fin)\nNote:8/10\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1446521784, "timestamp_updated": 1446521784, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18821119": {"recommendationid": "18821119", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045000812", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449186005}, "language": "english", "review": "\"you were always such a kidder steve\" say this to all the people who says this game sucks", "timestamp_created": 1446401082, "timestamp_updated": 1446401082, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18759767": {"recommendationid": "18759767", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117872597", "num_games_owned": 558, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 429, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450553536}, "language": "english", "review": "You Always Were A Kidder, Steve!", "timestamp_created": 1446199051, "timestamp_updated": 1446199051, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.410084", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18659999": {"recommendationid": "18659999", "author": {"steamid": "76561198171384047", "num_games_owned": 870, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 667, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1446343295}, "language": "english", "review": "no other horror games can match this (and also phantasmagoria -why this one is not on steam?) true terror. all hail 90s FMV horror games!", "timestamp_created": 1445702807, "timestamp_updated": 1445702807, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18603063": {"recommendationid": "18603063", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012399123", "num_games_owned": 438, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 443, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1445447928}, "language": "english", "review": "The combat in this game is really terrible.

If you have even the slightest taste for horror you should definitelly check this old gem.\n\nI love old games like this one. At the time the different genres of gaming weren't so clear-cut as they are today. Not having the imperative to be separated in perfect little boxes in order to identify a game as \"adventure\", \"action\" etc, resulted in games like Harvester. A game with heavy adventure elements, timed events, combats, different weapons you can actually aim and use, ammo to manage and of course, many deaths. \n\nThere is a weird exhilarating sense of freedom in that lack of genre labeling in gameplay. You can't follow the patterns modern adventure games use, so even simple things may have an unexpected aspect to them. This kind of freedom in a game's design makes it more interesting -and of course, at times, harder to beat.*\n\nUnfortunately Harvester also carries with it the sexist tropes of the era, so if you can't stomach good old sexism, a touch of homophobia, gratuitous sex scenes, ladies in lingerie and violence against women then you should probably choose another game.

Every weapon has a different range and firing speed, but it always winds up being a speed-click contest regardless; you can also aim upward, middle, or downward but this seems to be pointless. It's a shame, because this game was delayed two years for the programming alone, which seems to have done more harm to the project than good.\n\nIn short, this game didn't get the budget it deserved.

Gross. And a point and click adventure. \n\nIf it is meant as satire, it is a bad satire. It lacks any depth or coherence. It is just a bunch of as much randomness and insanity as possible without any central theme whatsoever. Everything that happens is just a bad excuse of a real story. \n\nIf it is meant seriously on the other hand, it is just badly realised crap. An ugly looking crap with bad controls and a stupid story telling (If you want to call it like that). The whole stupid violence and crackbrained efforts to create disgust are simply plain dull. It may be controversial, it apparently was when it has been published, but I can\u2019t see anything that really provokes me. It is a childish Fantasising about violence without anything special about it. Any symbolism, metaphorical reference or any other medium of meaning is just soulless and meaningless. And I can\u2019t ignore that, because there is nothing else to focus: No remarkable gameplay, no special look or art style, no fun in playing this imbalanced mess.\n\nAnd that disappoints me very much. From Minute one I saw and I waited, fascinated from the dark (humorous) world full of quirkiness to actually deliver something. But anything that could have created some meaning in this pile of randomness came to nothing. All this references to: Atomic Weapons, religious extremism, bigotry, child abuse and murder, homophobia, the somehow creepy societies in small towns, peversion ... \u2013 all this is right there, ready to create meaning or at least a story. But the game just throws it in your face and then goes on never minding it again. There is nothing here. At all.

So you can expect an epicly gorey and surreal adventure. You'll want to try and explore every area of the game and you'll be surprised or shocked by some of the stuff you'll see.\n\nIf you remember the classic point and click adventure games, then you'd already know the fundamentals of playing this game. Click on things, Pick up items, Heavy dialog from various NPCs, Work out cryptic puzzles, Think about using an FAQ. All those natrual moments of point and click adventures will come to you. So if that thrills you, This is a title to pick up. If you need an extra push on the decision... here's the story.\n\nThe beauty of this game is basically waking up not knowing a single thing. You dont know where you are, who you are, or what you are meant to do. and after briefly talking to various people in the town, You find out you have amnesia. As you discover parts about yourself, you also learn the town you are in is not exactly like other towns. You have your average buildings like Schools, Police station, General store but the largest building in the centre of the town is The Lodge. No one in town knows whats inside but you'll need to gain access to it. If you manage to succeed, You might be lucky to actually understand what the whole story of this game is.\n\nAs for the violence and gore? Well there's definately a lot of that. There was several settings and scenarios that may upset some people and if I could admit, there was one particular scene I came across which even I was shocked by. The FMV movies have some porno-intro style acting but it gives the game a unique touch. \n\nIt might feel dated now, but the story and the enviroment you are traveling through. It feels like a surreal bad dream and for some reason, when things are so creepy or unusual we cant help but be curious to get more. So I'd say if you can get this game, Grab it.\n\n \n \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1429550863, "timestamp_updated": 1429550863, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15463804": {"recommendationid": "15463804", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073540985", "num_games_owned": 1812, "num_reviews": 85, "playtime_forever": 211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431674018}, "language": "english", "review": "Harvester is a point and click horror/adventure game from the 90s.

You play as a character called Steve who wakes up in town called Harvest somewhere in the 50's. He doesn't remember why or how he got there, and he can't recognize his not-so-idyllic family. Pretty soon he starts to realize that things are very, very wrong in this small town. And the only one besides Steve who realizes this, is his soon-to-be fiance who lives next door. The true nature Harvest will unveil as you progress through the game.\n\nGameplay is exactly like you would expect from any point and click adventure game from the 90's. You walk through different parts of the town gathering stuff and trying to figure out whats going on while talking to all the peculiar characters in the town. The game has its share of some flawed and obscure puzzles. The game also has some extremely clunky combat elements, but you won't be needing combat till much later in the game, so it doesn't really matter. \nYou can also kill every character in this game if you want to, but you'll be sent to the electric chair if theres any witnesses around.\n\nGraphics are pretty abysmal by todays standards, but I think it just brings more charm into this game. Not to mention all the greenscreen cutscenes which were so hilariously bad that they were funny as hell.\n\nOverall, this game is a rare gem and should be played by anyone who enjoys old-school adventure games and/or downright fucked up games.", "timestamp_created": 1428516442, "timestamp_updated": 1428523534, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499803", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15101874": {"recommendationid": "15101874", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001597265", "num_games_owned": 898, "num_reviews": 181, "playtime_forever": 151, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1427866371}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the most obscure yet interesting games i've had pleasure of playing.

1430682750}, "language": "english", "review": "Harvester is a sometimes uncomfortable mix of oddly done social commentary, and a collection of sometimes awful ironic funny moments delievered in the style of an odd D-List FMV game.\n\nYou play as Steve, the Plaid shirt wearing kidder of Harvester. You wonder around Harvester, trying to remember what's what as you suffer from amnesia all of a sudden. Harvester is from the odd age of PC games, or at least right at the end of it. The game is a point 'n' click, complete with odd plots, pixel hunting, and sometimes hilariously woeful animations, visualisations and 'great' voice acting. The game tries to mix things up near the end, with very mixed results, with some sections coming off as boring or weak compared to the rest of the game.\n\nThe quirk, is that nothing is ordinary. People are obsessed with anything, be it corpses, meat, wasps, or whatever else. FMV cutscenes tell the story hilariously. As mentioned before, the voice acting and ridiculous writing that would ruin any other game gives Harvester an excellent personality. Be it staring at Spinal Cords and thinking about pie, or be it becoming somewhat genuinely disturbing, Harvester's plot is memorable because of its plot is its greatest quirk.\n\nVisually, it\u2019s an FMV game, and you can tell by looking at it that it's an FMV. The characters feature quite a bit of animation considering this. Unfortunately, dialogue is not animated, but it is fully voiced by Harvester's all-star cast, which although all sound really odd, perfectly portray the screwed up world that Steve inhabits. The environments are extremely weird, and the cutscenes featuring full-motion video are extremely strange.\n\nThe soundtrack is very varied, featuring a variety of different music. Although it sometimes seems unsuitable, once again because of the weirdness this game strives in, I can't tell if this is intentional, or if it\u2019s just really shoddy design.\n\nOverall, there isn't much you can say about Harvester. Harvester is just a bloody weird game, and because Harvester is so weird, I have to recommend this to as many people as possible. The game is just weird, and deserves some attention now, being a breath of fresh air in the modern day of serious, competitive gaming.

I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I was going to.\n\nThe game took me 18 hours to complete, but that is because while playing I went back in saves to explored every possible outcome of each situation and to hear all the dialogue possible in each conversation depending on the questions I asked or answers I gave. If you rush through the game you can probably beat it in half that time.\n\n\nA few technical tips if you do pick up this game.\n\nSave often, especially later in the game. The game allows you to save 25 times before having to overwrite old saves. This is for 2 reasons. One, there are a lot of situations where there are different outcomes depending on what you say or do and you may want a recent save point to try out all the options without having to go back to an old save and repeat a bunch of stuff. Two, this game is run through DosBox and it has problems with skipping some of the cutscenes.\n\nIn the DosBox settings (steamapps\\common\\Harvester\\dosbox_windows\\dosbox_harvester.conf) you will want to set a certain cycle number to play at and then use the cycle down and up shortcuts (ctrl F11 & F12) while in game when you get to a cutscene that was skipped. I used these settings, but you may need to adjust them a little for your computer: cycles=28000, cycleup=20000, cycledown=20000, aspect=true. When a cutscene is skipped, load the previous save (beginning of that conversation if you are saving a lot), press F11 to drop the cycles down to allow the cutscene to play and then press F12 to bring them back up so the game plays faster and smooth again. I had to do this on probably about 20% of the cutscenes, the others played fine. You can also adjust your mouse sensitivity in the DosBox settings. You may notice that your mouse cursor moves horizontal faster than vertical, I could not fix this.\n\nYou may want to get a pen and paper while playing. When you talk to people in the game, new subjects will appear that you can talk about just like in most point and click games, but in Harvester you cannot click through every subject because sometimes when you pick one subject the others will not be there after. There is a box that says \"other\" and you can type in subjects to talk about, but you have to remember the exact title of the subject. I chose to write down the subjects each time I talked to someone and then crossed them off after I did each one. That way I can type in the others that disappeared and get to hear all the great dialogue.

You have a strange society and some kind of wisdom which promises you all the answers. Dialogues are believable, seems to be written by someone that actually knows how to do that (a fact that is not obvious in modern P&C games, where talking heads tells you bullshit)\nI like how this game presents some human instincts like a jealousy. \nHarvester is still actual when we are talking about media and things like food production. Sometimes it seems to be pretensious but for the story of a young guy it`s acceptable. \nIf you want to buy an adventure game and have a dilema between Harvester and a new 3d Broken Sword, choose a Harvester. And if you have to choose between Harvester and one of these modern pseudo artistic - adventure maker based - shit, choose Harvester. \nBut remember: Do not overdose FMV games. It hurts your brain.

Now let me start off by saying Harvester is NOT for everyone. Do I  myself love this game? Yes I do but for those easily offended or for those faint of heart I suggest staying away although I highly recommend the game it's audience is not aimed at those people but if you are still curious I would say it's worth looking into for sure just be prepared for what you are getting yourself into.\n\nYou start off the game with some 90's FMV sequences and the introduction of your main character Steve. Oh what a kidder Steve is along his journey he will uncover who he is and what is the deal with this Stepford Suburbian's town of Harvest. There will be many a zany characters in this such as the soon to be stepdad who loves meat human or otherwise , the gay firemen.....dare I say they are flaming!? , The Wasp Woman and even your own mom be careful on asking her to have sex she just might take you up on that offer......uh.. yeah okay. Anyways the mechanic's are your typical point and click fashion except no real way to get permanently stuck thank goodness but I would recommend saving often. You never know when that Officer who has no legs with PTSD will gun you down and set off the rockets killing you all.\n\nYou will soon be introudced to all these characters and the more important ones such as Stephanie your soon to be wife who is in the same situation as you are with no recollection of what happened before or what is going on now and the Sergeant at Arms who is associated with this \"lodge\" everyone in town is obsessed with.

A relic from a bygone era deserving of its' cult status\n\nThe games worst aspect is its combat, no question. The first 2 acts are traditional point and click style with the 3rd heavily incorporating combat additionally. Whilst you CAN kill people in the first 2 acts there aren't many reasons to do so and there are consequences, many of them fail states. So when it came time to unleash I found it a welcome change of pace which added a nice, albeit frustrating at times, survival horror element towards the end. I managed to quite enjoy it despite its shortcomings but I understand why that isn't a popular sentiment. The timing of attacks is mostly luck but choosing the right weapon can make things a lot easier. Also there are opportunities to talk your way around some confrontations.\n\nIf you are a horror fan (particularly if you have an eye for satire/ social commentary) and are craving an interesting story (even if, like myself, you aren't overly fond of the point and click genre) you owe it to yourself to pick this up at some point and persevere 'til the bitter end/s.\n\nIf you're the type to take the Metacritic score into account I advise you to take note of the disparity between the critical and user reviews.\n\nThere's also a GOG version if you'd prefer.\n\n. . . and if you'd like to see a review which mostly echoes my feelings toward Harvester then this LGR review is pretty close but it contains some SPOILERS, so fair warning.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtjAsQIPauY", "timestamp_created": 1415526284, "timestamp_updated": 1511425545, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 45, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.728923", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12826352": {"recommendationid": "12826352", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067054480", "num_games_owned": 357, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1417422257}, "language": "russian", "review": "Harvester -

I almost had fun accidentally punching children in the face when I meant to talk to them. The relatively small overworld map was enjoyable to watch change throughout the game's timeline, and a massive amount of the game is optional - from hidden weapons and rooms to entire areas of the overworld map having absolutely no effect on the plot (The Wasp Woman and Military Base in particular). \n\nWhat Harvester tries to be is a dark comedy with a few sobering morals. Age has changed what it is though, from an era where FMVs and basic 3d modelling were standard to one where their very existence is hilariously archaic. \n\nThe game hasn't just become camp, it's become on of the most stupidly camp games you could - and should - ever play. The absurdly gory deaths are no longer shocking moments, they're punchlines - watching the digitized actors dramatically spread eagle on 3d rendered backdrops that could pass for a high school student's school project results is so bad that it's brilliant.\n\nI'd recommend Harvester to anyone who's in for a camp adventure in the vein of watching 13 year olds from yesteryear try to be dark and cool, and doesn't mind always being a kidder, Steve.\n\nBe warned, however, that this isn't a true port - it's DOSBOX.

Actually the trend of juvenile violence relating to video games has experienced a downward trend since the formation of the ESRB in 1994, so the premise is no longer true (and here in 2014 we can laugh about it). But the overall message is obscured by the game. Its only concern is to get you to play \"minor pranks\" that will ultimately turn Steve into a serial killer. As the game goes on, it gets more and more ridiculous. The newspaper boy has a pistol that he'll shoot you with if you don't put the newspaper outside (the game even acknowledges the ridiculousness of that), Loomis the sheriff's deputy is beaten with a newspaper like a dog by the sherriff if he catches him beating his meat in a jail cell, a teacher actually beats a child's head in with a baseball bat for asking a question during a nuclear bomb drill, the firefighters are all gay and drive a pink fire truck.

Clicking on stuff gives most of the time funny descriptions.\nLike \"this plastic plant has been recently watered\", \"this plastic plant is dying\" and many other very funny variations. This plastic plant joke will become a true inside joke throughout the game. Then you get to the living room and find a kiddo watching black and white TV. The first dialog happens when you will ask him one of the following questions:\n- Who are you?\n- Who am I?\n- Where am I?\nThat made me seriously LMFAO.\nWell, you got the picture. All the game is like this, with absolutely crazy people, funny dialogs, and incredible stupidity. The acting is bad -- on purpose. However the voices are good.\n\nThis game is a point and click adventure parody. But it's not just that. The main story will keep you playing. How comes you know about color TV when those rednecks have no idea it exists? Why don't you remember anything? Why are they... so strange?\n\nYou will encounter lots of people in this small town, from a waistless vet protecting a nuclear site, to \"feminine\" firemen and a teacher that loves to have a ... \"goodtime\" with little children... This town is completely crazy and you will definitely want to know why and how you did get dragged into this crappy situation.\n\nI had lots of fun the first day in the game. Talking to everyone, blackmailling people and stuff. However, you will get stuck pretty quick, having no idea what you should be doing. Items\u2019 purposes are hard to figure out. I was so stuck that I had to check the walkthrough -- just to know where I was supposed to go. \u201cDamn, yeah, I missed this tiny white pixel which was a light switch\u201d... and so on. Very frustrating.\n\nWhat really turned me down was the end of the game, which is super lame. All was going fine, with your everyday weird routine, like giving the newspaper in the morning instead of being it given to you, chitchatting with people about commies and gay firemen, peepholing on your GF and watching her undress (eheh). Until you reach... a certain point where the story goes litteraly FUBAR. No more plot, no story, no details anymore. You will just whack you way till the end of the game... and learn the truth. Everything will be explained don't worry. But... that will be super lame.\n\nOverall this game is good for a solid 3/4 of the story. But the plot dissapoints. The story feels so unfinished, what a letdown. There are bugs too, so save often on different slots. The combat system is super  s h i t  but that's meant to be. Some FMV scenes are a bit disturbing which were the cause of the game ban in various countries. But, even though there is an excess of blood and violence, all of that is not serious. We are in a parody all right.\n\nUnfortunately, this was not enough -- for me -- to recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1400417292, "timestamp_updated": 1400426551, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581774", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10158538": {"recommendationid": "10158538", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136742887", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 251, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1400283864}, "language": "german", "review": "Das mit Abstand schlimmste Game das mir je untergekommen ist. Dies will ich jedoch nicht einfach nur so in den Raum werfen.\nZur Verdeutlichung: Das Spiel verf\u00fcgt \u00fcber \u00fcberspitzte Gewalt. Gut das haben wir in Games wie Phantasmagoria und Konsorten genauso aber... das Schlimme an der Geschichte ist ja, dass das Spiel einem oft nur die Entscheidung zwischen gewaltt\u00e4tigem tot und gewaltt\u00e4tigem tot bzw. in einigen Dingen \u00fcberhaupt keine Entscheidungsfreiheit l\u00e4sst. Es behandelt Themen wie Kindermord, Selbstmord, Massensterben etc. ohne jegliche Sensibilit\u00e4t. Und da das nicht schlimm genug ist, muss alles auch noch sch\u00f6n in Sequenzen explizit dargestellt werden. Ein Kind mit Loch im Kopf, dass die Lehrerin zum Spa\u00df reingeschlagen hat- keine Konsequenzen. Der Charakter den man spielt reagiert da nicht weiter drauf. Man selbst t\u00f6tet (ohne zu viel zu spoilern) und findet auch Leichen... oder muss einer um ihr totes Kind (was uns das Spiel auch wieder unter die Nase halten muss) trauernden Mutter noch das Letzte nehmen was ihr bleibt und ihr Restaurant niederbrennen um im Spiel weiter zu kommen. Das hat noch zur Folge, dass sie sich erh\u00e4ngt (wieder extra in einer absurden Sequenz dargestellt) aber das Spiel wiederum hat keinerlei Sinn f\u00fcr Sensibilit\u00e4t im Bezug auf bestimmte Themen.\nDie Gewalt wird entweder verherrlicht oder als \"normal\" abgetan und der Spieler muss immer wieder einfach mitmachen.\nDabei sind weder die Bewohner (welche teilweise schlimmer sind als die Szenen, da ihre Kommentare das komplette Geschehen noch \u00fcbler gestalten) noch die eigene Hauptfigur glaubw\u00fcrdig.\nIch habe das Spiel als Livestream gezockt und kann nur sagen \"Finger weg\".\nDie Zuschauer und ich waren oft kurz davor, das Ganze abzubrechen und haben letzten Endes beschlossen in der Hoffnung vlt. ein ordentliches Ende zu erhalten, die Session durchzuziehen.\nEs mag sein das die Locations vielf\u00e4ltig und einfallsreich sind, aber durch die absurden Szenen und erzwungenen, moralisch jedoch nicht zu unterst\u00fctzenden Handlungen, ist es einfach nur schlecht.\nDavon ab l\u00e4sst das ungenaue Gameplay sehr zu w\u00fcnschen \u00fcbrig und durch einige Bugs m\u00fcssen gelegentlich Screens neu geladen werden oder Zusammenh\u00e4nge werden einfach weggelassen. \n(manchmal vlt. sogar zum Vorteil, da einige bereits tot, sind ohne das man wieder Hand anzulegen braucht oder sich eine weitere schlechte Splatterszene anschauen muss)\n\nDas Game h\u00e4tte viel Potential gehabt, hat es aber durch die Umsetzung wirklich komplett in den Sand gesetzt. \nDer Streamchat und ich waren froh, als das Trauerspiel endlich ein Ende gefunden hat und wir wissen, welches Game wir sicherlich nicht noch einmal anr\u00fchren werden.\nDas Beste ist eigentlich, dass man nach solch einem Machtwerk des brutalen Schunds die wirklich guten Games noch einmal richtig zu sch\u00e4tzen wei\u00df und auch Titel wie Phantasmagoria mit ganz anderen Augen betrachtet.", "timestamp_created": 1400414235, "timestamp_updated": 1400414970, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500637", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10149562": {"recommendationid": "10149562", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012310051", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 719, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518183225}, "language": "italian", "review": "Ok recensire questo gioco non \u00e8 facile: la trama \u00e8 complicata e sopra le righe, disturbante, mentre il sistema di gioco \u00e8 arcaico e superato...ma la vera domanda \u00e8: nel 2014 esiste qualcosa di lontanamente paragonabile che possa restituire le stesse sensazioni di Harvester? La risposta \u00e8 semplice: assolutamente no. Non avevo mai giocato a questo gioco prima d'ora e mi sono ritrovato a finirlo dall'inizio alla fine senza riprendere fiato.

Qualche consiglio? Provate a non dare mai il giornale la mattina al bambino o attaccate la donna nella casa con le vespe.\nA conti fatti consiglio questo gioco agli amanti dell'horror e del surreale che troveranno una trama complessa ed appagante, con delle scene talmente disgustose e disturbanti che almeno una volta vi volterete dall'altra parte.", "timestamp_created": 1400344035, "timestamp_updated": 1400344035, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551282", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10133563": {"recommendationid": "10133563", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984120598", "num_games_owned": 393, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 630, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456327023}, "language": "english", "review": "Leave it to Beaver + Twin Peaks + Troma Films + Looney Tunes = Harvester\n\nIf you can get past the clunky controls and have a completely warped sense of humor buy this game right f'n now!", "timestamp_created": 1400203593, "timestamp_updated": 1400203593, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500352", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10115992": {"recommendationid": "10115992", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064266957", "num_games_owned": 388, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1400128501}, "language": "english", "review": "most fucked up game ive ever played", "timestamp_created": 1400128540, "timestamp_updated": 1400128580, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499995", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10106977": {"recommendationid": "10106977", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069147046", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 77, "playtime_forever": 282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496057460}, "language": "english", "review": "Overated piece of shit.", "timestamp_created": 1400039376, "timestamp_updated": 1400039376, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500033", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10096012": {"recommendationid": "10096012", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982942764", "num_games_owned": 1431, "num_reviews": 117, "playtime_forever": 261, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1399926821}, "language": "english", "review": "This game made me want to kill people, forget my reality, and maybe even be a harvester my self...\nThen again.\nI always were a kidder...\n\nI can only ask you to actually play this your self, and if needed follow a guide on how to advance in it, the atmosphere, the setting, sound and looks are... either new to you, or could bring back many memories.\nThe game it self has a high level of try harding.

(I might SPOIL some parts of the game or more so don't read if you hate spoilers)\n\nThe best way I can describe Harvester in my opinion is the perfect serial killer simulator because of the bizarre atmosphere of the town of Harvest, the unsettling NPCs of this small town like Mr. Pottsham (obsessed with meat) who is a molester & a pervert who likes watching Stephanie 24/7 (I don't blame him Stephanie has nice cur...... errr let's continue) or Steve's \"mother\" who is an extreme BDSM enthusiast (That bitch has all sorts of other issues which I won't mention) & don't forget the stages of a serial killer which you can read here http://www.criminalmindsfanwiki.com/page/Psychological+Phases if you wish.\n\nPuzzle wise the game wants you to think illogical & dangerous the entire game so you have all the time in the world to do stupid crap before you get the electric chair by the corrupt police who are extremely delusional, lazy & idiotic towards real crimes like arson or attempted murder, the combat is the biggest flaw the game has because it is cringeworthy & broken the entire game so it is based on luck but I forgive this flaw because Harvester gave amazing writing from Gilbert P. Austin who is the same guy who made Wing Commander 2 so to me it looks like he never made a horror game before https://archive.today/YFfTK but sometimes inexperience is the best thing just take a look at the success of Goldeneye 64 which was made by inexperienced devs. https://archive.today/iMybh\n\nPros:\n\n1. Amazing story\n\n2. Bizarre atmosphere\n\n3. Unsettling NPCs\n\n4. Very fucked up\n\n5. Awesome Music like this piano piece for example http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf1krRBwjRE (The rest of the game's music is a masterpiece)\n\nCons:\n\n1. Shitty combat\n\n2. A few items like the tampons for example are useless\n\nOverall this game is worth the time & money if your not offended easily so I suggest everyone to play this cult classic title because today's horror can't make gems like these anymore & besides Steve was always a kidder so give him some slack.\n\nUPDATE: I found an interview about the Stephanie actress & how she ended up working for Gilbert Austin https://www.facebook.com/notes/harvester-pc-game/interview-lisa-cangelosi/525709370815394\n\nFor a bonus this is what she does now for a living http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORv8qPXavh4\n\nUPDATE 2: Here is a two part interview with the mastermind of Harvester https://www.facebook.com/notes/harvester-pc-game/interview-gilbert-austin-part-1/619663171420013 \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/notes/harvester-pc-game/interview-gilbert-austin-part-2/702809679772028\n\nUPDATE 3: Here is an interview with the voice of Steve & the Sergeant at Arms https://www.facebook.com/notes/harvester-pc-game/interview-ryan-wickerham/588985577821106\n\nUPDATE 4: Here is an interview with the actor who played our fav character Steve https://www.facebook.com/notes/harvester-pc-game/interview-kurt-kistler/544620568924274\n\nFor a bonus this is where he is now http://mugshots.com/US-Counties/Texas/Dallas-County-TX/Kurt-Stephen-Kistler.8684252.html\n\nUPDATE 5: Here is an interview with the composer of Harvester https://www.facebook.com/notes/harvester-pc-game/interview-hamilton-altstatt/575250429194621", "timestamp_created": 1398877844, "timestamp_updated": 1496598947, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.705014", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9976809": {"recommendationid": "9976809", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963566246", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 41, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1399788952}, "language": "english", "review": "Play this game.", "timestamp_created": 1398834129, "timestamp_updated": 1398834129, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.999658", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9896110": {"recommendationid": "9896110", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975109538", "num_games_owned": 611, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 341, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1398456738}, "language": "german", "review": "Meat & Gore! ... turn on your Brain and beat the most violent classic adventure game in history. 11/10 truly!", "timestamp_created": 1398127162, "timestamp_updated": 1398127162, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9837509": {"recommendationid": "9837509", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960420760", "num_games_owned": 321, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1435805492}, "language": "english", "review": "I remember buying this game for $1 (sealed) at a tag sale around 1998 when I was ten years old.

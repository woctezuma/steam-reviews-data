Purtroppo li presi su Impulse/Gamestop e su Steam la collezione pare monca. Peccato perch\u00e8 non erano male.\nIl terzo \u00e8 diviso in 4 parti e mi ha deluso moltissimo: ho bocciato tutti e quattro i sottocapitoli, anche per il fatto che hanno diviso in 4 un gioco che come lunghezza era paragonabile ai primi due e al quarto: un completo nonsense. E anche per l'estenuante backtracking.\nPer il quarto che dire. Beh, \u00e8 bellissimo.\n\nDiciamo subito che ci sono state almeno un paio di circostanze in cui ho riso di gusto. Ma non sorridendo, proprio ridendo come un fesso davanti lo schermo. Il protagonista Boyle \u00e8 un soggettone che vuole fare il cattivone (in passato lo era) ed \u00e8 promesso sposo ad una strega cattiva (Ingrid): i due si beccano in continuazione durante tutto il gioco, e non solo, ci sono stati momenti con altri personaggi davvero piacevoli, che mi hanno appunto strappato pi\u00f9 risate.\nIl gioco \u00e8 lungo (tra 35 e 40 ore se si decide di portare tutte le missioni a termine), anche se per qualche missione permane il problema del backtracking (soprattutto una quest relativa alla formazione di una congrega delle streghe, ma ne vale la pena per avere una maledizione finale che fa un fracco di danni).\n\nLe missioni sono appuntate su un diario e mano a mano che si risolvono vengono cancellate, quindi il tutto \u00e8 molto pulito e ordinato. Anche se l'uso dell'inventario per gestire gli oggetti \u00e8 molto scomodo, perch\u00e8 bisogna scorrerli sempre uno ad uno non potendo gestire le loro priorit\u00e0 (ad esempio, se durante un combattimento un personaggio muore bisogna scorrere tutti gli oggetti per trovare quello che permette la resurrezione e questo viene messo in fondo alla lista).\n\nC'\u00e8 molto di avventura grafica oltre ai combattimenti, con enigmi (bella la parte dentro il castello in cui bisogna capire cosa fare per procedere tra le stanze inizialmente inibite) e la disposizione dei mondi verso cui viaggiare \u00e8 abbastanza intelligente, anche se a volte si dimenticano i nomi delle locazioni e si fa fatica a ricordare dove andare. Ma c'\u00e8 anche una specie di netherworld che permette di fare viaggi veloci e leggere i nomi delle locazioni di arrivo su comodi cartelli. Verso la fine si sblocca anche la nave e si pu\u00f2 anche viaggiare liberamente.\n\nA parte il backtraking (che per questa tipologia di gioco \u00e8 sempre presente e a volte \u00e8 snervante perch\u00e8 alcuni passaggi sono labirintici e si vorrebbe evitare di rifarli pi\u00f9 volte) evidenzio tre altri difetti:\n\n1- le missioni secondarie sono piacevoli, ma a volte lo sforzo non d\u00e0 grandi soddisfazioni finali, o perch\u00e8 l'oggetto acquisito \u00e8 inutile o perch\u00e8 magari in precedenza si era gi\u00e0 presa un'arma (o armatura) potente in un'altra missione e ci si ritrova come premio di missione qualcosa di pi\u00f9 scarso. Inoltre le missioni non rilasciano esperienza: secondo me avrebbero dovuto implementarla. Anche perch\u00e8...\n\n2- la sezione finale \u00e8 davvero sproporzionata in quanto a difficolt\u00e0 rispetto il resto del gioco (non impareranno mai a gestire questo aspetto, mai). In genere combattimenti contro nemici nuovi e boss sono piacevoli e ben misurati, ma poi si arriva sulla Montagna del Teschio e si scopre di avere di fronte nemici troppo OverPowered, boss finale compreso. Qui ho faticato un po', e sono stato costretto a tornare indietro per finire altre missioni, trovando armature migliori, e livellare maggiormente.\n\n3- la trama generale non \u00e8 proprio chiara e nel complesso non ha molto mordente. Per fortuna Boyle ed Ingrid tengono alto lo spirito dell'avventura.\n\nBelle le locazioni, belle alcune pensate (interruttori che modificano ad esempio la conformazione di un livello) e bella la sequenza finale (con battuta epica finale di Boyle) in cui si inserisce anche una sequenza che dipende dalla romance intrapresa durante il gioco. C'\u00e8 pure la cosa scema a chiudere.\n\nLo consiglio vivamente, lo ritengo l'episodio pi\u00f9 riuscito tra i quattro Aveyond.\n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1506190463, "timestamp_updated": 1506192276, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514349", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34909583": {"recommendationid": "34909583", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130552357", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1630, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507664803}, "language": "english", "review": "So prior to this game I had only played Ahriman's Prophecy and loved it.

However, it's not an Aveyond game. Yes there are references here and there in conversation, but the only thing that makes this game by definition an Aveyond game is the presence of the holy land of Aveyond itself. You could change the name of that place and erase the 5 or 6 references you get in passing and you wouldn't even know it was part of the series. Like I said before I don't think this is a bad game, but it just doesn't have the feeling of being on a proper quest to save the world. In every Aveyond prior to this, there has been a real threat of an evildoer plotting some grand plan, and you are sent on a quest to stop this from happening, running into all sorts of plot twists, tricky puzzles and difficult enemies along the way. In this game, [spoiler] you start off on a quest to find your dog, and even when the game seems to pull out the dramatic plot of an evil demon, [/spoiler] the main characters brush it off as a joke, leaving the whole plot lacking to feel of a real, important goal.\n\nAnother aspect of the game that I believe sets it aside for the rest of the series is the amount of consistencies of the series that were broken:\n[list]\n[*]There is little to no mention of Thais or the Pendragons\n[*]The menus work in a completely different way (i.e. no numbers on health/mana bars when using items, an individual equip menu for every character in their profile instead of one equip menu for everyone, the unappealing new layout of the home menu (especially when trying to use keys to quickly navigate the screen) etc.)\n[*]New interactions with spells (i.e. a spell may hit a random number of times, hit a random enemy/random enemies, hit the hero party etc).\n[*]Plently of memorable item, monster and character sprites were removed (which seems petty, but alongside everything else it kind of just sealed the deal)\n[/list]\nI feel like any one of these things could be implemented without alienating the game from the series, but all 3 along with others I might not have said are definitely a rather large shock.\n\nAs I have already eluded to, I also believe this game relies too much on it's comedic value to hold the player's interest in the plot (and the game as a whole). I had my fair share of good laughs during the Orbs of Magic series (usually during exchanges between Te'ijal and Galahad), and yes they made the games all the more enjoyable and added a sense of personality to the characters, but what keeps me going back to those games (as well as Aveyond 1 and 2) is the sense of completion I get every time I complete a quest, defeat a difficult enemy or ultimately finish the game. But because of all the satire and lack of suspense as to the final boss' plans, I found myself at the end of this game without even realising it. The feeling of approaching the climax of the story (i.e. the final showdown to stop your enemy's plan once and for all) just wasn't there. The fact that so many quests are left out of your journal for you to figure out on your own (i.e. [spoiler] the whole ordeal involving the two wizards and their towers [/spoiler]) didn't help either, as I went into the final fight fully expecting futher story development involving those side quests that I had assumed would come up later. (Please note that I am not saying the unwritten side quests were a negative addition. They are a great source of replay value and add that extra sense of completion to the game. However they should probably be pushed further to the side so as to not interfere with the apparent progression of the main storyline, or else they may actually withdraw from the sense of completion as it did with me).\n\nAnother note that I should make is that the number of highly problematic bugs in the game (at least at the time I played it) is rather alarming. Some characters don't show up during cutscenes, images may be doubled (i.e. [spoiler] a tile showing glowing eyes in a hollow tree shows a duplicate beneath itself on the misty mountain as the start of the game [/spoiler] ). And even carrying certain items interfered with menu interactions.\n\nI love the Aveyond series dearly, and I did thoroughly enjoy this game. I did get a good sense of completion for all the quests I finished and secrets i found. However, it just doesn't fit the epic fantasy adventure RPG role that the series demands of any addition. I find it to be more of a sort of parody of the series.

Boyle makes for a fun and interesting \"hero\". The side characters are just as interesting and the dialog is well written..\n - The art is, as usual, beautiful.

While a game can be boring if it is too linear, this game would have benefitted from more clear direction.\n - The story started out strong, but fell apart toward the middle. \n - Backtracking. A lot of tedious back and forth, zig zagging all over. It got pretty boring.\n - The locations, while beautiful, felt small and cramped. The overall world map felt like each continent / island was stuck together on a too-small map at the end. Where previous games felt open and vast, this one felt small and squished.\n - The ending. No spoilers, but it was a letdown. I kept saying to myself \"That's it?\". Pretty disappointing.\n\nOverall, the game started out strong but seemed to lose it's way around the middle.

Not a problem but without maps included it is hellacious trying to figure out how to get back to a previous location. Between the ferry, mist portal and ship....I don't know which way is up.

The storyline is both deep and hilarious, and the characters are, for the most part, engaging.\n\nThis game incorporates the traditional elements of puzzle-solving, action, and adventure into a neat and enjoyable package. There are the usual elements of high fantasy, with the characters ruthlessly poking fun at themselves. The enemies are creative and fun to fight.\n\nBecause they are failed villains, Boyle and Ingrid are unhappily in love, and that storyline adds ongoing humorous elements. Myst and Robin are naive and make good foils for Boyle and Ingrid. Hi\u2019beru and Rowen arrive later in the game, and Phye arrives so late I did wonder why he was included at all. As a Draghar, Phye does have some power, but I think like a writer, so in my opinion, all the characters should be in place at the midpoint. Because he arrives so close to the end, we don\u2019t get to know him as well as I would have liked.\n\nI purchased the game the day it was released. I have played the game through to the end four times. The first time through, I had Ingrid join Lorelei\u2019s coven and married her off to Boyle. With that scenario the game played smoothly with no glitches. I was in love with the game!\n\nThe second time through I had Ingrid join Jinx\u2019s coven, but when I tried to complete the task of selling the craft in Robin\u2019s store, the game froze and I had to take drastic measures to close the game down. No matter what I did, in this scenario the game froze at that point every time.\n\nSo I went to their website and, following the suggestions in their forums, I reinstalled the game. I never got past that point on that particular attempt.\n\nSo I started a new game, and that time I had her join the transformations coven. This went well for the most part, but with one major flaw. Ingrid gained the ability to transform into a dragon, but the skill didn\u2019t appear in her menu. When I went out to the forums to see how to solve that, the answer was that it would be resolved in the next build. I was disappointed, as I did want to have the ability to play her as a dragon.\n\nHowever, that time I married Ingrid off to Hi\u2019beru, which was cute.\n\nThe environments that the game is set in are lush and beautiful, dark and moody. The music is amazing and really contributes to the enjoyment of the game.\n\nThe game is fun, hilarious, and when it works properly, it\u2019s a great way to spend 25 or so hours.\n", "timestamp_created": 1455677061, "timestamp_updated": 1455677061, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531250", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21250527": {"recommendationid": "21250527", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026026011", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455623297}, "language": "english", "review": "I received a free download key for this in exchange for leaving a review as I purchased the game from the website directly.

The dialog is funny, clever, cute and well-written.  All the grammar and spelling is correct (one of my pet peeves is games with incorrect grammar and spelling, the Aveyond ones are safe from that).\nThis is an RPG Maker game with very cute sprites.  The sprites are very nice, and you can actually tell which sprite is which character.  The art (the non-RPG maker generated art) is lovely; the character art in particular was great, with very expressive faces (that actually looked like realistic emotions instead of something out of a Looney Toon).\n\nI recommend this to anyone with a good sense of humor, and anyone who likes RPGs.  If you liked the other Aveyond games, you'll almost certainly enjoy this.

I completed the game in a blind playthrough in about 26 1/2 hours between Steam and the non-steam installer.\n\nThis game has all of the humor of the other games in the series, but has the unique twist of featuring a villain as the protagonist!  Some of the ongoing storylines from previous games find their way into this one as various cameos, which will appeal to fans of the series.\n\nAs for the game itself, it's a fairly easy to pick up RPG.  Instead of the archetypical classes you find in other fantasy based games, each character has their own set of skills and abilities, and each character obtains their abilities in different ways.\n\nThe story is engaging, and even the side quests are interesting and entertaining.  My only complaint is that the difficulty of the monsters in the last zone of the game is FAR above the difficulty found in the rest of the game... for instance, the monsters in the previous zone would hit my characters for 1, but in the final zone could kill with bad RNG.\n\nAside from that nitpick, the game feels polished and plays well on an XBox One controller, despite having to use an analog stick instead of a D-pad.

Each of the games is their own experience, and while in certain narrative ways Aveyond 4 feels like a regression, as far as gameplay goes, the series has grown in some fantastic ways. Though I feel as though the protagonist was the wrong choice for this game, the game maps are extensive and rewarding, and the arc of the game is smooth and fulfilling. The way the game plays is excellent, and the narrative aspect mostly provides context for how to view it, so although I was largely disappointed in the story of the game, I loved Aveyond 4 as a whole.\n\nOverall, I had a great experience and would wholly recommend it. That said, this review is largely narrative critique. \n\nTHE NARRATIVE:\n\nNarratively, Boyle felt like the wrong choice for the protagonist. He is not engaging as a main character--the humor regarding 'retired villains' and 'heroes' fell flat, and it felt reductive. The best part about him was his relationship with his dog, but that dedication is not enough to make a protagonist. An attempt at humor regarding evildoing in a comical tone is not enough to make a protagonist, either. While the backstory about how he found his dog as a pup was touching, it does not offer strong enough motive for him to be the main character of this story. He is mostly a static character. While he does admit that doing good is pretty good, it is dulled by the joke of it all, and the retired supervillain aspect diminishes the entire relationship of good and evil. Basically, it seems as though he was truly good all along, and the only amount of growth is in his awareness of this, and it is not enough to drive an entire game. His personal stake in this journey is not, narratively, the strongest one.\n\nBoyle is looking for his dog; Myst is looking for her brother. In order to find his dog, Boyle must find Myst's brother, who was snatched by a demon. Even the game's title, \"Shadow Of The Mist\", suggests that Myst is the one with more to lose, here. Boyle plays the reluctant hero, but it is irritating to have what feels so much like Myst's story filtered through this flat, reductive joke of a retired supervillain. Myst has never been away from the mountain, and while she also needs to find her little brother, she longs to see the sights outside of The Mist. She has so much to learn, so far to go. She has the most reason to go on this journey to defeat the demon and save her brother, and she has the farthest to grow. She is the most dynamic character, at a tipping point of her life.\n\nIf Myst were the main character, the framing of this game would've been much more powerful--and it would've offered a kind of serious beauty to it, too. In that way, it would mirror Aveyond 2, which was personally an extremely successful, gorgeous game with a very gentle, fairy-tale like story. This still would've been light-hearted in (many ways, and a grand heartfelt adventure, but it would've also had the background context of a fairy-tale. This game could've so easily been absolutely incredible, beautiful, had Myst been the protagonist. She has every reason to be. Also, her background as a Myst Wraith is so much more compelling than the dull, simplifying joke of the Retired Supervillain.\n\nTHE GAMEPLAY: \n\nThe maps are beautiful. They are detailed, extensive, and so very rewarding. The chests are set up so that they can be seen when strolling on the most obvious paths, and while it does take some challenge to look for them, it is not to the point of frustration. Taking the effort to go the long way around for a chest that was seen ten minutes earlier is always worth the effort. The color schemes of the maps are brilliant, well-thought, and the layouts of all the buildings are varied, textured, not tired and reused. Each part of the journey has its own distinctive map which feels like its own little area within a larger world, which helps create a better idea of this lush, full world of Aveyond. The only complaint here is that some of the maps are so ambitious that they lag on soe systems. I also loved how purposeful all the sidequests were; everything was important.\n\nThe battle system is set up in a spin of the traditional turn-based system. It makes battles so much less tedious. Each character has a different role in battle, with their own pros and cons, and it is very fun to think about how best to use each character. Myst has a few different abilities, including a healing and shapeshifting one, and using these abilities does not require a cost of mana or skill point, although it does mean that these abilities aren't as powerful as ones that would have a cost. Boyle's darkness points are replenished with physical attacks, and he uses these same points to cast magic, and it is very fun to have a wizard type who is also a formidable physical attacker--in addition to his minion, whose attacks add additional damage at every turn. Those are only two of the characters, but all of them have roles that aren't so simple as deducting a mana / skill point cost. The character battle roles are fun, and the battles demand a measure of attention that makes it so they aren't a matter of grinding through the same predictable battle rhythm again and again. It's more fluid than that.\n\nThe only thing I would say is that there are many characters who get introduced too late in the game to really develop an affection for them, or a feel for their role in battle, so they don't get the opportunity to shine. It's more difficult to care about them, when there is so little time to get familiar with them.\n\nLASTLY:\n\nIn a lot of ways, I do not think Aveyond is the right arena to even attempt deconstructing Heroes or Villains--that seems more the space of cape comics and games inspired by those. It felt odd and uncomfortable to reference that type of Hero vs. Villain relationship in a largely original, fantastical world such as Aveyond. Also uncomfortable in the game was the way sprites from popular anime series appeared in prominent side quest characters, as if, no one would notice Hetalia sprites or Chi from Chobits acting in ways that seemed to serve no purpose, no reference, to their original series at all. It was not right to include representations of those licensed designs in this original game being sold for its own profit. Original sprites should have been made by the Aveyond team. Both of these aspects broke immersion of Aveyond as the world of Aveyond, an original fantasy world with, largely, its own mythos which does at times reference outside ones, like Aveyond 2 and the Snow Queen, and moments like referencing the Fruit of the (Greek) Gods (a pomegranate) in Aveyond 1.  \n\nIn terms of media representation, the Aveyond series made such an impact on me as a kid realizing that girls and women were powerful, complex characters, and to see them in positions of power, as heroes unqualified by the acts of men, it was incredible. And honestly, if I wanted to play a game about a man, I'd look literally anywhere else. That was one of the first reasons why Boyle failed as a protagonist for me. He has nothing to add to the conversation. He is not refreshing in any way. There are countless characters like him, and there are so few respectful representations of women in games, especially Fantasy ones known for their trope of women as reward for the (male) hero's triumphs, damsels in distress, or as vile and petty temptations of evil.\n\nAll this said: I loved this game. It may be because I played it most recently, but it was my favorite game to play. But, narratively, it doesn't compare with Aveyond 1 or Aveyond 2 and the way those games stayed in my heart. I still had a blast, though, and am looking forward to replaying it\n\n*Disclaimer: I received a free Steam key for this review, and I originally got the game elsewhere.", "timestamp_created": 1454648710, "timestamp_updated": 1454648842, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20962569": {"recommendationid": "20962569", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044642049", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 52, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454648033}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been a fan of Aveyond games since the first one came out, and Aveyond 4 is no exception.

Mainly because I kinda didn't like the art. It really could have been better. \n\nThe music on the other hand was (and I quote Sid!) grandiose! Music (for me) is the most important thing in a video game lacking voice over. aveyond 4 blew my mind with its music. My favorite tracks were the ones playing in Ulrock, Delamere and Halaina. \n\nThe story was really fun; I enjoyed every bit of it. And I loved how every party member had their own little endings and the consequences of the sidequest we played too!\n\nMy favorites were Myst and Hi'beru. Really loved it when Myst angered Boyle. And how Hi'beru always came to rescue when dreams were involved.. and that ending with the gladiator? Priceless!!!\n\nI had Ingrid paired with Phye in my game just because I didn't like her with Boyle. Call me silly, but I think he and Myst have much more chemistry :P\n\nBesides, Ingrid deserves a strong man and Phye was prefect.\n\nHinting that Boyle has some connections with the Pendragons was interested. I'd love to see this idea being expand on in the future. It really sets the bases for a new game *wink wink*\n\n \nRegarding the curse; my theory is that Boyle did break it. Remember that moment when he was like \"Fang is my true love\"? this is a type of unconditional love. Because as far as I know, love extends beyond romance type. So, I think Ingrid knows that too but didn't tell Boyle else her plan will fail. Anyone else thinking the same thing?\n\n \n\nA side note; mentioning the suggested subtitles for the game which was posted originally on Facebook dring the ending scene actually made me scream because I was one of the peeps who suggested a subtitle for Aveyond and my submission was considered (albeit for a book about Boyle but anyway)! It made me really, really,really,really,REALLY HAPPY to see it in-game. Thanks so much Aveyond Dev team!\n\n \n\n Oh and since I also got the strategy guide, I'd like to point out that it's not as helpful as I expected. I found myself surfing the forums more than reading the guide. \n\nFor example, it only mentioned that Myst can get a bear amulet but doesn't mention how to get it and from where. Also that part about Rowen's sword singing skill was not written. I accidentally stumbled upon a topic on the forum discussing it. \nHowever, it came handy when I was looking for the goodie caves before solving Sid's puzzle.\n\nFinally; I'd like to metin that I got this game when it was first released in December from aveyond Kingdom sit, and as soon as the game was released on Steam,  I got a free Steam key, so, I would like to thank Amanda and the team for this. Many other developers forget about the loyal fans as soon as the game is greenlit on Steam *cough* Bethesda *cough* :)\n\n\nI look forward to playing more games from you!", "timestamp_created": 1454644396, "timestamp_updated": 1499523685, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20955440": {"recommendationid": "20955440", "author": {"steamid": "76561198173253221", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 563, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497589814}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a great addition the the Aveyond games!

Its not just the boring use mana to cast a spell, or have a basic attack\n-Puzzles: There were some puzzles that I really enjoyed to solve, my favorite part of the game was the probably the dungeon which is a very confusing hour puzzle, that I loved to solve.\nThere are more benefits that I loved but those are probably the main ones\nCons:\n-Navigating the map: It takes a while getting used to navigating the world map and it can be a fair amount of walking getting to where you want to go sometimes\n-Vauge quest descriptions sometimes: Sometimes a quest can be kind of vauge and its hard to figure out where your supposed to go or do.\n\nAll in all I definitely reccomend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1454539213, "timestamp_updated": 1454539213, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458253", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20936109": {"recommendationid": "20936109", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036917793", "num_games_owned": 250, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1489, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455409949}, "language": "english", "review": "So this is SoloKane's wife writing a review for Aveyond....in case anyone was wondering why he was playing this game.

What happens to villains after they are defeated?  Do they retire?  Is there anything that could cause them to turn a new leaf, and become \"heroic\"?  The storyline is clever and character interactions are always amusing.  All six playable characters have their own unique gameplay and skills and the ability to freely switch combat members allow you to customize your party for specific encounters.  Gear upgrades are significant enough to feel worthwhile, and while you can finish the main storyline without completely exploring the world, the most powerful armors require full exploration of bonus areas.  Side quests for each area are easy to find or ignore as you see fit, and are generally found in the area where they are completed to cut down on unnecessary backtracking.  \n\nThe game is challenging enough to need to use your brains, while being balanced around not needing to grind levels to be able to survive the next quest area.  You can save at any time outside of battle, which makes Aveyond 4 perfect for casual gamers or adult gamers who may never know when playtime will be interrupted.  Hidden quests (not listed in your journal), hidden treasures and a hidden class skill for one of the playable characters reward players who take the time to fully explore and pay careful attention to npc conversations.  \n\nI have a hard time thinking of cons for this game, but the one annoying thing I have found is that sometimes the mob grouping pulls in enemies from off screen when initiating combat.  When I touch an enemy sprite to initiate combat and I only see two sprites on the screen, I shouldn't pop a battle with 4 mobs.  When the battle is over I see that extra two were around a corner and blocked by trees.  In the same vein, sometimes enemy sprite loot marks are difficult/impossible to find.  This does not happen enough to be more than a temporary irritation though.  \n\nOverall it has been a great game, and I highly recommend it both as an introduction to the Aveyond series and for those who played Aveyonds 1-3.", "timestamp_created": 1454462195, "timestamp_updated": 1454462195, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20922914": {"recommendationid": "20922914", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995873577", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 60, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454468536}, "language": "english", "review": "What I love about this game is what I love about all traditional RPGs: the story.

I've been a follower of the Aveyond series since it first came out years ago, and (unlike many series), the quality has only gone up with each game.\n\nStory and writing: The story is amazing. Aveyond is what got me into RPGs in the first place, and I've yet to come across another that has such well-written characters and a cohesive plot. It's made me laugh from the get-go and has a bit of a different spin from the other games; this time, you're playing from the perspective of a retired villian who's sort of forced into the role of hero. It's original and well-done, without gramatical or spelling errors.\n\nMusic: The soundtrack is, as always, incredible. Aaron Walz has really outdone himself with this one.\n\nGameplay and controls: There are both keyboard and mouse functions, for whichever you prefer, and everything is really easy to figure out without being annoying. It's pretty stnadard, but in a good way.\n\nArt: Aveyond has given me extemely high standards for art, and is the sole reason why I'm hesitant to play many other RPGs that aren't quite up to par. SotM very much keeps with this standard. The art is beautiful and expressive, and unlike many other games that have decent art to provide nothing more than a visual, the art in this game really adds something. The expressions are hilarious and personal, and you can really tell that a lot of effort was put in.\n\nCombat: Simple without being boring. It's turn-based and the abilities of each character are truly well thought-out. \n\nMy impression as a whole: Play the damn game. It's very much worth the price (and to be honest, one of the only games that I'm willing to spend more than $10 on), and the more people who play, the easier it is for the series to continue on and flourish. If you're new to the series, absolutely give it a shot. Hell, give all of them a shot. They're all great.

When I first began playing Ahriman's Prophecy, my daughter was just beginning high school.  I was excited, as our new computer had a brand new operating system called Windows XP.  \n\nFastforward to last summer.  My granddaughter came to stay with my husband and I for the summer.  She played through Aveyond, Aveyond 2 and the various chapters of Aveyond 3.  She quickly fell in love with the games, as had her mother and I years before.  When I told her that the release of Aveyond 4 was on the horizon, she became at least as excited as many fans of the Fallout series, awaiting Fallout 4.  \n\nAveyond is a familiar place, and has seen at least as many changes as the lives of the wonderful people who make up the fanbase. If you're looking for an intense, fast paced game with gore and violence aplenty, move along.  If you'd like to recover some of the innocent wonder and happiness the world so callously tries to strip away, welcome to The Kingdom. Relax, sit back and just...play. \n\nIf you've ever had a beloved pet go missing, you'll know very well the depths of despair and challenges of finding them  and bringing them safely home again. In Aveyond 4 you'll revisit this issue, but with a wonderful twist.  There are riddles to be solved, mountains to climb, tournaments to win, and a narcissistic king who simply will not take no for an answer.   Aveyond 4 is packed with various  quests.  There are old friends, new heroes, dragons, elves and wicked witches. Have you ever pondered the meaning of a particularly disturbing nightmare?  Someone in this game might have the answer. Love, betrayal and wonder await you.\n\n  If you've ever enjoyed wandering around town and country with a good friend while the rest of the world is quietly slumbering, aiding a hilarious faction that desires to rule the world (a top secret faction that might actually do a better job than the figurehead in place), give this game a try!  \n\nThis game is not a race, it's a meandering walk throught he woods, exploring every leaf, feeling the wind in your hair and the warmth of the summer sun on your face.  Slow down, lock your inner critic in the dungeon buy this game and just enjoy.\n\nI purchased this game from the Aveyond website a few months back.  When I heard that Aveyond 4 was coming out on Steam, I wrote to ask of I could review the game here.  The deleloper was kind enough to send me a key code for downloading the game here on Steam.

However, you do *not* need to have played any of the others to enjoy or understand this game.  There are a couple of long-lived recurring non-playable minor characters from earlier series, but they do not play major roles in this game.  This is also a complete game, unlike the 4-part Aveyond 3.\n\nYou can play this with either a keyboard or a mouse.  I generally prefer the keyboard unless I am trying to navigate tricky terrain or avoid a bad guy without a fight.\n\nThis is a long, detailed, well-imagined fantasy game.  There are battles, and you can have up to four fighters (plus one minion) from amongst your seven party members (you won't have seven party members the whole game, for most of it you will have fewer than seven).  Each character has different battle skills and strengths, and you may not want the same fighters in every situation.  You will have a chance to experience the battle interface during the demo. \n\nThe party does not always remain the same, either.  Although Boyle is the main character, occasionally other playable characters will have quests without him.   All the characters have unique backgrounds, and many are very different characters than we have seen in previous games.\n\nThere is a lot of fun, snarky humor in this game, especially with two of the MCs (Boyle and Ingrid) being an ex-villain and a witch.  Possibly reformed characters make great reluctant heroes.   Boyle's primary loyalty is to his dog/wolf Fang.  It takes him a while to get used to being part of a group.\n\nI don't want to give away much of the plot, but there many different locations in this expansive world, allowing for many different creatures and scenery.  (Mountains, forest, farmland, desert, seaside mining town, swamp, dreamscape, etc).  There are a bunch of main quests, and a fair number of optional side-quests with useful rewards.\n\nThere are several options for replayability, too, especially involving Ingrid, who can marry one of several men, depending on who she fancies and how much work she puts into it, and also join one of three witches covens, each with its own unique spells.  Eventually I want to try al the options.\n\nSo, try the demo and see if this is the sort of game you like.  (Note: the first half-hour is more scripted than the rest of the game, so do not be misled or turned off by the initial nudging).  \n\nAlso, my tip to you - save early and often, especially before battle.  And talk to everyone you encounter.  \n\nI had (and am having) lots of fun with this game and I hope you do too.  In some respects it is like immersing yourself in an interactive book/movie and experiencing a deep and nuanced world.  You might have to put more effort into it that the normal shooter or point-and-click games, but you will be rewarded for your efforts with a unique experience most games do not give you.  Most games are forgettable and interchangeable, but I always remember the Aveyond games and characters long after I am done playing.  Aveyond 4 makes me smile and forget about the real world for a while.    \n\nDisclaimer: I bought the PC version of this game when it was first released in December, and received a free Steam key from the developer.\n", "timestamp_created": 1454386707, "timestamp_updated": 1454386707, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20905780": {"recommendationid": "20905780", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107998486", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 9875, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472831025}, "language": "english", "review": "I am so happy to see Aveyond come on to Steam.

Now, I don\u2019t claim to be a sports enthusiast. I used to play football and basketball when I was younger, but those days are long behind me. Occasionally I\u2019ll dip my toes into an NBA 2K or an NHL 20XX, but I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve followed those sports in a long time. I suspect Dan Marshall, developer of Behold The Kickmen, is in a similar boat with soccer.\n\nWhen I arrived at the main menu, I was presented with three choices. I could start a career, jump into a quick play game, or try the tutorial. I opted to go for quick play, so I could figure the mechanics out as I went. That\u2019s when the personality of Behold The Kickmen really started to expose itself. I received an incredibly smarmy, yet accurate pop up notification saying that I should probably try the career mode first, as it slowly would teach me mechanics over time. I complied and attempted to start a career, and was greeted by another message with an even thicker coat of smarmy-ness drizzled all over it.\n\nAfter my lovely experience with the tutorial, I was finally ready to jump into a career mode. I was given the opportunity to rename my team, and so Flankstank United was born. I was also given the chance to rename my star player, but I let him be.\n\nSo there I was, ready to play some soccer, except wait, Behold The Kickmen suddenly became a visual novel. Star player, Joey Flash, had some demons that his bitter rival Pedro kept taunting him about. Meanwhile, the coach of Flanksteak United seems to know less than I do about soccer, which to my knowledge is a requirement of being a coach. My goofy soccer game turned into a soap opera in an instant, and I couldn\u2019t have been happier.\n\nAfter the drama died down temporarily, I was able to play what seemed more and more like a mini-game in this entire package, soccer. Or some version of soccer I suppose. Remember when I said Behold The Kickmen was an accurate representation of soccer? I lied. Sure, there\u2019s a ball and two goals, but I don\u2019t think that actual soccer is played on a circular field. Nor do I think the \u201coffside\u201d rule just randomly occurs mid game punishing a played for being too far to the left. But hey, I\u2019m not a soccer fan so I can\u2019t say for sure.\n\nFor all the jokes and guffaws, Behold The Kickmen actually has some interesting mechanics. For instance, there\u2019s a combo meter on screen at all times that accounts for passes, shots and tackles. You keep the chain going and eventually finish the combo off by scoring, or as the game calls it, having \u201cDone a goal.\u201d Finishing the combo grants you cash, and cash is key to growing your team.\n\nIn between matches and soap opera segments, you can take your hard earned cash and spend it on upgrades for various aspects of your team. Whether or not those upgrades actually affect gameplay is a question I have to ask, because I don\u2019t entirely trust this game. But I hope at least one of the upgrades works, because when you start out, your players run painfully too slow and I would very much like that to change.\n\nYou can also unlock abilities like passing and sprinting (yes those are abilities) in career mode as well as things like advanced tackling techniques and being able to control the ball mid flight. You can also edit a 4-4-2. which I\u2019m sure means something in real soccer, but once again, I don\u2019t trust this game.\n\nBehold the Kickmen may not be a hyper-realistic simulation of the world\u2019s biggest sport, but rather a perfectly fine arcade style soccer game with a great sense of humor. It doesn\u2019t have any multiplayer which is a little disappointing, but isn\u2019t any worse of a game without it.

And yet, you get the feeling that that may not be strictly true...\n\nCertainly the general feel of the title is that of a less polished Sensible Soccer or Kick Off type title - both stalwarts of the arcade football genre. That the rules are quite blatantly wrong seems if anything to make things more accessible, the offside rule in particular.\n\nMy main gripe therefore is with the fact that this is only single player - the idea of having a knockabout with a more straightfaced FIFA or PES fan would make for a great experience, as the initial joke game feel gives way to something more arcadey. However, I can see how two player control in this setup would rapidly become unwieldy, as the ball moves very quickly, particularly in later matches.\n\nI realise in this that I haven't covered the Story mode, which is the key to this game as currently set up. It's all a bit Speed Racer and manga in styling, with an overblown melodrama that suits this game to the ground. If football doesn't appeal, the secret future deathsport mode is worth a look, somehow combining the gameplay with a style more akin to early Bitmap Brothers titles (you know which one I mean).\n\nOne thing I would say though is do the tutorial mode first - for an arcade title, the controls can be a bit finicky compared to the one button and a stick approach of the aforementioned Kick Off type games.

The character designs are delightful, and the satirical bent of the project is extremely charming.\n\nBut the game has serious technical problems. Tackling and passing are Russian Roulette in terms of whether they will actually do what the player wants; sometimes the tackling \"possession\" reticle appears, sometimes it doesn't, sometimes it appears and then disappears, sometimes it appears, changes color to the one that enables possession for the player, but the ball or the character just bounce off in another direction. For passing, sometimes it just flies across the field in the opposite direction. The A.I. is extremely buggy. Enemy teams have a tendency to run the ball into the corner where they get stuck until you try to tackle them, which serves only to dislodge them and run past you to score a goal. And things aren't better on the goalkeeping side. If anything, they're much worse. In terms of settings, attempts to turn down the grating music failed; turning the volume down did absolutely nothing. An opening prompt strongly recommends a controller, but the controller cannot select some menu items, requring a mouse and keyboard to navigate.\n\nBut the most egregious issue is not a glitch but a design choice: You can't change your character on defense. The game auto-selects the character that you're controlling and switches at random, presumably trying to select whoever is closest to the ball, but just as often selecting someone far behind the ball or in no position to reach the ball. If you try to tackle and it fails, you're stuck with that character until it auto-selects someone else, which might be fine except for the aforementioned hit detection issues and the fact that at least half the time the character the game switches you to is behind the opposing player with their stamina depleted because the A.I. was sprinting independently for some reason. The left trigger of the controller is totally open, too, which leaves room if the developer can figure out a way to patch in a way to cycle through nearby characters. A lot of the technical issues could be overcome if the player was able to quickly regain control by selecting another nearby character. It would probably help with some of the outrageous difficulty spikes, as well. \n\nI didn't have a hard time winning, for the most part, but I had a hard time getting the game to respond accurately to my inputs.\n\nI really hope the dev can figure out some of these issues, because as it stands it's a charming, funny, potentially addictive game marred by technical difficulties.", "timestamp_created": 1502243412, "timestamp_updated": 1502243412, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500225", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34071229": {"recommendationid": "34071229", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048272074", "num_games_owned": 424, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502126777}, "language": "german", "review": "Kauft dieses Spiel nicht, wenn ihr mehr als nur einen 30-Minuten-Witz wollt,\n\ndenn so lange unterh\u00e4lt the Behold The Kickmen wirklich gut. danach \u00e4ndert sich das aber schlagartig.

Then I made the mistake of winning a few matches; that's when I discovered that the game's difficult scales based on the assumption that you're able to bring in loads of money per goal, so that you can train your team to come at least vaguely close to keeping up with the AI. Alas, even after all the matches I've won and lost in the weeks since I bought this, I still score lots of 0/1 pound (note: not sure how to abbreviate pounds sterling appropriately, sry) goals, with the occasional 100-200 goals. I think I saw one for about 750 once....maybe. I may have imagined it. But since training is expensive, I quickly found myself in a spot where the AI was making laser-like passes and goals, stealing the ball from me at its whim, while I would apparently fail to even gather the ball after running right into it. While I'd love to take more of the blame for this, I fear that there may also be an issue of clunky controls that aren't nearly as responsive as this game needs them to be.\n\nDespite having grown frustrated with the game early on, I was going to give it a positive recommendation....until I saw the patch notes for the 1.5 patch. The developer claimed that this patch addressed some of the negative feedback about this game, so I fired up the game again to see how different it felt. With my team in 17th place, the AI once again manhandled my team and I ended the match without bringing in a single penny. In 18th place, winning was too easy, but I didn't bring in nearly enough money for even a single upgrade to my team.  But goal scoring still feels just-managable enough that I don't feel like I can start doing whatever the game expects me to do to bring in more money when I finally score. In other words, same old poor scaling.\n\nEven after the improvements, I still had a major problem: The automatic selection of which player you control. I can't count the number of times I've wanted to control a player who was actually near the ball (but couldn't, because the computer decides who you control), or the number of times when I've been charging in for a tackle, only to have the computer switch players so my slide tackle is done by someone neither near the ball nor even facing it. This, perhaps more than anything else, is what made the game frustrating for me. (A close second is when the computer starts intercepting every pass that comes near it, while my players do nothing of the sort. Or when the computer starts stealing the ball even time it wishes, while my attempts to steal are far less predictable.)\n\nWhat mostly pushed me over the line toward a negative recommendation is the dev's statement of \"it's supposed to be a difficult game.\" Upon reading this, I concluded the following: This isn't a difficult game, it's a poorly-designed game with awkward controls and a lack of attention to difficulty scaling. (Not to mention that the game does next-to-nothing to show the player how to succeed at the game's most important mechanic, that of maximizing money earned per goal.) Hearing the dev suggest otherwise sounds arrogant and out-of-touch to me.\n\nAlso, I've grown sick to death of the opening music, and button texts and match win/loss notes seem about as vacant as the typical meme...but they just keep showing up. In other words, I've quickly grown tired of this game's tedium and I don't want to fire up the game any more.\n\nTo be fair, the first couple hours with the game were quite fun, so if you think the price is low enough to see if you also enjoy it -- either at first, or possibly for much longer -- then, by all means, give it a go.

A bit of speedy silly play does fit in with the theme of this game, but it reaches such an insane speed it is literally untouchable, borderline un-seeable. At present as well, you have to get used to successful tackles somehow resulting in their player not losing the ball, your defenders refusing to ever be behind the halfway line in some games, the auto-select of players (for you may not do this yourself) is often very unhelpful, either not selecting anyone near the opposition with the ball, or randomly changing your selection when you want to tackle to someone who is not in a useful position, and then the game won't let you try and tackle again for quite some time. \n\nThis game will be brilliant, I don't doubt that, as long as it keeps being updated and improved. I just don't know how long we will have to wait for these things to be improved on, because at the moment they are taking the silly fun this games offers and turning it into an infuriating affair that is best described more as a video than a game, because all you can do it watch, and feel just a bit humiliated as the AI keeps passing the ball across your goal at 200mph because none of your team are even in your own half...\n\nI'm looking forward to changing my recommendation to yes, because I feel confident it will happen, it's all there!

Here's my take on it.\n\nPROS\n+ It has a 'Sensible Soccer' feel about it, which is never a bad thing for an arcade football game.\n+ I like that this game doesn't take itself seriously, and doesn't pretend to be completely truthful to real-life football. If only all referees - sorry, umpires - kissed players after they scored!\n+ The 'three strikes (fouls) and you're out' rule is a cool addition, as is 'doing' more than one goal if you score from a longer distance.\n+ Dan Marshall got the offside rule absolutely spot on, in my opinion.\n+ It's cheap. I'd recommend spending a few spare quid on this, with the proviso that you know exactly what you'll be getting into.\n\nCONS\n- Much like with the 'Dan & Ben' games, I found the humour to be VERY hit-and-miss. Indeed, the good stuff can start to grate after a couple of hours.\n- The storyline is somewhat naff, even by FIFA 17 'The Journey' standards. And if you want to complete it, set the number of enemy teams as low as possible to avoid monotonous repetition of the same old matches. I stupidly went in the opposite direction, as I thought at first that I'd still be playing this game weeks later.\n- The rubber-band difficulty setting. The enemy team is either unplayable (when losing) or just incapable of playing (when winning). There's no middle ground. While dynamic difficulty is a nice concept on paper, it's not exactly enjoyable when you squander a six-goal lead because the AI start playing on fast-forward and do a couple of lucky goals from distance.\n- Why can't you alter the direction of your tackles? Unless I was breathing down the enemy's neck, 80% of my tackles would end with my 'kickman' sliding literally anywhere other than towards the opponent.\n- And don't get me started on the goalkeepers, erm I mean 'gold-keepers'. I wasn't expecting Buffon-like gold-keeping in this game, but I was hoping that they'd be somewhat competent. A lot of matches seem to come down to which team has the least inept gold-keeper.\n- Did Skrillex do the music for this? The EDM is so loud and migraine-inducing, even at half volume.\n- You need a mouse to navigate the menus, but also a keyboard/controller for the gameplay itself. For some users, that's not ideal.\n- No multiplayer, therefore not much playability once you've completed the story.\n\nI got about two hours' enjoyment out of this game before the novelty wore off. Behold The Kickmen is NOT a terrible game, and I don't regret buying it (certainly not at such a low price), but it just hasn't grabbed my imagination.

options. Right away, the games humor shows as every team name MUST end in the word \u201cUnited.\u201d There are many little touches like this that true football fans will appreciate, and everyone else will just assume, like Dan did, that this is how the game actually is.\n\nTo set-up the action, there are various cutscenes where you interact with the \u201cbest player,\u201d as well as your coach and I assume other characters as well. There are decisions to make, and relationships appear to build in these scenes, but I have no idea what effect this has on the game. \n\nIn story mode, you can spend money you earn from games on boosting abilities and every win unlocks an advanced ability. There\u2019s also an option to move your players\u2019 starting points on the field, but as you\u2019ll see, at the beginning, it looks like your watching teams of eight-year-olds play the sport.\n\nAt this level, the players just bash into each other and are so horribly skilled that they can\u2019t do much of anything. The only two advanced abilities you start with is shooting and tackling. I was a little dissapointed that even passing was locked out of this part of the game. The only thing that made these early matches bearable was that it is extremely easy. I won this first game 7 - 0. While there is a tutorial mode, I wish this part of the game was included there too and that I could skip to the point where I at least have the major game play elements unlocked.\n\nSince I haven\u2019t dived too deeply into the story mode yet, my favorite mode is simply the quickplay. In-fact, the game itself feels a little slow so I crank up the speed 25%. I am by no means an \u201cexpert\u201d gamer and I will almost always choose \u201cnormal\u201d difficulty, but something about this game just feels a little handicapped. \n\n\nIn quickplay, all the major game elements are present. There is passing which is simple enough, tackling which now includes a \u201ctiming mechanic\u201d and if you press tackle, again, at the right moment, your player will continue with the ball instead of it being knocked away randomly. Shooting can be held for more power, but less accuracy, and also spun to curve left or right. There is also a dodge left or right ability that can only be used by a player once a possession, and it is great for dodging tackles. Altogether, these abilities make a fun and rewarding arcade soccer experience. When you land a perfect tackle, a huge pass and inevitably, a goal, it feels great.\n\nSome quirks to the regular soccer formula that you are sure to notice is that sometimes, when you make a goal you get two instead of one. Extra time just randomly happens and offsides brings up a huge warning on the screen and you have to leave before you get penalized. There may be other \u201cfake\u201d rules and these are what make Kickmen unique.\n\nOverall, this is a hard game to review. It\u2019s based on soccer, but you have to call it an arcade soccer game. The rules are changed, so that reminds me of NFL Blitz, Mutant League and NBA Jam style games. Depending on how much you enjoy the humor, I believe this game could be fun to play through the story mode once and if it sells enough copies and receives a free multi-player one day, it will definitely be worth the money.

I believe my cousin owned it and frequently brought it with him when his family was over at ours, and we played it a bunch over the years.\n\nEventually he got bored of it, I forgot the game and the football games got more and more serious.

I thought football was shit back then, and I still do. There was a shop called The Candybox not far from the house I lived in at that time and it was really strange how it rented VHS tapes as well as selling sweets. Like, half the shop was devoted to VHS tapes it was weird. I remember listening to The Gingerbread Man on my walkman and going to that shop and explaining that we didn't need to rent Red Dwarf because we taped them off the telly also can I have one penny sweet please thanks very much look I don't know why you're looking like a slapped arse I'm five fucking years old I'm going to waste your time it's just what we do. Anyway Sensi was a god game I liked the manager mode and the amateur league. My favourite team in that league was The Professionals because amongst 'Milkman' and 'Dentist' there was one player who was a 'Footballer' and he was really good at the big kicks, just like my two strikers in this wonderful videogame- Thom Yorke and Ronaldino Sailboat. At one point in this game there was someone playing a trumpet badly in the crowd and I cracked up for like the eight or ninth time. We never actually had two equally good joysticks for SWOS so somebody always had to have the shitty one with the iffy fire button, it meant that you had to smack it and make a big loud springy noise to kick the ball. Distinguishing between a pass and a shot was basically impossible. I like the bit in the manual for Sensible World Of Soccer where it explains what a gold keeper is and that they can use their hands so Watch Out! Except I don't know if they were joking in the manual from the early nineties whereas with Kickmen I know it's a joke. The other bit of Sensi that was really good was the song Goal Scoring Super Star Hero and I will be docking some points for its lack of inclusion in the sequel 'Beholden Kickmen'. The Amiga was well good for games I only realised recently that Desert Storm: Return To The Gulf was weird propaganda. The best game on the Amiga (asides from Embrace The Kickmen) was Cannon Fodder so I think a mod for this game that makes it into Cannon Fodder except instead of a straight faced war game (like the original) it's like a satire about the futility of war that would be good.

There Scipio Africanus, the savior of Rome in the darkest days of the Punic Wars, found Hannibal Barca. The latter had left Carthage in exile when the Romans demanded his surrender seven years after his defeat at the hands of the former, lest he rebuilt the broken city to its former glory.\n\nIt is not often such great generals meet outside the blood and gore of the battlefield and thus the conversation between them fell to whom they ranked as the greatest generals of antiquity. Hannibal answered Alexander ranked highest and though Scipio was dismayed, they could all agree that Alexander was without equal. When asked who ranked second, Hannibal answered Pyrrhus, the Greek general who was the first to bring the young Roman republic to its knees. Scipio then asked whom he ranked third and Hannibal, without hesitation answered that it was himself who ranked third.\n\nScipio, hurt in his pride that the victim in his greatest success would rank themselves above their victor, asked where then would Hannibal place himself if he had won at the Battle of Zama? And Hannibal answered that beyond doubt, then he would place himself before even Alexander.\n\nScipio didn\u2019t answer again, instead kicking a pig bladder at Hannibal, through his legs and in between two vases standing in the corner of the gymnasium. He pulled his toga over his head and galloped to the crowd with his hands in the air.\n\nAnd so, the game of football was born, though it wouldn\u2019t be rediscovered until the 1990\u2019s in England, where some rich people decided they could be a lot richer still by asking people a lot of money to watch other people play. Soon, instead of playing football, people decided that they could make a game that was like football, but played on computers instead, so they didn\u2019t have to go outside and get dirty. \n\nYou can kick the ball, run around with the ball, pass the ball, tackle other people who have the ball and if you want to pull your shirt over your head and run around yelling \u201cgoal, goal, goal\u201d, you can do that while playing Behold the Kickmen on your computer.

An oval round pitch a hundred meters in length, and the game split into two divisions with variable scoring based on how far away from the goal you were when you did it.

Players move significantly slower with the ball, placing an emphasis on passing (though players can sprint for a limited time). Both kicks and tackles can be aimed, and tapping the tackle button again when near the ball will take possession. Dashing left or right is also available, though you are not able to manually switch players (which makes the game more challenging and exciting overall). This is not a serious depiction of the sport: there are no throw-ins, goalies barely get in the way, you score more points by kicking further out, extra time is added by running over clocks scattered on the field, and offsides penalties are given randomly (well, that part is realistic). The AI is just good enough to provide a decent opponent while adhering to the silly nature of the game. Although Behold the Kickmen is not the best arcade soccer game available, it does offer good gameplay mechanics befitting of its casual approach to the sport.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=707gZec0AoY", "timestamp_created": 1500570327, "timestamp_updated": 1500570327, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.584930", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36106421": {"recommendationid": "36106421", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050135590", "num_games_owned": 866, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512410326}, "language": "finnish", "review": "Peli on hauska vitsi ensimm\u00e4isen tunnin tai kaksi, jonka j\u00e4lkeen pelaaminen k\u00e4y tyls\u00e4ksi.\n\nPelin idea on toteuttaa jalkapalloa tuntemattomien v\u00e4\u00e4rinymm\u00e4rryksiin pelin s\u00e4\u00e4nn\u00f6ist\u00e4 ja yksityiskohdista.\nKyseess\u00e4 on siis vitsin\u00e4 tehty jalkapalloa mukaileva peli.\nVitsit on nopeasti l\u00e4pik\u00e4yty, joten pelillisesti t\u00e4ytyisi olla jotain annettavaa.

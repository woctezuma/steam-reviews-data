If you like or at least are vaguely okay with them, [i]To Be or Not To Be[/i] might work for you, even if you're not really a fan of Shakespeare's [i]Hamlet[/i].\n\nPros:\n+ The humor. It's weird and occasionally surreal. There's one route where you briefly become a horse just before the sun explodes, and another one where Ophelia and Hamlet engage in a training montage and become ninjas.\n+ Lots of endings, almost every one of which comes with its own piece of artwork, which you can look at again in the game's art gallery. I haven't counted how many pieces of artwork there are, but I know that I've been playing this game for almost 5 hours total and I'm still missing 40 or 50.\n+ Ophelia is awesome.\n+ It highlights some problems with the original play that I'd never really thought about before. I kind of wish this had been around back when I was studying this play in school.\n\nCons:\n- The game includes \"checkpoints,\" which are basically \"save\" spots you can return to in order to try out different choices without having to replay everything that came before it. Unfortunately, all you get are the \"checkpoints\" the game provides you with - you can't create your own. The \"Skip\" button is nice and all, but I've gotten really tired of skipping through the pirate scene just so I can get to the stuff right after it. The lack of ability to create your own save points is one of the reasons why I don't think I'm ever going to manage to collect all the pieces of artwork. I don't know that I have the patience for it.\n- This comes from all the visual novels I've been playing lately, but I really wish there were a \"skip 'read' text\" option.\n- The narrator doesn't appeal to me at all. Thankfully, you can play the game with narration turned on or off. I started with the narration on and turned it off before I'd even selected the character I was going to play as.\n\nAll in all, not bad.

It's not very effective...\n\nThe game goes all out, satirizing and heckling every step Hamlet made, revelling in just how easy it would have been to avoid most of the play's tragedies. The result is often comedy gold\u2014it made me laugh aloud several times (which is a lot in our informationally-overloaded-yet-desensitized-to-everything times). Hamlet's emo teen logic in the game is just too amusing, and somehow the whole thing also manages to have a touching moment or two.\n\nYou can also play as Ophelia and Hamlet Sr., but I'd say that their stories, as well as the bits from Hamlet's that stray from the original completely, are less compelling than the parody bits\u2014although still fun and good interactive prose.\n\nThe whole thing is broken into easily digestible bits that allow for reasonably simple backtracking and exploring alternative branches. And if you have a favourite comic artist of international renown, chances are that an artwork of theirs is featured in the game\u2014although I have to point out that the artworks, unlocked by reaching various endings, are not present in the game itself, but rather serve as non-useful rewards, so if you were hoping to see a ton of cool art, you're kinda out of luck. (Except for Kate Beaton's art that's present in the game and obviously instantly makes it cooler.)\n\nSome people criticize [i]To Be or Not To Be[/i] for the fact that the choices in the game aren't equal. True: the game blatantly ridicules you for making some. However, I don't think it's a reasonable critique. [i]To Be or Not To Be[/i] is not a real CYOA  game; it's based on a work that already has a \"canon\" storyline, so different options have different weight by default, some of them being \"real\" (i.e. Shakespeare's), while others being alternative. The goal of [i]To Be or Not To Be[/i] is not to provide you with an array of balanced options, each of them having its own merit, it's actually quite the opposite: the game sets to make fun of the \"canon\" choices.\n\nSo, if you're looking to truly, honestly roleplay Hamlet, [i]To Be or Not To Be[/i] won't suit you (you should maybe consider a career as an actor instead, people say the notion of playing Hamlet is kinda popular in theatre).

Aside utilizing the names and events of the original storyline for a setting - and paraphrasing the book now and then - this is nothing even slightly close to the original work. If you have never read or watched the play, I strongly recommend doing so before venturing into this cheesy spoof.\n\nI've always been a bit of a fan for chose-your-own-adventure format, exploring various courses of actions and their consequences presented for a singular story. I basically grew up reading them, playing on the notion of a choice action. Also becoming a fan of Shakespeare's all works as my age and experience in English language progressed enough for me to appreciate them; this game felt like a natural choice for me. Well... this wasn't what I expected.\n\nAs the narration starts, you are given the opportunity to play the game as Hamlet, Ophelia or Hamlet Sr. a.k.a. King of Denmark, exploring 110 various parody paths and their endings harboring cringe and insult comedy, narrated in modern slang mostly. It's a cute and imaginative game to spare some mindless time with, sure but nothing exceptionally rich I must say. You start playing the game with a silent smirk on your face, scoffing now and then, deepening that smirk into a smile. It has its almost hilarious moments too, mostly presented in situational comedy through written narrative.  It works for 2-3 playthroughs. Yet, as you keep playing and keep witnessing the same kind of shallow remarks for the 30th time, the game quickly loses its charm.\n\nI must confess that the humor presented here was not my cup of tea. It is mostly rough parody and elementary satire, downright underrating the brilliance of the original author by taking crude logic and blatant exaggeration as its weapons. It's not a traditional or psychological reading of the concept. It's an absurd and cheesy parody of the norms of the era, story path choices, gender representations, free-will itself and character interrelations. The relationship between the player and the narrator is somewhat of a semblance to [i]The Stanley Parable[/i] with the narrator constantly criticizing you, intervening with your choices and rearranging actions to fit into prearranged storyline format, and doing so while belittling your sentience mostly. Some of the scenes presented - like the naval war between Hamlet's fleet and pirates - are imaginative and entertaining; but most scenes end up being direct hits on the original play with American sitcom humor.\n\nI am aware that I've mostly presented downsides, but would I recommend the game as a final verdict? Meh, why not if it's in a heavy sale and you'd feel like watching Ophelia going on a killing spree, Hamlet time travelling or King of Denmark exploring the bottom of the sea. It is cute, but that effect doesn't last. There is nothing to actually dislike in the game. Narrative dynamic functions fine and the author obviously knows his Shakespeare enough to criticize [i]Hamlet[/i] in to this extent. This whole thing is a matter of taste.

The premise is simple, read along and make choices and create your own version of Hamlet. With so many choices, and some  cringingly awesome puns, you control the fate of your character and his/her kin.  The gameplay is fun, although, I wouldn't recommend it to someone who doesn't enjoy reading or appreciate Ryan North's brand of humor (snarky, sarcastic, and nerdy).  Also, it can get a bit pedantic, so I also wouldn't recommend trying another story immediately after beating it the first time.

Le studio Tin Man Games nous propose de red\u00e9couvrir \u00e0 nouveau la c\u00e9l\u00e8bre pi\u00e8ce dans une adaptation vid\u00e9oludique sous forme de livre \u00e0 choix multiples o\u00f9 humour et trag\u00e9die coexistent pour une aventure des plus d\u00e9routantes.[/i]\n\nUn petit rappel du sc\u00e9nario s'impose (avec quelques raccourcis vous pensez bien !). \nHamlet, Prince du Danemark apprend le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son p\u00e8re et le remariage de sa m\u00e8re avec le fr\u00e8re du d\u00e9funt, Claudius. Le fant\u00f4me de Hamlet Senior fait savoir \u00e0 son fils que Claudius l'a assassin\u00e9 et r\u00e9clame vengeance, Hamlet accepte de tuer le nouveau roi. Claudius est d\u00e9masqu\u00e9 lors d'une pi\u00e8ce de th\u00e9\u00e2tre rejouant la sc\u00e8ne du meurtre mais au lieu de le tuer Hamlet tue accidentellement Polonius, le p\u00e8re de sa promise Oph\u00e9lie. Il s'enfuit en mer et \u00e0 son retour apprend le suicide de la jeune femme. D\u00e9cid\u00e9 \u00e0 s'occuper de Claudius il est arr\u00eat\u00e9 par le fr\u00e8re d'Oph\u00e9lie qui lui demande un duel \u00e0 mort dans la salle du tr\u00f4ne. Les \u00e9p\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 empoisonn\u00e9es et les deux hommes, touch\u00e9s par les lames, sont condamn\u00e9s \u00e0 mourir tandis que la m\u00e8re d'Hamlet boit du vin empoisonn\u00e9 que Claudius avait r\u00e9serv\u00e9 \u00e0 ce dernier. Dans un dernier \u00e9lan Hamlet parvient \u00e0 tuer Claudius, chose qu'il aurait pu faire il y a longtemps ceci dit. \n\nCette histoire vous chiffonne ? Vous trouvez que les choix d'Hamlet sont compl\u00e8tement idiots ? http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=557839959 Pourquoi tuer Polonius en pensant que c'est Claudius alors qu'il venait de voir celui-ci dans la chapelle ? Pourquoi s'enfuir et se faire passer pour fou aupr\u00e8s d'Oph\u00e9lie, la poussant ainsi au suicide ? Pourquoi d\u00e9fier le fr\u00e8re de celle qu'il aimait au lieu de se charger de Claudius bon sang ?! Eh bien r\u00e9jouissez-vous car vous allez enfin pouvoir changer le cours des choses et aboutir \u00e0 une meilleure fin (peut-il y avoir une fin pire que celle-ci de toute mani\u00e8re ?). Attention l\u2019\u0153uvre originale est sans conteste un chef d\u2019\u0153uvre de la litt\u00e9rature et un grand classique th\u00e9\u00e2tral mais on peut bien en rire un peu, non ?\n\nLe ton est donn\u00e9 d\u00e8s le d\u00e9part, d\u00e8s les premi\u00e8res explications du jeu qui est enti\u00e8rement en anglais. Il convient vraiment d'avoir un tr\u00e8s bon niveau car d'une part vous aurez du mal \u00e0 comprendre certains (rares) passages soutenus et certaines boutades et d'autre part si vous avez du mal \u00e0 lire l'anglais le jeu sera surtout ennuyeux pour vous. Le texte est toutefois majoritairement \u00e9crit en langage courant. Ceci \u00e9tant clarifi\u00e9 vous pouvez commencer l'aventure en choisissant entre 3 personnages : Hamlet, Ophelia et Hamlet Senior. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=557839906 Vous pourrez bien s\u00fbr revivre la pi\u00e8ce telle que Shakespeare l'a imagin\u00e9e en choisissant les r\u00e9ponses comportant un petit cr\u00e2ne (non sans \u00eatre interpell\u00e9s par le narrateur qui s'interrogera sur votre sant\u00e9 mentale au vu de vos choix discutables) ou changer la donne en faisant les choix qui vous plairont (ne tuez pas Polonius, tuez Claudius plus t\u00f4t, ne vous engagez pas dans un duel avec le fr\u00e8re d'Oph\u00e9lie). Vos choix pourront rester proches de la trame originale ou r\u00e9sulter en un enchainement de situations qui vous am\u00e8neront \u00e0 une fin compl\u00e8tement diff\u00e9rente, tordue et pleine d'humour noir. Le [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=558770379]Haml-O-Meter[/url] vous indiquera \u00e0 quel point votre aventure a \u00e9t\u00e9 proche de l'originale \u00e0 chaque fin de partie.\n\nEn optant pour Ophelia ou Hamlet Senior vous allez vivre l'histoire sous un angle totalement diff\u00e9rent qui r\u00e9serve bien des surprises ! Alors votre Ophelia sera-t-elle une tueuse sans merci, votre Hamlet Senior r\u00e8gnera-t-il par la terreur gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 ses pouvoirs fantomatiques ? Il y a \u00e9norm\u00e9ment de fins diff\u00e9rentes, \u00e9norm\u00e9ment d'embranchements dans l'aventure et chaque fin vous fera d\u00e9bloquer un nouvel [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=557840034]Artwork[/url]. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=557839981 Enfin, vous l'avez compris c'est vraiment un jeu pour rire, on ne se prend pas au s\u00e9rieux ! Vous pourrez recommencer de nombreuses fois pour essayer diff\u00e9rents choix et cela est facilit\u00e9 par les nombreux checkpoints qui pars\u00e8ment le jeu.\n\nLa dur\u00e9e de vie est \u00e9lev\u00e9e si on cherche \u00e0 r\u00e9colter tous les artworks. Une partie avec Hamlet version Shakespeare durera 2h30-3h, une partie avec Ophelia prendra plut\u00f4t 10-30 minutes par exemple. Je ne peux pas vous dire combien de temps il faudrait pour le finir avec toutes les fins car cela demanderait aussi de prendre des notes pour se souvenir de chacun de ses choix.\n\nTo Be or Not To Be a aussi des qualit\u00e9s autres que son \u00e9criture r\u00e9ussie et inventive. Les artworks et les quelques images qui accompagnent le texte ont un style bien d\u00e9fini et sont r\u00e9alis\u00e9s avec soin. Votre lecture sera aussi agr\u00e9ment\u00e9e par des musiques qui s'adaptent \u00e0 la situation, ce ne sont pas des compositions exceptionnelles mais elles cr\u00e9ent cependant une ambiance tant\u00f4t l\u00e9g\u00e8re ou festive, tant\u00f4t \u00e9pique ou myst\u00e9rieuse. Vous pourrez d'ailleurs choisir d'activer le narrateur pour vous faire conter l'histoire mais je ne le conseille pas aux non-anglophones car il est facile de perdre le fil avec ce rythme soutenu de lecture. \n\nAu final, cette r\u00e9adaptation de Shakespeare est intelligente et inventive, bourr\u00e9e d'humour et de sc\u00e8nes loufoques. Pour l\u2019appr\u00e9cier pleinement il faudra toutefois avoir un bon niveau d'anglais et ne pas avoir peur de lire beaucoup. Ce type de jeu m\u00e9rite d'\u00eatre plus reconnu car il permet de vulgariser des \u0153uvres qui ne sont pas forc\u00e9ment accessibles \u00e0 tous. Et quoi de mieux que d'utiliser le rire pour faire d\u00e9couvrir ou red\u00e9couvrir un grand classique tel que Hamlet ?\n\n[i]Une cl\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie \u00e0 des fins d'\u00e9valuation par les d\u00e9veloppeurs ce qui n'a n\u00e9anmoins pas influenc\u00e9 mon avis.[/i]\n\n[quote]Lisez d'autres avis sur ma page de curation : [b][url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9002662/]Kitsune's Guide[/url][/b][/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1448227079, "timestamp_updated": 1448228342, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.693867", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19137195": {"recommendationid": "19137195", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030486667", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472850846}, "language": "english", "review": "I only read the credits.

Parler d\u2019 \u00ab adaptation libre \u00bb est encore un euph\u00e9misme, tant l\u2019\u0153uvre du dramaturge britannique se voit malmen\u00e9e. Hamlet est d\u00e9peint comme un trentenaire emo, sa \u00ab girlfriend \u00bb Oph\u00e9lia tente de vivre sa vie de jeune femme ind\u00e9pendante, pendant que le p\u00e8re est gratifi\u00e9 d\u2019un bonus de caract\u00e9ristique en sieste.\n\n\u00c0 l\u2019exception de certains monologues retranscrits mot pour mot depuis l\u2019\u0153uvre originale, le niveau d\u2019anglais est suffisamment commun pour \u00eatre facilement compris. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019aucune traduction n\u2019est disponible, il faudra de toute fa\u00e7on s\u2019en contenter. Pour les plus anglophiles, un narrateur (impeccable) leur permettra m\u00eame de se passer d\u2019une bonne partie de la lecture. Un narrateur qu\u2019on aurait imagin\u00e9 davantage dans son \u00e9l\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur de l\u2019\u0153uvre originale ; la prose de North se faisant tr\u00e8s orale et anachronique, mimant \u00e0 la Kaamelott un langage moderne au milieu de cette histoire de ch\u00e2teaux et de rois.\n\nLa fluidit\u00e9 de sa plume se trouve par ailleurs parfaitement retransmise par l\u2019habillage d\u2019aventure textuelle, compos\u00e9 avec go\u00fbt et avec soin. On peut librement revenir en arri\u00e8re, et les effets visuels accompagnant l\u2019histoire font mouche. M\u00eame pour un habitu\u00e9 des visual novels japonais, cette mise en forme centr\u00e9e sur le texte est rafra\u00eechissante et plus intelligente dans sa conception qu\u2019un simple cadre en bas de l\u2019\u00e9cran.\n\n[h1]Party hard[/h1]\n\nDifficile de continuer sur l\u2019histoire en elle-m\u00eame sans trop en d\u00e9voiler. S\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas de faire un inventaire de tous les \u00e9v\u00e9nements que l\u2019on peut rencontrer, il est \u00e0 noter que les embranchements sont nombreux et am\u00e8neront tous \u00e0 des rencontres plus loufoques les unes que les autres. M\u00eame le sc\u00e9nario officiel de Shakespeare, dont les choix sont indiqu\u00e9s \u00e0 chaque bifurcation, conduira p\u00eale-m\u00eale \u00e0 des soir\u00e9es en bateau, des propositions incestueuses, un duel de sourds ou une vir\u00e9e tr\u00e8s m\u00e9ta dans un autre livre de l\u2019auteur.\n\nToutefois si les premi\u00e8res impressions flattent le lecteur, moyennant une pond\u00e9ration si vous accrochez \u00e0 l\u2019humour, la replay value semble plus difficile. Les gags proviennent souvent de ficelles communes, qui deviennent de moins en moins dr\u00f4les \u00e0 force de r\u00e9p\u00e9tition. Il vaut peut-\u00eatre mieux ainsi espacer votre lecture pour ne pas finir \u00e9c\u0153ur\u00e9 du m\u00e9lange d\u2019audace et d\u2019ironie mordante de North, qui ne nous \u00e9pargne vraiment rien.\n\n[h1]\u00c0 retenir[/h1]\n\n[b]Malgr\u00e9 une sortie anecdotique sur Steam, To Be or Not to Be se r\u00e9v\u00e8le \u00eatre un titre sympathique pour les amateurs de com\u00e9die et d\u2019aventure textuelle. D\u00e9nu\u00e9 d\u2019ambitions extravagantes, il en ressort un jeu soign\u00e9 \u00e0 la fois au niveau du texte que de l\u2019habillage jeu vid\u00e9o. La dur\u00e9e de vie assez faible ne constituera un d\u00e9faut que si vous accrochez r\u00e9ellement \u00e0 l\u2019humour de North, mais le prix assez \u00e9lev\u00e9 (~12\u20ac sur la plateforme de Gabe) me pousse par contre \u00e0 vous le conseiller de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence en soldes.[/b]\n\nAntigoomba", "timestamp_created": 1447773045, "timestamp_updated": 1447773045, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19121582": {"recommendationid": "19121582", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015453793", "num_games_owned": 918, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 1049, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452032897}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Leitura interessante do Hamlet.

To those scared of being overwhelmed with confusing text, fear not, as the game only dips into the play's text for two or three of the more well known speeches. The rest is told in a humorously critical analysis of just what the characters were saying to each other, and just how insulting and coarse the Bard's characters can be sometimes.\nAnd that's just the path that follows the Bard's version of the tale. Every choice you make could put you into the shoes of      Hamlet himself, his girlfriend Ophelia, and even the Ghost of King Hamlet Sr. without warning. One of my favorite moments so far came from a sidepath of the Ghost King that took me completely by surprise. I won't spoil it, but that moment alone has made me determined to unlock every possible ending just to see what crazy misadventure happens next.\nWhile not the most orthodox way to introduce newcomers to Shakespeare, this game is a treat that should not be passed up by anyone.

This is unfortunate because the music is louder than the narrator's voice, so you can't really play them both and get the full effect of the game.\n2) I could not find a way to access the options menu with my controller so I had to switch mid-game to a mouse and keyboard.\n3) We had difficulty figuring out the checkpoint system, but that may have just been us.", "timestamp_created": 1424819807, "timestamp_updated": 1424819807, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500333", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14590587": {"recommendationid": "14590587", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060572962", "num_games_owned": 425, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 685, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453523814}, "language": "english", "review": "amazingly  fun, witty, and snappy title that is definitely worth the 12$ price tag for anyone looking to spend a few hours reading. if you have a hard time reading it has you covered with a dyslexic friendly font and if you just don't like reading it has great narration for you too. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1424593922, "timestamp_updated": 1424593922, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501850", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14556595": {"recommendationid": "14556595", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004583352", "num_games_owned": 7117, "num_reviews": 120, "playtime_forever": 128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1424422338}, "language": "english", "review": "There's so much to be said about this game that is wonderful.

I like that I can play a storyline in the 10-minute breaks between my classes; the writing style, humor, and references work for me; and the game singlehandedly convinced me to nickname my car Ophelia (+1 to science, -1 to water, and +10,000 to badassery). This is also a game where it is really fun to achievement hunt -- achievements tip you off to lots of silly but non-required moments, and chasing them down is a good way to structure your playtime.\n\nThat said, the humor relies a lot on the inherent silliness of juxtaposing Hamlet with modernity and may not hit the mark for everyone. Additionally, a lot of humor is milked from the narrator being exasperated with and/or railroading you, a la The Stanley Parable. I found this funny, but given the way To Be or Not To Be is checkpointed, I understand why others might find it frustrating.\n\nAnd that brings me to my biggest problem with To Be or Not To Be: the checkpointing. Checkpoints are infrequent, and while they mostly come at sensible points (at any major scene/plot turn), you'll still end up skipping a lot of text to get back to that one spot where you didn't take the other branching path. It's a minor annoyance, but it's still an annoyance.\n\nAdditionally, for whatever reason, only some of my checkpoints (and ending art!) ever persist after exiting the game -- this is a known bug, and I'm hoping it'll be patched soon. [Edit: This has since been remedied!]\n\nA lesser problem is the sound controls. Although the music and narration volumes have been adjusted since release so the former no longer totally drowns out the latter, there's still no sliders; you can only turn things on or off. My advice: Skip the narration and leave the music on. It's more fun to read the story in your own voice and give the words your own emphasis anyway, and the music really adds to the scenes and the humor in a way that the narration doesn't.", "timestamp_created": 1423368851, "timestamp_updated": 1425510575, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.627297", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14371779": {"recommendationid": "14371779", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997172478", "num_games_owned": 2247, "num_reviews": 469, "playtime_forever": 146, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1423332874}, "language": "polish", "review": "[h1] To Be or Not To Be jest swego rodzaju sukcesem i fenomenem.[/h1]\n\nGra ta mia\u0142a sw\u00f3j pocz\u0105tek na kickstarterze gdzie chcia\u0142a zebra\u0107 skromne jak na gre 10 tysi\u0119cy dolar\u00f3w.\nJednak tutaj sta\u0142 sie dziwny spisek poniewa\u017c gra uzbiera\u0142a \u0105z 580 tysi\u0119cy !! :OO\n \nI w tym momencie wymagania wszystkich wzros\u0142y - poniewa\u017c nie jest to ju\u017c tylko nisko bud\u017cetowy projekt paru zapalonych student\u00f3w a powa\u017cny projekt.\n\nPlusy\n- Jest to przyst\u0119pna, skr\u00f3cona wersja Hamleta\n- Prowadzona w zale\u017cno\u015bci od wyboru z trzech ro\u017cnych perspektyw\n- Wiele wybor\u00f3w kt\u00f3re prowadz\u0105 do innych zako\u0144cze\u0144\n- Mi\u0142e dla oka obrazki,szkicie i ogo\u0142nie strona graficzna\n- Interfejs\n- Historia jest \u0142atwa do zrozumienia i ogarni\u0119cia\n- Ciekawostki, zaimplementowane w grze o Shakespearze\n- Developerzy sa bardzo spoko\n\nMinusy\n-Specyficzny humor jak dla mnie troche tandetny i bez polotu jak na powage produkcji a raczej dzie\u0142a do kt\u00f3rego sie odwo\u0142uje\n-Wybory sa troszke ograniczone\n- Scie\u017cki wybor\u00f3w w pewnym momencie robi\u0105 sie liniowe (tylko jedn prawid\u0142owy wyb\u00f3r wszystkie inne nas zabijaj\u0105 czy co\u015b)\n-Bardzo kr\u00f3tki czas przej\u015bcia - ka\u017cda jednorazowa rozgrywka mo\u017ce nam zaj\u0105c z dwie minuty\n-Niekt\u00f3re obrazki kt\u00f3re nam s\u0105 prezentowane nie s\u0105 doko\u0144czone \n-G\u0142o\u015bna muzyka i brak mo\u017cliwosci wyciszenia jej - og\u00f3lnie ca\u0142e opcje sa bardzo skromne i na nic nie pozwalaj\u0105\n-Synchronizacja narracji\n-Statystyki sa bez sensu\n-Fabu\u0142a jest troche za szybka przez co cie\u017cko sie wczu\u0107\n-Za droga, swoje ju\u017c zarobi\u0142a my\u015ble ze 5euro to wystarczaj\u0105ca cena\n\nI nie chce \u017ceby to wygl\u0105da\u0142o tak ze gra mi sie nie podoba\u0142a - ot\u00f3\u017c wr\u0119cz przeciwnie jest to bardzo fajny pomys\u0142 - z ciekaw\u0105 realizacj\u0105 i na pewno wybijaj\u0105cy sie z t\u0142umu tylko niestety kwota kt\u00f3r\u0105 na siebie gra zarobi\u0142a nie zosta\u0142a wykorzystana - jest to troche zmarnowany potencja\u0142 przy prognozie tym czym mog\u0142a ta gra zosta\u0107 dzi\u0119ki uzbieranym pieni\u0105dz\u0105.\n\nDaje siedem gwiazdek \n[\u2605[\u2605[\u2605[\u2605[\u2605[\u2605[\u2605[\u2606[\u2606[\u2606]", "timestamp_created": 1423328543, "timestamp_updated": 1424195572, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.608123", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14367392": {"recommendationid": "14367392", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989598675", "num_games_owned": 198, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1422787633}, "language": "english", "review": "The book was better, but at least the game will read it for you and turn the pages!

Seriously, the Prince of Denmark is a colossal dumbass. He spends most of the play in a state of crippling indecision, talking to himself, talking to the ghost of his father and on one occasion even talking to the skull of some dude he used to know. When he does choose to do something, it is in almost every instance the worst possible thing he could have done. No man of action is Hamlet, instead he's an emo manbaby whose most famous speech is basically him debating whether or not to off himself. Pretty much anyone could do a better job of being Hamlet than Hamlet did, am I right?\n\nWell, good news! In To Be or Not To Be, you can find out just how well you'd do in Hamlet's shoes! You needn't limit yourself to being Hamlet, either. You can also choose to play as the beautiful, brilliant, emotionally unstable Ophelia or Hamlet's dad! Yes that's right, the dead dude, but remember, the whole reason the play even happens is because his ghost is hanging out in the castle! If you want, you can skip getting your idiot son involved and carry out your own ghostly revenge. Pretty kick ass, eh?\n\nI couldn't reccomend this game more highly. It is clever, funny and highly irreverent. However, potential buyers should keep in mind that this is a direct adaptation of a choose your own adventure style book.

The writer explained a lot of his jokes too much or put words in ALL CAPS to EMPHASIZE how FUNNY or ABSURD it is, RIGHT?!\n- Way too much money to pay for what it offers, a more appropriate price would be $5\n\nTo Be or Not to Be is a really good concept of a game. I happen to be a fan of \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" books and this game was trying to emulate that. What made me buy this game was the Kickstarter page, where it raised more than $500,000 for an originally $20,000 budget game. It clearly had devoted fans and excited developers (especially the writer), so I had to try it out with the expectation that this would be a witty and fresh take on the Hamlet story.\n\nMy biggest criticism is that the pacing is rushed. There was too much summary, like the writer is assuming we don't want to read certain bits or want to know how we got from Point A to Point B. In one playthrough, I played Ophelia and I got a choice of who was at the door: Hamlet, her father, or her best friend. I chose her best friend, but the narration declared that it was Hamlet and Ophelia can't \"CONTROL reality with her MIND. Sheesh!\" Then why would you give me the choice? Unless that was supposed to be funny, which leads me to my next criticism: The humor. There was no subtlety. Imagine someone paraphrasing Hamlet for you in a parodied slang, and then whenever a joke is coming they only get LOUDER and LOUDER to emphasize their point. That is the humor of this game.\n\nAnother playthrough, I played Hamlet Sr. and I had a choice of how to kill Claudius, his brother: Enlist your son to do it, or do it yourself. I chose to enlist his son, Hamlet, to do it only to be met with judgments and grief from the narrator claiming that the choice was \"awful, dude\". So they emphasize I have to live with this choice and then attempt to save me by saying I should pick an \"afterlife career\" (to which they needlessly list a bunch of mundane careers) or I can continue with my choice. I chose to go through with my choice only to be yelled at more and the narrator refusing to cooperate with me. So they just changed my character into Hamlet instead of my original choice, Hamlet Sr., because if I was going to \"induce a man to murder\", I had to go through with the murder myself. If I refused this change of events, they gave me an abrupt ending. In Shakespeare's play, Hamlet Sr.'s ghost form appears to Hamlet and tells him about the murder, planting the seed of revenge in Hamlet's mind. Judgmental narrators can work, but not when they don't allow you to make the choice at all.\n\nAs for the art (one piece for every ending), there wasn't too much of it and I don't think it was redeeming enough to make up for the writing, which is the dominant force of the game. So if you're buying the game to see the art, I suggest waiting for the game to go on sale. \n\nI went in expecting a coherent, branching storyline where \"your choices matter\" and you develop relationships with the characters in a way that was more in-depth than Shakespeare. This game is very casual and rushed, a playthrough possibly taking no more than a minute. While the \"canon\" playthrough is accurate and developed, I would suggest reading a Sparknotes version of Hamlet if you don't want to read Shakespeare's version. If you're still interested in the game, pick it up when it's on sale. However, if you share my criticisms, there are many games that do this style of game better.\n\nEDIT: A commenter pointed out that the Kickstarter was for the print book, not the game. Which in that case, I understand the rushed pace and perhaps lack of funding for the game. But my points still stand, since most of it was for the writing.", "timestamp_created": 1423098494, "timestamp_updated": 1423104968, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 227, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.694982", "comment_count": "10", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14331809": {"recommendationid": "14331809", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053055241", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1445646814}, "language": "english", "review": "If you enjoy shakespeare, this is great.

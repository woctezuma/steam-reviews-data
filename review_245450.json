It lacks the occasional obtuseness of the earlier games(both in terms of puzzle solutions and actual mechanics), not to mention their often poorly-aged interfaces, and it's a game that rewards clever ambushing and positioning.\n\nIt's just a shame that it never quite got finished. The end of the scenario has some parts that just don't happen(like your allies, if you have any, showing up at Ascension Peak), and the end of the game also has some gameplay issues. Firstly is the part where it tends to involve much larger battles than any other part, and the game's combat speed, even at max, means that battles against 20+ enemies tend to take forever until you start murdering them. Secondly is the issue where enemy magic resistances in the endgame are rarely lower than 90, meaning that a caster-heavy party is essentially useless at that point if they're not backed up by some physical bruisers.\n\nNonetheless, for all its flaws, it's definitely a game I'd actually recommend people play.", "timestamp_created": 1514004086, "timestamp_updated": 1514004086, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524370", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37876956": {"recommendationid": "37876956", "author": {"steamid": "76561198177347753", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2401, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513867161}, "language": "polish", "review": "Gra\u0142em w dzieci\u0144stwie brakuje jedynie polskiego j\u0119zyka gra nadal fajna nie gra\u0142em w nic podobnego", "timestamp_created": 1511873044, "timestamp_updated": 1511873044, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37851423": {"recommendationid": "37851423", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079970072", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511844506}, "language": "spanish", "review": "I loved the story of this game.. yes.. it has seen better days ... how i wish someone could tale the story and the gameplay of this wizardry serires and revamp and modernize it", "timestamp_created": 1511844591, "timestamp_updated": 1511844591, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37785132": {"recommendationid": "37785132", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086394196", "num_games_owned": 133, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1666, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509579118}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a great rpg of times past.

I consider Wizardry 8 to be one of the last tobust party-based dungeon crawler RPGs. It offers a TON of content in a charming fantasy/sci-fi world with a lot of attention to detail. The developers clearly made this game because they loved doing so and wanted to share that with the players. They spared no expense (RIP Sirtech...) to create this massive world to explore and plunder. In fact, there are even some \"secret areas\" that are as large as something that offer enough content they'd be sold as $10 DLC add-ons nowadays.\n\nPros:\n- Heaps of content\n- Good RPG mechanics\n- Fun party-based interactions\n- Great theme with well developed lore\n- Good NPC conversations with full voice-acting\n\nCons: Basically it's old\n- Slow combat (you can get a mod for this. I recommend it)\n- Dated graphics\n- Repetitive sound bank\n- Controls feel outdated\n- Unforgiving - even on easy difficulty, this will be hard. Expect pain. Quick-save often. Learn and improve.

Fighters, valkyeries, rouges, ranger, mage, priest, bishop, samurai, alchemist, gadgeteer, ninjas, bards etc. Each with there own specialty and stats ( strenghth, intellegence, piety, vitality, dexterity, speed and senses ) as long as skills such as sword, close combat, shield, dual weapons, communication, wizardry, stealth, lockpick, pick pocket etc very reminiscent of the elder scrolls system were you gain levels of your skills the more you use them such as using swords increases your sword skill or pickpocket increases your pickpocket skill but you also get the traditional experience which after levels youll gain attribute points, skill points and sometimes choosing new skills.      \n\n And then you can have a party of up to 6 so you have a lot of room to customize your party and you can even multiclass or switch classes if you want which is all a plus. You can also recruit up to 2 more party members throughout the game bringing your total party up to 8. \n\nWhat i really like about the magic system in wizardry is its the old school system such as FF1 were each school of magic or level of magic has its own magic points which is something i highly prefer and like more than just regular magic points because it allows more use of magic and encourages you to try new magic too were as in a normal magic system youd just use your favorite spells cause theres no real restraint aside from cost but in the old school style youd have magic in each level or school so if you used all your magic in fire magic youd still have all your magic points from mental, or divine or earth etc.\nThe game is also quite open world, not open as in elder scrolls open but still very open.\n\nAnother plus is the dialouge system which i think is much better than most games today or RPGS were you get a selection of choices and you just mash A/X till all the options arent lit anymore. In wizardry you can type or choose what to say so you have to actually pay attention to the dialouge. You can type in hi and theyd greet back or how are you? Or room? Or this place etc which feels more like your actually there and talking. Cause you have to pay attention such as if they said something important youd want to talk about or type in that point.\n\n\n\n\n\n                And for the bad:\n\n\n        it does have much bull$hi+ though. What i find really irritating about this game is just how often you miss its pathetic like whats the point of a fighter or samurai when all they do is miss!? And they just went way overboard with the enemies and battles theres no reason battles should go on for 20+ minutes because theres 12 enemies and then theres like the whole damn city and guards who all have to \"use a turn\" litterally its like watching a absurdly long loading screen! They even put a fricking yellow bar at the top of the screen which fills up more after each NPC/enemie takes there turn and half the time you cant even see whats going on cause the render distance is litterally 2 feet ahead of you. And you cant run from battles cause theyll follow you forever theyll still follow you after there off the screen! Whats the point of a run command when they follow you for so long?! And it takes so long you might as well just fight them instead! You have to be like on the other side of the planet before theyll stop chasing you its retarded! The biggest problem with the game is the insane amount of enemies like in the monastary youll face like 12 rats and it really takes minutes until each enemie moves and by the time its your turn agian youd have just wasted it cause you either missed or your fireball spell backfired and damaged your entire problem. Theres another problem too, level scaling or more so monster scaling were as the higher level you are the higher and stronger level and diffrent monsters and enemies are summoned which has its plus and negative. The plus is that the game never really becomes too easy and is always challenging.

I remembered deep char creation, went back to try it. \n\nFirst day experience: I spend half day creating my party of 6. Every following character took more time. Truth be told, I spent most the time reading and looking up info online on classes, combos, strengths ect, but I can tell you... it is VERY DEEP. Especially because the way it balances the classes isn't \"linear\"... Classes have tiers, basically meaning more powerful and imba ones are harder to play and are a lot weaker earlier and require more exp per level as well as pumping resources (time and ingame money) into them. \n\nUnique points: \n* Classes - As described in \"First Day\". I think it was 15+ different ones? They partially overlap. \nExample#1 - I love the fact that you can have a mage, that can cast everything in the game. But the class is so sh't and useless first half of the game, that it's not an insta-pick unless you want a challange. \nExample#2 - Variety of \"tank\" options... You can either be unkillable, because you have a %-chance to ressurect. OR you can have insanely high health regen, to be hard to bring down in the first place. OR you can have so fat armor that nothing really even scratches you. OR you can be so hard to hit (enemy miss), only option is AoE spells. Every option also has weaknesses in certain ways, which you can also try to mitigate...\n* This game enemy scaling is probably amongst the best I've seen in many RPGs. Grinding your character levels and skill early on doesn't make the rest of the game significantly easier, nor does it severely punish you either. I feel like I've significantly leveled up and improved my stats (some of my main attributes are maxed) and yet I still feel going to beginner areas somewhat of a challange. \n* Looting - You have loot that is visible on the floor, loot that is in chests/containers and loot that is \"invisible\" but you require a certain skill to \"see\" it. [either Ranger in party with it or \"Search mode\" or certain Active-Spell]\n* Strong status effects - Not just \"different\" versions of DoT damages ( like many RPGs do ) but actual status-effects that impact the combat, some are annoying enough because they're \"permanent\". Meaning they persist until taken care of with a strong status-specific potion or some other means (but there's enough ways to not feel cheesed either).\n* Races and Factions! - Amongst the most amount of interesting races (for me), without them all being \"cheesy\" as most modern RPGs... Mouse/Hamster people fighting against Rat people, awesome... Fish faced dudes, Robotic aliens, Half slime-insects, giant hairy gorillas... Also finally NO DRAGONS (they've been severely overused and are boring)\n* Journal - It has several interesting features. \n1) No cluttered useless chit-chat or background info you don't need.\n2) Quest hints and info is quite steamlined and slim, basically couple keywords. \n3) Doesn't hold your hand and make you feel like a ret'rd by telling you where to go and what to do precisely. \n* Inventory man.- this is done brilliantly. I love looting and this game enables it, but at the same time it has some \"soft\" penalties for being a pack-yak. \n\n\nWeak points:\n* Graphics obviously outdated. Doesn't bother me though.\n* So many awesome races existing in the game that you cannot create a character from. Sadly it'd probably break story logic, but hell I want to make a party of slime-insects or Fish-faces! \n* I'm not a game dev, but I see oceans of opportunities and \"easy\" ways to deepen the game and add replayability imo. \n* Many items despite different stats, qualities and names have same visual icon. This doesn't bother me, but in a modern game I would address this.\n* Game objective and quest log \"can\" be confusing, but it has a good effect to it [read Unique points.]\n* This game has interesting universe, wish there was like a \"encyclopedia\" to turn back to, to read up on what you've collected or found on different factions, races, events ect.\n\nConclusion: This is the kind of game, that makes me search for similar games in similar genre, that are as little as 10 years newer.

When I think about how much I've replayed this game (which is probably dozens), it would probably count as my favorite game. Considering that to be true, my experience wasn't exactly golden from the start, but I am glad that I did get back into it.\n\nI bought this game a long time ago before it was ever on Steam and I played it once and I didn't quite get the feel for how to run a party composition and I failed to get far in. I ended up setting the game down for a good 4 or 5 years before I picked it back up on a whim.\n\nIt may take a bit of trial and error feeling out a good party composition, or one that you can work with. If you have any experience with table top rpgs, you may have an easier time balancing out what you need to have a good experience. Several party compositions work, of course, but you many need more experience to use them as adaptly.\n\nYou will always (at least if you're new) need a good melee tank or 2 to absorb the volume of attacks that tend to target the front row, and that can be filled by a fighter, lord or valkyrie well enough, but some classes can really help you get along with what the game gives you\nIn general, Rangers, Bards, and Gadgeteers are a good boon for a party because of their various strengths for how the game is set up. \nRangers auto search for hidden items that you could run over and prevent you from a surprise penalty on initiative for combat that toggling a manual search does to you, and their ranged attacks scale well for late game.\nBards are useful because they can utilize all the instruments scattered throughout the game that can have some powerful magic effects by spending some stamina. They also can function well enough at a melee spot if you build vitality for a good amount of stamina (needed for instruments) and hit points.\nGadgeteers also benefit from various scattered parts in the game that can be combined to make gadgets that function much like the bard's instruments, very powerful as you progress. Their omnigun also grows more useful as they level with added chance effects that can help weaken enemies and have a growing list of ammunition types. ( % chance blind, unconsciousness and other effects on hit, can use rocks and musket balls and later darts, bolts and arrows)\n\nMagic begins a little sparce for casters, but ramps up toward mid level depending on which class and which schools of magic you spend points on (using magic can also add points in that school). You may want to spend heavily on one element to begin with and between magic usage and increased access as you level, you'll be more free to effectively spend points on other magic later on.\n\nDespite some difficulties when you're new, the game can be intimidating with an imbalanced party, but don't be afraid to play around with it. If you really push through into this game, you'll find exactly how great this game is. You have a lot of freedom with how to proceed and you can make allies with just about any faction. You can attack anyone too, but just make sure that you can survive the consequences (or save first).\n\nAnother friendly note: the Rapax Rift/Castle areas can be a deadly in the mid game if you're not ready to take on a high number of exceptionally strong enemies, though you generally get a good taste of you may fair in the swamps. Don't be afraid to flee a combat either, you may be unlucky enough to encounter a strong wandering mob of enemies that hit like trucks.\n\nAnyways - Survival is very rewarding in this game, save often if you see uncertain creatures on the horizon, or just run the other way. Leveling up feels good, and not too many games these days has that level of satisfaction with each level you gain. Don't be afraid to use a guide if you get stuck, I never did, but it can really help if you're not used to this style of rpg. It is a great game if you have the knack or patience to learn its ins and outs.

Thanks to the 3d presentation, it isn't as confusing to navigate around. However, as with all Sir-Tech games, they take 1 step forward and 2 steps back. The navigation would be better except they didn't use more landmark items to ease confusion, so you still need to draw a map.\n\nCharacter creation also got a lot better since you don't need to roll for hours on end to get good stats. It's a point buy system with static stats based on Race selection and Class selection. The streamlining of this made it more apparent that the game's level up system was badly done. Stats cap at 100 except by special items and it's very easy to reach 100 for the skills you want. They padded this process by forcing a 3 point limit per stat, per level.\n\nThe other major negative is the stat system gives no legimate education on the impact of stat raising. All you are told is high numbers are good and low numbers are bad. No info is given for hit chance, overall effectiveness, what randomizer is used to determine success, .etc Considering this is a D&D knockoff, knowing what your stats mean should almost be mandatory. The manual doesn't answer that either, by the way.\n\nI tapped out from playing farther after encountering the statue trap that sends the player down a pit to fight a bunch of bugs.

I remember always wanting to play these old style RPGs when I was younger but I never had the patience for them. I felt like I could enjoy them more now where as a child, I just felt like the game was unfair and I couldn't understand why. And while I wanted Grimoire, I didn't want to pay that price. And then I found Wizardry 8, a game from a tried and true series and said, what the hell.\nI tried 6 and 7 first. I wasn't a fan. Some things don't age well and the aid of nostalgia glasses don't help. They were just too outdated and honestly, the graphics were too pixelated and I had a really hard time reading them. The games literally hurt my eyes to look at. And I thought they were too clunky. I just didn't have a whole lot of fun in the short time that I did play them, so they got returned. But Wizardry 8 however, was a different story.\nThis game is closing in fast on 20 years old and even though it looks like it (albiet in a charming early 3d way), it sure doesn't feel like it. The frame rate is surprisingly smooth for something of this age. The sound is very high quality and the dungeon layout is beautiful. \nThe controls are a little odd and the default key layout is strange, but nothing huge to complain about. It's a minor gripe at best.\nThis game truly holds up after all this time and still runs wonderfully on modern systems. Unlike it's predecessors, Wizardry 8 has aged gracefully.

La possibilit\u00e9 de fuir, se retrancher, et m\u00eame de semer l'ennemi, rend les affrontements encore plus vivants. De plus, une action peut \u00e9chouer, par exemple l'utilisation d'un objet magique peut retourner la situation, mais pas comme on l'attendait. \nA tout moment, on peut swicher du tour-par-tour au mode battle \"en continu\".\nAinsi, une simple rencontre avec un pack de slimes verts au d\u00e9tour d'un corridor peut virer en bataille \u00e9pique, avec un suspense r\u00e9el qui emp\u00eache tout ennui.\n\nCe qui avive la curiosit\u00e9. On a envie de \"voir plus loin\".\nLe fait de pouvoir annoter la map rend aussi l'exploration plus active, les trajets moins r\u00e9barbatifs ou hasardeux.\n\n\n\n\nC'est l\u00e0 qu'on s'aper\u00e7oit que rien, dans WiZ8, n'est ennuyeux, irritant ou d\u00e9suet.

They are adequate to show you what is going on so you can choose strategies and tactics.\n\nWhen starting the game, the screen remains black for an unusually long time. This can lead new players into thinking something is wrong and pushing Esc or other keys to try to \"unstick\" it. This can ruin the game loading. Just be patient and the game will load reliably every time.\n\nThe game is difficult at first. It is possible to fail so badly that only starting over works.\n\nCharacter creation is deeply involved and not entirely obvious.\n\nBattles take a long time. If you are experiencing the dubious help of \"allies\" a single battle can take over an hour of real world time. If this is too annoying there are mods or play something else. I have no mod and no trouble with this but some are impatient or want a faster pace. There is nothing wrong with that. Play something else.\n\nGame designers were partially, but only partially successful in removing repetition and tedious aspects. For example vendor inventories need to be kept clear of cheap ammo (by buying and stashing it somewhere) or their inventories get clogged up and they do not offer the better items they will otherwise have as you go up in level. There is no need to grind in the game... but players sometimes do repeat things. After a while that can become not fun... but it is not needed. Conversations with NPCs (non-player characters) and RPCs (recruitable player characters) tend to be a bit tedious but they have bits of key info hidden among the topics.\n\nThere is a thing called Expert Skills that can be very important (only opened when an attribute is brought to natural 100) and powerful. This is a great game feature but is poorly documented. Power-Strike, Power-Cast and Eagle Eye are all powerful as well as sometimes other Expert Skills, depending upon the character and party. Only planning the character from the beginning lets one obtain these at all in time to matter. This is interesting and fun; it is only the lack of documentation (in game or manual) that is negative.\n\nSome Expert Skills do not help all of the characters one might think it should. For example, the Expert Skill Power-Cast does not benefit the Bard or Gadgeteer at all, even though their musical instruments and gadgets respectively do cast spells. It can be frustrating taking all the time to give an expert skill that does nothing.\n\nPositives:\n\nThere are many ways to design characters and parties. Some are better than others but the variety of right answers is huge.\n\nThe difficulty of monsters (expecially at first) makes every choice in character creation and development, as well as tactics and choice of spell or attack during a round really matter. This is fun.\n\nThere is not just one way to take on enemies. Spells and/or weapons can be used with multiple widely-varying strategies.\n\nSkill increases are rewarded when those skills are used. It feels natural and fun that you become increasingly effective at whatever you do.\n\nRunning and hiding in and fighting from nooks is part of this game. Once you get used to that it is a positive rather than a negative and is fun.\n\nEvery character in the game is potentially very strong. There are no weak characters, only weak players in generating and developing them.\n\nEven great players can combine into a weak party. The party is the emphasis for player wisdom in generating the right characters, in the right combinations, and using the right formation so they use what you want them to be good at. I keep saying \"right\" but there are lots and lots of right answers.\n\nThe story is weak and a small part of the game but it is consistent with several choices to explore during replays. The world is  a non-linear one that you can take in different orders (lots of right answers to exploring with various sequences). Numerous items are only in one spot and a few items only appear randomly in some games.\n\nEnemies level approximately as you do, one of the first RPGs to implement this feature and making boring tricks like grinding in one area simply bad ways to play this game. Unlike some games you do not need to rush, however, and there are plenty of rewards for thorough exploration.\n\nThe replayability of this game is extremely high, with different parties and styles explored, long after the story branches are all well known. No two games are even vaguely alike, even if you choose similar characters and sequences. Enemies are random and wide in variety, expecially when you change the sequence a bit (almost no wrong answers in doing so).\n\nEven after playing this game 10 or 20 times there is still a lot of depth and new things to learn. If you avoid advice tellng you that you need to play a certain way or that certain characters are weak then tons of possiblities and ways to play are opened up and give very different gaming experiences.\n\nThere is no randomness in character creation and development. For a certain class and race you get the same number of attribute and skill points to distribute every time. This is excellent because you can try different things, refine your choices, take or not advice from other players. Your skill as a player in developing your characters matters... a lot.\n\nNone of the complexities of the game are needed to enjoy and win it, only a bit of patience and maybe one or two restarts if one is a bit unlucky.", "timestamp_created": 1497408940, "timestamp_updated": 1497408940, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 71, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.874744", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32343292": {"recommendationid": "32343292", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047747145", "num_games_owned": 216, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1406, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493943366}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, I spent hours on it back in the early 2000's. again in the late 2000's and now again in 2017.

So men, during their only idle time, will waste it away on nonsense instead of thinking, then eventually talking with other men why their lives are so crappy.

I was never big on party based games. Several months later I decided to quit WoW and started thinking about other games to play. I found the demo for this and was hooked. Its the first party RPG I've seen where its possible to get through the game with any party combination if you're determined. \n\nThe first party I ran with was a fighter, rogue, ranger, mage, bishop, and a second fighter. A rather dry party but it got the job done. I've started several other play throughs but life keeps getting in the way. The bard class is excellent as you can level the music skill up outside of combat. The bards instruments focus on dealing damage and debuffing the enemy. The gadgeteer is the opposite where his creations focus on buffing the party and his weapon upgrades with every level. There are several other classes, all classes bring something unique to the table.\n\nThe world is narrow but big. My current play time of 1.8 hours only counts my steam played time, not my GOG or CD playtime. For $10 you will easily get your money's worth out of this game. There are secrets dungeons and unmarked quests to explore. While you can only have 6 PCs that you made in your party, 2 NPCs can join you. Keep in mind the more characters you have in your party, the less exp each of them gets as it is divided up.\n\nMy biggest issues with the game are 1. Combat can take a while at higher levels and 2. The mobs level up with you at times. Of course you do get some rather powerful weapons and abilities at higher levels. You can feel your characters getting stronger and they do unlock new abilities with each level up. Theres a great sense of progression with the game. \n\n\nI would highly recommend this game. Since I first played it I have looked for games like it. Etrian Odyssey is to grindy for my taste but I like the map making system. Other games the grinding is ok but the map system is horrible. This is one of the few games that I cant find anything like it to play afterwards except for one of the spinoffs that came out for ps2 but that still doesn't have the same feel.", "timestamp_created":

Voice acting is very good. \n", "timestamp_created": 1491724513, "timestamp_updated": 1491724513, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30883242": {"recommendationid": "30883242", "author": {"steamid": "76561198238118522", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 16, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506206414}, "language": "english", "review": "OKay if you like rpg's just buy the F##cking game", "timestamp_created": 1491071773, "timestamp_updated": 1491071773, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.383137", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30520793": {"recommendationid": "30520793", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001522719", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1451, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490227682}, "language": "english", "review": "RNG too easily hacked to feces.

I finally broke down and got it in a bundle and I'm so very glad that I did. I somehow missed this game when it was current, so I don't have any nostalgia blinders. I did grow up in the 80s/90s though, so I'm pretty well versed in the various eras of ugly video games and older graphics don't bother me. Still, this one looked like it might have been just too dated to be fun. The screenshots tend to look horrible so I hesitated.\n\nI'm so glad my misgivings were wrong. The graphics are actually not even that bad once you have a little time to adapt. I find the visuals quite passable now (though they are dated for sure, lets be clear on that).\n\nOne thing I noticed that kept being repeated while I was researching this game is that even today, nothing compares to Wizardry 8 or carries the torch. Its true. This RPG really is in a class by itself and if there is anything that really does its job, I have never seen it - spiritual successor or otherwise. \n\nThe character creation system is complex. There are a lot of races and classes to choose from and you can have up to 6 in your party, with 2 extra slots to recruit optional NPCs later. The leveling system gives the player a lot of control in each character's development and skills can also be raised through use, which is nice.\n\nCombat is turn based and you can issue commands to each party member before rounds. You can also turn continuous combat off and on (even mid-fight) to speed things up if desired. Formation also matters a lot but you can change it up during combat if a group of enemies attacks you from behind (being surrounded can be very dangerous though!).\n\nFor a game this old, the voice acting is surprisingly good as well.\n\nAnother thing that's impressive about this game, is how sophisticated and polished the interface truly is. There are a couple of things that are kind of annoying when you're trying to do things quickly (such as mass potion brewing/stack splitting) and the inventory can be a bit of a pain sometimes but even so, the interface of this game is probably one of the best designed I have ever seen. \n\nThis game is still worth playing, later.

quest markers and hand-holding became a more common theme to break the genre open and make it appealing to younger players.\n\nWizardry 8 boasts a fitting musical score to bring to life a variety of environments, some surprisingly good if not hammy voice acting that often manages to bring characters to life, and a no-pulled-punches approach to the gameplay. I found myself engrossed in this game as a younger teenager and played the whole thing to completion, despite what was back then a lack of [i]complete[/i] sensible consideration over certain decisions. \n\nReturning to the game years later has been as enjoyable as playing through it was the first time: the game is as challenging as I remember it being even with the additional bonus knowledge of tips and secrets that are incredibly easy to miss. Par for the course, by the time I hit the first real boss Gregor, I managed to have a character die on me and used my first Res. Powder - it's a surprising comfort to know some things just don't change.\n\nThe controls are a little more wonky than I remember them being, and of course Wizardry 8 demands a resolution that some might not be entirely used to these days, but though the game has clearly aged over the years it has done so gracefully and still provides a great classic RPG experience to any who want to dabble in the genre.\n\n(Also, I'm not saying but I'm just saying, a full Dex/Strength/Speed Rogue with Antone's cursed sword Bloodlust in main hand and any decent dagger in secondary might sound like a terrible idea in principle, but let me tell you when that sucker hits four to five times with Bloodlust and five to six times with his dagger he's gonna be your [i]favourite[/i] melee combat party member ever.)", "timestamp_created": 1484631536, "timestamp_updated": 1484631536, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.627701", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29282928": {"recommendationid": "29282928", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017536558", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 2078, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487388981}, "language": "english", "review": "Even now, this game holds up.

The variations in party configuration, the epic story, the size and scope of the game, the incredibly well thought out UI (especially given the release date), all add up to make an amazing game, with a ton of replay value.\n\nI had this game on CD when it came out, and put hundreds of hours into it, I think I'm over 100 hours now on the steam edition (which I bought instantly when I found out it was available).  I'm sure I will put at least 200 hours into this version, if not more.  It's one of the games that you can just keep coming back to.  The different approaches you can make to the game via party configuration, really does make reply beyond viable.\n\nWizardry 8 is a difficult game.  It doesn't hold your hand, give you quest markers, or make it easy for you to know exactly what you should do at all times.  It will nudge you in a general direction, and it's up to you to figure things out.  That can be a bit daunting at first, as the world is huge, and there are a lot of things going on.  It's also awesome, because everything probably actually does mean/do something.  See that blue feather on the ground?  Yah, it's for something, you just have to figure out what.  You have to think, deduce, and reason when you play this game, and that's awesome if it apeals to you.  There are of course, very in depth guides and spoilers, so you'll never really get stuck.\n\nI haven't gotten to the bottom of this game, even after at least 300 hours, and I still love starting up a new party and setting off again.  A tremendous game, that's well worth whatever they charge for it.

The Wizardry series was once THE big thing, together with Ultima, Might & Magic and a ton of classic DnD games it helped define the CRPG genre. \n\nWiz8 is the final part of the \"Dark Savant trilogy\", which started with Wizardry 6, but truth to be told, you can enjoy it without playing through the other games: There's not much of a story and while there are references and the option to import an old party, Wiz8 works as a standalone game. There are three powerful artifacts. There are several parties hunting for them. Go get'em and become as gods.\n\nWhat Wizardry8 is, is an old-school CRPG with a heavy focus on numbers and game mechanics. After creating a party of up to six characters from a wide range of classes and races, you're quickly introduced to the quest for the three artifacts that will make you the most powerful of all beings. But you start out weak, ill-equipped, and rather clueless, so it's time to  whack some rats first.\nEspecially for modern players, a party-based RPG with intricate combat, magic, crafting and lore systems will look... odd, maybe. There's more to it than charging at foes and waving your pointy sticks- Wiz8 comes with a pretty intricate combat system that takes into account anything from party formation to range and cover, so swapping weapons and using a turn to reposition your wannabe Gods is as important as taking advantage of elemental damage and resistance, items and special abilities. The interface looks rather crowded and clunky at first but it's amazing how well the various systems work together. With a simple click you swap a dagger for a crossbow, cast spells of varying power levels, or force your fighter into berserk mode. It's a good thing the combat IS so entertaining, because you will be fighting a lot. Fighting, and getting better at what you do, seeing your ragtag party dveloping their roles and skills and minmaxing the hell out of every character. If you enjoy that kind of stuff Wiz8 will be right up your alley.\n\nThe setting, too, does stand out even today. Just like the old M&M games there is an oddball mix of classic \"Sword and Sorcery\" fantasy and high-tech- characters travel between planets and dimensions, crossbows exist next to laser guns, and it's not uncommon to see a kickass Ninja Fairy gibbing a troop of androids.\nI repeat. Ninja Fairy. Fighting ANDROIDS. If THAT doesn't get you exited, nothing will :)\n\nHighly recommended to anyone who knows about the series at all or enjoyed some good old-fashioned CRPG games already.

I still give the game a run every year \u2014 though the GOG version runs better on my machine. Wizardry 8 is my second most favourite RPG of all time (after Morrowind).\n\nIt is an old-school party-based RPG: you can have between one and eight characters in your party, with the range of six and eight being the standard, and there are fifteen classes and eleven races to play with. There is no artificial limit to the possible combinations, so you can try all kinds of characters, be they wacky and gimmicky or not. Each character is excellently voiced; there are 18 different voices/personalities for male RPCs, and as many for female RPCs, not to mention  the mercenaries you can hire. Each is quite distinct from the others (for example, there is a New Age dreamy kind of girl, an aspiring writer, a warlike battle-maiden, a conceited know-it-all), and the amount of dialogue and remarks is staggering. Listening to your characters' comments is one of the best things about this game.\n\nThe main feature of Wizardry 8 is almost non-stop turn-based combat: you have to fight most of the time; no location (including the cities) is devoid of monsters. Some fights can be quite impressive, with your party being outnumbered four to one by creatures several levels higher (hey there, Rapax Castle!): such battles take a lot of thinking and adapting your tactics as the battle keeps on flowing.\n\nThe skills in the game are numerous: there is a dozen or so of combat skills, six schools (\"realms\") of magic, \"expert\" skills that you can only get by getting one of the primary attributes to 100, and supporting and miscellaneous skills. You can multi-class, creating amazing hybrids to better slay your enemies. The array of monsters is equally impressive: there are dozens of types of enemies, and hundreds of subtypes (say, the more generic \"android\" archetype comes in several variations \u2014 \"troopers\", \"slashers\", \"gunners\", \"berserkers\", and others). Each type of enemy requires a different approach: some will overpower you with magic if you let them; others will force the members of your party to attack each other; still others will rip you to shreds at close quarters if you let them close.\n\nThe setting is unique: it merges sci-fi with its spaceships, light sabers, and earth-to-air ballistic missiles (that you get to launch at people you don't like) with the more traditional fantasy elements, such as dragons, ghosts, and dwarves. And you've not seen it all until you've had your elf blast demons to smithereens with a rocket launcher.\n\nThe plot is not that impressive (though it's far from bad), but you don't play this game for the plot \u2014 you play it for the combat and the open world.\n\nThe difficulty comes in three levels, which fact will make the game manageable for everyone \u2014 provided you are careful and don't act like you are death incarnate. In this game, it's easy to lose a high-level party if the enemy gets a jump on you, along with a bit of lucky RNG.

There is always an argument over what \"hard-core\" means, but for old guys like me (39) who have seen just about the entire evolution of RPG's \"hard-core\" doesn't necessarily mean [i]hard[/i]--although they usually are--it simply means the player's skill is demonstrated by strategic and tactical strategy, exploration, character creation, willingness to keep good notes, and whereby the [i]character's skill[/i] is responsible for combat initiate, to-hit, locating items, detecting traps, warning about out-of-sight monsters, etc...\n\nWizardry 8 is a great game for anyone who loves developing characters! You get to design six, count 'em, six player characters, and then steer their leveling over the course of this long game. They will go through all sorts of armor and weapon combos, master their class skills, change professions to master new skills, learn dozens of spells, use musical instruments, create gadget weapons, master traditional weapons, etc... You will never be bored with a party of six PC's to manage.\n\nWizardry 8 is also a great game if you love combat. In fact, back in the day this game became notorious for its marathon combat sessions. Fights can easily go on for twenty or thirty minutes real time! In fact, I would mark this fact as both a strength and a weakness. This opinion will switch back and forth depending on whether I just won or lost a marathon fight. When you win these huge fights you will often level up several characters, if not the whole party, but when you lose you just wasted a half-hour of your life you cannot get back. Often I have been traveling Arnika road, and have had to deal with waves and waves of enemies, expending every last arrow, bullet stone, magic spell and drop of stamina and life, but was richly rewarded with XP, potions, gear, etc...\n\nIn true Wizardry style, the game world is just as much a puzzle as a fantasy world. The puzzles do not quite reach the sophistication of 'Myst' but you simply can't always go where you want to on the first try. You will need to solve quests for NPCs, find very well hidden artifacts, etc... to gain access to many areas. I love this though, because it makes reaching hard to access areas all the more exciting and rewarding.\n\nIn terms of difficulty, this game is certainly not easy. There are no quest arrows or fast-travel. You must drag information out of NPC's using your PC's communication skill, fights can be incredibly long and even low level monsters can wipe you out if there are 20 of them and they manage to surround your party (this is one thing about this game that seems ahead of its time--enemies do not just stand there and take a beating. They will always try to flank or even surround you. They don't have 'AI' per se, but their fighting instructions are well-written.\n\nObviously, the game's graphics have aged a lot since 2001. That being said, as you can see from the screen shots, the graphics are nice and colorful and quite sharp. The spell effects are varied, and there is plenty of variety when it comes to monsters. Besides, as I said in my opening paragraph, this game is really more a table-top simulator than a modern open-world RPG. It's not about eye-candy world (it's graphics were already weak in 2001), it's about thinking your way through quests, puzzles, long fights, and befriending NPC's to get much needed information. Also a handful of mods exist that tweak some of the balance issues in this game, and weed out some of the needlessly annoying issues that you will encounter in some areas.\n\nIn conclusion, I would strongly urge anyone who likes a challenge, and who likes the recent resurgence in old-school RPG's, to give this original old-school game a chance. Also, take the time to read the  other reviews and the game description. You'll see they are mostly positive, and many do a better job than mine describing the game. I am really hoping that someone will develop a new-generation Wizardry-style game to go along with the spiritual successors to Baldur's Gate (Pillars of Eternity) and to a lesser extent Ultima (Divinity Original Sin isn't quite the Ultima 7 successor I would like, but it's still really good). Give Wiz 8 a few hours to grow on you. It's like a great novel that needs the first twenty or thirty pages to establish itself, and then it's a real page turner the whole rest of the way.", "timestamp_created": 1477926596, "timestamp_updated": 1477930127, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.711709", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26260436": {"recommendationid": "26260436", "author": {"steamid": "76561198332298933", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 71, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477635776}, "language": "english", "review": "Sir-Tech closes it's doors, but bids a fond farewell to Wizardry with this most excellent installment:\nI practically cut my roleplaying teeth on Wizardry 7: Crusaders of the Dark Savant.

A full 1st person 3D open world with a combination of turned-based and real-time combat, full 6-party with 2 hirable NPC characters that can swap in and out (or simply become permanent), meaning 8 characters you can use as you progress through the lengthy game.\n\n[b]The main features:[/b]\n[olist]\n[*] [b]amazing character progression:[/b] with classes like Lord, Valkyrie, Bishop, Bard, Ninja and yes, Samurai - among many others including the staples like Priest, Mage, Rogue, etc., this game rewards the player with every encounter. It's a use-based skill system where characters have simply tons of potential skills, stats, and magic options to increase, all packaged in a very workable and mostly modern UX (that supports right mouse click to open, close).\n\nBy amazing, I mean amazing. Players have completed the game on its Iron Man mode, without losing a life, and have also completed the entire thing using just one character. I am on my 6th playthrough of the game (and I know many have much more than that). Any character combination is viable, and they are always growing in some way.\n\n[*] [b]great combat:[/b] what would a great progression system be without some place to show off. Here's where you can. While it's not the easiest game to at first get into (as it has more depth than almost any other RPG I've played), with things intuitively displayed such as your cone of facing, party positioning, short and extended weapons, all kinds of status effects you can get and inflict, all types of ranged weapons (including modern weapons and even a couple sci-fi influences), the game just puts it all together in an extremely well thought out experience. For example, cast a fireball spell and you'll get a nice draggable marker that extends out into the world with a range indicator, highlighting all it would affect. \n\nAnd there can be big battles. You'll be roaming the countryside and see a group of 10 bandits. They have an aggro range so when they \"sense\" your party, they'll start walking toward you. As soon as they get within combat range, turned-based combat will ensue. NOTE: by default you'll want to speed this up in options as it'll be too slow. Just slide it to its max.\n\nAfter any combat, you'll get a very cool list of all your character's skill increases, which always makes any combat worth entering into. By the end of the game, you will feel exceptionally, and appropriately powerful. \n\n[*] [b]open non-linear world:[/b] the world is a scary place. You can definitely travel to areas with creatures way too tough for your party, which makes exploring so fun. The path is not always exceptionally clear - a good thing in my book as it really relies on the player to get immersed and explore its lore. But you'll get to travel around and within cities on the ground and in trees, military bases, outposts, swamps, and hidden labs, among other places. And the order you do this is up to you. There are factions you can ally with and work for with meaningful rewards / consequences. \n\n[*] [b]replayability:[/b] the depth of the character progression and party options, as well as the non-linearity of main storyline, key randomized chest drops throughout, faction choices, as well as enemy spawn system, make for a highly replayable game.\n[/olist]\n\n[b]TIPS FOR BEGINNERS[/b]:\n[olist]\n[*] [b]important:[/b] for most wide screen monitors this game will by default looked \"stretched\". You'll likely want to (until a widescreen patch with proper UI support is made - there is one but the UI stretches) play this in 4:3 ratio. Which means you'll need to go into your graphic card settings (e.g., nVidia control panel), go to \"Adjust desktop size and position\", and for GPU set maintain original aspect ratio, then save changes. Also when you run the game and its 3D setup, choose Direct 3D as your mode, and ensure that it's set to 4:3 ratio. Then you'll get the correct black bars and your mouse will be nicely constrained. It will also look much better, and I find is completely playable.\n\n[*] google search Wizardry 8 tips and you'll find a few key websites with information on party building, etc. GameFAQs also has some good guides\n\n[*] make sure you have one or two spellcasters in your party (e.g., mage / priest) as they have beneficial long-term spells they can cast like Armorplate or Enchanted Blade that can be up at all times starting from not long into the game. And don't forget light. :)\n\n[*] positioning is key. As you travel in the Monastery and in the wilderness, mostly stick to the sides of the area, as they'll have nooks and crannies you can get your party into, so enemies won't surround you and get your back-positioned party members. Doorways and narrow hallways help with this, too. \n\n[*] don't be afraid to find a corner, press \"c\" to camp, regenerate your spellpoints / hp, and then start again.\n\n[*] there's a quicksave - simply press \"q\" and there will be multiple slots worth that recycle. It's instant, and do it often.\n\n[*] practice using skills and spells - the more you practice, the more effective they become. For example you can practice examining locked chests for traps, or picking a complicated door over and over (when you find one) to increase your locks & traps skill.\n\n[*] focus on only a couple primary stats at first until at least one is 100. It then unlocks a special trait that's usually very helpful. This won't happen until early-mid game if you're persistent. \n[/olist]\n\nSure there's more but there is a ton of info about this game still... and a somewhat active player community, even 15 years later.

Over and over again. In the rare cases where another party member were getting injured too much, I had to throw a couple of healing spell and done.

You're even annoyed that those games aren't featuring turnbased combat. And the setting seems too familiar like something done a million times before. \n\nWelcome to Wizardry 8. Pretty much the pinnacle of turnbased dungeoncrawler cRPG's. This one is gold. If you ever played Might & Magic, Eye of the Beholder, Menzoberezzan or the newer Legend of Grimrock (which is gridbased unlike this one) you'll most likely adore this game. \n\nThis is a game for oldschool RPG players. It's stat-heavy, character development is exciting and fun, there is A LOT of combat and A LOT of loot, progression feels right and well paced, character voices are a blast, music is pretty atmospheric and nice, the world is a bit empty but looks decent for an oldschool cRPG and the 90's developer humour is a joy to behold (do check the manual as well for some quick laughs). \n\nThe amount of races (11) and classes (15) gives this game one of the most intriguing character creation schemes ever. It's bloody hard to settle on 6 characters only when they all sound very unique and interesting. The game lets you recruit two npc's at a time (RPC's) with their own benefits and limitations (some outright refuse to go to certain areas).  Once created the future development starts to intrigue you. You'll most likely end up in forums getting answers to a lot of questions in that regard. Which is quite nice. I learned half of this game by reading posts and figuring out different approaches. \n\nWhich is this game's strongest side IMO. There is no right or wrong way. It's how you wanna play it (for the most part). There is no such thing as an optimal party. It's what you want it to be. What suits your roleplaying and gameplay the best. And that's one of the reasons it's hard to become tired of this game. The amount of options, how many characters to run (1-6), where to go (semi-open world), what skills to emphasize developing, who you wanna recruit etc..... You most likely wanna try out every possible combination. \n\nThe game has a few bugs. Luckily the game uses rolling quicksaves so you can have 3 quicksaves at a time (at which point the first gets overwritten and so forth). And the combat can get really slow. I highly recommend using the monster movement speed mod: http://wolfie.wiz8.de/Wiz8Fast.html\n\nTL;DR \n\n\"You're going to need someone of superior intelligence\"\n\nIf you like oldschool, combat and stat heavy cRPG's you will get hooked on this one. I've seen people with ridiculous amount of time in this game. People who tried multiple playthroughs with different setups, 1 character iron man games, you name it. \n\nPersonally I have 300+ hours in the game (some off Steam) and have gotten around 15%-20% through the game then restarted to try out different parties and builds. This game will do that to you. I have rarely seen a starting zone (the Monastery) this many times in any cRPG I've ever played. And I love it. \n\nThe game has some quirky puzzles. Things you wouldn't expect or see coming. And the feeling of solving said puzzles leaves one with the satisfaction like no other. Back in the day people didn't go online to check walkthroughs but sticked with it and got the most rewarding feeling of figuring something out for themselves. This game has that sort of \"achivement moments\". \n\nIMHO this game, Fallout 1&2 and Arcanum is the best non-D&D cRPG to ever have been made. It's just that bloody good. Not the story, but the level of party customization, the mix of \"improving through usage\" and point distribution at level-up's, the witty voiceacting, the weird fantasy-scifi setting, the extremely tactical combat system (positioning is everything), the small tricks you pick up as you get better at the game etc.... \n\nIt is simply brilliant.

Those games are in a different category of coolness, but Wizardry 8 branches out and places a shadow over everything.\n\nHere are the reasons Wizardry 8 is the best RPG ever.\n\n*An uncanny amount of enemies in most fights, for an RPG of this kind. (You can have 30 or more monsters in a single battle.)\n\n*AoE spells are the best.\n\n*Every enemy EXPLODES or DISINTEGRATES on death. Nobody falls over and leaves a corpse. Cleaner world, cooler finishers.\n\n*This is one of those rare games with a class that can eventually learn every spell available, and that class can eventually one-shot the entire enemy lineup of 30 or more monsters. Bishop or bust, homes.\n\n*Monks will roflstomp everything. And I do mean everything.\n\n*It has Wookies.\n\nAll you have to do is drop a measly $10, pocket change, and you've got hundreds of hours of gameplay at your fingertips. Ignore my steam times - I've been playing Wizardry 8 off and on for 13 years. I've probably beaten this game more times than any other game I've ever played.

Here are a few tips as well as a helpful video.\n- Always have atleast one fighter preferable 2\n- have a mage\n- have a psionic\n- make sure you don't have more than 3 ranged characters (with little health) with you. \n- SAVE OFTEN\n- If a character dies, load your last save.\n- Early on in the game (first 30 minutes) mages and other low health characters will probably die at least once your first couple parties.\n- Don't give up\n- Last but one of the most important, EXPLORE!!! It helps a lot.\nFinally here is the video and if you need more help send me a msg and I will try my best to help you.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKejat-4qHo", "timestamp_created": 1452651858, "timestamp_updated": 1452651858, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.707164", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20338982": {"recommendationid": "20338982", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024907369", "num_games_owned": 316, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451959554}, "language": "english", "review": "Buy it for the nostalgia, buy it because it's a fun way to waste an afternoon, but don't buy it for the Mac port.

You'll meet many incredible monsters, some easy to beat, some hard to beat, some even impossible to beat - (you might have to run from them).\n\nThe story is continued from its predecessors and now your party can even ascend and become gods (or cosmic lords, as the game calls it). Which is incredibly fun!\n\nSo it's not an easy game at all. It can be a challenge. And you can build your characters wrong so they may be useless in the endgame. But it's an incredibly rewarding game. For every new player, I'd recommend to make yourself familiar with the game on normal or easy settings, then go for the 3rd and highest difficulty for an amusing game where you'll sometimes have to run but where XP flows steadily and challenges come galore.\n\nJust for fun, I have started a speedrun to share my hundreds of hours I have played this game - not only on steam, but before too. I'm so happy about this version as my old DVDs didn't work with Windows 7 anymore.\n\nYou can read newbie tips about the game here: www.thoughtfulgaming.com - and you'll have access to my YouTube from there too.\nAnd there are, of course, many Playthroughs on YouTube for the game. Some of them really funny if new guys play it blindly. You will experience some of the fun if you buy and play this game just like that.\nAnd for the speedbumps, you can go to e.g. my blog and get some starting help

Just requires some patience. Its an old game but I think the graphics are quite alright. I play in windowed mode so I can chat and do other stuff too (search online for the tweak). One thing I like is the way battles can be automated or micromanaged. Positioning, formation  and knowing when to use spells is critical!

I just leave it here (beware of much text ahead).\n\nStraight to the point. Wizardry 8 is a fabulous game. I mean, the best game ever. Only after over 500 hours played I'm realizing that all of my best loved games are just no way superior to this masterpiece. Powerful artifacts, deadly encounters, incredible adventures \u2013 this is Wizardry 8 in a nutshell. Like any other game of its kind, Wizardry 8 is definitely not going to be appraised in terms of mere good or bad. Once in a little while it looks completely genial, sometimes you are like \u201cWhat the hell were they dreaming of introducing this?!\u201d, but rather more often you simply don't know how to react to what you see on the screen.\n\nWizardry 8 is both amazing with its exceptional gameplay features and frustrating with its outrageous flaws. It provides a vast open world which should teem with lots of NPCs engaged in profound interactions, but for some reason it is nowhere nearly true. This world itself is not going to be lively and frolic of any kind. The sparse Dominus dwellers resemble me some kind of heartless automata, and only brilliant dialogues are the ones to persuade that these wretched beings are actually sentient and full of life. Most of player's concerns are confined to insane scouring areas for valuable loot and exterminating representatives of the local fauna, the remains of the later ones to be involved into a biological cycle. \n\nMany of the classes are interesting to try out and even extraordinary, though some of them seem not entirely refined. For instance, the samurai class. In my vision, these guys are implied to be ultimate fearless warriors, slicing their enemies into multiple pieces, casting thunder storm over them simultaneously. But like it was implemented in the game, a samurai will never exceed the plain fighter since he tends to get exhausted too quickly and even is not able to go berserk upon his foes. Similarly, he's barely capable of serving as a decent spellcaster for his getting some epic spells rather late, not counting the wizardry spellbook being not the most effective. It's also worth mentioning the minor racial abilities. For example, the faeries possess a natural bonus to AC which is predictably to be explained by their small size and high mobility. However, that gives no considerable benefits to their survivability in combat \u2013 enemies will regularly hit your faerie, shamelessly ignoring her gift. Some races weren't given any specific talents at all.\n\nWizardry 8 is notable for its marvellous sounds and music, yet even this trait is innerly inconsistent. The musical compositions are great enough, but not various and for sure not numerous. Many of the sound effects are so stunningly convincing that sometimes they pierce your head, with sudden death of your character from Boiling Blood causing an emotional trauma.\n\nThe auto-levelling system seems to make sure there is always a match to your heroes from the beginning towards the very end, but it proves to be broken inside. Being more precise, it comes out in that your party is often going to get either gutted by powerful beasts far greater or simply bored to death by those who are many levels lower than your buddies.\n\nThe ferocious randomness and merciless monster respawning are supposed to make your characters\u2019 life unbearable by all means. Having gone insane, a fighter will stab down his party mate just in a couple of casual swings, or give an instant deathblow to that one who urgently needs healing. Miscasted spells will backfly by chance which may turn demise for the whole party. Your enemies themselves will show up just from nowhere and tread your group around swiftly, leaving you no chances to get away. Bad enough they appear in enormous packs, but they also have ridiculous amounts of health and are always glad to perform some nasty tricks for you. Those encounters can be infernally difficult at times, yet they ultimately cause you build your team sensibly, with equal dedication to every single member.\n\nEither of those features seems not to be able to handle itself, to say nothing of how they all were supposed to get along with one another. That being said, overlapping and twisting into a disproportionately shaped entity, they basically form Wizardry 8\u2019s tangled consistency. Deprived of any of them, the whole thing will get collapsed.\n\nBut enough vilifying for right now. What\u2019s so special about Wizardry 8?\n\nFirst of all, this game offers the most complicated character development system I have ever seen. It enables you to create a team of spunky adventurers, each of whom (in his own pathetic way) is going to embody your personal ideas on what the true hero should be. For a spry hardcore player, there\u2019s a possibility to create a party of one \u2013 that\u2019s when the real challenge begins. You can also import your characters from Wizardry 7 \u2013 then it gets even more interesting.\n\nWizardry 8 got a tremendous score of replayability. Here one will find a lot of everything to tinker with: races, classes, skills, spells and so much more. Such a range of variety makes you dizzy of numerous options, meaning that none of your replays will be similar to one another.\n\nThe communication system is rather unique to any game known to me \u2013 instead of clicking text-lines you are suggested to pick out a subject from the text on your own, and note that not interacting with everyone you encounter you\u2019re going to cluelessly stagger around, futilely trying to figure out what\u2019s the point and what you should do now. Rare NPCs you meet may not seem much sensible outside, nevertheless they have many interesting thoughts to share, and who knows what innermost secrets they may keep? Practically each of events happening to the group is accompanied by charming remarks let out by your adorable characters what in a way makes you believe they are real personalities. You see just the portraits of them all the time, with only lips moving and eyes blinking, but they do a great work towards convincing you they are alive.\n\nThankfully, Wizardry 8 lacks in annoying cut-scenes and stretched videos, as well as evident hints at what you need to do next and where head for, like \u2018walk there, kill that bad guy, enjoy the ending\u2019. All you got is your own mind to apply and the vast open world to explore, full of obscure menaces and incredible adventures. The conditions of victory are stated explicitly, but what are the ways of pursuing them is not as clear. Upon the emergency landing on Dominus, one thing proves undoubtful, though: the fact of your party surviving a shipwreck is definitely not a prospect for having a nice trip after all. Prepare for a long and arduous journey which involves reaching celestial heights and diving in the ocean abyss, creeping along spooky dungeons and roaming around a whole city built up on a tree, meeting old comrades and making some new friends as well. You'll have to handle interracial disputes and solve fancy puzzles, and in the end of your adventure you're going to save the world, of course!\n\nI'm being out of space to write in, so let's get approaching a closure. To sum up all the stuff mentioned above, I\u2019d say Wizardry 8 is a genuinely unique RPG game featuring challenging yet still rewarding gameplay, immersive rpg system, overwhelming sounds and adorable dialogues. It's the case when originality and inconsistency blended together make for products of the highest quality. Too bad such a game was irreverently forgotten.\n\nPS the text was initially written in another language and I couldn't squeeze it into a steam review due to the dumb limitation to about 2000 symbols.

However, it is ultimately crippled by tedious combat mechanics. It is still weird enough for me to recommend it, but with the caution that it is best suited for gamers who can view this boring combat as a form of meta-challenge; I do not, and I did not continue.\n\nFor old-school fans, there is fun to be had in the kooky character background and class options, the stat-tweaking galore, the deep party-building, the non-linear play with many story options, and the offbeat NPCs. The voice acting is quite good and it all makes up in novelty what it lacks in graphics.\n\nThere is not fun to be had in the combat. The turn-based combat is not difficult in any engaging, strategic sense. It is simply slow and boring, even with a continuous-combat option. A single combat can easily last over 10 minutes of hack-slash-repeat. Much of this is because the game predominatly uses large groups of monsters, each moving in turn-based fashion. Other factors slow it further. AOE magic is typically quite low-damage; there is good CC, but never any quick mass-kills to clean house and move on. Your party has to move constantly, again in turn-based fashion, into extremely close range to hit with melee weapons, while enemies inexplicably do not. You cannot disengage from combat by running away or having enemies run from you; so if you Terror the enemy, you may have to wait a long time for them to return while you sit there, turn by turn. And there are many unavoidable fights, especially as creatures respawn in narrow roads, tunnels, etc.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the rest of the game and explored five major areas of it. But I finally gave up on this one night after an hour of gaming that consisted of walking about 1/4 mile on a road, and engaging in three unchallenging combats and one NPC conversation. The convo was about 5 minutes, the walking less than that. Do the math on how tedious the combat is. And looking down the road, I saw yet another mega-mob coming...

The controls and graphics are fully acceptable by today's standards (though you may want to swap your cursor keys for WASD) and I've seen many modern mobile games look worse. The introduction basically tells you all you need to know about the Wizardry games that came before, so no need to play any other titles prior to this one.\n\nThe Wizardry series was hit and miss for me in the old days since it was one of the worst offenders in the \"ecology of a dungeon\" -- with rats and ninjas one step down a corridor from slimes ready to pounce you from total darkness. Wizardry 8 is much more realistic in that sense with slimes in rooms where it looks like they'd thrive, for example, although it still has some of the wacky characters and races more suited to science fiction than fantasy. I'm not sure how I feel about that aspect of the game - but this particular Wizardry seems less corny in that way.\n\nThe locations are varied and interesting, and the game makes you want to explore every nook and cranny rather than blow through it. Sometimes you will find little hidden items and clues, so the searching is worth it. \n\nThe gameplay is a hybrid between Castle Grimrock / Dungeon Master / Bard's Tale classic-style and 3D full-range movement CRPGs, and allows you to position your characters to the sides in your party formation. I have yet to decide if this works well (since while you can be flanked you cannot flank the enemy with your \"blob), but it does add interest to how you form your party. \n\nIf you like dungeon crawls with inventory management, healing spells, and a casual tone (but with ample challenge), this one is a good use of your time.", "timestamp_created": 1433694963, "timestamp_updated": 1433695357, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549223", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16228198": {"recommendationid": "16228198", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022390880", "num_games_owned": 349, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3350, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468411909}, "language": "english", "review": "If there is a game that deserves a HD remake It's this one.

This will be a turn off for some (felt as a grind) and a sweet joy for others. You can like the story or not but the fact is that you will spend most of the time in this game doing combat using a very special first person turn based system. Combat takes place in the same first person world view as exploration when enemies spot you and are close enough or when you decide to turn on combat mode. At first, it is difficult to understand the combat system and how it works, but once you get the hang of it (or read the manual) it is truly amazing. Turns are simultaneous, meaning you first choose an action for each of your characters (or keep the default one), then click \"end turn\" and see what happens (both your party and enemies will act according to their initiative, some actions may be cancelled or become useless depending on what happens and when). In first person view you never see your characters in 3D but there's a combat formation pane to position your group of characters (you can change during combat as well costing a turn to involved characters): it affects which enemies you can reach in melee depending on your weapon and the position of the enemies, and vice-versa. You can also move the whole group during a combat turn but it can prevent some characters to act for this turn. Positioning does matter in this game, and it's not at all like a simple turn based rpg where you just choose an action and a target for each character one at a time. There are also AoE items and spells, you can choose spell levels at your own risks (a spell may frizzle or even backfire if you're not skilled enough, on the other hand you can always choose a lvl 1 version of a spell for lower mana cost and safe results).\n\nThere is also the characters creation system with A LOT of races and classes to choose from, more than any other RPG I know. You can make a party of 6 characters or less (plus there are 2 guest slots reserved for story NPCs). The levelup and skill systems are great. Once you have enough XP, you levelup your characters when you want outside combat (you can pile up levels even): you invest points on stats and skills and spells, separately (each have their own points so you don't have to sacrifice one for the other). Your skills and spells also improve by using them (in and out of combat).\nImproving your characters is a real pleasure in this game and it feels very rewarding, never limiting or frustrating.\n\nHonestly, I'm still looking for another game with these features and I don't find it. Plus the way your characters portrait talk and react to things in and out of combat really gives personality to the adventure (without cut scenes and long dialogues). You even choose your character's portrait, personalities and voices for various hilarious results (and you can change those anytime during your adventure).", "timestamp_created": 1432409967, "timestamp_updated": 1432410050, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15773640": {"recommendationid": "15773640", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009379161", "num_games_owned": 189, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 13637, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492182197}, "language": "english", "review": "Wizardry 8 is a game from my childhood and was very pleased to see it was available on steam, so far with 40 odd hours of game play and no bugs yet so it gets a thumbs up from me!", "timestamp_created": 1431268441, "timestamp_updated": 1431268456, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15756936": {"recommendationid": "15756936", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028770494", "num_games_owned": 2302, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 4759, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1388347085}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0430\u0442\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0444\u0435\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0435\u0442\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0433 \u0438, \u0441\u0443\u043a\u0430, \u0430\u0431\u0441\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0442\u043d\u043e \u0431\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0449\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0434\u0438\u043b\u043a\u0430 \u0432\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0431\u043e\u0435\u0432\u043a\u0438.\n\u042d\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044b \u043e\u043b\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0443\u043b\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0443\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u044e\u0442. \u041d\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u0440, \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0448\u0435\u043b \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0439\u043a\u0435 \u043d\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043e\u0433\u0440\u044b\u0437\u043e\u043a \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u0432\u0437\u044f\u043b \u0441 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0439, \u0442\u043e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0442\u0438.\n\u041d\u043e \u0432 \u0446\u0435\u043b\u043e\u043c \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0430. \u0418 \u0431\u0435\u0441\u0438\u0442 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0438.", "timestamp_created": 1431182854, "timestamp_updated": 1431182854, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546996", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15648033": {"recommendationid": "15648033", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121997809", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1488, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1430534734}, "language": "english", "review": "too slow for me :/", "timestamp_created": 1430544414, "timestamp_updated": 1430544414, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.305116", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15647138": {"recommendationid": "15647138", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013815387", "num_games_owned": 1482, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 3592, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474395204}, "language": "english", "review": "Length of Time Played: ~300 Hours (On and Off Steam)\nDistance Played: Beaten the Game on Ironman Mode\nPersonal Grade: A+ (5th Favorite Game of All Time)\n\nOpinion of Each Aspect\n\nGrading System -

It is on its own, the last Wizardry game of the Dark Savant trilogy made by Sir-Tech as well as being the last within the official series (the license was given to game developers in Japan who made their own Wizardry games such as Tale of the Forsaken Land which have their own story and universe in comparison to that of 8).\n\nThe gameplay itself gives players either a turn-based approach or a more active but still turn-based take on combat. The game itself is a mixture of fantasy and sci-fi, pitting players against mundane enemies such as a human spell-caster and giant rats to more technological or magical enemies such as androids or demonic beast. Wizardry 8 offers a variety of customization to players based on the races and classes to choose from. This means one can play with a normal party such as a dwarf fighter, elf mage, and a human thief to something a bit more diverse such as Hobbit ninja's and Felpurr samurai's. Not only is there a variety in races (such as human, rawulf, dracon, mook, etc.) and classes to pick (such as bishop, priest, ninja, alchemist, etc.) but the game also offers a variety of equipment to use, each with their own advantages and restrictions.\n\nThe story of Wizardry pits the player's party against the forces of the Dark Savant for whatever reason (using an imported save where you went with an important NPC to Dominus, following a prophecy you'd first hear a bit from the Trynnie merchant, the game does have different intros based on what saves you use, be it imported saves from Wizardry 7 or using an entirely new party). Ultimately (without trying to spoil too much), the story would lead to players trying to gain a power that the Savant himself desires.\n\nThe only con to Wizardry 8 as far as I know is that trying to play it off Steam with a mod (only tried the Christian Coder mod) doesn't seem to work for some reason.\n\nIf you are a sort of person who is interested in playing a good CRPG that is worth the time and money spent, Wizardry 8 is one to go with.", "timestamp_created": 1425503745, "timestamp_updated": 1425503745, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.640264", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14709391": {"recommendationid": "14709391", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990561916", "num_games_owned": 356, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442493374}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0438\u043a\u0430, \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u043e \u043d\u0443\u043b\u0435\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043b \u0437\u0430 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u0432 \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u043e\u0442 \u0411\u0443\u043a\u0438. \u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0430, \u043a \u0441\u043e\u0436\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044e, \u0442\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0433 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0442\u0438 \u0438\u0437-\u0437\u0430 \u0431\u0430\u0433\u0430 \u0432 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u043c \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0446\u0435 (\u0437\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043b\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043a\u0435 \u0432 \u0444\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043b\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438).", "timestamp_created": 1425217216, "timestamp_updated": 1425217216, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14658686": {"recommendationid": "14658686", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049798597", "num_games_owned": 236, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 5568, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1413805358}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u6e38\u620f\u53f2\u4e0a\u4e00\u9897\u6c38\u4e0d\u9000\u8272\u7684\u5b9d\u77f3\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u7ecf\u8fc7\u591a\u5c11\u5e74\uff0c\u59cb\u7ec8\u6563\u53d1\u7740\u593a\u76ee\u7684\u5149\u8292\uff0c\u6c38\u8fdc\u50b2\u7acb\u5728RPG\u754c\u7684\u9876\u7aef\uff0c\u8fd9\u5c31\u662f\u5bf9\u5deb\u672f8\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u6700\u5ba2\u89c2\u7684\u8bc4\u4ef7\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1424938033, "timestamp_updated": 1479949943, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.640792", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14593409": {"recommendationid": "14593409", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990001715", "num_games_owned": 980, "num_reviews": 73, "playtime_forever": 1902, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1390385105}, "language": "english", "review": "Immortal Classic.

You guys are awesome! \n", "timestamp_created": 1424608477, "timestamp_updated": 1424608477, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521552", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14528006": {"recommendationid": "14528006", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061063257", "num_games_owned": 356, "num_reviews": 155, "playtime_forever": 758, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1421608558}, "language": "japanese", "review": "RPG\u306b\u591a\u5927\u306a\u5f71\u97ff\u3092\u4e0e\u3048\u305f\u4e8b\u3067\u6709\u540d\u306a\nWizardry\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u306e\u7b2c\u516b\u5f3e\u3002\n\u8272\u3005\u5916\u4f1d\u3084\u3089\u5fa9\u523b\u7cfb\u304c\u51fa\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u304c\n\u5b9f\u8cea\u7684\u306b\u306f\u3053\u308c\u304c\u6700\u7d42\u4f5c\u3068\u8a00\u308f\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\n\u30d1\u30c3\u30b1\u30fc\u30b8\u7248\u306f\u3068\u3093\u3067\u3082\u306a\u3044\u30d7\u30ec\u30df\u30a2\u4fa1\u683c\u304c\u3064\u3044\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\u304c\nSteam\u3067\u304a\u624b\u9803\u4fa1\u683c\u3067\u8cfc\u5165\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\n(\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u8a33\u306f\u672a\u5b8c\u6210\u3067\u3059\u304c)\n\n\u904e\u53bb\u4f5c\u3068\u306f\u9055\u3044\u30011\u30de\u30b9\u305a\u3064\u9032\u30803D\u30c0\u30f3\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u5f0f\u3067\u306f\u306a\u304f\nDoom\u306e\u69d8\u306a\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u79fb\u52d5\u5f62\u5f0f\u306b\u5909\u66f4\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u305f\u308a\n\u6575\u3068\u906d\u9047\u3057\u305f\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3067\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u304c\u5909\u308f\u308b\u306a\u3069\n\u8272\u3005\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u304c\u5c0e\u5165\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\n\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u3092\u80b2\u6210\u3059\u308b\u697d\u3057\u3055\u3001\u672a\u77e5\u306eMAP\u3092\u63a2\u7d22\u3059\u308b\u559c\u3073\u306f\n\u5065\u5728\u3067\u3059\u304c\u6614\u306e\u6d0b\u30b2\u30fc\u3089\u3057\u3044\u7406\u4e0d\u5c3d\u3055\u3082\u5065\u5728\u3002\n\n\u30fb\u4ef2\u9593\u3092\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3055\u305b\u308b\u65bd\u8a2d\u304c\u306a\u304f\u3001\n\u5e8f\u76e4\u3067\u6b7b\u306c\u3068\u751f\u304d\u8fd4\u3059\u306e\u304c\u56f0\u96e3\u3002\n\u30fb\u6575\u304c\u30ea\u30b9\u30dd\u30fc\u30f3\u3059\u308b\u3068\u4e3b\u4eba\u516c\u3068\u540cLV\u3067\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3059\u308b\u306e\u3067\nLV\u3092\u4e0a\u3052\u3059\u304e\u308b\u3068\u5834\u6240\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u306f\u8a70\u3080\u3002\n\u30fb\u72b6\u614b\u7570\u5e38\u306e\u5d50\n\u30fb\u4e00\u90e8\u72b6\u614b\u7570\u5e38\u304c\u5e8f\u76e4\u3067\u306f\u56de\u5fa9\u4e0d\u80fd\n\u30fb\u9053\u3092\u5916\u308c\u308b\u3068\u5f37\u3044\u6575\n\u30fbLV\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u3067\u706b\u529b\u304c\u4e0a\u304c\u3089\u306a\u3044\n\n\u7dfb\u5bc6\u306a\u8a08\u753b\u3092\u7acb\u3066\u305a\u306b\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u3059\u308b\u3068\n\u6b63\u306b\u4fee\u7f85\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\u3002\n\u3057\u304b\u3057\u30ec\u30c8\u30ed\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306b\u6163\u308c\u305f\u4eba\u306a\u3089\n\u4f55\u5ea6\u304b\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3092\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u5185\u306b\u8981\u9818\u3092\u63b4\u3093\u3067\u3001\n\u9b3c\u755c\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u306b\u81ea\u7136\u3068\u99b4\u67d3\u307f\n\u5c11\u3057\u305a\u3064\u63a2\u7d22\u51fa\u6765\u3066\u3044\u308b\u81ea\u5206\u304c\u3044\u308b\u3068\u601d\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\nDOS\u6642\u4ee3\u306b\u904a\u3093\u3060\u96e3\u3057\u3044\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u601d\u3044\u51fa\u306b\n\u6d78\u308a\u305f\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3089\u304a\u52e7\u3081\u3067\u3059d(\u00b4\u03c9\uff40*)\n\n\n\u2026\u307e\u3041\u3001\u3067\u3082\u3001\u5ba2\u89b3\u7684\u306b\u307f\u308b\u3068\nRPG\u597d\u304d\u306e\u9593\u3067\u3082\u76f8\u5f53\u4eba\u3092\u9078\u3076\u4f5c\u54c1\u3060\u3068\u601d\u3046\u306e\u3067\u3001\nM\u306a\u4eba\u5411\u3051\u3068\u8003\u3048\u305f\u65b9\u304c\u3044\u3044\u3067\u3059\u3002\n\uff62\u8efd\u304f\u904a\u3093\u3067\u307f\u308b\u304b\uff63\u307f\u305f\u3044\u306a\u30ce\u30ea\u3067\u8cfc\u5165\u3059\u308b\u3068\u5730\u7344\u3092\u307f\u308b\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\u3002\n\n\u4f59\u8ac7\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001\u53e4\u3044\u4f5c\u54c1\u306a\u306e\u3067\n\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u516c\u958b\u65b9\u6cd5\u304c\u7279\u6b8a\u3067\u3059\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1424260049, "timestamp_updated": 1432448633, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 36, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.757578", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14441329": {"recommendationid": "14441329", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170944626", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 17487, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512843498}, "language": "english", "review": "Wizardry 8 is by far and away my favorite game and rpg of all time.

It kicks my ass. It makes me cry. I still haven't beaten it because I keep trying new parties to see if I find that magic key that works for me.\n\nBut I really really enjoy it.\n\nOne of the biggest draw is the party creation, in which you get to select semi-animated character portraits and select from a variety of personality based voices. Your party members speak quite a lot, usually as a way to notify you of things that've happened or are happening in game, and it really makes your party feel real. Try getting to level 12 with a group and not care about all 6 of your party members for reasons other than tactics. If you can do it, you're heartless.\n\nThe other thing I love about it, is from the perspective of someone who hasn't completed everything yet, it's such an interesting world to explore. It's not quite what you expect and it always feels like there's more around the corner, and it's worth it to just spend some time cautiously poking around.\n\nAs a comparison to another game, Legends of Grimrock, I consider LoG a dumbed down half broken crappy version of Wizardry 8 with much prettier graphics.

The quest resolves around some mysterious artifacts, an evil dark savant, and an awful lot of random encounters. The combat is turn based, with each of the characters in your party been able to perform actions on each round, which can vary from casting one of the many spells, to playing an instrument, or simply hacking away with your sword. \n\nThe spell casting system deserves a special mention; rather than simply having a fixed damage for each spell, they can be cast at a variety of power levels, with lower level spells been easier to cast at the higher levels (up to level seven). This help stop even your lowest level spells from becoming redundant for most of the game.\n\nThis game is however fairly hard, (through it is perhaps the easiest Wizardry game), and you will most likely have quite a few frustrating moments, save often because you never know what is round the next corner or whenever the rng will go your way. \n\nAll in all if you enjoy any type of turn based strategy games, and especially if you enjoy turn based RPG's then trust me but this game because you are missing out.\n\nStill as great as ever.", "timestamp_created": 1419514354, "timestamp_updated": 1479943350, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13471021": {"recommendationid": "13471021", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053717891", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1756, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493932940}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]A must have game for anyone who likes turn based RPGs[/h1]\n\nThis is an old game that has aged very well.

I was originally planning to get it simply for Systemshock 2, but this wonderful game came along with it. after doing some research, i found out just how loved it was, so I tried it for myself. \n\nBasic, spoiler free tldr Plotline: Create your party, grab 3 artifacts and stop evil dude from doing the same, whist exploding everyone and everything that stands in your way of saving the world.\n\nThe plot is pretty much put to the wayside in my own opinon, but it is interesting enough to be noteable.\n \nAt first, It can be a bit daunting for players used to newer RPGs, but everything is very well streamlined when it comes to the User Interface and inventories. That is, once you get used to it. \n\n \nCombat:\nBasic lowdown: up to six PC's and two followers fighting together against enemies, using ranged, melee, or magic, with enemies in a 3d space. Works in a similar way to the older FFs, and is very fun at as well as aggrivating in earlier stages. \nThe game spices up this style of combat  by applying the strategies of positioning and formations, which are vital for both staying alive and dealing damage. The enemies have a bad tendency to be either mediocore or brutal, crushing your party to a pulp at times. But, the combat remains rather balanced throughout, and exciting.\n\nCharacters and Character Progression:\nMuch like Oblivion or Morrowind, each character has Basic Stats that can only be raised through leveling up, and Skill Stats that can be leveled both through gaining levels or by use in combat. Creating a character that fits his or her role into the party is absolutely esssential, and if not created properly, can permanently cripple the party. To survive basically, you need at least one Melee character in the front, a Ranged in the back, along with a caster to support them. Character classes basically divvy up the general roles into more specifc ones, with some classes unable to use certain weapons, you must choose carefully. \nThe combinations of both races and classes, and the distribution of stat points allows for immense variety in playstyles, from the practical to the ridiculous.\nProbably my favorite thing about the progression is seeing how far my party has come from the beginning. From my caster being barely able to cast basic magic to being a Lord of Death on the battlefield, erasing damage to party members and boosting their stats to ridiculous levels.\nAnother thing that stands out is the wide variety of Voice packs that each character can posess, and can be changed at any time. From laid back to the edge of sanity, sultry or sneaky, your choice. My favorites are the Male and Female Chaotic voices. These add much needed soul to the game, as well as some laughs.\n\nGraphics:\nThe game looks \"Good Enough\" for the modern age of games. Thankfully, with programs included such as Nglide, the game can run on just about anything. Laggy areas can be prevalent, even on modern, top of the line PC's, but usually, it will run at a glorious 60fps. What makes it even better, is that Steam Cloud saving for some odd reason works perfectly with this game, and the game's saves can flawlessly transfer from computer to computer.\n\nStuff I do not like about this game:\nThis game is hands down the best of this specifc genre that I have ever played, but it still has its flaws.\n\n-quests and objectives can be rather ambigous, and without the help of online guides, some of these can be very frustrating.\n-Crafting recipies are never revealed in game, which can be agrivating unless you have them online.\n-Travelling the world can be rather slow, as it is quite expansive, and portal spells can only be unlocked later in the game.\n-Saving is a bit awkward, having to go into the options menu every time can get annoying.\n-Starting off on the wrong foot party wise can lead to a near impossible playthrough.\n\nOtherwise, I heartily recommeded to those wishing to sink a lot of time into a great, easily scaleble game.", "timestamp_created": 1413827755, "timestamp_updated": 1413827755, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 67, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.850626", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12547403": {"recommendationid": "12547403", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985649641", "num_games_owned": 571, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 3415, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455888565}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is pure and simple amazing.

Simple as that. And not only is it the final game in the Wizardry series, it is also the final of the Dark Savant Trilogy, which consists of Wizardry 6, 7 and 8. We had to wait nine years for 8 after VII, but you know what, it was worth the wait. To some of us anyway. For those of us that played Wizardry Gold, the wait was a little shorter, but still, five years is a long time to wait for the final story of an amazing story arch and series of games.\n\nDepending on how you ended VII, if you did, then you have multiple beginning story archs to be a part of, then again, so to you have multiple endings.\n\nRemember in the beginning of Zelda: OoT, where you have to find the three gems to unlock the Temple of Time? Well, I think that borrowed from this entire story, because that is it. You have to find three gems, but make no mistake... you will not do it as quickly as you'd like. And then the story is just plain weird after you get them, because then you have to become a Templar. And well... that is the funny part, you will see.\n\nThis title also takes away from the stepping from spot to spot of the previous two titles and you are able to walk (via first-person perspective) and turn and such in a full 3D environment. And even better, you can see the enemies this time, no random popping of battles. It may not seem like it, but in its day, this was amazing stuff to see. This game is amazing even today, so give it a go, you will enjoy it. It's fluid, it's great, and it will make you laugh with some of the story stuff, but I will not spoil anything.\n\nThere are also mods for the game, however I have not tried any yet, as I am still giving it a go in vanilla forme.\n\nThe game runs great, has multiple beginning and ending story paths and tells a great story for its time.

It is certainly one of the best cRPGs of its time and, arguably, one of the best of all time.  All of the elements that made up a great game of this genre in the 2000s is here:  robust character creation, flexible party formation, plentiful combat, and addictive character progression.\n\nAs might be expected of a game its age, the graphics in Wizardry 8 are dated.  But, importantly, not cripplingly so.  Watching a freshly killed opponent explode and seeing their skull careen across the screen is just...timeless.  Unlike the graphics, the sound is still top notch.  The ambient environmental sounds, whether in a dungeon, jungle, or graveyard, do a very nice job of bringing some immersion to the game.\n\nWhile RP elements such as open world exploration and NPC interactions are light compared to the standards of today, the character creation and party formation system provides enough variety that you'll develop an affinity for the members of your party as you go along.  Stat and skill prgression is a fairly straightforward affair:  raise the tank's strength and stamina, raise the mage's intelligence, etc.  But what's nice is that it's not just leveling up that provides progress.  Using skills repeatedly also raises their scores.  So, yes, you can develop a mage that's awesome with a bow (given enough practice).  On top of such flexibility, progress actually feels like progress.  You can sense the improvement in your characters as they climb the godly ladder even as they face more difficult opponents.\n\nThe story is decent enough but, frankly, isn't likely to be the reason someone keeps playing the game.  That motivation will likely come from character/party development and....\n\nCombat.  This is truly a towering strength of the game.  It's plentiful and it requires adapting tactics to have any sort of long term success.  Fortunately, the game allows you to do just that.  The AI mobs can be surprisingly, and unforgivingly, clever.  Don't just stand in the middle of open ground...get your party's back against a wall to avoid being surrounded.  Guard that mage, because the mob's not going to charge headlong at the lady in plate armor with the big, pointy stick (unless you find a way to give them no alternative).  If the enemy has access to long range attacks, they will use them, so you better not sit back waiting for that fireball to explode in front of you.  There are even going to be situations in which your party is in over its head.  Retreat to fight another time.  Not every combat will provide a challenge, but just enough will to keep you on your toes.\n\nIn conclusion, while it has the drawbacks of age, Wizardry 8 still provides a great cRPG experience.

But if you look beyond that it's a fun game, you can play this in so many different ways.\n\nYou start off with 6 adventures that you can customize yourself, all the way down to how they sound when they talk. From there you are cast in an adventure of a lifetime. The combat is turn based, and some of the spells are cool to aim around. There are all kinds of classes to pick from, and races to mess with... Oh and your rag tag team will talk to each other, it's kind of funny.\n\nPros - Mix and match classes and races, lovable chatter within your party, spells are fun to use and all areas of magic are useful in some respect, replayability is high if you don't mind starting over, ironman mode can make the game a real challenge.\n\nCons - Some monsters are hair-ripping frustrating to deal with, graphics are really dated, some races are useless, backfiring spells can be a problem, monsters auto-level with you.\n\nVerdict - Only get this game if you don't care about graphics and those auto-leveling monsters, I highly enjoy this game to no end.

The game is aging but should appeal to old school gamers who remember the days when video games were about interesting game mechanics and not just having the latest and greatest graphics. The game is turn based, which should appeal to players who enjoy games from the time period the Wizardry series of games originally came out in. Sadly, it seems not many today know or remember Wizardry, but if you enjoy games with a lot of different mechanics you can utilize while not being required to use them to complete the game, and have a special place in your heart for retro games of an amazing caliber, Wizardry 8 has a lot to love. \n\nThe battle system is easy to learn but hard to master, yet once you are able to do so, you will feel like a true boss stomping over weaker enemies that gave you trouble before, while still weary and afraid of what new beastie may be lurking around the next corner. As far as the story and dialog goes, Wizardry 8 certainly has no problem seating itself into a more comical niche. At first glance, it may appear some of the  lines and plot are just corny and lame because of Wizardry 8's age, however, if one were to look closer, they may see that the game enjoys being campy, welcoming your eye rolling and snickering. \n\nEmbrace the silly dialog and goofy plot! Enjoy the in depth character creation and entertaining battle sequences!

The character customization, combat, magic system and difficulty set this game apart from most others and it has some pretty solid music tracks to set stage for epic battles. A multitude of races that all have their unique strengths and weaknesses along with a great selection of classes that all rely on seven primary attributes (strength, intelligence, willpower, endurance, dexterity, speed and senses) which somehow all manage to be relevant at least in some way to every class.\n\nOne of my favourite things about this game is that you can make up a party of 6 adventurers from scratch and by the time you are done, they all have personality. One thing of note about this game is the amount of lines of voiced dialogue from you party members.In any given battle they will be shouting out about being hurt, landing killing blows or getting poisoned and the like that really immerse the player in what is going on in the battle, all the while doing so in the personality of the voiceset you picked. While this may not seem new, the sheer amount of things they will comment on gives enough variety so it always seems to add to the situation instead of being repetative annoying drivel.

This game does not, and considering it has some of the most in-depth of its kind that is fairly amusing.\n\nThe only thing about this game that hasn't held up well over time is the greatly outdated first gen 3d graphics and a mediocore story (mostly due to limited interactive npcs).

But overall, once you get used to things, this game is extremely enjoyable. (Assuming the outdated graphics don't bother you)\nThe class system is pretty extensive, several to chose from, with the ability to multi class in addition to that. Luckily there are a few hybrid classes to begin with (Lord and Samurai for example) so you may not have to multiclass to get the build you want. The combat in slow but satisfying, with enemies exploding as you defeat them. \n\nLeveling get's pretty slow as you go along but the skills you have develop as you use them (Sword skill increases as you attack with a sword, Wizardry skill increases as you cast spells, etc.) and how fast they increase is dependent on your stats. (Sword skill is dependent on Strength and Dexterity, magic element skills are dependent on Intelligence/Piety etc.) This system of skills increasing is one thing that makes this game unique and makes very slow leveling much, much, more bearable.\n  \nThe thing that really makes this game unique is the magic system. Your casters don't have just one magic meter, they have a magic meter for each and every element, and the amount of magic they each have is mostly dependent on your caster's skill level with magic (other factors being character level, piety stat, etc.). Normally I prefer hybrids over pure casters but this game's magic system makes classes that only cast spells appear much more appealing.\n\n You get a good amount of character portraits and voices mix and match to create characters that are just right for you. Plus you can change them at any time so if one voice or portrait get's tedious you can always try a new one without having to reset the character completely. (The only thing you can't change is the character's gender)\n\nNPC interaction is also extensive, to the point where it's kind of tedious, and you can even recruit a few NPCs into your party, and develop them the same way you would develop your own characters.\n  \n Speaking of development, the way you can develop your characters any way you want in terms of stats and skills, which you can increase as you level, is what makes this game really great. (Though it can be very unforgiving if you develop them poorly) \n\nHowever, the game can be very unforgiving as well. Unlike most RPGs, monsters get stronger as time goes by so if you start struggling with tough monsters you can't go back to fight weaker monsters as those monsters will be stronger as well. The complexity of stats and skills is great, but it may be to the point where you need to look up a walkthrough on how to build your characters before you can even make a party that doesn't get killed easily. \n  \n Overall, this is an amazing game, if you can handle the complexity and the outdated graphics and difficult gameplay.\n\nPros:\n    + Character development is deep, especially for a party-based RPG\n    +Open world gameplay gives you several story choices, even if you aren't aware of them.\n    +Graphics are outdated but are still pretty well-made\n    +Did I mention deep character development?\n\nCons:\n    - Very difficult and unforgiving, even on Novice difficulty\n    - May require a character building guide\n    - Several things in this game may slip by you without a walkthrough\n    - Combat is slow, with encounters lasting an average of 5-10 minutes (Some are faster, some are slower)", "timestamp_created": 1401606445, "timestamp_updated": 1423543497, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10225978": {"recommendationid": "10225978", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095310142", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 20540, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474338130}, "language": "english", "review": "Greatest RPG ever made!", "timestamp_created": 1400991789, "timestamp_updated": 1400991789, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478261", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10222859": {"recommendationid": "10222859", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035620307", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 6422, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1405706530}, "language": "english", "review": "Old classic still delivers.

I was so enthralled whenever I watched him play it because of the gameplay and the character-creation. When I played it after I got older and was able to better grasp the mechanics of the game, I was still in love.\nThe first part of most RPGs, character creation, is an experience itself. With many races and classes to choose from, there is plenty of variety because you not only create 1 character, but you create 6. The races range from the Tolkienesque races to some really cool and unique playable races (Dracon. Faerie, Lizardman, Mook to name a few)There are plenty of different classes to choose from also. Developing your characters throughout the game is also great. There are many spells to use too. \nThe game plays like many of the old school RPGs like M&M in a FPS type. Just watch the video to get the idea. Wiz 8 was the last of a dying breed when it came out, but I personally enjoy the gameplay. Combat is turnbased while exploring is free roam. \nThe story of Wiz 8 is actually pretty fascinating and proves to be enagaging at times. I'll leave it there and let it unfold for you because I had the story spoiled for me and I will never forget it. I wish it wasn't spoiled.\nAll in all, I can praise and review and talk about how fun Wiz 8 is til I'm blue in the face.

It is hard, doesnt have a tutorial and punishes mistakes in character building and creation without mercy. It has some bugs....so all these bad things now to the good things: It is challanging, has a great story , gives you great freedom and knows several ways to solve problems.

World is interesting, surprising and has loads of personality.

It inherits the typical early 2000 engine limitations and quirks. You will probably get stuck sometimes, you will get crushed by physics objects (death by crates!) and you will get stuck behind patrolling friendly NPCs, who are surpsingly headstrong in walking in front of you slowly, or walking through you, pushing you along and frustrating you. Trynton is horrible for this very reason sometimes. Also, combat is sometimes very slow, and you will find yourself avoiding fights a lot of the time, because they take so much time. There is a way to speed up animations and combat when launching the game, and you should probably do that when nearing the end of the game.\n\nAll in all, even though it's a bit dated game, and even if you've never played it, but like PC RPGs, it's a really good pickup.", "timestamp_created": 1388483890, "timestamp_updated": 1480144533, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.742022", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8449481": {"recommendationid": "8449481", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964851376", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 24, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1388471483}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is ultra gay", "timestamp_created": 1388471549, "timestamp_updated": 1388471549, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.285814", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8441793": {"recommendationid": "8441793", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057809284", "num_games_owned": 494, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 3079, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1390083345}, "language": "english", "review": "One of most interresting RPG.\n\n+ strategic phased fighting system\n+ nice rpg system", "timestamp_created": 1388446225, "timestamp_updated": 1388446225, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469667", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8438429": {"recommendationid": "8438429", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054322386", "num_games_owned": 607, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 5437, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514532236}, "language": "english", "review": "i still like the game even today  its a truly masterpiece of the RPG Games. \ni Wish there whould be more game like wizardry 8   that you grow not in level but youre skills\nbecoming more effective over time \ni really recommand  this Wizardry 8 if you like to play into 6 Characters in  party \n2 in later game   8 in total\n", "timestamp_created": 1388437826, "timestamp_updated": 1388437826, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8435555": {"recommendationid": "8435555", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028318177", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3075, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1389664023}, "language": "english", "review": "I wasn't expecting much from this game, but I picked it up after hearing many good things about it and it tickling my Everquest nostalgia with it's skill system and graphical style.\n\nI have to say this game has been a blast so far and I'm only at the beginning.\n\nIf you can stomach the graphics and are a fan of building and planning characters, you will LOVE this game.", "timestamp_created": 1388431405, "timestamp_updated": 1388431405, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8421238": {"recommendationid": "8421238", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052337412", "num_games_owned": 781, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 950, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457123057}, "language": "english", "review": "Suprisingly good game of course the graphics are just plain bad but do not let that fool you.

Your party crash-lands on the planet Dominus, and is soon confronted by the servants of the Dark Savant, who challenges you to retrieve the three artifacts: the Astral Dominae, the Destinae Dominus, and the Chaos Moliri, place them at Ascension Peak before the Dark Savant can ascend to Godhood.\n\nYou create a party of 6 characters (plus up to two hired guests) from 11 races, 15 classes. You can customize each character\u2019s portrait, and assign them one of 18 voices. Or, you can import your save game from Wizardry VII, and continue the story.\n\nThis is what computer RPGs looked like before the genre was taken over by dungeon diggers (like the Diablo series) and single-character real-time RPGs (the Elder Scrolls series).\n\nPros:\n\n* Parts of the game have aged remarkably well\u2014despite being made in 2001, it runs natively even on 1080p monitors and works with modern 3D video cards (despite its hilariously dated 3DFX logo on startup.)\n* Huge world, huge number of races, huge number of classes, multiple beginnings and endings make this a highly replayable game. I've been playing this game for literally years, and still haven't experienced all of the content in it.\n\nCons:\n\n* Random encounters can be badly-paced and repetitive. (Especially the plant monsters around Trynnie area, making even just moving from point A to point B a chore at times.\n* Lack of in-game help text makes the manual a necessity. (The manual is available on Steam; you might consider printing it out for reference.)\n* Alt-tabbing from the game can sometimes cause the game to lose keyboard control. (You can sometimes solve this by hitting alt-enter twice in a row.)\n\nThings Modern Gamers Might Have Issues With:\n\n* Difficult: even by 2001 standards, this was a difficult game, even on the \u201ceasy\u201d setting.\n* Graphics: while the graphics engine can display at 1080p, the models aren\u2019t any more detailed than they were in 2001. Some monsters (slimes and spiders) look very good even by modern standards, others (humans) look blocky.\n* Not all of the dialog is voiced.\n\nIf you\u2019ve played and enjoyed any of the Ultima series, the Might and Magic series (before they became strategy games), or the modern indie game Legend of Grimrock, I think you\u2019ll enjoy Wizardry VIII.", "timestamp_created": 1386534644, "timestamp_updated": 1386535142, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.468336", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7972347": {"recommendationid": "7972347", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047241312", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 21950, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482097890}, "language": "english", "review": "I was looking for this game and it's Wizardry 6 & 7 counterparts for a long time until I finally decided to do a quick search in Steam again, just in case, and found all three.

That said, the old game has lost none of its charms. There is one race short of a dozen playable ones, and fifteen classes. Each race offers its own little perks, and each class has amazing abilities and powers. Combine this with the plethora of items and magic, and you'll be experimenting with different combinations over and over again.\nThat being said, it is an old game. The graphics are pixellated (go cry in Skyrim if that's what you care about, you horrid wretch) and the control system is outdated (I spent fifteen minutes pressing WASD until I realized it was the arrow keys that moved the party). And it has the \"old school difficulty\": if your party isn't properly made or if you're missing a member (IE: someone who can tank or cast spells), you're going to get mercilessly butchered by the first boss creature, repeatedly.\n\nI'd recommend this game to all of my friends. It's amazing, it's fun, it's inviting, and it's dynamic. It's an age-old, forgotten gem that has lost none of its charm.\n\nTL;DR: It's a better version of Legends of Grimrock\n\nPS: Hey Steam, why not release other good, old games like Betrayal in Krondor/Antara while you're at it?", "timestamp_created": 1385690879, "timestamp_updated": 1385690895, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 118, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.826440", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7787849": {"recommendationid": "7787849", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039763191", "num_games_owned": 388, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1393509031}, "language": "english", "review": "Sir-tech's final entry in the series does not dissapoint. I've played Wiz8 a long time ago and now it's finally available on Steam.\nIt's not perfect, but it's damned close. It can be very difficult for a new player who never played Wiz series before.\nFor the first time in Wiz series you will see a completely 3D environment - game is still quite pretty for its age.   \n\nPlayer can create a party and fully customize each party memeber (like class, skills etc ). Each character has its own dialogue, animated portrait, and unique voice tone. The characters and the way they interact with each of the NPCs have come a long way since Wiz7. Your personality, communication skills, and the way you and the NPCs view each other all determine what happens during a confrontation. You can talk by either typing in complete sentences (like: Where is XXX?), and also by selecting words from your already memorized ones. \nCombat system is very good IMO. Player can setup all party members in a formation that could be anything from *fighters in front and ranged characters behind* to a *fighters in the middle and casters on the sides*. Player can setup virtually any formation desired. Either way you will be able to change the way your party attacks/is attacked and do so on the fly, letting you devise a new formation during battle to adapt to the new combat situation.\nI highly recommend this game - it's difficult but very rewarding.

It's a piece of history! It's a godlike game. No rpg fan should miss this game. It can't be compared to any RPG i've ever played, but i like to compare it to FF7 because this is essentially the Western Game Equivalent of FF7. In my mind both games are equally epic and share the first place among my favorite RPGs of all time. (2nd place goes to morrowind and 3rd place goes to Dark Souls, gives me a nice and even amount of Asian and Western games in my top 3. since my top 3 is essentially 4.)\n\nThe game has the most perfect, smooth turn based combat system i have ever experienced in a game. Truly masterful, and fun!\n\nIt has one of the most fun Character Creation systems in gaming since you can make up to 6 characters for a single playthrough.\n\nIt's soundtrack is perfect.\n\nIt's setting is perfect. A mix of sci-fi and dark medieval fantasy.\n\nI almost jumped out of my chair when i saw it brought to steam, and didn't hesitate for 1 second to buy it again (also got 6 and 7 because i'd like to play this games predecessors)\n\nFor a personal rating lets see.\n\nOverall 9.5/10 (All things considered. that's what i'd rate it as, very close to perfect)\n-\nGraphics (For it's time) 10/10 (Perfection)\n-\nGraphics (For now) 5/10 (still enjoyable to an extent)\n-\nGameplay 10/10 (Obviously i think that, i can't describe it in brief either. It just is.)\n-\nSoundtrack 10/10 (It does everything a soundtrack is meant to do, and does so well.)\n-\nVoice Acting 9/10 (Very solid voice acting. And yes pretty much every npc is voiced)\n-\nControls 8/10 (You can survive this game using only the mouse, except for dialog boxes where you need to type. You will get used to the controls very fast but that does not make them good, however you will not use most keyboard shortcut functions i suspect. only keyboard for movement and mouse for combat, but if you learn to use the keyboard shortcuts for combat it can be a great asset to speed up your fights)\n-\nWorld (Layout) 8/10 (It is very open and unexplored at first, but once explored once, it usually wont show you anything new except maybe a chest you didn't notice before or something like that. Also for an open world game, the maps in it are surprisingly linear, this is not bad however. It helps you know where you can go to continue)\n-\nStory 8/10 (I have not finished it yet because i just wasn't up for that difficult task. But from what i have seen, it's story is quite good, good enough to get you immersed in it. But it doesn't hold anything new that i hadn't seen before unless maybe the end which is unseen by me. I feel the 8 does it justice.)\n-\nHardcoreness 10/10 (Think, Dark/Demon souls or Witcher as examples of hardcore modern rpgs. This game stays very true to being an RPG, It's got difficult fights and a learning curve. (For example mob spawns are mostly not levelled like in most modern games) It's very dark fantasy which in itself is a part of being hardcore. The game has every bit of hardcore Witcher or Dark souls offered me and much more.)\n-\nFun 9/10 (I really love making characters and custom teams in the game (or any other), it's a huge part of my love for it. Then once in game i love progressing and leveling up, it feels like so much happens, but levelling gets very slow after a certain point at which you've still got ways to go to finish the game. The only thing that dropped the fun from 10 to 9 was that i've felt the need to grind for levels in the game occasionally. But this in itself is reasonably fun sincei ti s challenging)\n-\nValue 10+/10 (Yes i'm saying that this title i wouldn't have hesitated to buy for 30$ today. and in it's own time i didn't hesitate to buy it for like 50~ish. This game has as the trailer stated roughly 200+ hours worth of gameplay. You're not gonna miss your money, it tastes better than any hamburger, it gives you more fun than any movie ever could. Look at all the awards the game has!)\n\nConclusion: Masterpiece\n\nIf you like RPGs, buy this and play this without even thinking twice. Kudos to Night Dive Studios for bringing the best titles back from the dead!\n\nUpdate: That's how the game is anyhow, but Night Dive's version of the game (this version) has a lot of terrible issues that make the game hard to run on Windows Vista and up, (I have a guide on how to work around it but sometimes people try everything in it and still can't get the game to run). Therefore I would recommend the GOG version over this one since it features the original unadultered version of the game and none of the issues that Night Dive introduced, and after years have still not bothered to fix.", "timestamp_created": 1378987287, "timestamp_updated": 1486867839, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.459770", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "2916256": {"recommendationid": "2916256", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014536882", "num_games_owned": 300, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 940, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491733232}, "language": "french", "review": "Amateur de jeu oldschool n'h\u00e9sitez pas, pour peu que vous ne soyez pas anglophobe \u00e9videment :)", "timestamp_created": 1378973883, "timestamp_updated": 1385405794, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "3087408": {"recommendationid": "3087408", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017214047", "num_games_owned": 154, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 981, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1399831807}, "language": "english", "review": "Behind FF6 this is my fave RPG of all time and the definitive CRPG of all time in my book.

The story takes place on a classic medieval fantasy planet that is now host to a range of alien factions vying diplomatically and militarily for control over artificats that will grant godhood. \n\nThis story drives gameplay both at the tactical level, with your party members choosing between swords, spells, guns, and technology, and at the strategic level, as you decide who to ally with and who to oppose among 2 major factions and a host of minor players. \n\nThese choices affect gameplay in a way that puts modern AAA RPG developers to shame.

If you have fond memories of the might and magic series, especially perhaps 6-8, and other ,more recent ones like Legend of Grimrock for example ( although that  has battles in real-time)   then wizardry 8 might scratch that 'rpg' itch. \n\n  It's a game where you control 6 characters, all highly customizable with several races, classes and a whole pool of skills and perks and go adventuring finding loot, exploring, levelling up and engaging in turn based battles. In fact even picking your party can be a daunting task with so many choices to make that can affect your chances especially the further into the game you go.\n\n  A word of warning though. This is a hard game. It can be unforgiving and frustrating even in the early stages which may involve a lot of running away and going back until you beat a particualr enemy or enemies. Indeed, at points there are a lot of enemies, sometimes unfairly so, and they come thick and fast where luck and frequent saves are sometimes the only way to progress. And, although i have no way of knowing how many hours i played this game ( but i would guess in excess of 50/60 hours) i never completed it.

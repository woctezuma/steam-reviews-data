Everything from the presentation to the gameplay is positively reminiscent of many early Flash games. It's been published over ten years ago as a free browser game but its hand-drawn cut out graphics feature a timeless and lovely art style especially well suited for children. Its mechanics are simple but intriguing and the gameplay, despite or rather because of its partial trial and error approach, elicits a nostalgic feeling for these kind of casual puzzle Flash games of which the GROW series is probably the most prominent example.\n\nWith no explanatory ingame text, the tasks are plausibly presented with pictures and animations and are thus universally comprehensible. While most situations are solved logically, some interactions are less foreseeable and lead to trial and error. For instance, the wind doesn't always blow in a clear or reasonable direction. Pushing a curious wait-and-see attitude, the game appeals to exhausting all options before progressing. The ideas and delightfully surprising outcomes certainly are what constitute the fun of this game.\n\nSprout's value lies within its gameplay simplicity, intuitive puzzles and overall endearing  presentation.

From the screenshots it looks like a decent indie tennis title with aged graphics and a funny name. But is that all it is? Or are its looks deceiving? This is what I think of Tennis Elbow 2013.\n\n This game surprised me in the best of ways. After taking a keen interest in the sport earlier this year and following the WTA, I wanted a good tennis game that I could play here on Steam. I didn't know of this title until I saw someone mention how great it was on reddit and I decided to take the plunge and purchase it. And boy was it worth it. \n\nAfter struggling to get to grips with janky controls and being dismayed at the UI ripped straight from developmental hell in the 90's I was ready to write the game off as a bad purchase. But I persevered with it. I was losing matches and being humiliated but I was...enjoying it. I got used to the controls and began to appreciate the weight and depth to its mechanics. This isn't just an indie tennis game. It's a serious simulation. \n\nThe controls are not easy to learn and the help screens confuse you with strange key mapping but once you learn about the different shots you can use and bind them to more natural keys, you'll soon be bossing it on the courts. You'll have to learn to time your shots or you'll be hitting balls into the centre of the court leading to inevitably being picked off. During rallies, you'll have to carefully position for certain shots or you'll mis-hit them. I wouldn't exactly say it's easy to learn but it's definitely difficult to master. Luckily there are a number of difficulties, six of them, each with a subset of ten levels. You can switch difficulties on the fly, even during the match, so the game is as easy or hard as you want it. \n\nThe game really comes into its own in its main mode; the World Tour. You can pick an existing player or create one yourself and rise from a rookie to a Grand Slam champion. There is great customization for you to create the player you want and you can assign some starting skill points into different attributes for your player. This ranges from the power in your forehand and backhand strokes, whether you have a good serve or not, speed and stamina and specialization shots such as the drop shot and lob. Once your character is done it's time to play tennis. \n  \n Having only played Top Spin 4, I'm not an authority on tennis games but this World Tour is excellent. There are dozens of different tournaments to play in with each week on a variety of different surfaces. It's all a bit overwhelming but in a good way. As a rookie, you'll have to enter the lowest tier tournaments and work your way up, playing against a roster of 1000 players. You'll even have to play qualifier matches just to compete, just like in the real sport. You earn XP every tournament and the better you do, the faster you'll improve. It's excellent when you finally make a name for yourself, not to mention satisfying. \n\nThis is the best representation I've seen of tennis in a game, but apart from the mechanics on the court, it's incredibly bare-bones. In Top Spin 4 you had little random events that would require a little input, such as opening a local night club or attending events. This game would improve a lot with a similar approach but the great gameplay more than makes up for that. The graphics are very dated, even for an older game, and the aforementioned UI is truly terrible. Which brings us to the last thing I'd like to talk about. Mods.\n\nThis game is highly moddable and the number of high quality mods available for it enhance the experience. With mods that simulate both ATP and WTA tours with character likenesses, real names(different but recognizable names in the base game,) custom courts, scoreboards, stat sheets and new UI mods, the world is your oyster. \n\nAll in all, this game is the best tennis game available right now. While its hard to play at first, once you get into the game you'll be hooked.

One of my close friends is an avid tennis player, and when I saw that the game had an online cooperative doubles mode, we decided to give it a go.\n\nThe mechanics of tennis themselves seem to be quite solid in the game. You can position your serves, either going for broke with a Roddick-style slam or going easier with a spinning second serve. You can make lobs, drop shots, or charge the net for serves and volleys. One thing that is important to know about the gameplay is that you don't hit the button to hit the ball (I played using an XBOX 360 controller). You move into position, hold the button corresponding to the shot you'd like to hit (even if the ball isn't yet there), and then move the stick around to position the shot. If you are in the right place, your player will automatically hit the shot. Therefore, the quicker you get into position (and/or the slower your opponent's shot), the more time you have to punish them with your placement, just like in actual tennis. It's really a genius system.\n\nAnother positive aspect of the game is the character customization. Not only can you change the physical and fashionable characteristics of your character, but you can actually choose moves from your favorite tennis players. Do you like Nadal's intimidating stance prior to his return? You can have it. Federer's backhand? Go and be beautiful. Isner's serve? Go frighten children.\n\nNot all is rainbows and butterflies in the world of Tennis Elbow 2013, however. First of all, the menu is absolutely terrible. It takes an unnecessarily long time to do anything, and relevant settings are sometimes scattered across a few pages. I couldn't find much in the way of choosing difficulty - the player seems to be able to adjust the difficulty between matches or something, but the details of this are pretty obtuse.\n\nMost of my time with the game was in playing 2 on 2 doubles vs. AI matches with a friend. Though we might've lost the first match we played, we had no problem winning every match thereafter. Without a good way to adjust the difficulty, there wasn't really much left to do. We tried a singles match against each other, but player serves in the game are so tremendously fast that it just became a guessing game. Additionally, the game pits you against the same two AI opponents every time, a woman in a pink skirt and a vaguely ethnic man. We took to calling them \"Nancy Kerrigan\" and \"Vijay Singh.\"\n\nI don't regret the time I spent with the game, but do feel that the game might not be worth it unless you can get it for around 7-8 dollars. I got it on sale at 16 (the normal price is 25), and I can't say I feel great about that price. The character customization and mechanics should absolutely be adopted by other potential tennis games that might be able to create a more complete experience.", "timestamp_created": 1520528579, "timestamp_updated": 1520528761, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1520534564, "developer_response": "1) I designed the menus for myself and I don't like to lose any time, so once you get familiar with them, you'll see they are very fast to navigate ; although it's true it's a bit hard to locate everything at 1st, especially as the game got a lot of new options from user requests ; so for the sequel, I'll do a big rehaul to put everything in a way that will be more friendly to newcomers.\n\nQuick tip : press the right button to go back the previous menus\n\n2) To customize your opponent and his partner, just go to the Character Sheet menu, and press on the top right icon to see the additional players :\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1324375138\nThis is explained in the manual here (\"Character Sheet\" paragraph) : http://www.managames.com/tennis/doc/Tennis_Elbow-Tennis_Game.html#menus\n\nBut you're not the 1st one to have difficulty finding the additional players so for the sequel, I'll add an intermediate menu to show & select the 4 players when you click on \"Character Sheet\".\n\n3) And in that 2nd player Character Sheet, you'll find the CPU difficulty level, just under the 3D player :\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1324378948\nQuick tip : if you play a coop doubles online, it's the Host who defines the opponents ; if you play in vs mode, each user defines his partner\n\n4) If you have an issue returning your opponent serve when playing online, be sure to set the Skill Mode to Fair ; this will slow down the serve and should help to get into the game. If it's still too fast, you can agree with your friend to manually lower both of your service skills in your Character Sheet\n\n5) I hope this helps and maybe you could give the game a 2nd chance now that you know how you can set up the CPU players.\nAnd if you need any additional help, I'm very often around ! :-)"}, "40658186": {"recommendationid": "40658186", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116124263", "num_games_owned": 366, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 692, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 544, "last_played": 1520767198}, "language": "english", "review": "I hesitate a bit because of the bad graphics but after a few hours I can honestly say that it's worth it.

While the other 2 games have much better graphics, a deeper career mode (top spin 4) and overall a better presentation I'd say that Tennis Elbow 2013 is probably better than the other 2 on the court when it comes to playing tennis. The controls take a bit getting used to, because it uses a different control system than the other 2 games. Instead of releasing a fire button just before or at the time you hit the ball, you have to keep the button pressed until your player performed the hit. But after a while you get used to it and the game starts to feel more realistic than Top Spin 4.\n\nI would still rank Top Spin 4 easily better in almost all regards, and Tennis World Tour which comes out in a few months might top this game.

In terms of realism and gameplay, they don't play in the same league (no pun intended).\n\nThe UI and the graphics are poor, even considering how old the game is. But who cares? A simulation is not about fancy arts, it's all about the feeling. And Mana Games outreached that goal. How you hit the ball, how the ball reacts depending on court surfaces, ball spins, running inertia, positionning before hitting the ball... all of this feel extremely close to reality. It makes it even more enjoyable to win tight games.\n\nI have yet to try the multiplayer mode, as I don't think I can take any pleasure online for now (I'm far from being good enough). But the career mode is great. It is very complete in terms of competitions as well as character progression: it's highly rewarding to finally be able to reach grand slams qualifiers after losing so many futures first rounds! \n\nYou should also consider that, even If you don't like too much realism, you can still set options to make the game less realistic (although it would be such a waste, imo). The same goes for graphics: there's a mod that greatly enhances the main (only?) flaw of Tennis Elbow (\"Maxou Patch\" that is). And where the gameplays proves that this game was made by tennis players, the game versatility (open to mode, wide variety of difficulty/gameplay option) proves that it was made by a gamer-friendly dev team... or at least a smart one!\n\nNow, although I personnally think that's the best tennis game out there, I still believe this could get better. For instance: money. We win a lot, but it's useless. It would be great if we could use it to hire staff: coach, physical trainer, physiotherapists, physicians, nutritionists (no more gluten Novak!), and so on. And it would be the opportunity to add a wound and long term fatigue feature.\n\nAlso, choosing racket strings tension and rackets would be a nice realistic feature as well, but probably extremely hard to implement (as it would significantly impact ball physics).\n\nThere could also be a \"morale\" factor, which would affect all of our skills in the same way fatigues does. And it would increase if you play home or if you're famous enough to get cheers everywhere you go, but decrease with a few defeats in a raw or some random events.\n\nOk, I'm clearly daydreaming here. But I read on various fora that a sequel was on the way... I hope it's true and that some new features are going to be added! \n\nPS:  It works perfectly with a PS4 gamepad, after a bit of tests and configuration.\n\n\n[h1]tl;dr: if you like sport sims, I highly recommend you try this underrated gem.[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1518470661, "timestamp_updated": 1518470661, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1518510186, "developer_response": "Thanks for the nice review ! :-)\n\nA good part of the things you'd like to see is in Tennis Elbow Manager, and thus will be in TEM2.\n\nIt won't come in TE4 because it'd be an overkill and come in the way for many players.

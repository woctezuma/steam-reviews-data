Had Civ 4 Col been made in 1996, it would have been awesome, but alas. \n\nLord of the Realms 2 is the grandparent, conceptually, of a number of games today. Total War especially owes a lot to the ideas of Lord of the Realms 2: strategic screens that lead into tactical screens, city management, random events (Black Death, finding extra grain, etc.), and even very rudimentary diplomacy were all present in Lord of the Realms 2 already back then, and most of these ideas quickly found their way into the basic Total War formula.\n\nLord of the Realms 2 is probably as important to PC strategy gaming as Quake was to FPS games, or Final Fantasy was to RPGs. In all these cases, these games weren't necessarily the first of their kind, but they introduced key mechanics, ideas, or quality standards that became visible in almost every game in the genre that followed.", "timestamp_created": 1514653309, "timestamp_updated": 1514653309, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38753486": {"recommendationid": "38753486", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161058320", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1277, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 239, "last_played": 1515449826}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game and well it's a great game it's like Civ series but it's own way.

Inicialmente, o jogo acontece em turnos, com a administra\u00e7\u00e3o de seu feudo, em que voc\u00ea deve dividir seus servos entre as atividades de agricultura e pecu\u00e1ria (para alimentar a popula\u00e7\u00e3o), extra\u00e7\u00e3o de madeira e ferro (para construir armas), extra\u00e7\u00e3o de pedras (para construir castelos), recupera\u00e7\u00e3o de campos e constru\u00e7\u00e3o de castelos propriamente dita. H\u00e1 diversos \u00edndices que tamb\u00e9m deve-se estar atento, como a satisfa\u00e7\u00e3o da popula\u00e7\u00e3o, os impostos, a sa\u00fade, etc. \n\nAp\u00f3s construir armas suficientes, voc\u00ea deve criar um ex\u00e9rcito e atacar os feudos adjacentes para expandir seus dom\u00ednios. Quando suas tropas encontram as do inimigo, o jogo passa para o estilo estrat\u00e9gia em tempo real, em que voc\u00ea e seu advers\u00e1rio comandam as unidades no campo de batalha no melhor estilo Warcraft/Starcraft. Em geral, as batalhas s\u00e3o bem triviais, mas a cereja do bolo ocorre nos cercos aos castelos, em que voc\u00ea constr\u00f3i m\u00e1quinas de guerra como catapultas, ar\u00edetres e torres de cerco, aterra o fosso, derruba \u00f3leo fervente sobre o inimigo, etc. \n\nOu melhor: ERA a cereja do bolo. Na real, LotR2 \u00e9 um daqueles jogos que merecia muito um remake, pois apesar de divertido, h\u00e1 in\u00fameras limita\u00e7\u00f5es para um jogo com mais de 20 anos. A intelig\u00eancia artificial \u00e9 p\u00e9ssima, coisas simpl\u00f3rias como selecionar todas as tropas de um mesmo tipo n\u00e3o s\u00e3o poss\u00edveis, suas unidades demoram a responder a seus comandos, quando simplesmente n\u00e3o o ignoram, etc. Nem a resolu\u00e7\u00e3o do jogo foi atualizada para os monitores atuais. E, o pior, n\u00e3o habilitaram o multiplayer para a Steam. LotR2 \u00e9 um jogo que implora por multiplayer.\n\nNo final das contas, minha avalia\u00e7\u00e3o positiva \u00e9 mais em fun\u00e7\u00e3o da mem\u00f3ria afetiva. Joguei muito Lords of the Realm 2 nos anos 90, era um dos meus favoritos. Quem nunca o jogou provavelmente vai sentir uma frustra\u00e7\u00e3o enorme com os defeitos e baixa IA. O que \u00e9 uma pena, porque n\u00e3o existe nenhum outro jogo igual a ele, mesmo nos dias de hoje.

Este review est\u00e1 sendo feito s\u00f3 agora em dezembro de 2017.\n\nLords Of The Realm 2 foi um dos meus primeiros jogos de computador e isso foi por volta do ano de 1999 ou 2000. S\u00f3 o fator nostalgia para mim j\u00e1 foi o motivo mais do que suficiente para me fazer compra-lo de novo, j\u00e1 que eu acabei perdendo o CD que eu tinha.\n\nQuando eu o adquiri, ele vinha de brinde em uma revista de computador da \u00e9poca, que eu n\u00e3o me lembro se era a Big Max, CD Expert ou qualquer outra que n\u00e3o me lembro o nome agora. Bom, isso n\u00e3o importa agora.\n\nQuando eu cheguei em casa e instalei ele, confesso que fiquei um pouco desapontado porque eu estava esperando encontrar algo parecido com o jogo de estrat\u00e9gia que eu era mais acostumado na \u00e9poca, que era o Warcraft 2, s\u00f3 que o Lords Of The Realm 2 n\u00e3o se parece em nada com o t\u00edtulo de sucesso da Blizzard.\n\nQuer dizer, tirando o aspecto da batalha, que LEMBRA um pouco Warcraft 2, o restante n\u00e3o lembra, e isso, HOJE para mim n\u00e3o \u00e9 um problema. \u00c9 uma qualidade do jogo, que na \u00e9poca eu n\u00e3o soube apreciar direito. E pra falar a verdade eu at\u00e9 tinha um pouco de m\u00e1 vontade com ele, mas agora, depois de se passar muito tempo, eu finalmente posso me redimir com LOTR2.\n\nBom....depois dessa enrola\u00e7\u00e3o toda, eu acho que preciso falar no que ele \u00e9 diferente do Warcraft 2.\n\nPra come\u00e7ar Lords Of The Realm 2 \u00e9 uma mistura de Civilization e Total War (sim, estou falando da s\u00e9rie Total War, que nem existia na \u00e9poca que esse jogo foi lan\u00e7ado, pois ele \u00e9 de 1996, enquanto que o primeiro Total War s\u00f3 foi lan\u00e7ado no ano 2000)\n\nQuando eu digo que ele se parece com Civilization, \u00e9 porque temos a vis\u00e3o de mapa do nosso reino, igual a do CIV, em um mapa, e a a\u00e7\u00e3o nesse mapa se passa por turnos, tamb\u00e9m igual ao que \u00e9 visto em CIV.\n\nNessa tela de mapa, podemos administrar o nosso reino, igual administramos nossa civiliza\u00e7\u00e3o no CIV. Podemos decidir o quanto de comida dar para a popula\u00e7\u00e3o, que tipo de constru\u00e7\u00e3o fazer para evoluir o reino, tipo de tropas a recrutar, que tipo de armas ou castelos construir, etc.\n\nNessa tela de mapa vemos os lordes rivais, que podem ser nossos inimigos ou aliados dependendo da rela\u00e7\u00e3o que o jogador vai ter com eles. De qualquer maneira isso n\u00e3o importa muito, pois o objetivo final do jogo \u00e9 dominar o territorio de todos os lordes.\n\nAssim como em Civilization, existe uma quantidade grande de tipos de mapa para se escolher, embora os lordes adversarios sejam sempre os mesmos 4 a serem controlados pela IA. A saber, os 4 lordes rivais s\u00e3o: The Baron, The Bishop, The Countess e The Knight. \n\nCada um deles possui uma personalidade \u00fanica e isso influencia na maneira que eles administram seus territ\u00f3rios e seus ex\u00e9rcitos.\n\nPor exemplo: The Baron \u00e9 um \u00f3timo economista. Seus territ\u00f3rios s\u00e3o bem administrados e ricos. Seus ex\u00e9rcitos s\u00e3o compostos pelas melhores tropas do jogo. Resumindo: Ele pode ser considerado ao mesmo tempo a melhor IA do jogo e a pior. \n\nComo assim? \n\nO Bar\u00e3o \u00e9 uma IA que \u00e9 lenta para expandir territ\u00f3rios, pois ele \u00e9 focado em admnistra\u00e7\u00e3o e ac\u00famulo de for\u00e7as. Isso faz com que ele seja extremamente lento para reagir no inicio do jogo. Ele se torna uma amea\u00e7a bem s\u00e9ria se for deixado sozinho, livre para poder seguir seu roteiro de administra\u00e7\u00e3o e aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o de recursos para construir seu ex\u00e9rcito. Resumindo: O Bar\u00e3o n\u00e3o consegue reagir muito bem contra t\u00e1ticas de ataques seguidos contra ele ou contra oponentes que o ataquem logo no inicio da partida.\n\nN\u00e3o vou descrever como se comporta cada IA, mas deixo esse exemplo ai de cima somente para ilustrar um dos oponentes.\n\nAlem da tela de mapa, que se passa por turnos, tamb\u00e9m existe uma parte do jogo que \u00e9 em tempo real, e essa parte como voces j\u00e1 devem estar advinhando, se trata da batalha.\n\nNa tela de batalha o jogo fica parecido com Warcraft (me refiro ao modo de vis\u00e3o e o cen\u00e1rio), exceto pelo n\u00famero de unidades. O n\u00famero de unidades presentes no campo de batalha \u00e9 uma vers\u00e3o primitiva do que \u00e9 visto em Total War. N\u00e3o espere batalhas com um n\u00famero de tropas gigantes na tela, mas espere ao menos batalhas com mais unidades presentes em campo do que a maioria dos seus concorrentes da \u00e9poca ofereciam.\n\nLOTR2 \u00e9 um jogo que tenta simular um ambiente medieval real. Aqui n\u00e3o existem elementos de fantasia como espadas m\u00e1gicas, drag\u00f5es ou orcs. S\u00e3o batalhas de nobres contra nobres, que tem como objetivo a conquista de territ\u00f3rios.\n\nComo nem tudo \u00e9 perfeito, o jogo tem sim seus defeitos, sendo que o principal deles \u00e9 o pathfinding das unidades, ou seja, o caminho que elas tomam do ponto A ao B at\u00e9 chegar no objetivo ou nas tropas advers\u00e1rias. As unidades se enroscam em obstaculos de cen\u00e1rios, se misturam umas com as outras, ou simplesmente ficam paradas sem atacar mesmo que esteja acontecendo uma batalha do lado delas.\n\nNo geral LOTR2 \u00e9 um jogo que eu recomendo, mas que exige uma certa boa vontade do jogador, afinal estamos falando de um jogo de 1996. Os tutoriais presentes s\u00e3o rasos e n\u00e3o explicam muita coisa. Voc\u00ea vai falhar e muito no inicio at\u00e9 se acostumar e aprender com o que \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio fazer. \u00c9 bom procurar videos ou algum FAQ para aprender sobre o jogo antes de come\u00e7ar (ou at\u00e9 de comprar).\n\nVale muito a pena pelo pre\u00e7o que ele est\u00e1 sendo vendido atualmente. \u00c9 uma viagem de volta ao passado e que serve de curiosidade para quem quer ver como eram os jogos de PC antigamente. Principalmente por se tratar de um jogo produzido pela Sierra, que era referencia em jogos de PC nos anos 80 e 90.\n\nAntes que me perguntem, LOTR2 rodou perfeitamente aqui no Windows 10.

I remebered hearing about it, and heard that it was a hidden gem of retro games or somthing. I was looking for somthing Fairly inexpensive and Slightly entertaining, I decided, hey I know that this game is on steam, it looks mildly fun, I saw the low price tag of less than five dollars and thought, well it's really cheap, I might as well buy the whole set of the lords series while I'm at it, and so, having spent 13 dollars on some games from the early to late 90s, decided to play them. quickly, I discovered that they didn't work due to my computer being so new, and so I spent about an hour getting them to work. that was an hour of boring work while spent though, because one of those games was Lords of the Realm II. \n\nI started the first misson, and quickly managed to starve my entire people into rebellion. then restarted, and failed to even capture a single county, and soon the enemy invaded and destroyed my county. then, I bothered to start trying harder, and soon, after Struggling against one of the most annoying AIs, the Baron, Conquered his counties and won the first mission. but wait, I hear some people ask, The Baron is only one AI? well yes, in fact there are four different AIs, with different Stratagies as well! the Baron builds low teir castles, then attacks you if he has a larger army than you. the knight is annoying and Terrible, though I haven't figured out his Tequnique yet, it seems to be sit still and be annoying. the countess builds the strongest castles she can, and seems to be a fairly agressive AI, and the bishop builds the Strongest Castles he can, and then sits still and does nothing, at least as far as I can tell.\n\noverall, this is a pretty good game that holds up pretty well, even today, and with the low low price, I would say it's worth the purchase. If I had to give it a numeric rating, I would say it's a 8.2/10 simply because it's cheap and fun for a good while, to the point where I think, ok one more invasion, ok one more invasion, and then WAIT WHAT IT'S THREE AM ALREADY? so go buy this game. you won't regret it.", "timestamp_created": 1507880615, "timestamp_updated": 1507880615, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.615670", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35448938": {"recommendationid": "35448938", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152663818", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6727, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1515867146}, "language": "english", "review": "You guys should make playing online available that would be hardcore!", "timestamp_created": 1507042310, "timestamp_updated": 1507042310, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.578245", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35308857": {"recommendationid": "35308857", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062834329", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2662, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502544351}, "language": "french", "review": "Un jeu que j'ai connu adolescent et que j'ai eu plaisir \u00e0 retrouver.

Erstellt man eine Armee hat man hier die M\u00f6glichkeit damit zum einen seine Burg falls bereits eine vorhanden oder selber erbaut zu Garnisionieren oder aber eine Fremde Provinz zu erobern bzw. nahende Feindliche Truppen abzufangen/ anzugreifen. \nJeder Armee hat 15 Bewegungspunkte pro Runde. Hat man in seiner Runde alles wichtige erledigt klickt man auf \"Spielzug Beenden\" und wenn alle anderen fertig mit ihrem Zug sind beginnt der n\u00e4chste.\nAnders verh\u00e4lt es sich bei Schalchten zwischen den einzelnen Armeen oder bei Burgbelagerungen. Hier l\u00e4uft die Schlacht in Echtzeit ab wie man das aus anderen Spielen auch kennt. \n\nDas Konzept mag ich sehr und habe dieses Spiel lange gespielt, auch die deutsche Version hiervon macht gro\u00dfen Spass.

Es h\u00e4tte so toll werden k\u00f6nnen, leider waren damals alle auf dem \"Echtzeit\" Tripp -.- \nTeil 3 Rundenbasiert, etwas mehr Wirtschaft, mehr m\u00f6glichkeiten die Felder zu Verwalten (also nicht nur Weizen und K\u00fche sondern noch Schweine, Schafe, Ziegen, G\u00e4nse etc. usw.). Vielleicht noch einen Burgeditor wo man sich seine Eigene Burg selbst zusammenstellen/ Editieren kann und hier und da noch was, die Grafik auf aktuellen Stand, ja ich w\u00fcsste genau wie dieses Lords of the Realms aussehen m\u00fcsste =P \nW\u00fcrde mir wirklich w\u00fcnschen jemand w\u00fcrde solch ein Spiel in die heutige Zeit umsetzen, vielleicht w\u00e4re es auch solch ein Erfolg wie Stardrew Valley!\n\nLords of the Realm II war f\u00fcr mich das beste Spiel der Serie und hat eine sch\u00f6ne Original Kampagne und auch mit der der Erweiterung, dem Siege Pack kam sowohl eine sch\u00f6ne weitere Kampagne hinzu, sowohl als auch tolle neue Karten und Schlachten. \n\nDie Gegner hier sind unter anderem:\n-Der Ritter\n-Der Baron\n-Der Bischof\n-Die Gr\u00e4fin\n\nAuch die KI wurde mit dem Siege Pack verbessert. \nDer Gegner baut nun auch kleine Truppen mit denen er hinterh\u00e4ltige Angriffe auf Felder vom Gegner f\u00fchrt um diesen unter druck zu setzen bzw. Auszuhungern usw.\n\nMit dem Karten Editor lassen sich eigene Karten f\u00fcr Schlachten erstellen. Hier kann man sehr viel Zeit lassen oh ja =P\n\nIch kann dieses Spiel eigentlich nur weiterempfehlen, man muss es einmal gespielt haben, absoluter Kult und hoffe das sie noch die deutsche Version bringen (war 5min Arbeit das auf Deutsch zu bekommen).", "timestamp_created": 1500153162, "timestamp_updated": 1500204880, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507389", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33557664": {"recommendationid": "33557664", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075071846", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 4076, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "last_played": 1515200277}, "language": "english", "review": "It's fun, it's complex but not at all confusing.

This game is around 21 years old and should firmly fall into the category of abandonware.  More addictive retro games are given free legally by content owners.  I bought the game hoping to rekindle memories of a fantastic game and if I were playing 21 years ago it may well get a 5 star review, with little else like this.  The trouble is, since then, Total War has been made and even the original Rome Total War stacks up 100 times better than this game (i.e. Rome Total War may give you 100+ hours of fun, but this game 1 before you get bored with how basic it is).  I thoroughly enjoy retro gaming but have come to realize retro gaming serves a purpose when there is no other game like it, it is a unique proposition.  So I can still play Railroad Tycoon for 100's of hours, or Capitalism Plus, no other business games have been made so well in so much detail.  Well made classics like the original Civilization still provide a challenge, as does Rome Total War which in my opinion is better than the latter Total Wars.  Bullfrog's Theme Park is still unique enough to offer something different to the Rollercoaster Tycoon series.  Sadly though, this game shows its age, the user interface feels dire compared to more modern games, the skirmishes are crazy, the gameplay fairly simple and not complex enough to satisy modern strategy gamers - more modern games offer more depth in gameplay, better graphics, UI and AI and satisfy the same urge.  But, if it wasn't for this game, we might not have had the same modern games that developed, or Stronghold (by the same developers), so this was very much a fore-runner of its generation.  Unless you really want to give it a go or absolutely love this game, I would avoid this in favour of more modern games.   \n\nMy rating (as of 2017) 5/10 : 50%.

There are two campaigns and a lot of maps for custom games available for playing. You can modify the difficulty in a lot of ways especially for the custom games, so you can decide if you want advanved farming or not, eating armies and how strong the opponents are!\nThe gameplay itself can be very addictive, prepare for long gaming sessions especially on the larger realms.\nThe graphics are ok for their age, it is decent VGA graphics sufficient enough for the gameplay.\nThe OST is really nice and adds some atmosphere to the game.\nThere is also some kind of humour, especially when listening to the troops or when some of the other nobles sending you a letter in rage. And if you beat the campaign you can listen to a funny song!(and if you are too lazy to play through the campaign look for it in the game folder ;-) )\n\nAre there any issues with this game? Well, while it overall runs without problems sometimes strange glitches occur like enemy armies or merchants going over mountains or even the ocean. While I stumbled upon these problems in very rare cases they can happen sometimes. Also I recommend to disable any software that might interrupt the gameplay with notification windows as it is very prone to crash in this case! Fortunately it auto-saves after every turn, still this can be annoying.\n\nAside this the gameplay also is in some regards unbalanced from my experience. Especially the strenght of the troops. Archers are the cheapest unit to produce only needing wood, but they are the strongest with their high range and fire rate! While knights are despite their high costs not so strong and the other ones are mostly uninteresting. Ok, macemen can act as \"cheap knights\" with nearly the same speed and rather low costs to produce, sacrificing some armour.\nThe siege part is also a bit odd, you can build catapults but these won\u00b4t do any damage to troops, I guess for balancing issues, so they just destroy the walls of a castle.\nAlso the animation and movement of the siege weapon looks very odd.\nIn fact you don\u00b4t need them except for a battering ram for the two stronger castles to destroy the drawbridge after the moat has been shoveled up.\n\nThe enemy AI is sometimes not that smart, making some games rather easy to win.\n\nAnother strange thing I encountered is that none of my capturing programs can record this game - neither FRAPS or Bandicam or other ones did recognise it. Not a real disadvantage, but in case you might to record it for Youtube or other means take note of this.\n\nDespite these little drawback the game is overall enjoyable to play and highly recommended for everyone who likes medieval strategy games.\n\nIf I could with for something then it would be the addition of the german translation and dubbing for this game.

In my opinion this is an improvement over LOTR. The graphics and interface are friendlier and the combat is much better.  On the flipside, the economy has been watered down, making it far less interesting and challenging than the original.\n\nThe overall objective of this game is to rape, pillage, and conquer the neutral as well as the enemy controlled counties of the map. Each map varies in the number of counties such as 4 or 6, for example. In order to meet the objective, one must build up an economy, raise troops, and go out and conquer the surrounding lands. All the while, the AI is doing the same. \n\nAs noted the economy is much easier to handle in this game. For example, agriculture has two options, grain and cows. However, there is also the buying and selling of iron, stone, and wood as well as varies weapons that the prudent seller/manufactuer may make money on. \n\nOn the upside the combat part of the game is much improved however, with the ability to position and move your troops much more fluidly, so you can try to outflank the enemy, or bottleneck the enemy in defensive terrain (ideally with melee troops defending a bridge while your archers and crossbows rain death on them). \n\nPlease note that you van also build a castle for your county-counties. They range from a motte and bailey to a full stone castle with defenses such as burning oil. Its always nice to have your castle seiged just to kill the enemy with arrows and burning oil. \n\nI wholeheartly recommend this game to anyone who played it intially and to anyone who likes strategy games.

Lords of the Realm 2 is a game that revolves around attempting to take over a region, which is split into a number of counties.  Each county provides your effort with resources such as food, lumber, money, and men.\n\nThe computer AI is remarkably good considering the age of the game.  It can accomplish many intelligent context based tasks.  For example if the computer sees it does not have the manpower to hold an endangered county, it will wreck what it can and transport away all the resources so that they do not fall into enemy hands.  In combat (which is done RTS style) it can organize a cohesive attack when it has the advantage of numbers, or attempt to turtle behind cover when it is at a disadvantage.  The computer can organize small expendable raiding parties designed to burn your crop fields and cripple your economy, and knows to press the advantage if it spots a lightly defended territory.  Overall it cannot match a human player, but it greatly lowers the need for computer advantages still used today by many games to artificially inflate difficulty.\n\nComputer controlled Lords have personalities and voice actors assigned to them for flavor, and although the voice acting is generally terrible, I must admit that it makes the game more enjoyable to have The Knight insult me in his exaggeratedly arrogant tone, or The Baron politely inform me of his intent to annex my territory.\n\nThe UI is easy to understand, and a marked step up from LotR 1.  There are tooltips and help topics; a brand new player will have no trouble diving right.  There are even auto saves, which was not a given at the time!

Lords of the Realm II was developed by Impressions Games, and published by Sierra Entertainment [i](Just saying those names takes me back)[/i] and released in 1996.\n\n[u][b]-Detailed breakdown review-[/b][/u]\n\"The year is 1268 A.D. The King is dead... ...There will be dark days ahead.\"\nLords of the Realm II is set in the lands of England and Wales, every petty warlord is scrambling to take the throne for their own purposes, you must conquer the usurpers and force them to recognize your superiority in battle, economics, and leadership.\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b] There are two key characteristics to Lords of the Realm II: World/Map View, and Combat View. In World View, you govern your people, keep them happy, feed them, plant crops, allocate food and supplies between cities/states/provinces, direct where your peasants should work to maximize efficiency... really, just about everything takes place in the map view, and most of the strategy takes place here too.\nAs with most strategy games, there's a lot of details to cover, and in a review there isn't really that much time, the basic gist is: Get as many people as possible, make or buy weapons, build an army, \"conquer thy neighbors\".\nThe combat view is where you can implement rather creative tactics. If you're fighting on an open plane, you can try to formulate a strong defense using your natural surrounding, or just charge in and smash against the enemy line.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=624363664\n\n[b]Achievements:[/b] Can I have an achievement that says \"I played this game as a little kid, and wasn't completely terrible at it\"? As far as older video games goes, this game isn't nearly as brutal as a game like X-COM: UFO Defense, however it's just as much fun to play.\nWithout the nostalgia factor I don't know how much someone else might enjoy playing this game. But when I saw it was available on Steam, I tried to ignore it for a while, but ended up purchasing it within a week. [i](As did my brothers, I might add.)[/i]\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=624473659\n\n[b]Price:[/b] Lords of the Realm II, was definitely the best of the series. Lords II hours is priced at $2.99, I snagged the game, and then proceeded to played for 5 hours, 2 where I completely forgot I was supposed to be working on my next YouTube Video Review, and 3 hours spent streaming it on twitch boring my audience with my nostalgia gushing.\nThere is a \"Lords of the Realm Complete\" bundle for $12.99, I always wanted to know what the other games were like, so that's the bundle I purchased. Stay tuned to hear my reviews for those games as well! [i](But it seems the general consensus seems to be: Lords II was the best.)[/i]\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b] If you cut me right now, I would bleed sound clips of \"WE'LL BE SHOT TO PIECES\", \"ARCHERS HO!\", \"FOR HONOR AND GLORY\". My apologies if this review has too many inside jokes and references, but this game... this game...\nLETS GET DIGGING! (4 out of 5 peasants agree, Lords of the realm II is the best.

I love this game.  I actually saved old computers to play it on that finally gave out completely.  I originally started playing this game when I was about thirty over the phone internet with my good friend Bill.  I miss that fax  machine sound but the game runs better than it ever did back then.  Even the single player runs better.  Three dollars are u kidding me???  When I was a kid in the early eigthees I would take my ten dollars or so of money for doing good on my report card and go with my brother to the arcade and spend it in two hours.  Then I would have to wait on him an hour because he always got better grades.  I would have never imagined back then over 40 hours of fun for three dollars and I am just getting started.  This game has resource gathering, weapons building and castle sieges.  The battles switch to another screen for real time strategy from the turn based portion of the game.  They are quite often a blast unless the enemy chooses to invade you with only 50 troops.  Of course those dont take much time.  The only flaw that I have seen that the game has, if u like old games of course, is after prolonged play usually 3-4 hours the sound sometimes messes up.  I then save the game, exit and come right back in with no problems.

All in all it's a nice and winning mix: I can say there is no other game around like this, but many games copied from it.\n\nI find it very satisfactory to station troops in enemy counties and let them feed on their crops; or to weaken enemies by sending small armies to their \"capital\" county, destroying all its fields and killing all the cattle!

I used to spend hours at night when I should have been sleeping playing this game, sending insults to The Baron while I was heavy-eyed and dozing off.  It was one of my introductions to games like Civilization, and I am not sure where to be thankful or angry at Impressions for that.  \n\nAnd I think comparing it to a small-scale Civilization is a good way to put it.  It's a lot simpler and more focused than Civ, and nowhere near the scope of Civ.\n\nThe concept of Lords 2 is that the king has died, and five pretenders to the throne are fighting it out with diplomacy and warfare going county-by-county.  Each player starts with a county, and can conquer thier neighbors while forming alliances and starting wars.  A second part of the game deals with commanding a battlefield in real time as you storm castles and conquer towns.\n\nPart of what made this game special in its time is that the two  game modes combined two different strategy genres perfectly.  The main game was a turn-based strategy with a small amount of micromanaging of counties, while the skirmish mode was an RTS reminiscent of Warcraft without the building aspect.  \n\nThe included \"Siege pack\" expanded on the RTS elements of the game, adding a Skirmish menu for custom battles and sieges.  \n\nThe game is still a lot of fun, but doesn't quite hold up after nearly 2 decades.  The AI is not very competent in the skirmishes, and the controls during those battles is awkward.  Issuing orders in mid-fight can be a pain.  Fortunately there is an option to skip the battles and \"autocalc\" them, if they are frustrating.  This can be done at anytime, before the battle or during.\n\nThe micromanaging might be offputting to some people, but it is not particularly complicated.  \n\nUltimately the game is still fun and immersive, but doesn't feel the same with all of the excellent strategy games that followed.  \n\nAvoid Lords 3 at all costs.", "timestamp_created": 1452979622, "timestamp_updated": 1452979622, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20561669": {"recommendationid": "20561669", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967685936", "num_games_owned": 1746, "num_reviews": 579, "playtime_forever": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452949821}, "language": "english", "review": "Gothic 1, Gothic 2, Age of Wonders, the list goes on, the list of all time best games ever.\n\nLords of the Realm 2 stands strong in that group.

The reason this is a bit like Stronghold outside the fact that it's the middle ages is because of the resource managment, you have a population that grows based upon health and happiness which is determined by how much your feeding them or if your feeding them at all and taxes, let it drop watch them die to illness and emmigrate to opposing towns. This is crucial that you make sure you keep them around as they are your workforce and your military when you recruit troops not only do you need to procure the weapons for the troop type you need the citizens to carry them so you have to find a balance of troops and workforce.\n\nAs for total war the campaign map is turnbased with the hybrid turns (everyone takes them at once) with towns slapped across the map. Also on the map you will see farm field which there are 3 types of and strategic resources being wood, stone, and iron. Here you will manage your peasantry and direct their work building castles, training troops, buying from the traveling merchants, and of course proving their can be only one king by slapping your neigbors silly.\n\nThere is abit more details I could throw in there but that's the core elements and if it sounds even slightly interesting to you definately buy it and then join me in moaning why these game mechanics haven't been replicated in a modern game engine.", "timestamp_created": 1452947867, "timestamp_updated": 1452947867, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20555271": {"recommendationid": "20555271", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077358399", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 501, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457507949}, "language": "english", "review": "An old goodie from Sierra's golden days.\n\nThis is a fun and simple little game which tasks you with balancing your feudal economies to crank out armies.

If you remember when CompUSA would demo computer games, and if you played computer games, you probably played this one. Highly reccomended for 2 reasons - Nostalgia & playing it again as the older, better version of yourself (just to see how much easier you crush this game). The music is still great, the unit vocals are still great and hilarious. The fighting was pretty good back in the day, even better than many current cell phone apps, but it does not compare to Total War. If anything, this is Total War before Total War was Total War.\n\nHere's my strategy (you don't have to read this):\n\nAfter playing every single Total War series, this game's economy and production is pretty easy to manage.\n\nIf you haven't noticed, the AI likes to garrison its' starting castle very quickly. This takes away from the labor force. They also like to take over counties very early, within about 10 turns or so. They are spreading themselves too thin. Within the first 10-15 turns, they have successfully sabotaged their production and increased their borders with armies of peasants, maybe a few archers and pikemen, and if the AI is The Countess, a little bit of macemen too.\n\nThe biggest thing to note is every AI has a seriously damaged economy and production. They've got hundreds of peasants in each army... empty towns... ruined fields... high taxes... unhappy populations.\n\nI've found the -best way for me- to deal with this is to spend your first 10-25~ turns spending ALL OF YOUR MONEY on IRON and WOOD, leave your forestry, mining and quarrying OFF. You can make up to 100 weapons PER TURN this way. As you're doing this, make sure your garison is at maximum troop levels. Archers and pikemen will hold anything. I particularly like to have a garison of 50% archers, 25% crossbowmen and 25% pikemen.\n\nSo you're making tons of weapons, having a happy and healthy population of over 1700 people. Meanwhile, poor defenseless counties are being invaded one after another. No worries, your enemies are spreading themselves thin, crippling themselves with peasant armies and terrible economic management. ALL GAME you must keep spending your money on Iron and Wood. Unless a food shortage is imminent, spend some money on that, but by then, you'll have tens of thousands of coins to waste. On the England map, I made a Stone Castle in EVERY county, by buying most of my stone, and/or turning off any production that is not STONE in counties with quarries.\n\nThis is basically a HEAVY defensive strategy but when you're rolling around win tens of thousands of coin, with over 3000 weapons, NEVER using PEASANTS in your armies... it really doesn't matter how many counties the AI have. You will crush them.\n\nHave no more than 4 wheat fields in a county with a large amount of total fields. 3 Wheat fields is pretty standard. Put tax at 7% when you're at 100 happiness. Put tax at 5% when you're around 80~. When you're below 60 happiness, have 0% tax, and buy some damn ale if you can.\n\nIt's pretty easy to be the greatest noble with the most coins, most troops, happiest people, most castles and most counties. The easiest way to get there FIRST, is to have the happiest people and the most coins... except you will be spending all of those coins on Iron and Wood during early game meaning, you will have the MOST and HAPPIEST people. Have a solid defensive garison and victory will be yours. The AI will try very hard with its peasant armies and crippled counties to take your castle. Be sure to keep an eye on SINGLE TROOP armies, which consist of 40~ peasants whom will raid your crops. You can easily ungarison your troops and auto-resolve these pests. 40 Peasant armies don't arrive until after you have smashed a greater army.\n\nYou can easily defend your castle against 2, 3, even 4 or 5 times the odds. Sometimes I just say, \"Hell, I'm gonna let them in\", and I lower the bridge. Prior to this, I make sure all of my men are at the last and final chokepoint inside the castle. For a Motte and Baily, It would be the tiny palisade surrounded by water. Pikes at the door, archers and crossbows off to the left or right so that they may shoot over the flag tower. Royal castles are particularly easy to defend, especially in combination with the 6 boiling oil pots. Just send all your men into the flag keep, pikes at the door, crossbows and archers behind, and just lower that damn draw bridge and let em' in. Have your oil pots at the front gates and just dump on them as they come in. Aim for their pikes and archers if you can. As for a Stone castle, that is an easy defense too. Just put all of your ranged ontop of the flag, and pikes at the only two stairways that lead up to the flag. \n\nHave at least a Motte and Baily, because that second wall that they have to break through is where the money is, in any castle. Let them in through the first wall, don't allow them to use any other siege equipment by Letting Them In! Then just dump oil on them till their crippled force reaches your second gate, followed by a pike wall guarding your archers and crossbows.\n\nThere is no need to compete with how fast the AI takes counties. Don't be intimidated. Be a Prang Mantus, wait for your time to strike, preferably with over 600 men, including a majority of maces followed by swordsmen, then crossbows, then knights. Make sure to engage with your swordsmen first, with macemen following right behind your swords and/or with a hefty group of maces to hit the AI in the flank. ALWAYS use your knights to engage in the AI's flank AFTER they have initiated your melee units. Crossbows will sit right behind the melee lines and fire away. As for the AI's boiling oil pots, just send in 1 knight to tip them over before sending in your main force.\n\nIt's okay to train up a ton of army after you have made tons of weapons and garisoned your castle. If you've got 25 happiness, that's okay, either tax your people 0 or 1%. If you're gonna run out of money because you've been spending it on iron and wood to make weapons, just sell 10 or 15 swords, or knights here and there. It's okay to lose some more population due to unhappiness after raising an army. Because with an army at this size and professionalism, it can smash any AI army, because they all have peasants. Just make sure to front line with your armoured units, flank with your fast units, and dont let your ranged get touched. \n\nSuper easy. Easy game. Fun though. Never thought I'd get to this point when I was a kid when this game came out. I couldn't even get past the first level when I was 8 years old. Now I just watch the AI be feeble and aggressive while I build up my ONE ARMY TO RULE THEM ALL. It's a pretty nostalgiac feeling to have a 1500 man army with zero peasants and stone castles in every county.\n\nLet your people build and repair! Buy those goods my lord.\n\nWithout trade, you cannot expand your empire to ridiculous sizes.\n\nWithout patience, you cannot secure your realm.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/uUYgGFI.jpg Politics do not matter.

The only downside is the much simplified economy, which is far less interesting and challenging than the original.\n\nThe general idea of the game remains the same - build up an economy, raise troops, go out and conquer more neutral counties/countries to build even more armies so you can defeat the active AI opponents that are doing the same. Unlike the original there are a number of different maps to conquer, rather than just the single England and Wales map, although the gameplay doesn't really change all that much between each map (you don't grow different crops or find different resources or build different military units).\n\nAs noted the economy is much simplified - for agriculture you only have two options, grain and cows/dairy. Even worse the lack of weather (except as special events) and fertility/crop rotation means that in practise you just always switch over to pure grain production as soon as you can as it frees up the most workers to your military industrial complex, as the risks of the previous title in specializing like this just aren't there.\n\nOn the upside the combat part of the game is much improved however, with the ability to position and move your troops much more fluidly, so you can try to outflank the enemy, or bottleneck the enemy in defensive terrain (ideally with melee troops defending a bridge while your archers and crossbows rain death on them).  \n\n Particularly for sieges this can get cheesy as you can dodge incoming fire with a bit of practise while the AI just stands there as you shoot at it, although this requires a lot of patience...especially when you have dozens of counties to capture during each campaign. Overall it plays much more like an proto-RTS game in this phase, and is much more fun and interesting that in LotR1.\n\nAs a whole then the game is far more accessible and friendly to play, so it would probably be the recommendation for someone that hasn't played the series before, although due to its age it likely is going to have an audience mostly limited to those that played it many years ago, who don't need a review to know what the game is like.", "timestamp_created": 1449191324, "timestamp_updated": 1449224049, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 86, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.842137", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19468399": {"recommendationid": "19468399", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987582405", "num_games_owned": 210, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 835, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515118407}, "language": "english", "review": "My damn childhood here!

Lords of the Realm is antiquated at this point but at its core is still a fun game. Much like the Total War series you start off in a small province with a meager economy. By growing your population with food (Cows & Wheat( you will be able to gain natural resources (Iron, Wood and Stone) and eventually draft them into your military to conquer neighboring towns and eventually the map.\n\nIt's a fun gameplay loop but it's marred in a few areas.\n\nEnemy AI is awful. From drafting armies of peasants, to their brain-dead ability to seige a castle (I've won 10:1 odds easily), to letting their troops get mowed down by archers because they're too stupid to move them; much of your success in the game will come from manipulating these mechanics. While it's own strategy in a way, it doesn't feel right.\nProgression is also limited. You have access to everything all the time - the best castle, the best troops etc., as long as can pay for it. This means each map is differentiated only by the lay out of the provinces and their respective natural resources. While the AI has individual personalities, in real game play they don't come off unique, and the diplomacy system is a joke.\n\nIf I am hard on LotR it's because it's a product of its age.

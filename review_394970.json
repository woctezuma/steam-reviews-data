Whereas Hotline is a pure aggressive bloodbath, DEADBOLT is a hit-and-run game that involves hiding in shadows (sinister 'click' as the lights go out), moving through vents as smoke, ducking behind cover, and using doors to lure or separate enemies (knock knock!).  Hopoo Games is the developer, meaning that the art and music here vaguely resemble Risk of Rain - except that the artists and composer have improved since then (go listen to \"Now I Am Become Death\" from the OST if you need convincing).  I recommend saving up for the Scythe.  Bringing the Flashbang with help you enter rooms with multiple ranged enemies, meaning it has good synergy with the Scythe.  Death & Taxes are cool dual-wield pistols.\n\nThe game is \"short\" (I beat it in 7 hours, with about 2 hours of experimental level attempts like 'melee only' or 'pure stealth'), but the hard mode (2nd playthrough) adds extra enemies to each level, and changes their positions: this is significant, because ammo is scarce and the first playthrough was already difficult.  Hard mode will test your accuracy (headshots -> extra damage -> conserved ammo) and force you to create a different strategy from the one that worked during your first playthrough.  In addition to the well-made hard mode, there is a level editor, allowing the community to make its own levels.  This gives the game additional longevity for people who enjoy the tense gameplay.\n\nIf you like speedrunning, there are also special achievements for beating the game quickly, and for beating it without dying: these achievements give you bonus Spirits to spend on extra weapons to buff out your file.  My recommendation is not to think about rank and achievements on your first run: go hard, and focus on getting good.  You'll still be able to afford probably 4 or 5 guns for the trunk without trying too hard, so you'll have a few favorites that you can bring into any level.", "timestamp_created": 1515854252, "timestamp_updated": 1515854252, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39296844": {"recommendationid": "39296844", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100493919", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 459, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 8, "last_played": 1515971820}, "language": "english", "review": "An original game that puts you in the point of view as a 'reaper.'\nVery unique take on lore and has gameplay similar to action-paced games like hotline miami.\nThis is a perfect game to pick up if you're looking to challenge yourself.\nEven though the campaign is a bit short, its hard difficulty and level editor will keep you occupied.\nI recommend it!", "timestamp_created": 1515810841, "timestamp_updated": 1515810841, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39289231": {"recommendationid": "39289231", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044746077", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 709, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486913285}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is fantastic\nNice graphics\ngood soundtrack\ndifficult but rewarding gameplay\natmosphere is really good\nstory is intriguing \nits a little short but makes up with that by being replayable as hell \n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1515786572, "timestamp_updated": 1515786572, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39272912": {"recommendationid": "39272912", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043452800", "num_games_owned": 154, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 442, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 296, "last_played": 1515990380}, "language": "english", "review": "I picked up DEADBOLT because I liked Gunpoint and it looked similar.

It makes the game a bit harder but also a lot more interesting.\n\nThe music is great, very groovy and it's almost always diegetic music (the music exists inside the game's levels) which is handled very well.\n\nI don't really understand their choice to have flashing lights in some levels, you can disable it so it's ok but it's such a strange and annoying thing in the first place, it doesn't add anything to the gameplay either.\n\nI think 10\u20ac is an OK price if you like this type of game but you can always add it to your wishlist if you're unsure.", "timestamp_created": 1515166449, "timestamp_updated": 1515166449, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39080928": {"recommendationid": "39080928", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993665989", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 670, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 309, "last_played": 1515277707}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a very nice game.

As the reapers mentioned in the summary of the game you have the ability to go through vents and toilets using a lighter and turning into what I can only assume is ash or smoke. This allows you to go through missions\\levels in many different ways. Equipment in this game can be from difficult to use melee weapons to a silenced pistol and rifle to a shotgun and a knife. Meaning you can \"stealth\" without \"detection\" which I will say loosely because I had lots of trouble doing it. Enemies all have different ways to be attacked such as how the fat zombies can't be meleed most of the time and vampires are tall and have more health requiring to mostly headshot while at the same time fighting zombies who are shorter and easier to kill. I recommend this game greatly and think everyone should beat hard mode before they say anything about the game.\n\n\n\nSnorcaorca is a dingus", "timestamp_created": 1514755123, "timestamp_updated": 1514755123, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38913329": {"recommendationid": "38913329", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089031044", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514750924}, "language": "english", "review": "Best refund of my life", "timestamp_created": 1514750970, "timestamp_updated": 1514750970, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.270229", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38913201": {"recommendationid": "38913201", "author": {"steamid": "76561198218062857", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 852, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 21, "last_played": 1515282752}, "language": "english", "review": "From someone who has played both Gunpoint and Hotline Miami, I think this game has a very cool concept and was executed very well.

usually not a fan of horrifically difficult pixel games, I was pleasantly surprised by how fun this game was (and still is!). It's still very playable for someone who's admittedly not the best at video games, but still offers a brutal challenge to those who'd want it; just check the achievements and you'll see what I mean. Even if you aren't an achievement hunter, this game is still challenging in a really fun way, and I would reccomend it to anyone, regardless of skill level (you WILL get better with each try, believe me).\n\nThe gameplay is pretty similar to Hotline Miami, but less fast-paced and more tactical. The vent system provides a fun twist, as well as the opportunity to both scope out the level before engaging with enemies and the ability to experiment with many different approaches. Though most levels have an approximate \"correct\" path that you will eventually figure out, carrying out that path is very difficult and full of little blanks that you can fill in with your own choices.\n\nThe settings, characters, and music are all designed/written extremely well, so if you're into video game soundtracks and film noir/mafia movie aesthetics you will enjoy what this game has to offer. The premise is understandable and still unique and consistently interesting as new information is revealed, so don't worry about getting bored with the game as you progress.\n\nThe only thing I could say I disliked was the stillness of the docks/the reaper's room, as nothing really ever changes/developes there (except for the addition of the cat, which was adorable).

You've been contracted by a strange entity to end the non-lives of the many undead who have been appearing lately.\n\nDeadbolt's gameplay is interestinging and challenging, without being too hard. For the people who want a challenge there's the Conquest achievement that requires you to clear the entire game in under an hour without dying. I'd say it's a strategy game with elements of combat when it comes to aiming and damage vs health (on enemies). Additionally, it has an interesting and thought-provoking, although not very fleshed-out, story. The music is composed by Chris Christodoulou and is among the best soundtracks I've ever heard.\nIt also allows the players to create their own maps, although I haven't made or tried any of these.\n\nThe game mechanics are quite simple:\nLight and sound helps enemies detect your position. In many cases there is no need to kill every enemy, so as long as you can get away you'll have succesfully completed a mission. There are light that can be toggled or destroyed, as well as different alarms that work as distractions. Even doors can be used strategically!\nDifferent pipes can be used as a sort of quick travel or to hide from enemies. These become essential to use in later missions.\nDifferent weapons have different specialities. Other than the more casual handguns they can be melee, silent, explosive or inflict large amounts of damage to the enemies.\nYou can take cover behind certain objects, or just hide behind a door and hope a stray bullet doesn't hit you! The pipes I mentioned earlier can also be used for escaping demise.\nYou are rewarded with souls after each mission based on your performance, and will also get souls from getting achievements. Souls can be used to purchase additional weapons. This is probably the weakest part of the game since you never really get to try them all in one run due to the cost being too high, but this wasn't really a problem for me.\n\nEvery stage is unique and many of them require repeated tries to be completed. The game is split into three parts with different themes, alternating between different types of fiends.

I will spare you the plot and details of the game but considering the gameplay, content, and difficulty it is worth every penny. In these short statements, DEADBOLT offers a tense, thrilling and consistent experience in btoh combat and atmosphere, combined with a killer soundtrack that caters a range of palettes.\n\nOne immediate and striking observation, DEADBOLT does not offer a \"choice\" of difficulty. Instead the difficulty is rooted in player skill and planning. With only one hit being able to swiftly dispatch your (short) life, DEADBOLT teaches you to be fast, clever, and efficent in managing limited ammo and knowing the variety of foes that have their own weapons and quirks. Mistakes can cost you dearly but clearing out a crowded level with a bloodstained scythe and a empty gun feels rewarding. Therefore, it is not for the easily fustrated as the patient will overcome all levels with enough skill and planning. One final note is that when you beat the campaign, a \"Hard\" mode is unlocked, offering more enemies to clear out the campaign.\n\nWith the DEADBOLT workshop, many users have created their own levels with the accompanying packaged level editor. They vary in quality and how hard (or easy) each custom level presents. However, if you get through the campaign in both \"Normal\" and \"Hard\" modes then I suggest playing two user-custom stories: DEADBOLT: Last Stand and FLATLINE.

I can't say I totally grasped what's happening with the story, but it seemed to me that I was putting down creatures who were still alive after their allotted time, such as zombies, vampires, and skeletons.\n\nAlthough at first I found the game almost too intense, I soon after settled into a rhythm (especially during my hard playthrough). However, there was always a little pool of sweat underneath my wrists when I completed a play session.\n\nBy the end of your time with the game, if you stick with it, you'll find that you've become a lot better at playing and thinking about the game. For instance, you'll learn about how many shots it takes to put down each enemy with each gun, which enemies can be stun-locked with melee attacks and how to conserve ammo, how valuable it is to turn off lights, how dogs and bartenders are the nastiest enemies in the game (IMO - definitely have a shotgun when fighting dogs), and the tactic of just popping into view and then retreating to pick enemies off one by one. The tough thing is that pretty much all of this will be learned with trial and error. However, after dying you pop right back into the action almost instantaneously to try a new tactic, so this minimizes frustration. On some occasions, it's still quite irritating, such as the levels where backup is called after you finish killing enemies. On these occasions, you may wish that you'd turned out the lights on the first floor where enemies enter, or that you would've saved more ammo.\n\nThere are a few gripes I have with the game. First of all, and I probably missed this like an idiot, I didn't realize that you could get purchased weapons from your trunk. I bought a hammer and it was displayed on my little corkboard. I was like, \"oh, that's it?\" Maybe the Grim Reaper is a weapons collector? So maybe the game could be a bit more explicit about this?\n\nSecondly, there was a level in \"1000 Year Royals\" (the second section) where you have to destroy four ash statues within a certain time limit. I was able to do it on the normal difficulty, but on hard it was virtually impossible. I created a route that I felt was extremely efficient, and died many many times without coming up with an alternative. On one occasion, I reached the door that the last statue was behind, but was gunned down with perhaps a second left on the clock. When the time runs out, you are killed instantly. However, at the time of this review, you can hide in the vent as time expires and then emerge to finish the level. I'm not sure if this was intended by the developer, but it was the only way I could beat the level. It's weird to have this time pressure when every other level in the game is best completed by using strategy and patience. Also, it makes the game a little less accessible to those without as much dexterity. I understand that not every game has to work for every person, but this particular level is an anomaly in the game.\n\nDespite initially not making the best use of my purchased weapons and my troubles with the aforementioned level in hard mode, I had an exhilarating time with the game. If you had a fun time with Hotline Miami or Not a Hero, you'll absolutely find something to like here.

I was expecting it to be forgettable, and not a worthwhile purchase.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nThis game combines some of my favorite aspects of storytelling: mysteriousness, things left for interpretation, dark themes, dark atmospheres but yet an overall soothing atmosphere. It turned the underworld into a city in which it's always night, and everyone has to leave eventually. The enemies represent different kinds of people: junkies who died of overdose, those betrayed by a lover and those driven to suicide. They are each represented by their counterparts: zombie junkies, lustful vampires and paramilitary skeleton gangsters. I love this classification of enemies and how they all have a background (some even offered by tapes in-game). It has a unique style, which I really like.\n\nGameplay-wise, like many may have already pointed out, this is like NOT A HERO combined with Hotline Miami. However, it shines in aspects that some of those lack. There is A LOT of cover that you can use to hide from certain enemies. There's some interesting mechanics i like as well, such as the use of sound and light to distract or attract enemies to you, depeding on how you want to take them out. There's weapon variety that can affect how you play, ranging from silenced pistols and shotguns, to a scythe that's risky but simpler to manneuver around. However, this game SHOULD NOT be taken lightly. Mistakes can be costly, and unlike NOT A HERO or Hotline Miami, the sometimes puzzle-like aspects of the gameplay can make some of Deadbolt's deaths frustrating, having you redoing levels after several minutes (or hours like in some of my experiences because I get too nervous and just sit there thinking for a while). If you get frustrated easily I can't recommend this for you. \n\nThe music is AMAZING. Each gang has their own musacal themes they stick by, and they are all relaxing to listen to. Chris Christodoulou's work and it's usage does an incredible job at setting the atmosphere correctly for the levels. \n\nDeadbolt has a level editor. I've made some levels of my own, but because I'm a shy snowflake I can't bring myself to publish them. It's a good editor, but I wish it had a more explicit way of replicating some aspects or scenes from the main story, I just can't figure some of that on my own. It adds lots of replayability.\n\nMy only complaint here is that items that are too close to one another are sometimes tricky to interact around. For example, if there's a bed next to a light switch, you may end up turning the lights on and off instead of getting behind cover, leading to some unfair deaths.\n\nI like this game, and I continue making levels for it and playing it constantly.

Let's start with the premise. You, the Reaper, are tasked by your mysterious employer with investigating the significance of a strange new drug, called Ash, which unravels into a conspiracy between three undead gangs: the Zombie Kingz, the 1000 Year Royals, and the Dredged.\n\nThis game is often described as a cross between Hotline Miami and Gunpoint, which does paint a decent picture of what to expect. The game has a side on perspective like Gunpoint, though the gameplay is a little more slow-paced than Hotline Miami. Not all enemies drop their weapons, meaning ammo conservation and aiming for headshots is key to completing a level, and while running in and playing on reaction time alone is possible, you die in one hit, so it's often better to plan out your assault.\n\nThe Reaper can turn into smoke with a flick of a lighter, allowing him to enter vents to flank enemies, and knocking on doors can lure them in for an easy kill. Enemies can also hear your gunfire depending on how loud your weapon is, and enemies react differently to this (generally, melee wielding enemies charge straight towards the noise, whereas gun-toting enemies usually take cover and wait for a few seconds before investigating). Flicking off lights limits their visibility.\n\nThis predictability allows you to plan how to tackle each room. Or alternatively, you can rush in and shoot everything. There are many weapons in the game, whether available to pick up within levels or buy from the gun dealer at the docks, there are weapons available for most playstyles. \n\nThe game's soundtrack is excellent, too. If you've played Risk of Rain you're likely familiar with the game's composer, Chris Christodoulou. I've personally purchased the soundtrack off Bandcamp and listen to it regularly. \n\nWith the game comes a level editor that allows you to make your own levels and share them on the workshop. There are many excellent maps available on the workshop, some even setting up their own narrative through cutscenes and unique tricks that the levels in the main game don't take advantage of.\n\nDeadbolt is a game I've come to be obsessed with. I simply love it - from its atmosphere, its storytelling with hints littered throughout, the gameplay and the music, I can say it is one of my favourite games of all time. It's not without its faults - some deaths can feel unfair, particularly when enemies overlap with one another, hiding so you only see one of them, and sometimes enemies can behave unpredictably, but such faults, in my opinion, don't detract from my overall enjoyment of the game.", "timestamp_created": 1511405626, "timestamp_updated": 1511405626, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 2,

Im schwachen Schein einer Stra\u00dfenlaterne stehen wir vor einem von Zombies besetzten Haus, Schalld\u00e4mpfer-Pistole und Blendgranate im Anschlag. Durch die Kanalisation geht es ins Haus. T\u00fcre auf, Deckenlampe zerst\u00f6ren, zwei gezielte Sch\u00fcsse und ab ins Untergeschoss. Flashbang werfen, Vorschlaghammer aufheben und die Untoten sind wieder dahingeschieden. \"Area cleared, Killer out.\"\n\n[b]Der Haken des Sensenmanns[/b]\nSo in etwa sieht jedenfalls der Idealverlauf aus, wenn man eine der knapp 30 Missionen im Spiel angeht. In der Praxis l\u00e4uft es dann doch oft anders, was insbesondere daran liegt, dass unsere Spielfigur, der Sensenmann, nur ein Treffer aush\u00e4lt. Deadbolt ist ein knallhartes Spiel, f\u00fcr jeden Fehler wird man umgehend bestraft. Checkpoints gibt es nicht - wer den L\u00f6ffel abgibt, muss die Mission bis auf wenige Ausnahmen also komplett neu starten. Das dabei trotzdem nur selten echter Frust aufkommt hat Deadbolt mehreren Faktoren zu verdanken. Zum Einen ist hier die \u00fcbersichtliche Gr\u00f6\u00dfe der Maps zu nennen: Beim Neustart sind wir sofort zur\u00fcck in der Action und haben das Ziel unmittelbar vor Augen. Zudem sind die zweckm\u00e4\u00dfig gute Gegner-KI und die vielen verschiedenen M\u00f6glichkeiten zum Vorgehen in einem Level von gro\u00dfer Bedeutung. Letztendlich ist auch die gro\u00dfe Auswahl an verschiedenen Nah- und Fernkampfwaffen zu erw\u00e4hnen, von denen wir immer zwei mit in den Auftrag nehmen k\u00f6nnen. Klappt es mit einer Kombination nicht, versuchen wir es eben mit einem anderen Equipment.\nDas Leveldesign variiert optisch leider nur marginal, spielerisch gehen die Entwickler von [i]Hopoo Games[/i] aber einen guten Weg. Gerade die vielf\u00e4ltigen und spielerisch gro\u00dfteils sehr gut ausgestalteten Gegnertypen sind wichtig, denn so m\u00fcssen wir unseren Spielstil stetig etwas anpassen. Angefangen mit recht simpel aufgebauten Maps, m\u00fcssen wir uns sp\u00e4ter gleich um zwei mehrst\u00f6ckige H\u00e4user zur selben Zeit k\u00fcmmern. Mit unserem Sensenmann geraten wir so oft in extrem brenzlige Situationen, denen wir nur mit einer schnellen Auffassungsgabe entkommen. Das generelle Niveau der Level ist konstant hoch, nur das gewisse Etwas an denkw\u00fcrdigen, \u00fcberraschenden Momenten hat mir bis auf ein paar positive Ausnahmen gefehlt.\nObwohl des knalligen Schwierigkeitsgrades des Spiels, stimmt die Lernkurve. Neue Spielelemente und Gegner werden peu a peu eingef\u00fchrt, sodass die Neuerungen nie \u00fcberfordern aber immer f\u00fcr frische Vorgehensweisen sorgen. Mit durch Levelabschl\u00fcsse verdienten Credits k\u00f6nnen wir uns im Hub au\u00dferdem neue Waffen (ich empfehle die Sense!) kaufen. Ein motivierendes Fortschrittssystem, das f\u00fcr zus\u00e4tzliche Abwechslung sorgt und au\u00dferdem den Wiederspielwert erh\u00f6ht. Aber auch mit einem einmaligen Durchlauf aller Level ist der Nicht-Speedrun-Profi bereits um die 7 Stunden besch\u00e4ftigt. \n\n[b]Das wummt rein![/b]\nZur Story habe ich bisher noch nichts gesagt und das hat auch einen Grund. Die steht n\u00e4mlich so sehr im Hintergrund, dass man sie auch ohne weiteres nahezu komplett ignorieren k\u00f6nnte. Vor den jeweiligen Missionen bekommen wir in unserem gem\u00fctlichen Kaminzimmer ein kurzes Briefing von unserem geheimnisvollen Auftraggeber, den [i]Candles[/i]. Die Texte sind (auf englisch) stimmungsvoll geschrieben und geben den anschlie\u00dfenden Missionen einen roten Faden. Zudem k\u00f6nnen wir auf den Maps Kassetten mit Einblicken in das \"Leben\" unserer Gegner aufsammeln. Generell hat mich die von der griechischen Mythologie angehauchte Rahmenhandlung durchaus etwas neugierig gemacht, doch eine Storyoffenbarung sollte man nicht erwarten.\nOptisch setzt das Spiel auf einen dunklen Pixel-Stil, dessen Umgebungen gro\u00dfteils aber recht detailarm und austauschbar wirken. Der Sensenmann selbst und sein vom Kaminfeuer erleuchteter Unterschlupf sind stilistisch fein designt, doch dieses Niveau k\u00f6nnen die Gegner und Level-Umgebungen bis auf wenige Ausnahmen leider nicht halten. Zumindest wirken die Animationen fl\u00fcssig und glatt. Hinderlich wird die eher grobe Pixel-Grafik auch, wenn sich viele Interaktionsm\u00f6glichkeiten nah beieinander befinden. Wenn wir eigentlich nur eine T\u00fcr schlie\u00dfen wollen aber st\u00e4ndig den sich nebenan befindenen Lichtschalter bet\u00e4tigen (beide Aktionen liegen auf der gleichen Taste), kann sich das in der Hitze des Gefechts durchaus mal zu einem vermeidbaren Problemchen entwickeln. Abgesehen von diesem Schnitzer funktioniert die Steuerung nach etwas Eingew\u00f6hnung aber relativ gut.\nDas Deadbolt trotz des eher kargen \u00c4u\u00dferen ein sehr atmosph\u00e4risches und intensives Spiel ist, hat es zu gro\u00dfen Teilen auch seinem hervorragenden Soundtrack zu verdanken, dessen Komponist auch schon f\u00fcr den tollen OST von [i]Risk of Rain[/i] verantwortlich gezeichnet hat. Obwohl die Vielfalt der Musikst\u00fccke gar nicht mal so gro\u00df ist, sorgen die exzellente Abmischung und der dynamische Einsatz f\u00fcr echte Killer-Stimmung.\n\nFAZIT\n[h1]Deadbolt ist ein Geheimtipp f\u00fcr Fans von knallharten und schnellen Stealth-Shootern! Das optisch austauschbare Mapdesign und die wenigen Steuerungsschnitzer lassen sich bei der enorm intensiven Atmosph\u00e4re verzeihen.[/h1]\n\nWERTUNG\n[h1]75[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1511102359, "timestamp_updated": 1511985537, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36616948": {"recommendationid": "36616948", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088939516", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3072, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511340288}, "language": "english", "review": "I have had so much fun playing this game. It is extremely unique, and as a person who is rather into pixel graphics, this is a number one for me. It features mechanics which allow you to get an edge over your enemies, who are statistically much more powerful than you, as if you get shot once, it is game over. This game is oft times challenging, and very rewarding; and yes, there is a hard difficulty for this game which is thrice as rewarding. \n\nImprovisation is not an option. This game requires a lot of trial and error, and planning ahead. Mechanics such as turning out the lights, setting off alarms, or knocking on doors will disorientate your enemies, and allow you to take them on alone. The only frustration for me is that lots of different actions with different objects use the same key, and when they overlap they can sometimes literally get you stuck in a room. Albeit rare, this is pretty annoying sometimes, but is not an immediate problem by any means.

Its great. im not much into these twitch reaction pixel shooters but this one really had me invested gameplay wise. imagine sidescroller/sideview hotline miami with a darker asthetic, an emphsasis on stealth rather than shooty shooty, and a bit more strategic planning. this is deadbolt. the game itself isnt very long level wise. it WILL take you quite a while to finish the game but because of its difficulty, not its level ammount. either way, this game is great and i would reccomend it to anyone and everyone.

As to how it plays...it's a mixed bag.\n\nI find the control scheme clunky and awkward. With any gun equipped, you have to hold RMB to actually use the gun, aim with the mouse, then click LMB to fire. I suspect this is a kludge to work around the 2-weapon carry limit without having to have your fist always available as a weapon (why it couldn't instead be an always-equipped 3rd weapon would require input from the devs, I guess). I also found it weird that, while the \"up\" key in the WASD layout is used to go both up and downstairs, it's not used to go into or out of vents, which instead defaults to \"E\" (not the worst choice, but less useful than Space since it requires moving from one of your movement keys to begin with - galling since S in the WASD layout isn't used here, for whatever reason). Given that you don't get a lot of time  to react to what's happening in the game, I find this a problem. It feels like there's a better control scheme for this game, and I think it's probably controller-based. Given the game is a year and a half old, though, I doubt that's forthcoming. \n\nCoupled with a \"no checkpoints\" system that means you play each level from scratch every time, this means that a level that starts out as a challenge moves from challenging to tedious - because you'll have worked out how to get through half of it, get killed in the second half and have to start over again. Which on a small level is ok, but on a larger level gets dull.\n\nIt's a pity, because when the controls aren't getting in the way and the level design is balanced right, it's a lot of (tough-as-nails) fun and a lot of effort has gone into the presentation. But the controls cause snarls and levels are wobbly a bit too often for me to enjoy it consistently, especially when compared to how smoothly games like HM or NAH flow by comparison.", "timestamp_created": 1508928470, "timestamp_updated": 1508928470, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.401011", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35946846": {"recommendationid": "35946846", "author": {"steamid": "76561198219148219", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507838669}, "language": "english", "review": "Didn't load in graphics when it started up", "timestamp_created": 1508771360, "timestamp_updated": 1508771360, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.300333", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35903693": {"recommendationid": "35903693", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140283607", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 429, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514865471}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a great game, one of my favorites. I love the style, the controls, the mechanics; everything just works so well. The sountrack is absolutely phenomenal, every song works so perfectly in the levels they are in. This has to be one of the best development teams I have ever seen, which is surprising for how small they are. The catch though is that this game is insanely difficult, but that is part of what makes it so great. I don't know how many times I've died in this game and just thoght \"one more try\". If you want to beat this game you have to plan everything, have perfect timing, fast reflexes, and be aware of everything happening around you. One of my favorite aspects of this game is that you have the decision to go in guns ablazing, sneak around and be a complete ghost, or do something in between. Both play styles present their own advantages and disadvantages. The offensive approach allows for quicker level completion but you also have a better chance of being ganged up on. The stealth approach gives you more control over what happens in the level but comes with the challenge of not being detected. I'm not going to recommend this to everyone because its not everyone's type of game, but for anyone who likes this kind of game definitely pick this up.", "timestamp_created": 1508623145, "timestamp_updated": 1508623145, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35902640": {"recommendationid": "35902640", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970403229", "num_games_owned": 673, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 641, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508614294}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game reminiscent of a side view Hotline Miami.", "timestamp_created": 1508619659, "timestamp_updated": 1508619659, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35866411": {"recommendationid": "35866411", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161254151", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 49, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508932308}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u975e\u5e38\u597d", "timestamp_created": 1508513615, "timestamp_updated": 1508930150, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35849194": {"recommendationid": "35849194", "author": {"steamid": "76561198230258572", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 509, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508693184}, "language": "french", "review": "really cool, I enjoyed it", "timestamp_created": 1508446267, "timestamp_updated": 1508446267, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35840253": {"recommendationid": "35840253", "author": {"steamid": "76561198385371265", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508485075}, "language": "schinese", "review": "Fuking shit ideot", "timestamp_created": 1508421871, "timestamp_updated": 1508421871, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.339856", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35836750": {"recommendationid": "35836750", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125889210", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1007, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514566849}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0431\u0430\u043b\u0434\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e!

If you die or screw up you can retry in a matter of miliseconds. No waiting around.\n- Some achievements are easy and gets you hooked while some are reserved for the veterans or bold.\n- Difficulty is not TOO insane. It is hard at a fun level and does not feels like you have to be asian to complete.\n\nYou go out on missions where you have to complete certain tasks, which most likely is to kill someone. Enemies react to sounds so you have to decide if you want to go silent assassin or just bust in and wish for the best. The enemies also start to vary very early in the game so you will have to use different tactics at some points. The environment supplies you with cover, lights and possible weapons to be used such as pistols or kitchen knives.\n\nAfter each mission you are allowed to relax and brief on the next mission in you apartment. Here it is also possible to overview achievements, visit the nearby docks, retry earlier missions or simply continue with the next mission.

Not without flaws, but the fun surpasses any problems that bounced into the way.\n\nThe story is simple and straightforward, but allows for many plot twists to appear... for those who pay attention to details. You're Reaper, tasked by the fire into delivering a swift death to those who sway astray in a city filled with all manners of undead. You can carry two weapons at a time, and for souls that you gain through completing missions and earning achievements, you buy special weapons that you can carry with you. 2D, it enables the player to use air ducts, sewer holes and toilets to sneak upon unsuspecting foes, or, if you prefer the John Woo style, to hide behind objects and use them as shields as you deliver headshots.\n\nThe main key for a good stealth/assassination game is adaptability, allowing a player to approach the same problem from different angles yet offering different challenges, and for most of the missions, Deadbolt allows you to do so without getting easy, for example, If you try to sneak, be aware that there is a delay between entering and leaving air ducts, leaving you wide open to be killed (in this game, one hit = death) and if you go guns blazing, ammo is rather scarce.\n\nThe soundtrack is really, really good, following you (as long you're indoors) as you fight through zombies in shantytown houses and nightclubs, a shame it's not being sold or can be found alongside the game, as far as I know.\n\nThere are some problems, though. Some bugs can be found here and there, and if you drop your weapon close to a ventilation shaft or a door, prepare for a world of pain and possible death since there is nearly always only a single command, regardless of how many acceptable subjects are available, as in, try to close a door while being chased by enemies, and you'll end up just swapping weapons, and so forth.\n\nThis complaint will be more due personal taste, but the story could have been more clearer and more plentiful, the same 'fault' that befalls Risk of Rain. The game ends with many questions that won't be answered so soon...\n\nRegardless of these shortcomings, I do believe that the game was worth what I paid for, and more.", "timestamp_created": 1506656279, "timestamp_updated": 1506656279, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35227407": {"recommendationid": "35227407", "author": {"steamid": "76561198381330790", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 365, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513454286}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the definition of a 2D hardcore indie game combining both stealth and action elements.

Graphics, music, sound design, writing, all of it, pretty much 10/10 in every single case. The only exceptions are one or two levels where flashing lights and similar obscure what's actually going on which is... again, not optimal.\n\nSecondly, the controls are largely smooth, simple and easy to handle(on some occasions, however, when two interactables are very close to each other, the game can get confused and that can get you killed). By and large if you come out at the bottom of a situation, it was because you hestitated or planned poorly.\n\nThird, though... we've got the level design, which is where things come apart a bit. Despite the game's insistence that there are multiple ways to deal with the various levels, it honestly doesn't feel that way. Rather, a few levels have multiple approaches, but most of them feel like they have one optimal approach, and if you manage to win while deviating from that, it's because you got lucky or exploited AI flaws.\n\nSometimes it's okay, though, because the optimal approach is easy enough to spot, and it's a matter of figuring out the execution. But in a few cases it's like playing a Roberta Williams adventure game where you're trying to figure out the moon logic that the devs employed.\n\nIt's also particularly aggravating in situations where the first 50% of a level is easy caketown that you end up redoing over and over because there's one really miserable difficulty bump right at the mid point.\n\nUltimately what makes me verge on giving this a recommendation rather than not, is the price. If it had cost ANY more, it would've been a clear no.

DEADBOLT is an action game about reaping the undead with a variety of weapons, I almost think of it as a puzzle game at it's core. Don't get me wrong, DEADBOLT requires plenty of reflexes and a quick trigger finger, but each stage can be thought of as a chessboard and the enemies, opposing pieces. Which pieces you take first and how you take them is key to winning. \n\nA number of zombies, vampires, hellhounds, and other creatures populate the rooms that make up every stage. They respond to gunfire and other noises, as well as light level. Since you die in one hit and enemies, while slow to react, can be very accurate, it's wise to plan your approach. These little murder puzzles are pretty addictive and the excellent soundtrack and crisp pixel art really add to DEADBOLT's charm. \n\nOverall, if you enjoy challenging, tactical action, you should consider giving this game a try!", "timestamp_created": 1505381803, "timestamp_updated": 1505381803, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34944199": {"recommendationid": "34944199", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137664191", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 2605, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514936923}, "language": "english", "review": "You are the grim reaper with a revolver and you kill zombie drug dealers...WHAT IS NOT TO LOVE!?", "timestamp_created": 1505375900, "timestamp_updated": 1505375900, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34902387": {"recommendationid": "34902387", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154472146", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 740, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507824403}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc190\ub9db \ud558\ub098\ub85c \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \ud558\ub294 \uac8c\uc784.", "timestamp_created": 1505226824, "timestamp_updated": 1505226824, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34852632": {"recommendationid": "34852632", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013210968", "num_games_owned": 456, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2305, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505162923}, "language": "english", "review": "Achivement hunters, welcome to hell.", "timestamp_created": 1505015828, "timestamp_updated": 1505015828, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.717579", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34850697": {"recommendationid": "34850697", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071281870", "num_games_owned": 321, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1361, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 23, "last_played": 1515958631}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0421\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0442 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0441 \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u044f \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0438\u043a \u0436\u0430\u043d\u0440\u0430 \u0421\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0441 \u0438 \u0437\u0430 \u0432\u0435\u0441\u044c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u043f\u044b\u0442 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043b \u0432 \u043a\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e-\u043d\u0438\u0431\u0443\u0434\u044c \u0425\u0438\u0442\u043c\u044d\u043d\u0430 \u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0430\u0445 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0437\u0430\u043b \u0432 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0445 \u043e\u0442 \u0431\u0435\u0441\u0435\u0434\u043a\u0438. \u0412 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0443\u044e \u043e\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434\u044c \u044f \u0437\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0441\u044f DEADBOLT \u0438\u0437-\u0437\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0447\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b, \u044d\u0442\u0438 \u0440\u0435\u0431\u044f\u0442\u0430 \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0438 \u0443\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0440\u043e\u0433\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043a Risk of Rain, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u043e \u0441\u0438\u0445 \u043f\u043e\u0440 \u043c\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0442 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0439 \u0430\u0442\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0444\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u0438 \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u0435\u043c.

Throwables get stuck in corpses, which becomes annoying.

Better AI could've made the game, like zombies grouping behind the big one to charge you, or the vampires going back on the ceiling to get an angle on you while in cover.

However, unlike Jacket (who's amongst the land of the living), you're a 'reaper', a mysterious being assigned with the job of dragging runaway souls back to the underworld. Due to your supernatural origins, you gain a rather interesting ability to turn into smoke, thus allowing you to quickly zip through accessable vents and even sewage pipes. Yes, you read that right: Sewage Pipes. What this means is that you can sneak into buildings by entering a manhole, and then appearing out of the sh**ter. However, if there are any enemies currently using the sh**ter, you have the terrifying and mildly humourous ability to appear regardless, causing their bodies to explode violently. Whether or not this would result in the player character getting sh** on his skull is never really made clear. However, there are also other not so supernatural things you can pull off to give yourself an advantage, such as shooting out the lights to confuse your enemies/prey, or knocking on doors to attract enemies, either to kill them or to distract them so that you can attack someone else.\nThe enemies and NPCs you face (or at least the ones I've faced within my uncompleted playthrough) are taken from all over; a talking fire, demons, vampires, zombies, and even the ferryman of the greek afterlife, Charon.  Charon acts as a storefront for you to spend the games currency of souls; souls are earned after you complete a mission, and depending on how well you did it, you'll either get lots of souls, or barely any. These souls will then be given to charon, who will in turn give you weapons; the better the weapon, the more souls you must bring him. The final key NPC is a fire, who will speak to you each time you sit down within your house; this fire will be what gives you missions, as well as small facts and tips about the game's enemies. You can also collect tapes from certain dead enemies, which will then unlock some filler text which you can read later. However, I didn't manage to collect that many in my playthrough, so I can't say how well they do the job of acting as story filler.

It is a game that is equal parts careful planning and smooth execution. There are multiple solutions to every problem, and each level is crafted in a unique manner that allows for differing attack patterns. Knocking on doors or turning on radios for distractions, turning off or shooting out lights to decrease enemy visibility, and flipping over tables and opening refrigerator doors for cover are all par for the course. Story elements are cleverly introduced during specific missions, and at every briefing which takes place in the comfort of your own home. Walking out of your house will take you to the Docks, where you can buy guns in exchange for souls that are earned by completing missions.\n\nHowever, there is one stipulation: its difficulty. Take one hit and you die, with very few exceptions. And die you will, many times, before coming up with a combination of actions that yields a victory. That is, in itself, the biggest satisfaction you'll get from DEADBOLT; as fun as it is to kill your targets, move through the vents, and mow down skeletons with the Old World Rifle, the best feeling you get will be from beating the level that you were stuck on for hours. DEADBOLT is very hard, but it's also very fun.\n\nThat being said, it took me more than a few sessions to push through this somewhat short, but very rewarding game. It's probably the most fun I've ever had with an indie platformer. DEADBOLT feels similar to Gunpoint, but much darker and more violent, which is why I like it better. The art style is very good quality for pixel art, reminiscent of games like Risk of Rain. The animations are beautifully crafted and the diegetic music is amazing. My only issue with DEADBOLT is how short it was; I would have loved a few more levels, or even DLC for it. Even a digital soundtrack would have been great too. Still, I think this is a must-have for fans of the Stealth-Action Platformer genre.\n\n9/10, am playing it again, this time on hard mode.

DEADBOLT is very different from their last game, Risk of Rain. The game is like a giant puzzle with some levels having a ridiculous amount of paths you can take to win. The story and atmosphere is surprisingly good for what seems like another stealth platformer (even though Deadbolt isn't a platformer like, say, Gunpoint). The soundtrack, composed by Chris Christadoulou (again just like Risk of Rain) is fucking amazing, especially the song for your home base and the final level's music which could encite an emotional reaction you may not have expected you could have. The only real issues I can think of are how enemy behavior can be inconsistent in a few situations, with different enemies getting alerted by the same sound with only slightly different positioning on your part, as well as Hard Mode being completely unfun that mostly involves running out of ammo and killing yourself, and the Death and Famine achievements, which need to be gained on the same save file before you can even think about getting 100% and which require no deaths AND beating the game in one hour, which I think is too high of a bar for someone who wants to just start working towards completion. Other than that combat is amazing, there are a lot of different options at different times, the boss fights are actually interesting AND in a stealth game at the same time, the art is beautiful, the music is even better, etc etc. I could go on for a while about how much this game does right.

There's a good reason for that. Deadbolt's combat is akin to Hotline Miami's, but as a side-scroller rather than top-down, and you do some stealthing through buildings going in doors and changing floors, turning lights on/off, etc., like in Gunpoint. I really liked both of those games.\n\nHowever, the one thing those two games had that Deadbolt does [i]not[/i] have are checkpoints of some sort. In Hotline Miami, if you completed a floor of a building and took the stairs to the next floor, which was still the same mission, then you died, you got to start the floor over, instead of having to start the entire level over. Gunpoint is even more generous. Without checkpoints, a die-in-one-hit game can be very frustrating. \n\nI put up with replaying the same levels again and again until I completed the first big \"chapter\" which consisted of nine missions, and decided that was enough for me. The music was great, the visuals were alright, though the storytelling was a bit whimical with no real characters or dialog between characters. If you care about narrative, dialog, and characters, Deadbolt is devoid of these things, at least in its first handful of hours. If it picks up, it's too little too late to get my interest. Deadbolt makes me want to play Hotline Miami or Gunpoint again, if only because it feels to me like a less fun version of both of those games mashed together. I do recommend those two games, though. They can be challenging but their checkpointing systems are legit.", "timestamp_created": 1501904894, "timestamp_updated": 1501904894, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.384172", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34011013": {"recommendationid": "34011013", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055089474", "num_games_owned": 613, "num_reviews": 95, "playtime_forever": 416, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497592902}, "language": "english", "review": "Super good! \n\nVery difficult gameplay for many parts, with a Hotline Miami feel; Challenges consist of a cross between puzzle solving, and quick reaction shooting.

It's not entirely unique by its own merits, but it has a charm all of its own. It plays in a similar fashion to Gunpoint, but without the hacking aspect. It also plays rather similarly to Hotline Miami in that combat can sometimes require multiple, rapid acts of precision. Also that it frequently requires trial and error. \n\nWeaponry and the methods used to complete a mission are all very satisfying. While the game advertises the ability to choose your way to accomplish missions, this is a bit of a white lie. Technically you [i]can[/i] pick and choose your path through most missions. However, the objective is usually in an area with only 1 entrance. And speaking of objectives, missions will have 1 of 2 (sometimes both!) objectives: \"Use this/these object(s)\" and \"Kill X enemies.\"\n\nThe game is simple and straightforward. You play a level and then you are taken back to your apartment to get briefed on the next level. In between levels you have the chance to buy new weapons or read some lore items. While I enjoy having bite-sized portions of game to play, I do really wish that there was a \"bigger picture\" for the story. The disconnected presentation of the world and its events really detracts from the storyline being presented here, even if the game does require that you read between the lines a little. \n\nOnce you're in a mission, you find yourself standing next to your really classy car. From there you set upon your grisly work. A really neat piece of flavor is that your weapon selection is conveniently in the trunk of your car. Prior to engaging the mission you get the option to swap out some weapons. Once you're done, Reaper closes the trunk and sets the alarm on the car again. The game has a huge amount of charm hiding in its sharply down pixel graphics which I think sets it apart from similar games in this genre.\n\nSound quality is superb. Your weapons all sound lethal and satisfying to use. The controls are tights and responsive. The game is difficult in a way that requires a little patience, a little skill and good reaction speed. The game is tough at times but never feels unfair, and is usually the result of your own failings. Also, the game is really swell in that it will occasionally pop up hints after you've died a handful of times.\n\nDeadbolt was a neat game that kept me entertained the whole way through. It offers a unique enough experience to stand out, even if it could have sorely used a little more actual meat on its bones.

An experience that prefers to dwell in the shadows, contemplating the next ambush, slowly rising out of the stillness of a gasp before the matter becomes a chaotic scramble with only the dead-beating pulse of the Reaper left alone in silence. Then hitting the elevator button with a smoke-break to take off the nerves before continuing the job. \n\nThis is the soul of DEADBOLT that makes the distress of failure and improvising solutions in advance a fleeting concern from another contract that you don\u2019t know why you accepted it other than the habit at showing up to parties when everyone is dead.  \n\n[h1]Hotline Underworld: 00-DEATH[/h1]\n\nAlthough the two experiences are very similar, DEADBOLT and HM cater to different tastes. Whereas the HM series imitate snuff films, the psychedelic disillusion of reality, and of entertainment that glorifies its violence as much as examines its lasting effects, DEADBOLT offers a film noir underworld ruled by a crime syndicate within its purgatory of the undead with an even greater lack of purpose behind the Reaper\u2019s motives. It is from the presentations as well as in the core gameplay that show DEADBOLT is perhaps the more \u201cHitman\u201d approach, rewarding usage of opportunities and inventiveness rather than twitchiness of HM. \n\nAs a game and as a story, DEADBOLT chooses its style and simplicity over being convoluted, choosing to revel in the methodology of a hit-and-run. This is indicative through the small gameplay refinements from the delays between raising their weapons between the alert phases; from the player\u2019s own delay in aiming their weapon; from the versatility of tools, environmental distractions and alternative routes within each level; and the missions never being as simple as they initially appear when the situation is compromised. It is also apparent through the narrative that focuses on Death as a contract-killer sent to disenfranchise the infrastructure of zombie gangs upon vampire mafias upon skeleton mercenaries seeking to dominate the land of the living. Neither the gameplay nor the story become any more complicated than the deceptively puzzle-like contracts.  \n\nInstead of adding more elements to the gameplay or adding more depth to motives and backstory, the storyline prefers to use poetic fragments of details from your victims in an already undead world. The city is referred to as the Place, the main character as The Reaper and the Reaper\u2019s contractor as the Fire, Details of the plot remain vague with little to no dialogue to the point where the game feels like the style was done for the sake of its art rather than for a purpose. As a result, the game\u2019s greatest value is its consistent pace of challenge and variety, something missing from the HM games that shifted its focus from allowing various playstyles into reflex challenges and where DEADBOLT rewards the more perceptive players who know their enemies and tools greater than themselves.\n\n[h1]Clubbing At the Monster Mash[/h1] \n\nAlthough what I truly love about DEADBOLT that sets it apart from other stealth-action hybrid games is the enemies can be more creative as a result of having supernatural enemies. One type of zombies can use their severed heads as a spotter while their body is detached; some vampires can have phylacteries that prevent them from truly dying the first time; one type of skeleton is able to cast magic that can make them vanish as well as revive fallen allies. Even the variants for these categories differentiate their weaponry and toughness, which offers a surprising amount of variety to a game that couldn\u2019t be possible in more grounded worlds.\n\nThe structure of the game, as previously mentioned, is a three-act progression of hits on three levels of corruption within the Place: The Zombies, The Vampires and the Skeletons. Only the first Act is limited in using one category of enemies, which never feels tiring because the threats are diverse. The other two acts begin with introducing new enemies before combining them with the previous variety to not only benefit the overall challenge of the game but also the narrative of disrupting the power-play from the bottom-up. Rewards come in the form of ratings on the success of the job, which earns you more souls only earned by completing achievements to unlock more tools for the Reaper, and the additional content provided by the level-editor as well as the hard mode that reworks the original twenty-seven levels truly explores the limits of its appeal.\n\nPerhaps the one example of a level that never seizes its idea for future levels on being inventive is The Tinkerer. Instead of another target amongst a crowd of other hostiles, The Tinkerer is a challenge of navigating the death-traps to eliminate the security personnel of a crazed technician trapped within his home knowing the Reaper is coming for him. The ending is simple irony of triggering the technician\u2019s own defenses against him without the satisfaction of taking the Reaper. It\u2019s this kind of playfulness with the level-design and environment that shines the player-freedom of its greater levels that the game never seems to capitalize on as much as the Hitman games.\n\n[h1]One Button to Doom Them All[/h1]\n\nIf Volume was only guilty of creating a simplified Metal Gear game that would benefit from adding more player-agency to its mechanics, then DEADBOLT is guilty of not creating more of these Hitman level deigns of poetic irony and playfulness within environments to enhance the core gameplay. The spirit captures the essence of HITMAN but not the replayability and mastery from playing with its mechanics. It\u2019s perhaps easier to design for this goal in mind with a 3D environment rather than a 2D design; however, there are many mechanics like the ventilation systems, sound positioning, and distractions that are more tied to individual levels for one opportunity than across all of them.\n\nOne notable oversight in the game\u2019s controls is the interact button. It is responsible for picking-up weapons, interacting with distractions, turning off/on lights, opening and closing doors, crouching, entering and leaving vents\u2014it simply is doing too much for one button. This wouldn\u2019t be as bad as it\u2019s implemented where the mouse does not affect the context of that action, rather it\u2019s the proximity with the player. This one button could literally be the death of you simply because your character picked-up a hammer when you meant to hide behind a couch. It\u2019s strange that the game doesn\u2019t map the cover-button to R as reloading weapons is not a mechanic whereas the game does set knocking to a separate button exclusively for knocking on doors. It makes no sense why the control-scheme was designed the way it is. \n\nMore importantly, however, the limitation of one interactable button prevents the game from capitalizing on using it more often for traps, distractions and escapes more often in levels because the levels designed here mostly account for this problem. Had the developers tweaked the control-scheme, the open-nature of its game would have most likely pushed the game to the next level in earning its caliber as an unofficial Hitman experience. \n\n[h1]Reap What You Have Sown[/h1]\n\nWhile shy of a new standard for stealth-action games, DEADBOLT manages to communicate the hunter and the hunted tension behind its exuberant style and refined simplicity of its gameplay. In the Place where only one soul can feel the fleeting fires of the Flame, the quiet mutterings of reflection simmer into nothing.  \n\n\u201cThus the living, lone and sobbing, In the throes of anguish throbbing, With the loathsome Furies robbing, Night and noon of peace and rest.

Hotline Miami 1 and 2 ended up getting a couple thousand hours of gameplay from me back when I tried them on PS3 and 4 a few years back. DEADBOLT is one of the greatest games I've ever played, ranking up there with Hotline Miami, Snake Eater, Spelunky, Super Meat Boy, Ocarina of Time, etc, etc.\n     The graphics are minimalistic but even if you don't like pixel art you should be able to appreciate the whole 'detailed but not really' aesthetic that lends itself well to the horror theme. Guns light up rooms and shoot out bulbs in fantastic intricacy as their pixel-y glass bits shatter and fall to the floor. Certain animations, such as knocking on doors or punching, become quickly endearing and memorable, much like Mario's jump or MegaMan's firing stance.\n     Gameplay. It's like if Not A Hero decided to slow itself down and try to model itself after Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield. You can only carry two weapons, and melee weapons can be thrown. Enemies have interesting interactions with the environment and your actions; For example, if you fired a few bullets into a room to clear it but someone else was wary, but not so wary they felt the need to check, they would end up pointing a gun at the door. If you knocked on the door two, three times in a normal rhythm, they will slowly lower their weapon and answer Death.

It doesn't exceed either of these games in these areas, but it certainly makes a good attempt. \n\nThe only issues I have with the game is it's short length, and boring progression system. The length in my opinion is balanced out with the difficulty and the fair amount of replayability, the progression system (if you can call it that) however is undeniably under developed. In my opinion it shouldn't even be in the game, and instead scrapped for rewards from individual levels. The system consists of one merchant who sells primary and secondary weapons. The big issue is how few guns there are, and how useless most of them are. You only need to buy one or two throughout the game, and even then it's completely possible to just ignore them entirely.\n\nAll in all, the second commercial effort for Hoopoo is pretty good, but not great, especially compared to their first. The game is completely carried on it's level design, and even that isn't perfect.  A heasatant reccomendation at full price, but a whole hearted one if you can nab it on sale. Worth your time, but maybe not your money. 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1498978335, "timestamp_updated": 1498978335, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

I see a lot of similarities with Hotline Miami. I want to warn you tho - controls aren't really well-made. For example, to both enter and pick up weapon you have to press \"E\". Not hold, but press: and for both actions. That means if you just so happen to kill an enemy right above the vent or in the doorway - say goodbye to that vent\\doorway, since character will most likely pick a weapon, whether you need it or not (and not go into the vent or close the door). In controls I didn't see options to separate those buttons, which would be important in a fast-paced game like this. Another bad design decision - when you warp through the vents, with lights off you can barely see your enemies, if at all. That is especially true for a skeleton behind a cover or a pistol-equipped vampire. So sometimes I end up looking so damn hard, but not being able to find them. And then they surprise and instakill me after I get out of the vent, just because they are pretty much invisible during the vent travel. Also sometimes to kill a brute skeleton it takes 4 hits with scythe, sometimes 2 (I count a \"hit\" whenever their sprite lights up for a brief moment). Which is surprisingly random, and in a bad way, considering how much of a gap it is. Also sometimes you can shoot right through landminer skeleton if you shoot him point blank, even though you're clearly facing him on a screen. And one of the stages was pretty frustrating (veeery close to the endgame). You get pinned by 2 gunners and one big skeleton with a revolver, and then your entire control schemes changes to basically \"press any button to die and have to redo all your progress\". Stealth is also a bad idea in that stage since none of the lights can be turned off. Which is kinda unfair in my opinion.\n\n That type of issues caused me a lot of death and frustration during some levels, so game definetely won't go unstained in my memory. So be prepared for them if you want to play this game.\n\n Otherwise, it's pretty good. Pretty much all stuff I read about it before purchase is true - you can stealth a lot of the time, or straight up go full-guns blazing if you have the lightning-speed reaction. It's not \"always\" possible, but most of the time both are valid options.\n\nI'm glad I gave it a go, especially for the price the game is asking.

I got it from a humble bundle, and it wasn't for this game whatsoever. \n\nBut, I really enjoyed it. It feels a BIT like Hotline Miami in that it can (KEYWORD CAN, but probably not always meant to be) be pretty fast paced, it's noire-ish and gritty, it's gorey and satisfying to kill people, and its also kind of trial and error at times too. \n\nIt certainly has flaws as well. I had a black screen on start up that I had to fix that was apparently due to windows 10 (I've been told) and the fix was literally just changing a 1 to a 0 in options.ini. I feel like that's something that could have been fixed by now. Not a huge issue, but it certainly sends a bad impression when a game doesn't start up. \n\nSometimes as well, the mechanics can be a bit clunky. If a gun is directly next to a door, for example, it can be really hard to close the door, and at times you really need to close doors to be protected since you die in one hit. \n\nOther than the game mechanics, my favorite part is the overall world and tone and writing and junk. You play in a noire-ish city but it's all like monsters from hell and whatevs. You got Clubbing Vampires and things like Greaser Satans (I love Greaser Satans so much) and it's really cool. The writing itself is really simple, really short, but powerful and to the point, and I really respect that. \n\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/319991423149539340/327792922130907147/Deadbolt_screenshot.png just a little example. You can also see there's not many cases of said writing.\n\nIt's not a perfect stealth game by any means, but it was really enjoyable to play. Expect some trial and error crap, don't expect the best game, and I think you'll be in for a pretty nice time if that's what you're into. It's not a particularly long game, so how much you'd want to pay for it is up to you. I'd say around 5 bucks give or take.

I had heard good things about it and picked it up on a whim.  One day I finally decided it was time to play, but before I installed it I glanced at the store page and realized it didn't have controller support so I opted to play something else instead.  There's nothing wrong with keyboard and mouse, but lately I've preferred to sit back and relax with a gamepad.  I'm glad I didn't initially notice the lack of controller support when purchasing the game because I may have ended up missing out.\n\nIt's probably best to know as little about the story as possible going in to this game.  The storytelling is vague at best, and it would be easy to play through the entire game and only end up with a superficial understanding of what happened.  The meat of it is told through tapes that can randomly drop from fallen foes.  The least detailed but still useful description I can give is that you play as a character that receives missions from a mysterious source.\n\nMissions can have one of several different objectives.  You either have to collect information, assassinate a target, or kill everyone at a location.  Strategy is required as ammunition is limited and taking a single hit means death.  Completing missions calls for tactics such as shooting out lights, traveling through ventilation ducts, creating distractions, taking cover from fire by hiding behind objects, and making sure you have the right weapons equipped.  Trial and error is often involved, but there are many different ways to accomplish the goal.  After finishing each mission you obtain currency which can be used to purchase new weapons for your arsenal.  Your loadout consists of a primary and secondary weapon. They can be changed a the start of each mission by accessing the trunk of your car.  After killing starts it is no longer possible to access the trunk, but generally there are other weapons available in each stage.\n\nWhile playing I was reminded of a long lost era of gaming.  The gameplay felt eerily similar to something I would have played on Newgrounds in the early 2000s.  Maybe there was a game where you played as a heavily armed stick figure and had to take out groups of enemy stick figures in a stealthy manner?  Either way, the presentation here is far better than anything I recall playing during that period.  The soundtrack is awesome and although the graphics are simplistic they successfully help give each chapter its own unique feel.  Some of the maps are creative not only in the artistic sense, but in the different strategic options they provide.\n\nAs someone that doesn't usually play stealth oriented games, I was surprised at how much fun I had playing.  It doesn't take long to complete and most players will probably be able to finish the game within 5-7 hours depending on how much they play around.  For additional replayability there is an unlockable hard difficulty, a map editor, and quite a few player created custom maps available for download in the workshop.  I'd recommend DEADBOLT to anyone looking for a stylish and relatively straightforward stealth action game.\n\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/25660729-CelerySpin/]Like the review?

Whether it's swinging around that scythe or headhunting with a revolver, the only limit are the weapon choices. You can lure enemies to doors to surprise them with a shotgun blast into their face, or shoot their heads off with a suppressed 9mm pistol while hiding in shadows. You will also find some weapons that are exclusive to the level during gameplay. If you fail, you stand up and try again. You can solve the levels in different ways, sometimes with unexpected results.\n\nEnemies:\nZombies, Vampires, Demons and Skeletons. Vampires are the most annoying because of their heavier units have this revive crap.\n\nConclusion:\nUnfortunately, I found this game short.

It's a good 4-6 hours long with some extra if you want to try for achievements.\n\nThis is a puzzle murder game. Most levels involve figuring out the right order to deal with your targets and acquire the weapons you need. You generally can't kick in the door and start shooting because you die in 1 hit, and many enemies need a few shots to take down. You also need weapons found in the level, as you can't be bothered to bring extra rounds.\n\nThere is a rating system for each level that I don't think works that well, but it gives some replay ability to the game. You don't seem to be able to acquire more souls that way though.  \n\nMinor Quibble. You can buy new weapons, but there is no refund system. If you spend your money (souls) poorly you are out of luck. Pro-tip: Buy the Knife. It's the only secondary weapon you need. I liked the Tactical SMG as a primary weapon. It had a lot of shots, even if they were not that powerful. The Scythe is sometimes incredible and sometimes utterly useless depending on the level.\n\nLarger Quibbles. You press W to use stairs, going up or down. You press E to enter vents AND as your general \"Use Key.\" W should have been used for stairs and vents. That would leave E for actions. There were plenty of times I wanted to enter a vent but ended up picking up a sledge-hammer. The R key is also rarely used for secondary actions, which is awkward and you don't use it much.

frustration. We have been working on something for the game, although admittedly it probably won't be exciting for most of you guys - we've been working on translating the game to a few other languages, and its taking a lot more work than we realized.\n\nWhich portions of the editor are you unhappy with? What could be improved? I also wanna know if you guys would prefer that I kept doing maps of the week - the reason I stopped is because new maps stopped coming out for a while, and there's been a recent resurgence with the Humble Bundle. Should it be more like \"Map Spotlight,\" so when a really good map comes out it gets the focus it deserves?

At your disposal you have weapons and the ability to travel through tubes.\n\nThe missions are very linear and easy to understand. Most of the time you just have to kill everyone. Sometimes you just have to kill specific targets, destroy items or get information. The game is split into sections containing a set of missions. Each section has a different theme. Simple yet satisfying formula.\n\nThis game has many of weapons. You have your fists, handguns, shotguns, riffles, hammers and so on. However ammo is limited. Being a stealth shooter have to be very careful were and how you use your weapons. You must also be very precise if you want to save ammo. Aiming for the head is a good choice.\n\nThis game requires strategy to win. There's not much room for mistake since every enemy can kill you with a single hit. The best way to beat each level is to study your sorroundings and take advantage of it. For example, you can turn off the lights, knock on the door, shoot on the back and so on. Even so, the game doesn't really stop you from going commando style. If you're skilled enough you may get away with killing maybe four enemies tops in a row. It's very difficult but still possible.\n\nOne issue I have with this game is that it is constantly giving you tips on how to play it and you cannot disable this feature. It's like Microsoft's clip. Often I just want to try not so great ideas for fun and I don't want to be interrupted by a pop up giving me tips.\n\n[h1]Update[/h1]\n\nI have just finished the game in hard mode. In hard mode there are more enemies to kill so you have to be more efficient. I didn't know you could buy weapons until I beat the game but in hard mode that's probably a good idea. If you liked the game hard mode is worth it.", "timestamp_created": 1491693460, "timestamp_updated": 1496441135, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31027203": {"recommendationid": "31027203", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986527965", "num_games_owned": 440, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 724, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491683661}, "language": "english", "review": "You spend the game running around levels killing various undead creatures.  There's not a lot here in terms of story/character development, it's mostly an action/stealth game depending on how you want to approach missions.  There are 3 chapters in the game, each consisting of 9 missions.  You are free to replay any mission at any time.  Most missions require you to kill all undead creatures but there're several missions that have other objectives where you don't have to kill everything.  Dying during a mission places you back at the start of the mission.  Some missions have multiple parts, during those missions, you'll respawn at whichever part you're at instead of the beginning of the mission.  Most missions can be completed in anywhere from 2-3 minutes, so it's pretty rare that any given mission will take you more than 15 minutes.  Took me around 11 hours to complete the game once on normal and hard.  Vents can be used to take shortcuts around buildings.  Doors can be knocked on to lure in enemies.  Objects can be used to provide cover.  Light switches can be pressed to keep enemies from seeing you or you can just shoot out lights if you want to.  The game has several melee weapons and many guns that all feel very different from one another.  You can run around with 2 weapons at any given time.  In between missions, you can use souls that you've earned to purchase weapons from Charon that you can choose to start missions with, some of them are unique.  All of the game's achievements also provide souls for you upon completion, giving you some incentive to complete them.  Completing the game unlocks hard mode which adds more enemies to missions, introduces tougher enemies earlier in the game, or changes the placement of enemies, which changes the strategy or tactics needed to complete levels.\n\nWhen the game works correctly, it's both fun and rewarding.  There are a decent variety of enemy types.  Each undead category (Zombies, Vampires, etc) have 4 types of enemies in it.  Some are melee, some use guns, some have more health, some hang out on ceilings, some hang out underground until you approach, etc.  Most enemies go down pretty easily, none are really bullet sponges.  A couple levels even include some traps for you to run into.  Each of the melee weapons have advantages and disadvantages.  The sledgehammer kills any enemy in 1 hit, but is very slow to swing, where as the knife takes a few stabs to kill enemies up close but can be thrown to instantly kill smaller enemies.  Guns due various damage depending on their types.  Big guns like the shotguns or rifles usually do more damage than smgs and pistols but also tend to have fewer rounds before they run out.  If you have a partially loaded weapon equipped and walk over a similar gun on the ground, the game loads the bullets from the gun on the ground into your gun.  Empty guns dissapear once dropped.  Each gun has it's own accuracy and your reticle will get bigger or smaller as you place it further or closer to you.  Head shots do extra damage to enemies.  Enemies will also react if they hear shooting nearby them.  You can buy silenced weapons from Charon for a more stealthy approach to missions.  Several missions have bosses on them.  Bosses tend to work just like regular enemies except with some added quirk.  None of them are bullet sponges and often go down just as easily as any other enemy.\n\nThe game has 3 issues that can occasionally be frustrating:  1. Picking up weapons, using cover, hitting light switches, opening/closing doors, and entering vents are all done by using the 'e' key.  Usually there isn't a problem with this, but some enemies drop guns when they die and these will often fall right in front of vents or light switches or doors.  So you'll go to a vent and press 'e' to hop into it and instead you accidentally pick up a weapon.  Not a big deal you think, until you press 'e' again to hop into the vent but still don't go in because picking up that weapon in front of the vent caused you to drop your equipped weapon in front of the vent, so you wind up picking up your original weapon and drop the other weapon in front of the vent again.  And now you're dead.  This will happen semi-frequently with vents you want to go in, light switches you want to hit, and doors you want to close.  I'm not sure how this issue didn't pop up during playtesting and why they don't simply allow you to assign a separate key for grabbing weapons.  2.  Closing doors is annoying.  You need to be almost on top of them to close them and often times it will close with you being on the wrong side of the door that you wanted to be on.  This can occasionally result in you getting killed.  3.  Every once and a while the game is inconsistent.

such as when an enemy enters/leaves a room, looks one way and many other diffrent variables i personally think DEADBOLT is an truly stunning game and if you like Stealth-Action games where it is a

As someone who was disappointed with the direction that Hotline Miami 2 took in that it veered away from HLM1's think-on-your-feet gameplay into just a boring twin-stick button-mash shooter, DEADBOLT really scratched that itch left unscratched by HLM2.\n\nThe graphical style, music, and atmosphere are fantastic and easily my favorite part of the game. Music always fits the mood, and every light is perfectly placed to keep the mood up.\n\nThe gameplay itself is cool. The game is difficult, but I never once felt cheated by a death.

DEADBOLT is awesome for the first bit, but gradually transforms from a game where you have to see how to kill enemies without alerting others or finding the coolest way to kill stuff, to being a management game.\nWhat are you managing? Ammo.\nDEADBOLT is still fun when it starts to be more about managing ammo, but it kind of takes away from the core of what felt satisfiying. Every shot counts, but more than it probably should. This goes to the end of each level requiring you to have to assign enemies to guns, and be forced into never missing a single shot. One good example is a level with two towers you must clear in order to reach the top and kill an enemy in each one. In order to do so you have to kill two enemies in a room with precisely two shots from a shotgun, carefully execute three enemies with the remaining shells. Then you have to use another gun you picked up to kill one enemy with one shot, and pick up the only pistol able to one-shot-headshot the enemy type you face. Exit the building and move to the other, and take out four consequtive targets with only headshots as not to waste valuable ammo, and dispatch the last one by throwing a hammer at him to save a single bullet. By the time you're done with the tower, you should only have one or two bullets left in your gun, and over 50 retries in the logs. That being said it's very satisifying to do so, but it does kind of feel removed from the earlier chapters where you explode a zombie's head from 20 meters with a silenced pistol in a single shot. \n\nNone the less, DEADBOLT is fantastic, and you should play it for the music, even if you hate the game.

The soundtrack is cool, the art is cool, the gameplay is cool, the main protagonist is cool. Everything in this game is dripping with a slick style that invokes a corrupt, familiar, noir influenced world of supernatural crime and intrigue. As the motherfucking Grim Reaper himself, it\u2019s your job to kill the targets presented by each mission, but instead wearing a hood and using a scythe (although you do get that option later), your tools of trade are a classy brown wool coat and an assortment of firearms and melee weapons.\n\nThe developer\u2019s previous game was the excellent rogue-like Risk of Rain, and DEADBOLT is a simpler, more focused experience. Instead of the plethora of characters, items, artifacts in Risk of Rain, DEADBOLT is a streamlined 2D stealth/action hybrid game where it\u2019s just you, your chosen loadout, and a group of supernatural monsters that need to die. The Reaper is essentially a hitman, but not the meticulously calculated, sneaky, make a target\u2019s death look like an unfortunate accident Agent 47 type, but the shoot everyone in the face, ambushing and mowing down large groups before they can react kind, more like a John Wick or perhaps more accurately, Anton Chigurh from No Country for Old Men, silenced shotgun and all. Similar to a 2D version of Hotline Miami, combat is fast and frenetic, and the Reaper dies in one hit. However, your character has the ability to teleport between vents in a level, letting you surprise and flank enemies from behind. Being in the dark as often as possible is absolutely necessary to avoid being insta-killed by enemies, which gives you a distinct advantage as you will always be able to see them, while they can\u2019t see you. The Reaper can also knock on doors instead of just barging in, setting up traps for enemies and drawing them away for opportunistic attacks, as well as hide behind cover for some survivability in the tense firefights.\n\nThe dark, moody soundtrack sets the mood wonderfully, and the sound design is detailed, leading to differing volumes as you move from an exterior to an interior environment. When people complain about a saturation of pixel art in indie games these days, they certainly are not talking about games like this. This is one of the titles whose presentation is enhanced by the minimalistic art, and it\u2019s a shockingly violent game as well. I was genuinely stunned as I capped a zombie\u2019s head from behind at close range, watching his blood and brains splatter in streaks across the wall, his headless corpse slumping down against an ajar door. The storyline, however minimal gives tantalizing glimpses at the world's lore and sets the imagination alight with a player's own speculation. I liked the story a lot, it definitely doesn't burden the game with pointless distractions, but has just enough to keep a player invested.\n\nThis game is hard as nails, but when you finally manage to complete a mission, it really does feel like you ARE the Reaper, taking out groups with precise headshots easily, disappearing into the shadows only to reappear somewhere completely unexpected. If you\u2019re a true masochist, there is even a HARDER mode that unlocks after you complete the main campaign(which I\u2019m pretty sure is impossible), as well as downloadable, user generated maps direct from the Steam Workshop.

This adds a certain replayablity to the game, for players may want to return to certain missions to train their reflexes for later (and harder) stages, whislt also farming some of the easier achievements.

Know that this game is less forgiving than Dark Souls, because one hit, one shot and you start that whole level over. Enemies are acurate and hitscan. You don't get to dodge, you have to make sure they can't shoot you in the first place.\n\nThe game may be unforgiving but it is fair. Levels always start the same way and enemies have predicatble behavior. You're never screwed by way of RNG, if you're screwed it's because you messed up.\n\nIf this sounds good for you, congrats!

setting for Deadbolt - a 2D stealth game where you play the reaper reclaiming the undead.\nAlthough that's just half-true, because depending on your skill you can play with guns blazing or without making a sound, either way it's incredibly good fun. \n\nChallenging, but not impossible.\nMost indies these days are [i]hard[/i] and Dark Souls made difficulty a selling point for videogames, but often times it feels like difficulty is just there to water down the content. \nDeadbolt on the other hand requires a calm hand and good planning. I've never been frustrated, because I knew I could do better and even then the game respects your time and effort. Something I've never seen before. When you fail a couple of times - and you will - the game tells you to take a break, reconsider your strategy or gives you a hint. I've seen people on the forums outraged, because they felt babysat, but I really appreciate the notion.    \n\nThe pixel art appeared simple at first, having played Hyper Light Drifter and the like, but it is that simplicity that grew on me with excellent, fluid animations and a necessary minimalism to give you the canvas to splatter zombie brains on. \nThe level design gives you multiple ways to complete missions and offers a variety that won't bore you, constantly introducing new enemies which will mix up the gameplay and force you to adapt. It keeps the game challenging and interesting.\nThe story is cryptic, which seems en vogue these days, but offers enough clarity to let you follow and actually care about it, so that the apex doesn't leave you completely cold.\n\nFor me Deadbolt was a huge suprise. I had so much fun that I actually replayed levels after beating it, which is extremely rare for me. I'm glad when I even beat a game in the first place.

That isn't even possible in this game: a better description is that it's a speedrun game of alarm management. You're not trying to carefully prowl around unseen, you are trying not to be visible long enough that you are shot and killed. These are not the same. A common pattern is to deliberately show yourself so that enemies take up defensive positions, then travel through a duct to take them from behind. Or wait behind a door to shoot when it is opened. Or just take cover and commence a gunfight: wait until they reload and shoot them in the head.\n\nThe game doesn't hold your hand and so a lot of strategic lessons need to be worked out from first principles. For me, the result was that for my first two hours or so I wasn't very happy. Part of the problem is that a stealth approach does sort of work through the Zombie Kingz missions, particularly if you purchase a weapon like the suppressed 9mm pistol. But later enemies require far too much damage and it becomes necessary to use louder weapons. Eventually it becomes clear that there are no actual consequences to discovery.\n\nIt's a smooth engine (feels like the same one previously used for Risk of Rain), nice artwork (a really wonderful level of character in the individual sprites given the pixelated style), and a great soundtrack. There's even a little bit of plot. The difficulty curve is uneven and some elements are under-used (e.g. traps), but there's hope that player-built custom levels can fill that void. \n\nHard mode is not that much more difficult than normal and if you didn't fudge your way through then it should be a nice challenge. \n\nThe gameplay is very polished, and most of the criticisms I had initially were because I was playing badly and didn't realize it. \n\nUltimately, most of my problems with the game are minor annoyances around menus etc., such as that if you quit after failing a mission, next time you start it up you have to talk to the flames again. The level menu also does not default to the next unlocked mission even though 99% of the time that's what you will want to play. If you drop a weapon next to a grate then the context changes to \"pick up weapon\" rather than \"enter grate\", which can be frustrating.

Watching the trailers left me unsure as it looked like Gunpoint (One of my favorite indie games) but with less flash. From what I could tell the protagonist Reaper barely had any unique abilities whatsoever. This simplicity ended up being what made this game so great for me. Reaper has one special ability, He can become mist and travel through the ventilation and plumbing of a stage. Beyond that he fights with normal punches, hammers and firearms.\n\nEach level consists of a cross-section view of a building filled with enemies for you to deal with similar to Gunpoint. This means you can see nearly every enemy's movement and whether or not they're coming for you. Planning is a very big part of Deadbolt but the great part is that it doesn't have to be. Similar to games like Hotline Miami or 'Not a Hero' Things can go wrong at any moment and you'll have to make split second decisions or get shot in the face. Reaper, by the way, can only take one hit from anything before dying. You can play it as a really frantic action game or you can play it as a strategic stealth game, or you can play it as a mix. And unlike most stealth games nowadays you aren't punished for taking one approach over another. There are only 10-15 enemy types and most levels only use a couple of them each until late in the game. However this means that enemies are easy to identify and their basic reactions and how much damage they will need to go down are obvious from one glance at a stage. You are given a couple options to help approach each challenge such as knocking on doors, prompting an enemy to come open the door or turning off the lights to hide your presence until the enemy gets really close. Every gun has very limited ammo meaning you can't afford to just pump bullets into a room. Most weapons don't pierce either so if you try to take own too many enemies with one weapon you'll run out of ammo or be taken out while shooting someone else. Headshots kill quicker so there is some skill involved even in the most strategic playstyle. \n\nA variety of weapons can be purchased with 'souls' that you get from beating levels and completing acheivements. The wonderful thing is that almost any weapon can be bought soon after the shop opens with the most expensive ones only requiring you to wait another level or two. There are no 'Super weapons' that can only be used on a handful of the last levels due to price. Each one has a clear purpose and playstyle intended with it and there are no superior versions of one weapon. So if you kick ass at headshots, buy the pistol that will one hit kill any enemy with a headshot. If you plan to go busting down the doors but dont want to alert everybody all at once you can get a silenced shotgun. The greatest thing is that every weapon is balanced. None of them are the best in every situation. Even the most expensive weapon, the scythe which can one hit kill any basic enemy, had plenty of moments where I had absolutely no way to implement it into my strategy. Beyond that every weapon you can buy besides the scythe has limited ammo that can't be found in the stages so all it does is change how you start the level, the rest you have to get creative with whats available to you. I also want to say that not a single level from the first to last had me thinking \"if only I purchased X weapon\" I felt every single stage could be reasonably started using the default magnum. \n\nThe game's story is simple, you're an underworld hitman (literally) trying to unravel a conspiracy involving all the gangs made up of various undead monsters. I love that theres no 'pretentious indie game message' that I have to understand to 'enjoy' the game. You can certainly dissect some of the dialogue but the story is perfectly serviceable with the brief bits we're given. \n\nThe Art and Music are both fantastic. The art while simple, just oozes stlye. Most areas are dark gray or white but this helps keep the area cleaner so you can see yourself and your opponents faster. A lot of games like this I often feel are too busy and things get lost in the background but not in Deadbolt. Enemies have different death animations depending on how you kill them and a good headshot splattering blood all over the monotone rooms is very satisfying. Each of the four gangs is given its own unique look as well. The Zombies have a 'gangsta/hoodlum' thing going, the Vampires have a 'sleazy/sexy' nightclub look and the skeletons have a proper mafia design. As they are fought in that order it really gives the impression of working your way up the ladder of a crime syndicate. The music is possibly even better than the game. I am usually the type to listen to a podcast or some of my own library instead of a game's music. I just get bored of a game's soundtrack after a while and often times game music isn't something I would actually listen to on a road trip or something. Deadbolt however kept my ears focused on it the entire time. From smooth jazz, to club beats to metal the soundtrack is diverse and there are quite a few songs in it as well. I bought the album soon after finishing the game which I feel is the best recommendation I can give. \n\nThe game is not easy, not at all, but its simplicty lets you learn it much faster than most games so that the levels can get creative much faster than they would if your character had a billion bloody moves to learn. Even though it is challenging, it isnt frustrating in the way games like Hotline Miami or rogue-likes can sometimes get where it feels like things are really overwhelming and almost luck based. Deadbolt does a wonderful job of finding that sweet spot for me where it isnt boring me but it isnt pissing me off either; I'm having honest fun facing each challenge in the game.\n\nMaybe the greatest testament I can personally give for how good this game's gameplay is that I actually downloaded and played player made levels. I never do this because I'm usually burnt out on a game by the time I finish it to want to play something that may or may not be good, but Deadbolt actually left me wanting more, I would pay up instantly for some kind of DLC for this game.

The story and characters of the game isn\u2019t that strong but they are enough to keep you interested.\n\nThe guns are all different as the damage noise and range changes for everyone, and you do have to be conservative with ammo. I personally found myself using melee weapons most of the time as throwing them is so powerful and can take out most enemies in one hit.\n\nThe levels are nicely laid out with most have multiple entrances. There are many ways to tackle each level and searching around is almost essential, there are many things in the environment you can use to hide behind or draw out enemies. I found myself never using the cover system as enemy ai wasn\u2019t that great.\n\nThe models in the game where quite nicely made although there was only one per enemy type, DeadBolt had some nice detail in the maps and I was in love with the design of the final level.\n\nThere is replayability to get all the weapons and 5 star each level.

You essentially enter a map, can see basically all of it, will generally know how enemies will react, and must figure out an appropriate strategy to kill all the enemies without taking a scratch yourself.  As the game progresses, every few stages a new element, weapon, hazard, etc, will be introduced - the scale of difficulty and understanding of what you encounter is handled quite well I thought.\n\nControl wise, the general aiming is mostly good.  It uses mouse to aim, as in with a cursor, and keyboard to move.  I feel like designing some elements of this with a gamepad in mind may have worked out better - in particular, I found it annoying how it can be difficult to reasses your aim when you change floors.  Another major annoyance - there's a single interaction button which handles flipping switches, opening doors, and picking up dropped weapons.  A number of times I was trying to do one of these actions and not others, particularly when I kill an enemy by a light switch.  \n\nGraphically, the style is simple and works.  The light effects and atmosphere work.  It's  a functional but not gorgeous game.\n\nGood soundtrack, effective effects.\n\nLength of the game is good, gameplay is fun.

You're killing the undead so it's okay.\n\nDEADBOLT is a 2D twitch puzzle game about violence.  It is a twitch game because it requires constant, split-second timing; and it's a puzzle game because your main challenge is not fighting, but determining your order of operations and tool selection.  You have a small number of weapons to choose from at the start of each level, and from there you have to kill your way to acquiring more weapons or ammunition to make it possible to proceed.\n\nThe format is \"sink or swim\", and \"quick and dirty\".  There are no checkpoints or game saves available while playing a level, and a single hit from any enemy will kill you.  If you slip up and get nailed, you start over.  A successful run will take maybe two minutes at most, but I found some levels punishingly difficult to crack, while others were beatable on the first or second try.  This led to my spending less than five minutes each on many levels, with a few taking much longer - one level took me almost an hour of retries to complete.\n\nSome levels have many branching paths, circular paths, and alternate entrances.  Others are more linear.  This unpredictability serves to keep things fresh as each new level demands critical examination.\n\nThere is a good variety of enemies, each with their own special rules and behavior.  A certain kind of zombie might keep its head on the mantel, giving you an opportunity to kill it without confronting the body at all; a vampire couple might investigate a noise by approaching from the ceiling instead of walking on the floor.  Naturally, each enemy has his own attack type as well, some being more dangerous up close and others carrying long-range weaponry.  It is up to the player to learn all these rules through trial and error, and plan accordingly or adapt on the fly as a run unfolds.\n\nI like the art style and love the music.  Duncan Drummond and Chris Christodoulou have done it again.\n\nThe minimal story is suitably creepy and pretty weird.  Although the game features vampires and zombies, it's definitely not a standard Halloween show.  The protagonist is a \"reaper\" (not [i]the[/i] Reaper, just [i]a[/i] reaper, whatever that means) who takes his orders from ... fire.  The setting is largely familiar, but with enough of the unfamiliar to be unsettling.  The mystery of what the undead are up to doesn't end up making a lot of sense from a human perspective, which I'm down with.  It's all an excuse to shoot monsters anyway.  But ... I appreciate the effort they took to make it strange and a bit poetic.\n\nThe game is short.  I clocked about 9 hours to get through all the missions.  There are also achievements and challenges, and completing them unlocks more weapons for your arsenal - if perfecting your strategies sounds like a good time, you could easily triple your hours.  Personally, although I may return some day to try to \"5 star\" all the missions, or try the Hard difficulty, I found myself perfectly satisfied with simply completing the story.  Again, the game is short, but every moment is solid gameplay, no filler.  I'd say the list price of $10 is a bargain.

At first it feels like a pretty barebones (no pun intended) side scrolling one health shoot-em-up, but when you get into it it remains a barebones side scrolling one health shoot-em-up only a lot harder.\n\nPlaying as a no-named Reaper, your job is to kill the colorful assortments of undead who live in a sort of purgatory in reality. They hate it and want to move onto the next world, but they live here because they deserve it in some cosmic sense. So you just have to make sure that they don't do anything illegal and are punished SEVERLY for it. What this means is you have a large assortment of enemies to learn and deal with as they appear. They don't stay for too long as the game is only 30 missions and every faction has 10 of those missions. Some barely stay at all and appear for a couple missions before vanishing entirely. But the variety is very welcome as - as I said earlier - the game is pretty barebones.\n\nAs the game progresses you'll be able to grab additional weaponry to assist in your killing sprees while the game also gets steadily more difficult leading to the point where you're dying three or four times each stage at minimum to complete it. What's great is the difficulty is a very steady curve, there's never a point where you feel like the game just suddenly got too hard or too easy, it's a steady increase. It leads to the point where I spent about 40 minutes on the last level in a game where each level is 5 minutes at most typically. And that's not even getting into Hard mode.\n\nWhile the premise is simple, it's a premise that works well, adding and removing a few layers of complexity along the way for whenever the mood needs it the most. All the while you have a pretty heavy soundtrack playing in the background keeping to the noir-ish theme of the game.

The setting, although only revealed in glimpses, is also quite fresh despite dealing with the world of the dead- a mixture of Buffy the Vampire slayer and the Punisher, where the protagonist is tasked by a mysterious force to kill undead gangs, vampiric triads and demonic mafiosi while searching for the truth behind the 'Ash' trade.\n\n*POSITIVES*\n- Variety of challenge and levels, different enemies requiring not only a steady gunhand but also wits\n- Interesting world premise\n- Entertaning and challenging\n- Player level support\n\n*NEUTRAL*\n- Very limited ammo. Good for survival horror and stealth, but begs a question that if this Reaper is going about killing otherwordly mobsters, he'd have the foresight to supply with multiple clips of munitions, instead of relying blindly on on-site-procurement every single time. He isn't Solid Snake, after all.\n\n*NEGATIVES*\n- Gun trunk mechanics make no sense. Granted, I can understand the dev didn't want the PCs being able to just run back and forth between their trunk to resupply for different weapons, but throwing a knife and then being denied access is silly.\n- Despite advertising itself as 'Choose your playstyle' game, some levels really leave you little choice other than to run in the door and let loose some deadly lead into your foes, as much as you'd love to tiptoe around the guards and perform the perfect Mr. 47-like execution of your target.\n- Some levels are just bad in the sense you have to fail and fail again until you understand the timing and enemy movements. One notorious example is one nightclub where you have to destroy certain objects in the span of 60 seconds.\n- Weapon store is limited, with half the weapons being a waste of precious souls. Why buy a 9 mm pistol when you get better drops almost instantly in the game. Better off just buying a suppressed shotgun and if you're feeling like throwing money around, the Scythe.

You'll die, and a tip will pop up and be like \"Oh hey you died, maybe you should try using cover next time?\" ignoring the fact that cover is a useless mechanic in this game, on top of which it's a largely moot point in most situations because you died in a corridor with no cover available whatsoever. Likewise, another tip that comes up is varying forms of \"Try a different way to complete the level\", which is just about the most useless tip you could possibly give a player, especially when a lot of times there is objectively only one way to complete a level.\n\nMan I'd really like to get the drop on these guys over here, if only the last five levels started with anything except a room with one or more bad guys and no workaround or vent from which to bypass or any way to sneak past or anything. Literally your only option is to go head-first into it and hope the mechanics are on your side this time.\n\nAnd you'll be doing that a lot. Like, *a lot*. The majority of times that you die past the first section of levels, it's not because you didn't know what you were doing. It's because there's a mechanic that introduces randomness or otherwise something that you can't control or predict for, and if you misjudge the specific manner in which this mechanic will operate on this particular run, you're dead, try the whole level over again.\n\nFor instance, there's an enemy type that's a big melee skeleton guy, and he's got a sledgehammer. And by this point you've swung a sledgehammer in the game before, you know it's got a delay to it, so you can assume they'll have to deal with the delay in the same way you did. But they don't, and the way that you find out that they don't is that you die to it. Repeatedly. Inconsistently. Because their attack animation is them spinning around, and the point at which the spin becomes a hit can be anywhere from a half second afterward to the instant they see you. You can use the scythe to dash past them, but they sometimes - not all the time - hit you when you're behind them. So if it were consistent you'd be able to start from in front of them and go dash-attack/dash-attack/turn-around/dash-attack for a triple-slash combo that would feel good and dodge their first hit with the first or second dash. But since their mechanics are so unpredictable, you just have to do it and hope it works. Which wouldn't be so bad if it not-working once didn't mean you had to start all over again.\n\nYou'll play a level and it'll go one way, then replay it - usually because you died - and the part you got past will play out a different way for no discernible reason. You get in an elevator and go up, the guys on the floor don't do anything - rightfully so, there's a door in the way, they can't see or hear anything you're doing. But if you happen to accidentally kill a guy and knock his corpse into the elevator, then they'll somehow know something is up, so now they're activated and the area plays out a whole different way because you have to accommodate this new development, which normally in a game would be interesting but the whole point of a game like this is for you to be able to robotically complete it quickly and accurately if you know exactly what to do when the things that are supposed to happen. happen.\n\nAnd the manner in which you go about killing people is another inconsistent mechanic that works against you. Sometimes you'll pick up a gun and it'll be normal - you'll shoot and it'll hit one guy. Other times, you'll pick up a different gun and it'l be able to pierce enemies in a line. Which is useful! Unfortunately there's no way to know which gun does that, so you can't plan on it whatsoever. And even if you could, you probably shouldn't, because shooting a hallway of guys all at once is a great way to get yourself killed, unless you can kill them all in one shot.\n\nWhich leads me to my next complaint: Automatic weapons are pointless in this game. If it's not a shotgun or a powerful pistol, there's just no point to it. Standing there unloading an entire clip into a guy is just asking for him or another guy behind him to shoot you in the face. The only way to effectively get shit done is to pop one or two rounds out and then run away if that didn't kill them. And by \"run away\" I mean go down the stairs and wait for them to chase after you.\n\nThe aforementioned 'cover mechanic': As said, it's useless. If you're having an open firefight with someone, you've fucked up. It might be helpful if you could shoot from behind cover, but you can't. You expose your entire body when you aim, which defeats the entire point of being behind cover.\n\nEarly on in the game you get a sense of freedom, of having many different options available to you. You can go through this vent, you can go through that one, you can go through this door and kill this guy, you can knock on the door to distract him, etc. And then progressively as you get further into the game, in an effort to make it seem harder (read: more frustrating) your options are narrowed down smaller and smaller. Vents now have valves that make it so you can't go through them without opening the valve first, preventing you from bypassing the room with the valve in it, kind of defeating the point of having a vent in the first place. Where they used to spider out into multiple exits, now each individual vent entrance will usually only have one exit point, and it's usually only right over there, next to the door you could've just walked through, both of which plant you in front of the enemy's line of sight. So again, what's the point.\n\nAs I said, the game is good. It's not great, it's not fantastic, it's not nearly as tight and reliable as it wants you to believe. But it's good. And you get a cat. Which is nice.\n\nJust don't go in expecting it to be fair and you should be fine.", "timestamp_created": 1484500430, "timestamp_updated": 1484500430, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498753", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29275167": {"recommendationid": "29275167", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043467891", "num_games_owned": 251, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 164, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486297593}, "language": "english", "review": "Being a headhunter in the world of undeand feels really great, m8", "timestamp_created": 1484492516, "timestamp_updated": 1484492516, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29273839": {"recommendationid": "29273839", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074825295", "num_games_owned": 148, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 988, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486725828}, "language": "english", "review": "So I was trying to set up the controls to play the game on my MacBook, and I guess the key I choose for fire/enter was not recognized or something, which means I now can't enter the menu to change it, because I have no 'enter' button defined.\n\nThat's pretty clever to have the same button be the one for shooting in the game, and changing the buttons in the menu.

Miami. It's tightly designed and very fun to play, but I'd like to take a second to highlight how gorgeous the game is. Every faction in this weird, eldritch Place has its own unique aesthetic. \n\nThe first enemies you face, the Zombies, are gangsters dressed in green and grey. There's a unit that uses a 9mm pistol, a unit with a backwards baseball cap and no shirt who attacks you with a tire iron, and a gigantic Bouncer that holds his sawed-off shotgun upside-down. Zombie levels are set in dilapidated motels and trailers containing meth labs. It's all very grungy and menacing.\n\nI won't spoil the other factions, because it's a real joy to see them for the first time. They're all mechanically different as well, using different weapons and tactics, so every level is a different experience. This game is available in the Humble Bundle at the time of writing.

Sometimes a shotgun bouncer won't be one-shotted by my silenced shotgun if all the pellets don't connect with his chest correctly. I've even put two direct shotgun rounds into a hellhound and it didn't kill it while every other time before that the same dog died with one shot. Sometimes what should've been a direct perfectly aimed headshot kill won't be.Basically the game has often inconsistent hitboxes. Once in a while I can be screwed during a mission because a guy that takes several shots when I have one or two rounds left will have been alerted and stand right in front of the door I need to come out of and won't move so I just have to restart the level.\n\nThe game is often very difficult for the wrong reasons, forcing a ton of restarts on a lot of levels. The next-to-last vampire level took me 103 tries and the last vampire level took me 91 tries. I mean that is just breath takingly aggravating but what keeps me playing is that the gameplay is rock solid and really fun. When it works correctly that is. That's this game's biggest downfall is that because it is so inconsistent it requires a string of correctly timed moves combined with an equal amount of luck. The game's constant and heavy inconsistency causes huge amounts of maddening aggravation. Maybe other people have better luck. I think Hotline Miami is a harder game but I've had to restart levels in this game way more than I did in HM 1 or 2.\n\nI love the graphics, sounds, music, and gameplay very much, but end up getting extremely aggravated by how reliably unreliable it is.\n\n6/10 catch on sale.

That's pretty much what you get with Deadbolt.\n\nYou are a Reaper. Your job is to eliminate a recent undead uprising, and only a few levels in, you discover the undead are using a new drug called Ash, which makes them feel alive. You are given increasingly more challenging missions from The Flame- literally a fireplace that talks to you. You work your way through the ranks, from low level zombies to mid level vampires, to even more that I won't spoil.\n\nEven though you're a reaper, you're extremely vulnerable. Like, one hit from just about any weapon at all will kill you and send you back to the beginning of the level. This, and the gore are where the Hotline Miami genes come in. You can play recklessly thanks to the ease with which the game respawns you. The Gunpoint comes from the fact that you can be stealthy. Not only are shadows your best friends since they make it much more difficult for enemies to see you, but you can turn into smoke and travel through any given ventilation system. Each mission has a different objective, but generally speaking you'll be killing everything you can.\n\nThis is, obviously, a very different game than Hopoo game's previous work, the stellar Risk of Rain, which is an absolute blast to play solo or co op. This game only shows that the developers know what they're doing and can design many different kinds of games- which, personally, has me excited for whatever their next project is. All the mechanics in the game are fine tuned so that when you screw up and die, it's almost always your fault (although the AI will sometimes behave unpredictably and that can lead to a death that feels cheap). The level design is absolutely top notch. The game looks great. It sounds great. It plays great.\n\nMy only complaint with it is that the story is woefully under written. You're thrown into this situation with little in the way of exposition. I understand that being cryptic helps the atmosphere, but I would have liked to know a bit more of the lore behind the world. It's clear that it's there, it's just tough to piece out, which leads to an ending that feels a bit anti climactic from a story perspective.\n\nBut that shouldn't hold you back from playing this terrific game.

Your job is to put down the unruly undead, who have become roudy as of late due to the emergence of a new drug called 'Ash'. Now this may seem silly at first, who has ever heard of zombies and vampires taking drugs? But, if you think about it for a second, it makes perfect sense. Zombies and vampires were once humans after all, so why not have them act like it? Why shouldn't the undead be taking drugs, going clubbing and running brothels just like their living counterparts? Following the trail of this new drug, the Reaper discovers a sinister plot that he must stop at all costs, mercilessly slaughtering any undead foolish enough to get in his way. \n\nDEADBOLT offers an exciting mix of fast-paced gunplay and more slow and cautious stealth tactics. Guns have very limited ammo, but there will be plenty more guns to pry from the cold, dead hands of your enemies, as well as plenty of knives and hammers lying around to stab/bash them with. If all else fails, you can always just punch the shit out of them. \n\nContrary to my initial expctations, DEADBOLT's minimalistic and slightly goofy story, as well as its fun and thought provoking gunplay, drew me in, and I ended up finishing the game in one sitting. Even though the story is reletively short, DEADBOLT boasts a level editor for windows, so you can have even more fun shooting, stabbing and punching undead on all sorts of different maps. \n\nDEADBOLT is a hidden gem of sorts, and I highly suggest purchasing it (especially since it's on sale at the time that I'm writing this).", "timestamp_created": 1483088087, "timestamp_updated": 1483126443, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28812284": {"recommendationid": "28812284", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041087038", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1701, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514017977}, "language": "english", "review": "Challenging, lots of fun.

Along the way you change your approach until you find something that works, and it's cool that there is more than one solution for beating each level - you can kill everything that moves (if you have enough bullets), you can break through (if you have the speed and the skill), or you can silently sneak to your destination.\nUsually, it's the combination of the three, and you'll have to carefully manage which weapon you should use, which enemy you'll kill with it and when - all in a split of a second. It plays a lot like Hotline Miami, actually. So if you like Hotline, you'll like the DEADBOLT.\n\nDEADBOLT has a rather peculiar setting. The location it takes place in is literally called \"this Place\". It knows no sunshine and its inhabbitants know no warmth, they only ever feel cold. And they surely don't like it, as one of your first assignments in the game is to investigate a new drug bursting on the streets, \"The Ash\", which allows its users to feel warm and alive. You play as \"The Reaper\" - a trench-coated hired gun with an empty skull. Your current employer is \"The Fire\", in much more literal sense than you would think: to communicate, the protagonist actually listens to fire, by lighting a fireplace in his room. You're not the only employee of \"The Fire\", they have a whole network of agents called \"The Candles\", black antropomorphic chandeliers. They will provide you with information and assist you in other ways too. The Fire pays for your work with Souls, and you give your Souls to Charon to buy new equipment.\n\nSpeaking of equipment, this game has quite a variety of it. You can buy most items, but some of them you can only find within the levels themselves. The weapons have subtle differences: at first they all seem similar, but soon you'll find out that one weapon is super accurate, the other is super silent, third is super strong, fourth has huge clip size - and it all matters for the gameplay. Your arsenal isn't limited to guns only, either \u2014 there are other varieties, like a scythe, stun grenades, etc.\n\nTo help you to play through the level in the manner you want, this game also has various features, like:\n\n- The ability to turn light on / off in rooms and break lightbulbs;\n- Luring enemies in with a sound, like knocking on the door, enabling the microwave, etc;\n- Using furniture as cover in a gunfight;\n- The ability to transform into smoke and travel through air vents;\n\nAll these features can be used whichever style you want to play, giving the gameplay just enough variety.\n\nVisual style and sound design fit together rather well and create a solid impression of the world they depict. As carnage is always an option in DEADBOLT, developers have tried to make particle effects, like explosions, blood splats and body physics as appealing to the eye as possible. There are four factions in the game, and each of them has distinct visual and sound style.\n\nThe weapon sounds are right on the spot, and the soundtrack is also cool, with some compositions you'll probably want to listen to even outside of the game.\n\nThe game has 27 levels in total, with an unlockable hard mode for additional challenges after the first playthrough. It also has Steam Workshop integration, so you can always get new maps made by other players.\n\nOverall, DEADBOLT is an action game with good mix of stealth, combat and rapid decision-making. According to SteamSpy, at the time of this review it has sold around 32k copies, and it definetly deserves more. Give it a try if you have an insatiable craving for high-paced action games.\n\nP.S.

If you're looking for a short fun game I would recommend this. \n\nIt's similar to hotline miamia in that the mission objective is typically to enter an apartment and kill everything but the game play is entirely different. Although I said that, very similarly to hotline miama you die very fast, in fact in deadbolt any direct damage from anything will kill you(some bullets to go through doors won't kill you) and the same doesn't apply to enemies, which means you have to get the drop on them and be the first to shoot and hit(depending on the enemy type you may have to get multi headshots).  On top of that the only ability you have over enemies is to turn into mist to enter pipes or vents which means most of the game is designed like a puzzle where you have to use whatever weapons are around to figure out how to kill everyone as quickly as possible with the least amount of danger. The gameplay is very rewarding, due to it being very challenging, but it is fair and every time I died bar three times(Due to explosion radius being bigger than I thought or gun was over a vent) I knew it was 100% my fault.\n\nThe game is linear in that there are set missions you play in order but how you beat each mission could vary greatly depending on the player and the weapons you have purchased for souls from the candles, while not always true(there are some missions like the trapped appartment or the sniper level which always end the same way but they play differently to the rest of the game) there are often multiple different ways to beat each level and each level is very well designed.\n\nThis has been one of my favorite games in years and although it is short I think if it kept going on it would have become fairly repetitive, and I'd rather have 5 hours of quality gameplay than 50 of monotonous gameplay, on top of that for Completionist that want to get 5 stars on every level or get all the acheivments the game may take a while. It's 100% worth buying as is, but if you don't want to pay $10 for ~5 hours then put it on your wishlist and buy it on sale for 5-7.\n\nThe music is pretty great and it's also not bad on the eyes, while it isn't graphically impressive aesthetically it's quite nice and has quite a few cool touches, like in some levels the music becomes louder indoors or in the light. I also encountered 0 bugs or glitches, and never had technical problems.\n\n I don't like numeric ratings myself but the only two flaws I can think of is the button for picking up weapons, opening doors and going into pipes or vents is the same, so if a weapon is where a vent is you might accidently pick up the weapon instead of going into the vent and get shot because of it and the engineers mine explosion radius is somewhat unclear, so I died twice thinking I wouldn't be in the explosion radius. These were the only flaws I could think of at all, so I'd give it a 10/10 or a 98/100.", "timestamp_created": 1482721609, "timestamp_updated": 1482730936, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537931", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28651316": {"recommendationid": "28651316", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066945113", "num_games_owned": 225, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 604, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502160642}, "language": "english", "review": "Hotline Miami and Gunpoint are two of my favorite games, and Deadbolt combines the two excellently.

I get it, thats the whole reason for rewards. The thing is, the game advertises itself with a lot of playstyle choices, sneak, berserk, etc. But to get the tools allowing you to be more diverse you need to finish the game with everyone killed, a 5 star rating on EVERY level, with delivering approx 99,5% clean headshots (otherwise you wont get 5 stars).\n\nIt is still a lot of fun to play it, just for the story and looks.

Unlike Hotline Miami which separates levels into floors and where each floor is relatively short, DEADBOLT expects you to complete the entire thing in one go and if you fail then you have to start over again. The difficulty level in DEADBOLT is also so extreme, and the aiming mechanic so precise that I found myself repeating the same few seconds at the start of a level on a loop for long periods of time.\n\nWhile you die in one shot and usually have to hit enemies multiple times to kill them, the enemies, as well as being more numerous, also have perfect aim. Not long into the game you're introduced to enemies that are bullet sponges. Not long after that, there are enemies that can come back to life and can't be killed directly.\n\nWhile it probably sounds like I'm simply complaining about the difficulty level, I'm not. I've beaten Hotline Miami and had a blast doing it. I've beaten Risk of Rain, made by the same people and also notoriously challenging, more times than I can count.

It has some great stuff. I really like the retro graphics and the fantastic soundtrack. The murder spree gameplay is pretty fun too, especially the stealth aspect like shooting out lights. But honestly I found this game frustrating. Now, I don't mind the \"die in one hit\" gameplay in principle, but I feel like the execution here is lacking. Hotline Miami seemed more fun and less annoying than this game to me. For one thing, I feel like you are stuck with lousy weapons most of the time, and enemies don't drop many guns, even when they are carrying them. The level design is also iffy, requiring you to open doors or drop into a room and then not only be able to shoot extremely fast (much like Hotline Miami) but also land a headshot, which is very difficult and frankly verges on aggravating, because the enemies will kill you in one hit if your aim is off even by a hair. The reaper (your character) also moves very slowly and there is no run option. I feel like the developers were not sure if they wanted to create a twitch action game or a stealth game and ended up just mashing it together and it didn't turn out that well.\n\nSo, all in all, it's not that bad. I think you might enjoy it, if you are okay with a game that is very difficult, partly because of real challenge and partly because of faulty design.

It has a decent difficulty curve with a few spikes, namely the final level of the 1000 Years Royale and The Dredged campaign, yes, this game is divided in 3 campaigns, each of them containing 9 levels. One thing I like in particular is that most levels work differently from others, for example: One level requires that you find an object, another wants that you kill all undead and another needs to be finished under a time limit.\nAs you progress several enemies are discovered, all needing a different aproach in order to take them down. You will also discover new weapons, new mechanics and new items. You can take different aproaches with each level thanks to the variety of weapons and items despite the fact that you can only carry 2 to battle, there is a great balance between weapons, no weapon feels OP or too weak and you can use them in different ways, sadly you will have to buy most of them.\nHopoo Games also learned their lesson from Risk of Rain and they decided to make a lore that isnt vague on relevant plot points but on background elements that can be deducted paying attention to the scenario and to the little dialogue in the game, its a really good plot with lots of world building. When certain enemies die they drop a cassette containing a short story from the perspective of said enemy that helps to construct the world and lore. The bosses are pretty good! They are unique, no level remotely resembles a boss fight since it uses unique mechanics, the only boss fights that arent really good, are the first ones that are just about killing a slightly different enemy surrounded by lots of enemies.\nThe music is also incredible and the pixel aesthetic is ok. It got an amazing atmosphere thanks to the incredible music and other details like: If you are outside a building and the doors are closed, the music will be muffled like you were actually outside the building, not only that but if you perform certain actions like headshooting an enemy the music will get louder.\nOne thing that I like is that all of the achievements are functional, the achievements grants you mpney so you can buy more weapons and since you only get 10 souls (the currency of the game) when you complete each level for the first time, you will need to get those achievements.\nThe game also comes with a level editor that is pretty intuitive and good.\nIf you couldnt deduct it by what I said earlier, the game is pretty tactical, you wont get anywhere by going Jeroy Lenkins. \n\nNot all is good though:\nWhile is true that the game has a lot of mechanics that are used to spice up the gameplay and give an unique gameplay to each level. I feel that a lot of the mechanics werent really used, for example, the traps: The traps are used only in a boss fight and I feel that they werent really used in the game and that was wasted potential or how about the Bartenders who guarded their phylacteries in hard to reach places (The bartenders are enemies that in order to be killed, you need to destroy their phylacteries and then kill them, otherwise they will be resurrected) I think that the game could have used its mechanics more often and it could combine said mechanics with other mechanics in order to delicer the same effect but better.\nThe game can be buggy too, thankfully there arent any game breaking bugs but there are several bugs that are easy to find and they reduce the difficulty or they make the game harder.\nThere isnt a lot of replayability, other than the hard mode but even then, the hard mode adds an enemy just in the place to screw you and sometimes it created difficulty spikes.\nThe game lacks checkpoints which for the smaller levels isnt really bad for levels like Madam Stela it becomes a big issue since the level is incredibly big.\nYou cant buy all weapons despite getting all achievements.\n\nOverall DEADBOLT is an amazing tactical shooter with a great lore and world but that doesnt take advantage of most of his multiple mechanics and has some bugs. But even then, most levels have an unique gameplay and is definately a good purchase.", "timestamp_created": 1476025652, "timestamp_updated": 1485120683, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25896093": {"recommendationid": "25896093", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111201386", "num_games_owned": 1107, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 592, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479960688}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u521d\u73a9\u5f88\u6709\u8da3\uff0c\u4f1a\u6301\u7eed\u66f4\u65b0\u6d4b\u8bc4\n\u7565\u786c\u6838\u5427\uff0c\u4e00\u547d\u901a\u5173\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u80cc\u677f\u53ef\u7834\n\u62ff\u5230\u9570\u5200\u4e4b\u540e\u611f\u89c9\u81ea\u5df1\u8d85\u7ea7\u540a", "timestamp_created": 1475811147, "timestamp_updated": 1476250393, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.451128", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25894232": {"recommendationid": "25894232", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054675040", "num_games_owned": 1300, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 584, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498682013}, "language": "english", "review": "Brilliant iteration on the Hotline Miami formula", "timestamp_created": 1475801414, "timestamp_updated": 1475801414, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25873933": {"recommendationid": "25873933", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012120582", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 447, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475694172}, "language": "english", "review": "A 2D strategy shooter with the one-hit-death difficulty of Hotline Miami but without the top-down perspective.

In this game, you play as the reaper (a badass skeleton in a trenchcoat), who takes missions from his mysterious employer, who communicates with him via his fireplace. At first, you have to investigate an uprising of the undead and a drug called ash, but soon enough, you find yourself in a huge mess involving numerous gangs of undead, putting both you and your employer in danger.\n\nDeadbolt is one of the most underrated games I have ever played, my second favourite game and a f*cking work of art. \n\nThis game is a side-scrolling stealth shooter. You can't jump or climb walls or anything like that, and your fragile character doesn't give you much physical advantage over your enemies, so, even though you will have a load of instense standoffs, the game is all about strategy and planning. Besides thinking about which room will you clear first and how will you isolate the strong enemies from the weak, there are many other far more interesting ways you get to make your strategy. The game lets you use the environment to your advantage, meaning you get to switch (or shoot) lights, knock on doors, take cover behind huge objects and some other stuff like that. In later levels, you even have to carefully plan what are you going to do with each bullet. A small cherry on top, if you die (and you will die a lot) you have to redo the stage. Gameplay-wise, this puts stealth and planning together with a heap of intense. Some people call this a combination of Gunpoint and Hotline Miami, but I enjoyed Deadbolt far more than either of those.\n\nThe story is something out of this world. It's still not Undertale, but it's amazing. In my first playthrough, I didn't see almost any story, but, playing it again and again, one gets to notice a heap of interesting details. The main plot was pretty easy to follow, but the main villain has a HUGE hidden backstory that you have to piece together with some small clues. If you're someone who has played the game and you want to know what I am talking about, I started a discussion about this on the forums. Also, in the game, you can rarely get cassette tapes from enemies (similiarly to logs in Risk of Rain) in which the enemies talk about how they feel and what's going on. This makes the game a lot more emotional, cause your enemies aren't just mindless zombies, they're all misguided people with their own lives and thoughts and problems. Also, the person who wrote the tapes is really good at writing. Each tape felt like a small, heartbreaking story.\n\nThe graphics are absolutely gorgeous. The whole game takes place in nighttime, giving it a dark atmosphere. Speaking of which, the atmosphere was incredible. You got to walk around old apartments, nightclubs and docks, all in nighttime. If I could summarize the atmosphere in a single situation, it's you standing on a rooftop, headshotting a zombie smoking under a lonely streetlight. The art was done really well, the game has detailed pixel graphics and there are plenty of moments for you to just take a break and appreciate how gorgeous the game is.\n\nThe music is so unbelievably good that I can't really find the right words to describe it. The guy who made Deadbolt OST, Chris Christodoulou, also made Risk of Rain OST, so you know it's epic, but I'd say this OST is far better than that of Risk of Rain. The music fits well with the setting - it's mostly relaxing and mostly guitars, drums and synths. The game persumably takes place in the middle of the 20th century, so the music wasn't nearly as alien as Risk of Rain (with an exception, \"The Great Beyond\" is far more alien than anything I have ever heard (and also gorgeous)), most of the OST was rock, electronic music, hip-hop, jazz and I honestly have no clue what genre some of the songs are. In most OSTs, I only like a few songs, but in this soundtrack, I enjoy every single one of them. My favourite track is \"The Proverbial Dust Biters\". Also, if you found it clever how all Risk of Rain songs had titles related to weather, in this OST, every song is an euphemism for death or closely related to death.\n\nOverall, this game is extremely great and I recommend it to anyone who is OK with some dark themes and a bit of violence. There isn't anything bad I can say about this game.

There is almost always just one specific solution to a level that you have to do.\nI cant recommend this game because there are far better ones in this genre.\n", "timestamp_created": 1474449168, "timestamp_updated": 1474449168, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.383208", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25613446": {"recommendationid": "25613446", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099507484", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1032, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502262713}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 Would buy again.", "timestamp_created": 1474429725, "timestamp_updated": 1474429725, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25603369": {"recommendationid": "25603369", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043813981", "num_games_owned": 334, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 426, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474559007}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like Hotline Miami or Gunpoint, this is the game for you!

At first this seemed to be just the fix, a new hotline substitute.But surprisingly it was remarkably different, really making the style of game its own. You die in one hit, like on hotline miami, but do not kill in one hit. The vast quanitity of enemies is swapped for a more tactical approach, with stealth elements, such as shooting out lights to reduce visibility, shooting at the ceiling to make noise that the enemies above would follow, and other tactics I didn't realise I had the ability to think of in a game like this.\n\nJust like hotline miami, you may feel yourself replaying the same level many times; but that's where half the fun comes in these sorts of games. Trying and failing a strategy, constantly improving it untill you have it running like clockwork.\n\nThe main problem for me was that, by the end, the missions seemed to get easier. I dont know if it was me getting better or just less interesting design. [spoiler] I felt the last missions specifically, where the demons became present and it focussed more on straight up action, were missing the difficulty that the high stealth requirement of the vampire missions. [/spoiler] This is because, again, it isnt hotline miami, and the mix of stealth with bursts of action were what really made it shine for me. The hyper violence of hotline miami was hotline miami's job, and as a whole they did it better, because it was designed around that.\n\nBut I digress, this is one of those game that make you feel like the [i]'meet the spy' [/i] trailer for tf2 portrayed the spy. A silent, deadly killer, who moves like a shadow through the dark, an unstoppable force with no mercy.

Die Grafik ist sehr detailverliebt und trotzdem simple genug um nicht abzulenken. Die Geschichte wird teils offen, teils versteckt erkl\u00e4rt. Das Spiel ist schwer, aber es h\u00e4ngt beinahe allein vom Skill des Spielers ab und in keinster weise von Leveln/Statuswerten etc. deswegen ist die Schwierigkeit ein eindeutiger Pluspunkt in meinen Augen. In ungef\u00e4hr 9-10 Stunden hat man das Spiel einmal durchgespielt, aber die dann neu freigeschaltene schwierigkeit bietet nochmals ein komplet neues Spielerlebnis durch neue Gegner Plazierungen und modifizierte Level.\nDas Spiel ist eines dieser \"einen Versuch noch\" Spielen bei dennen man pl\u00f6tzlich anstat abends um 3Uhr Nachts dasitzt.

Just a note.\n\n\n\nDEADBOLT in the nice list of side shooters is enjoyable to say the least. As it says, its a side schroller shoot-em-up with a sort of \"One shot kills all\" take like from Hotline Miami or other games with a similar death system. Of course though the game itself is enjoyable. Unlike my previously reviewed RONIN, it actually has story and meat in it besides gameplay. Sure it seems simple, but it does turn into a thinking mans game on the later levels as you progress. Often enough though you do die a lot, but it isn't soul crushingly hard unless you try to rush it.\n\nThe story follows you, a \"Reaper\" who must help his clan, the Candles, stop the undead from doing what they shouldn't be. Though it goes much deeper than that, I wont get into it. Other than the fireplace giving information about the world depending what you click on the dialogue box, there are some cassette tapes that pop in and out occationally, which hold more story. Though you'd have to be ready to read a lot cause these things dont really have voices.\n\nMusic is okay. Its certainly more entertaining than RONINS overly repetitive soundtrack, but sometimes it seems to replay other tracks. Now I'm not saying \"MAKE GAMES MUSIC AS VARIED AS HOTLINE MIAMI 2\", but it does feel only a smidgen repetitive. But on the bright side of it, its nice to listen to.\n\nThen theres the custom maps which gives this game a nice flavor in replayability, but it depends how much you enjoy playing it. You'll either come out of it feeling good or a bit frustrated. It just depends on the person you are to this game.\n\n\nAll and all, this was a nicely made game that I would certainly recommend if you're lookin for something fun. Though play this game in small bursts. Maybe about 3 or 4 missions per session is what I would recommend. And this is where RONIN should take notes. Keep the story in the game, and not in some delux addition.", "timestamp_created": 1472771572, "timestamp_updated": 1472771572, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25289581": {"recommendationid": "25289581", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127245029", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3294, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502818549}, "language": "english", "review": "I never have written a review for a game but Deadbolt is absolutley an amazing and emersive stealth, single-player experience, that I hate to write one. I recommend it to all who enjoy playing strategic stealth games. As you progress through the game, you need to think more and more about how you are going to complete each mission. You can choose between weapons you buy before the mission and then decide if youre going to go in loud, or stay stealthy under cover. Firepower and weapons are also something to be conservative and aware of. Some missions will have additional weapons in the map, but you will never have an abundance of the weapons or ammo. The game also has a lot playthough and play time, and the game is so deep you could play it through again and not get bored of it, plus there are Workshop levels you can download. I recommend this game for anyone who likes stealth and strategy, not to mention the amazing soundtrack the game has. Definitely a great game at an amazing price.

Guess ill have to figure that out!\n\n\nBut so far i actually do like the game, its a really fun gunpoint type of game, it has great levels, great music and just overall a great athmosphere around it.

The new game mechanics introduced throughout the game make sense and make combat interesting. Each enemy type requires a different tactic, but I wish there were more places where enemy types were mixed to force the player to make decisions on-the-fly. The main mechanics such as cover and knocking on doors are incredibly useful throughout the entire game, but it is up to the player to decide if and when they want to use them, as they are not required anywhere. The setpiece missions were awesome and I would have loved to see more of them throughout. They felt very well thought out and seem to make the combat take a back seat to the stellar level design.

The overall premise s that you play as a \"reaper\" and are given missions from a misterious source through a fireplace. The gameplay itself mainly comes down to conserving ammo, going for headshots, and trying to plan out how you take a level. This game could be considered strategy in the fact that you have to plan out your route but it mostly comes to bashing your head against the wall until you find the path of least resistance. Watching friends play the game, however, shows that there are multiple ways to play through levels, and that different weapons hold different advantages in terms of gameplay. \n\nThere were not very many glaring issues I had with the game, besides the fact that weapons may sometimes block vents and doors and in stressful situations I found myself sometimes having vents being blocked by pistols, and instead of making a hasty getaway using the game's vent mechanich, I accidentally change weapons with a rogue weapon lying on the ground. The only other major flaw were landmines. I thought that they were very cool the first time that I found them, and the first time you encounter them you get to weild one in order to learn how they work. Sadly, this was one of the only two times you actually  get to weild a mine for yourself, and then you get introduced to technicians, the enemies that plant and use landmines against you. Landmines can only be avoided by going through vents or blowing them up remotely with a gun or a thrown weapon. This means that if you find a lindmine in your path with no way around it, and you don't have a weapon, you have no choice but to die. This fault in landmines is also accenutaited by the fact that enemies do not trigger landmines, and if an enemy body falls on top of the landmine, there is no way to remotely trigger it except to destroy the body, which uses a ridiculous amount of ammo, a very limited resource in this game. \nOverall I found beating levels gratifying and had a good time playing the game, and would reccommend to fans of games like Gunpoint.", "timestamp_created": 1471486408, "timestamp_updated": 1471650387, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558824", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24969148": {"recommendationid": "24969148", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108515778", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505531649}, "language": "english", "review": "A challenging stealth game, with amazing level design and fun gamepay.\n9.6/10", "timestamp_created": 1471421144, "timestamp_updated": 1471421144, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24966007": {"recommendationid": "24966007", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088599835", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 484, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509407813}, "language": "english", "review": "If you came looking for Risk of Rain II, then too bad, take this masterpiece instead.

I'd say that ther game plays quite like Hotline Maimi, but honestly it is similar in few enought ways that I will not. Both have a super quick pased combat system where you are more fragile than paper-thin glass. But that's sorta where the similarity ends.

DEADBOLT is a mix of Gunpoint's beautiful map design and Hotline Miami's unforgiving gameplay and gore. This combination creates an extremely challenging strategy, stealth and shooter casserole that I would eat 3 meals a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. You play as \"The Reaper\" a ghostly figure who can transport through pipes and whose only purpose is to brutally murder bad guys and to upgrade his arsenal. It is highly rewarding and extremely challenging. \n\nThe soundtrack is fantastic if you like slow electronic jazz and rock.\n \nThis game is a diamond in the rough and I highly suggest you pick it up without watching any YouTube videos or even reading my full review, unless you're not sold by my initial description. P.S this is my first real review.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nWhen you finally clear that level that you have died time and time again on whether it's through a strategy that took 10 lives to refine or through knocking on doors, luring enemies into a bullet with their name on it, then lighting up the rest of the room, you get the most rewarding and triumphant feeling that very few games succeed to give to its players. \n\nMUSIC\nThe music is a great slow jazz mixed with modern electronic beats and sounds. It gives such a stark contrast to your actions ingame yet at the same time, fits the aethstetic so perfectly. It is written by Chris Christodoulou. Here's the OST, which is great, even without the game. https://chrischristodoulou.bandcamp.com/album/deadbolt\n\nVISUALS\nThe visuals are gorgeous. It is a dark and gloomy gloomy pixel art slum like city, crawling with zombie like goons that's only purpose is to keep their boss from being murdered by you or to keep getting that fix of a drug that makes them feel human again. \n\nSTORY\nThere is little story to the point where you could ignore its existence but if you look closely, and collect the cassette tapes, you find grimly written, drug infused stories from the goons themselves. They give surreal descriptions of the baddies' experiences with the drug and with life as a zombie.\n\nSeriously, buy this game.", "timestamp_created": 1470857252, "timestamp_updated": 1470857950, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.598997", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24812783": {"recommendationid": "24812783", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042278964", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 658, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504479277}, "language": "english", "review": "NOT A HERO and Hotline Miami had a baby that actualy works in fullscreen", "timestamp_created": 1470847734, "timestamp_updated": 1470847734, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497336", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24808832": {"recommendationid": "24808832", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082790318", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 293, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510136691}, "language": "english", "review": "i fucking love this game. great hotline miami feel with the aesthetic soundtrack. phenomanal gameplay. cant wait to get deeper in", "timestamp_created": 1470829741, "timestamp_updated": 1470829741, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499821", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24807420": {"recommendationid": "24807420", "author": {"steamid": "76561198178423614", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 502, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474086849}, "language": "english", "review": "I've just finished this game and now starting hard mode.

I kept checking up on Hopoo Games, just to see if there would be a Risk of Rain 2. I did this for a while and I eventually came to a conclusion that they were just a \"one and done\" gaming company. Not too long ago, out of curiosity, I decided to check on Hopoo Games again.\n\"Deadbolt?\" I asked myself. \"This isn't Risk of Rain 2... Well, lets check it out.\"\nI was NOT disappointed. This game is fantastic.\n\nYou play as the Reaper. You work for a mysterious entity that speaks to you through the flames in your fireplace. Your job: kill the undead the flame wants killed. The theme is a dark one. I don't want to say much about the story, because it's rather interesting, very dark, and quite somber. Just know there is a heavy theme of death, sex, drugs, tragedy, and suicide.\n\nThe gameplay is similar to Hotline Miami, in a sense. You observe your environment and use various weapons/tools to complete your job as quickly and efficently as possible. However, this is a stealth game. Unless you're very fast, lucky, and have a steady hand, you can't just go into a room and blast everyone away. Take your time, plot your path, and prepare to die a few times until you get it right. Knock on the door to confuse your enemy, jump into the vents nearby and flank your enemy, the options for each level are endless. This game isn't easy, but it isn't brutal.\n\nThe music. Oh man, the MUSIC! Chris Christodoulou is a fantastic musician and every piece of music he creates for the games he's associated fit the theme and set a very atmospheric tone that many other musicians simply can't achieve. In fact, the music is one of the main reasons Risk of Rain is one of my favorite indie games of all time. Deadbolt is no exception. The music ranges from creepy and daunting to rythmic and exciting. Of course, the music fits the tone for each level. It's great. Just youtube it.\n\nThere isn't much to say about graphics. It's pixel graphics, which is all the rage for indie games it seems. There are some nice details. Nice blood spatters coat the wall as you brain a zombie with your 10mm. The color palettes don't clash, so you won't get confused by what you see. It looks fine.\n\nWhat about some bad stuff?\n\nUnfortunately, the story mode is short. Very short. I felt a little underwhelmed when I finished the game, asking myself \"is that it?\" Luckily, there is a hard mode to unlock after you beat the game. I'm working on it now. It's tough.\n\nThere were a few bugs as well. I've seen a few enemies fall through the map, making me need to restart the game.\n\n\nOverall, the game is really good. If you like a Hotline Miami-ish style game, amazing music, a dark and mysterious storyline, and a high difficulty cap, this game is for you.", "timestamp_created": 1468588378, "timestamp_updated": 1470832737, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.642575", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24325108": {"recommendationid": "24325108", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121495543", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 58, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468513116}, "language": "english", "review": "Hitman: Enter a World of Assassination\n\n\n\nwith skeletons and zombies and vampires oh my\n\n\n\nalso there is a gun in this game, I like how you shoot the monster with it\n\n\nthere is no way out and three doors, escape before He get you!\n\n\nEnemies, of freedom, face the music (C'mon boys, take 'em down!)\nPresident Donald Trump Knows how to make america great\n\n\nAnchorman 3: The Legend Continues.

There's moments for me where the game seems to almost go in slow motion as I build up the flow, which is very cool. The actual aesthetic really hooks me as well.

By either going loud or stealth like. The combat is fun and at moments intense. The controls are tight and don't feel odd or floaty. When aiming your cross hair will actually reflect the accuracy of your shot depending on your distance from the target. The story is also very intriguing. It keeps the player coming back for more out of curiousty.\nIt has a very nice ambient soundtrack, the sound design in general is pretty great as well as the level design. \nBest of all is the replayabily value.

If you arent interested in those, buy it on sale and you won't regret it. 10/10 would reap again.\n\nREVIEW\nDeadbolt is a great mix between the fast paced action of Hotline Miami and the puzzle aspects of Gunpoint, which is why I think it'll be more efficient for me to compare this game with those 2 (which are both great, by the way) so you have a better idea of what you're getting into when you buy this game.\n\nDeadbolt is a 2D action stealth hybrid where you play as the Reaper himself.\n\nThe gameplay of this game is a unique blend between Gunpoint and Hotline Miami. First off, the death system. Just like in Gunpoint and Hotline Miami, one hit kills you instantly. And just like in Hotline Miami, getting killed means resetting to the beginning of the level. No checkpoints for the most part. Some levels later in the game have checkpoints (think of them like going to another floor in Hotline Miami. You didnt beat a level, just a portion of it). The game also expects you to not only die, but to improve upon previous plans because of it. Maybe you died because you didnt see someone in another room, or because you missed a shot. Contrary to your own frustrating deaths however, killing enemies feels GREAT. The gib system guarantees that almost every death feels satisfying,  and nicely complements all the weapons at your disposal. Much like in Gunpoint and Hotline Miami, each level does not have one right answer, and this is largely dependent on 2 things:\n1. How you, the player, like to play.\n2. What tools are given to you.\nThere are a TON of weapons available for your disposal. Blunderbuss? Check. Hammer? Check. A cool-ass scythe? You fuckin bet kiddo. The only problem with this is that usually, the weapons you like are gonna be the weapons you bring to the mission. And if you prefer using guns, then be prepared to run out of ammo for them if you aren't good at landing headshots. Ammo is almost never replenishable for you, thanks to the fact that the only ammo you're getting is from guns that are the same as yours. However, the game turns this from being an annoyance into being a way to challenge the players. Okay, you used up almost all of your ammo. Do you focus on enemies that are closing in. Or do you try to sneak around and kill someone who has a gun? And part of the fun in this game is the sudden improvisation, where you completely missed an enemy and have an \"OH SHIT\" moment, just trying to shoot someone but accidentally punching them till either you or they die.\n\nAnd speaking of sneaking around, I think that I should mention the ventilation in this game. As in, the vent mechanic. The reaper has a special lighter that allows him to travel through vents, which can make for a great way to escape a fight in which you would most probably die or a way to reposition yourself to take opponents by surprise. This mechanic gives me Gunpoint vibes, because its where the stealth and puzzle mechanics creep in. It makes engaging with the enemy more of a puzzle than a fight, as the enemy also dies quite quickly. Usually. But due to the fragility (is that a word?) of enemies, getting the first hit can help immensely. \n\nThe music of this game is done by Chris Christodoulou, who also worked on the Risk of Rain OST.

You play as the Grim Reaper on his quest to slay hordes of undead in various gangs using a wide variety of weapons ranging from humble pistols to semi-automatic grenade launchers. Each level is unique and very challenging (sometimes a bit too challenging). The vent transport mechanic requires timing and is also super fun to use. The music adds a great atmosphere to the game, making it seem even more dark. DEADBOLT is obviously influenced by Gunpoint, but it's not a rip-off at all. There is an air of mystery throughout the whole game because you are only told to kill zombies, but the reasoning is never fully explained. All in all, Hopoo Games has made a terrific noir style game that is simultaneously mind-bendingly tricky and possibly more addictive than crack. Did I mention you get to kill zombies on the toilet?

[/h1]\n\nI just finished the mainstory and I can not comprehend how I haven't heard of this earlier.\n\n\n[h1]What is this game all about?[/h1]\n\nYou're the grim reaper. Working for an unknown employer you set out on a quest to find out why the dead are coming back to life and what their plan is. You're placed into a bizarre and vague Hotline-Miami-esque storyline with a similar soundtrack (really good original OST here!) and start murdering while the mistery slowly unfolds.\n\n\nI won't spoil any of the fun for you but let me just tell you this: there are a lot of different enemies, maps, bosses and even a few special missions to just give you a feeling what what the devs were trying to tell you.\n\nYou can just go on walzing your way through the game or go full-on stealth mode. I liked both.\n\n\n[h1]What I liked:[/h1]\n[list]\n [*]Choose your own playstyle\n [*]The aiming is very accurate\n [*]You can lure enemies into ambushes\n [*]There is a huge of amount of variety (weapons, enemies, levels, etc.)\n [*]A map editor and Steam Workshop are integrated\n [*]The story and especially the ending really kept me on my toes\n [*]The physics of flying limbs is [b]REALLY[/b] satisfying\n [*]Very cool OST\n [*]Lovely artstyle that really underlines the excellent atmosphere (opening the trunk of your car gave me goosebumps)\n [*]It's hard as fuck\n[/list]\n\n[h1]What I didn't like:[/h1]\n[list]\n [*]The ceilings occasionally felt too high\n [*]That's literally all, just the ceilings\n[/list]\n\n\n[h1]Here's my conclusion:[/h1]\n\nA lot of love has flown into this game, it can be seen within every facet. From the sprites to the excellent soundtrack (available on Bandcamp by the way), this game is a masterpiece and has earned a spot within the ranks of my favorite games of all times. This truly is the golden era of indie games.\n\nIf you like Hotline Miami, Gunpoint or Ronin, you will not be disappointed! \nI recommend getting this at full price, [b]it's really worth it.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1465651413, "timestamp_updated": 1465651531, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23469746": {"recommendationid": "23469746", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046069015", "num_games_owned": 195, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483276268}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Este juego me recuerda mucho a \"Hotline Miami\", quitando la vista desde el aire y reemplazandola por una vista lateral.

tone while still being fresh and dark enough to fit Deadbolt\\'s world.\n-Gunplay: The gunplay is viceral and hits very hard. Each weapon is both balanced and strong enough to fit a variety of situations. The way enemies heads\\' explode with a succesful headshot truly makes you feel like the Repear alongside the innacurate firing of the enmies that encourages trading fire when in a gunfight.\n-World: The world of Deadbolt is both dark and relaxing with a very clean and still detailed pixelated art style.\n-Its just awesome.\n\nWeaknesses:\n-Depth: Beyond unlocking all the weapons and beating the game once through on normal (and again on hard) there isnt much to the world of Deadbolt. It makes you wish for an in depth \\\"perks?\\\" system that would allow us more Repear powers or the like. The same problem persisted with Risk of Rain with few fun relics and repetative gameplay even with different characters after the first few clears.\n-Story: The set up for the story is there and if you make an effort to collect all the tapes you can get a sense for a loose story within this universe. However with such a short main story arch there isnt much depth that can be acheived. I want to dive deeper into who the Repears are and why they do what they do. I came out with a multitude of questions and even after extensive collection I was still disappointed.\n-Replayability: It would be great if the level editor was more expansive or if the game had a new weekly challange or stage or... something! But once you finish your first playthrough \\\"Hard\\\" mode is still much too similar.\n\nVerdict:\n-Buy this game, its 10 dollars and if it goes on sale then it really deserves a purchase.\n-Seeing this as Hopoo\\'s second major game I would give this an 8.5/10, its everything I expected and not much more. Not that thats a bad thing, because I did expect a killer soundtrack, fun gameplay, and unique art style. \n-I hope that Hopoo continues to produce great games and eventually makes a game that really has an expansive, replayable universe!

But then we come to the descriptions of the undead. Sure, they explained the Vampires, Skeletons and Demons well, but they didn't quite go into depth with the zombies. So let me just say this: The story sometimes doesn't give us full details, which begs a few questions. And yes, these aren't always bad ideas to beg questions, but it would be a bit nice to explain what zombies are (Prehaps people who have overdosed on drugs?) There isn't much I can say about the storyline now, except that it is very short if you know the controls well, and can take a challange. The best way you can continue is through the use of the workshop, which, I have to say, was a great addition to the game. Don't get me wrong, the storyline was really great and thoughtful, and the tapes really gave some stories to how the Undead felt from time to time, but the Workshop just adds new levels, new designs to which people add to! It would be awfully fun if they did a contest or something. Next up, we have the end.  We never get an understanding to why our friend (I really forgot his name, the one who died at the well) said that the flames was his 'Old friend'. Now, there is that one Skeleton log talking about how a skeleton had the fireplace, however it vanished for some reason (Perhaps he became an undead at some point). It would be nice to have a [b] *COUGH COUGH* [/b] DLC [b] *COUGH* [/b] , Where you play as that undead who lost everything.  Would make for a touching story. [/spoiler] ...So that's all I really have to say about the game. Overall, I'd give it a 6/10, the gameplay was challanging, it had a touching story, but it didn't achieve some things right.

Each stage consists of a more or less complex area to infiltrate, guarded by a number of enemies. As the difficulty increases, so do your options: a wide array of weapons becomes available as you progress, in addition to those you might find during the missions.\n\nAs one hit instantly kills you, balance and level design were always going to be critical. Fear not, [i]Deadbolt[/i] is absolutely brilliant in both respects. The tight balance leaves little room for error, but most levels are short enough that you won't mind redoing them until you've figured out how you want to go about them. Then you'll experience the deep satisfaction of a well thought-out and precisely executed plan, clearing the stage like clockwork... or dying to a minor detail that you overlooked. The gameplay is full of clever ideas, of things you can do (enter a vent, switch off the lights, knock a door to distract your foes, etc.) to approach each mission in a number of subtleicious ways.\n\nThankfully, the visual and audio design is on point. The \"film noir\" atmosphere is simply awesome, not the least thanks to yet another memorable soundtrack from Chris Christodoulou. As for the visuals, this may well be the most stylish pixel art I've seen in a video game.

It also introduces new concepts and enemy types at a regular enough pace to keep the combat interesting; the few boss levels in the game really require a lot of forethought and planning that makes reaching the end really rewarding.\n\nIn addition to the solid combat, the story and narrative design is delivered in a minimalist breadcrumb manner via small mission briefings and the occasional enemy note drop. It drives home the \"mystery thriller\" aesthetic through story as well as graphical and audio atmosphere. The soundtrack alone is pretty good, but after playing the game, you'll definitely appreciate the tracks more for what levels they remind you of. All in all, awesome game from start to finish.", "timestamp_created": 1461311113, "timestamp_updated": 1461311113, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22558353": {"recommendationid": "22558353", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077444637", "num_games_owned": 226, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 796, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507493581}, "language": "english", "review": "A real Gem of a game, DEADBOLT is a quirky sidescroller where the character mercilessly dispatches the undead.

To avoid an untimely return to the afterlife, you\u2019ll have to make the most of the reaper\u2019s unique set of skills.\n\nNot only is he surprisingly skilled at using any type of weapon he can get his bony fingers on, the Reaper is able to quickly transport around levels via turning into smoke and going through pipes and vents. More often than not, gunfights become a hectic ordeal of jumping throughout the map to find new weapons or get a new angle at your foes, and when everything comes together, it\u2019s quite satisfying. I\u2019ve never played a game that can make something as crude as causing a vampire to explode into chunks via bursting out of his toilet seem so stylish.\n\nThroughout my time with Deadbolt, I may have struggled with certain segments and a few nasty shootouts, but it\u2019s hard for me to pinpoint a time I was actually upset with the game. It achieves that perfect balance of punishment and reward. A game that constantly knocks you down, but it\u2019s just such a blast that it keeps you wanting to get back up and give it another shot.\n\nRead the full review here: http://techraptor.net/content/deadbolt-review-become-death", "timestamp_created": 1461092152, "timestamp_updated": 1461092152, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489426", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22519216": {"recommendationid": "22519216", "author": {"steamid": "76561198214652173", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 208, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477222385}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0443\u043f\u0435\u0440 \u043d\u043e \u0440\u0435\u0431\u044f\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0441\u043e\u0437\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u044b", "timestamp_created": 1461086039, "timestamp_updated": 1461086039, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22513537": {"recommendationid": "22513537", "author": {"steamid": "76561198174823994", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462596699}, "language": "english", "review": "havemt finished yet, but this game will piss u off", "timestamp_created": 1461062266, "timestamp_updated": 1461062266, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22508362": {"recommendationid": "22508362", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994666064", "num_games_owned": 2643, "num_reviews": 545, "playtime_forever": 408, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458305814}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Um baita de um jogo charmoso, a jogabilidade dele \u00e9 um tanto seca, basicamente um \"Entre l\u00e1, mate todo mundo\" ou dando variadas como pegar pap\u00e9is ou matar um \u00fanico cara e o resto ser opcional.

The levels themselves are non-linear as they can be completed however you want, but you get no choice on which missions to take and there's no branching story lines or side quests. The puzzle aspect stems from certain objectives and enemies. There are no \"logic puzzles\" per se, instead you'll be racking your brain trying to figure out \"how do I clear a room with 12 enemies in it, when I only have 6 bullets?\" There's a plethora of guns and melee weapons for you to utilize, some can be purchased before missions and brought with you, while some can only be found during levels.\n\nDEADBOLT reminds me a lot of Hotline Miami. You take one bullet, no matter where, and you're dead.\n\nYour enemies, however, aren't going to go down nearly as easily. Accuracy is key in DEADBOLT. If you're not getting headshots, you're wasting bullets. If you're wasting bullets, you're not going to survive very long. It's not uncommon to end a level with 90% accuracy with 100% headshots, because that's what the game demands of you. Nothing but the best.\n\nThe gameplay, visuals and soundtrack are incredible. Hopoo Games have proven that the greatness behind Risk of Rain was no fluke.\n\nI paid full price for this game and I am very happy with that purchase. DEADBOLT's campaign is approximately 6 hours long, and hard mode is unlocked after completion.

I will be honest and admit I'm a hopoo fanboy, I bought this game almost entirely based on my experiences with Risk of Rain, and I wasn't disappointed!\nThe game keeps itself seperate from titles similar to it by focusing at least partly on stealth, rather than the fun, bass-pumping of hotline miami, and I greatly appreciate the sneaky manuvers that can be achieved. While the mechanics are simple (raise gun shoot gun throw melle weapon) I keep finding new ways to use the simple design to my advantage, exploiting tricks with a knowledge obtained through many black blood stains (Big bartender vampires take three hammer hits to kill, phylactaries and head cameras can be broken eith a hammer and still let you keep the weapon, you cant out damage a nightcrawler. Ever)\nThis is a game that offers a great set of challenges for an enthusiast, from the tricky levels in hard mode to the nose-bleedingly difficult four horseman achievements, and, coupled with a community of map makers, will keep a pulse on the undead for a while. The other challenge, and one I had hoped would appear again, is the deep set touches of lore and story that give the world life and hint at something greater. For the life of me, and SPOILERS AHEAD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite collecting nearly all tapes I can only glean that you live as a reaper in this Place, and Ibzan was the reaper before you and wants to pass on, which he believes he can do by speaking with the Flame. Even getting to this conclusion took a fair deal of brain twisting, and while that might not appeal to everyone, I know I am not alone in loving thehidden lore of a game. \nIn conclusion, buy. This. Game. If not for the story and hidden details, if not for the very well done musical accompanyment, if not for the challenge of beating famine and death, get it because at its core, Deadbolt is a fun and fast paced stealth hybrid, and good Flame who doesn't want to spam knock on a door until someone answers and eats blunderbuss?\n", "timestamp_created": 1460271236, "timestamp_updated": 1460271236, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22327709": {"recommendationid": "22327709", "author": {"steamid": "76561198195063154", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1218, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514143170}, "language": "english", "review": "How to make DEADBOLT\n\nfour teaspoons of Mark of the Ninja\n\none quart of hotline miami\n\none gallon of some special Hopoo Games juice\n\nBlend together on high for 2 minutes\n\nENJOY!\n\n\nI'm immensely curious about the word of DEADBOLT.

Their first game, Risk of Rain, was a highly addictive and satisfying experience that was only made better with later patches. Needless to say, I was excited seeing their second game, DEADBOLT, hit the Steam's shelves. And oh boy, did they deliver with this one.\n\nIn its essence, DEADBOLT is a challenging 2D side-scrolling stealth-action game. It features beautifully drawn pixel art graphics and animations, MIND-BLOWINGLY stellar soundtrack by Chris Christoudoulou and a noir story setting that oozes style.\n\nIf this review is not the first one you are reading, you most likely already saw DEADBOLT being compared to Hotline Miami by quite a lot of people. And they are not necessarily wrong -- albeit different in perspective (top-down vs. side-scrolling) and aesthetic there's a lot in common to find in these games. Just like Hotline Miami, DEADBOLT will have you planning out your strategy, making split-second decisions whenever your plan goes awry, observing your surroundings and dying... Quite a lot. \n\nDEADBOLT's gameplay is extremely satisfying. Feedback you get from every action looks great, sounds great and feels great, from hurling a hammer at a skeleton or emptying your SMG clip into a beefy zombie bouncer to vanishing into a vent to escape or flank an enemy. Levels are designed in a way that allows you to take different approaches in completing the objectives given and if you're a completionist, you'll find a lot to like here, optimizing every move to get that 5 star rating on a level. This is further complemented by the ability to customize your starting loadout with a primary and secondary weapon. A number of different weapons can be unlocked as you progress in the story in the order of your choice. Overall weapon variety is relatively large and that keeps the gameplay fresh and interesting. Controls are tight and precise, although delay after certain actions (for example switching into a different weapon after getting out of a vent) might throw you off a couple of times until you get used to it.\n\nStory of DEADBOLT is quite original, in which that it mixes noir and undead settings together. It works out pretty well. Dialogue is interesting to read and you can find casette tapes in various levels that add details to the setting. The whole atmosphere of this game, however, is executed like no other, thanks to the soundtrack composed by Chris Christodoulou. The OST of Risk of Rain (also composed by this guy) quickly became one of my favourite game soundtracks of all time and damn me if Chris has not out-done himself this time. Soundtrack is of such high quality and even while combining a variety of genres manages to stay true to the game's setting and overall context. Use of diegetic music was also a very welcome choice. At this point I cannot wait to hear what Chris is coming up with next.\n\nDEADBOLT is a very difficult game to not recommend. It does very little things wrong and does so much right that I believe it deserves a chance if you're considering giving it a try. :)", "timestamp_created": 1460234482, "timestamp_updated": 1460245878, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22323029": {"recommendationid": "22323029", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077984016", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 995, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461298444}, "language": "english", "review": "It's fun, it's difficult, and the music is great.\nIf you take Gunpoint, mix it with Hotline Miami and turn everyone undead you get this game.", "timestamp_created": 1460222402, "timestamp_updated": 1460222402, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22312358": {"recommendationid": "22312358", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049992365", "num_games_owned": 289, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1588, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 18, "last_played": 1516089318}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is just amazing, I love almost everything about it.

What really sets it apart from any other game I have played is by far the story and the setting.\n\nMashing the concepts of the Grim Reaper fetching lost souls and the shady, urban lives of street gangs and mobs seems strange on paper, but is very nicely done in execution. As for the gameplay, while it is challenging at first it ends up feeling very thrilling and satisfying when you are able to do neat tricks and execute complex strategies. Whether you're stealthing through or going in guns blazing, DEADBOLT delivers a fun gameplay experience with challenging, varied enemies each with their own unique personality and spin in the hideouts they reside in.

But Deadbolt manages to remain it's own unique game and provide a massively enjoyable experience. \n\nPlaying as the Grim Reaper set in a modern time, you have been tasked to cleanse the city of the undead, who instead of being your typical cookie-cutter zombie horror things, the undead act more like underground gangs; Hanging in rundown hideouts, stashing and selling drugs and running questionable businesses. There are several missions taking you through 3 of these gangs of zombies, vampires and skeletons with each mission introducing new mechanics and enemy types to keep the experience fresh and fast-paced. \nThe controls are intuitive, easy to pick up, but tricky to master. Combined with the ever-expanding enemy variety and the fact that you die in one shot (but get infinite retries like Hotline Miami) make Deadbolt a challenging but fair game. Most deaths leave you with no doubt what you did wrong and how you can do better, so during your trial-and-errors the plan on how to beat the level gradually formulates itself inside your head. \n\nYou enter each level undetected by enemies, who mind their own business but ultimately catch on to your presence and start looking around. Enter the vents, which turns you into an undetectable cloud of smoke that can travel through a set series of pathways while still granting vision of the level, allowing you to monitor your foes and plot out your next course of action. Entering/exiting the vents however is not a guarantee get-out-of-jail-free-card. As there are a few precious moments before you enter the vent where an enemy can shoot you down, and some vents exit out of a high-up and out of reach area. So you can't just pop in, shoot, kill, pop-out. \nA problem with this and general world interaction is that there are some levels with cluttered interactive objects. Sometimes you'll find yourself interacting with the wrong item when you meant to enter a vent just because you were not standing in the exact right spot, which given the fast-paced nature of the game means you very well might get killed.\nOn the topic of vents: There is an uncommon but highly unfortunate glitch that may be encountered. You may attempt to enter a vent to safely escape enemy fire, and the game will visually show you that you have successfully entered the vent, however, despite all this you still managed to die. It makes no sense and is unfortunately frustrating. Why did it show that I clearly escaped and then still kill me? It's uncommon but unfortunate all the same.\n\nTo kill your enemies you have a good-sized variety of firearms, some of which you can start the level with or purchase from a shopkeeper as you progress through the game. The guns all have a very satisfying and loud punch to them, as well as their own individual effective ranges. As you aim further and further away from the Reaper the reticle expands, showing that the bullet spread makes the weapon more unreliable with an unmistakeable visual. This doesn't apply to all weapons, but the ones that are perfectly accurate are few and far between. \nKilling an undead is also very satisfying. Despite having 8-bit graphics they still implement ragdoll physics, so dead enemies fall and react in a realistic and gratifying fashion. \nHowever, the biggest complaint I have with Deadbolt is the limited AI of enemies. You fire off a few shots to eliminate a target but get the attention of some other enemies who were within earshot. You escape into the vents or move up/down a level in the building, and when they get there all they do is quickly and seemingly endlessly walk back and forth. I would have liked to see the enemies group up and start patrolling the entire area (in groups, not just run off individually like idiots and get picked off one by one with no fear of consequence). The AI can also be herded a little too easily, popping up and showing yourself in the stairs for a brief moment can cause them to follow you down, lining up for a quick and easy kill. \nThe AI isn't groundbreaking in any sense, and despite its flaws, it serves its purpose well enough. The game is already quite challenging as it stands. \n\nFor the asthetics: Deadbolt is littered with small and loving details showing that the developers really took their time and had a lot of passion for their work. The soundtrack is absolutely outstanding and I might just buy myself a copy to show my appreciation for it. \n\nThe simplicity of Deadbolt's set-up and it's steady challenge is quite simply endearing. I absolutely love this game and I definitely recommend it. If you liked Hotline Miami, stealth games or passionate indy games, Deadbolt will be right up your alley.", "timestamp_created": 1459649545, "timestamp_updated": 1460032456, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.556870", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22205432": {"recommendationid": "22205432", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134860308", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 764, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513073100}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is very good 11/10 love the art stile of the game and there are vampire chicks.", "timestamp_created": 1459630531, "timestamp_updated": 1459630531, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22204039": {"recommendationid": "22204039", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158189283", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2476, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492427288}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e00\u76f4\u90fd\u5bf9\u50cf\u7d20\u753b\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u611f\u5174\u8da3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8fd9\u79cd\u867d\u7136\u7c97\u7cd9\uff08\u6bd5\u7adf\u662f\u50cf\u7d20\u753b\uff09\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u628a\u753b\u9762\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u90e8\u5206\u7b80\u7ea6\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u8868\u8fbe\u51fa\u6765\uff0c\u5404\u79cd\u7ec6\u8282\u90fd\u663e\u5f97\u5341\u5206\u7ec6\u817b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u76f4\u662fhopoo games \u4f18\u79c0\u7684\u5730\u65b9\u3002\u7136\u540e\u9488\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e00\u4f5c\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bf4\u662f\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u8010\u73a9\uff0c\u96be\u5ea6\u4e5f\u628a\u63e1\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u597d\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6027\uff0c\u57fa\u672c\u9760\u80cc\u7248\u5c31\u80fd\u901a\u5173\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u8bf4\u5236\u4f5c\u65b9\u672c\u6765\u5c31\u6253\u7b97\u8ba9\u73a9\u5bb6\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\u53bb\u653b\u7565\uff0c\u4e5f\u4ee5\u6b64\u6765\u5ef6\u957f\u6e38\u620f\u5bff\u547d\uff0c\u53e6\u5916\u672c\u4f5c\u4e5f\u652f\u6301\u521b\u610f\u5de5\u574abtw\u3002\u5c5e\u4f73\u4f5c\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1459625630, "timestamp_updated": 1459625630, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22203478": {"recommendationid": "22203478", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157925952", "num_games_owned": 232, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 35, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459622458}, "language": "english", "review": "Horrible game compared to Gunpoint. \nThere's a million ways you'll die for some stupid reasons, listing a few:\n1.

The skill curve can be deep at first but once you get the hang of it youll be killing undead left and right. Honestly best gameplay Ive seen in years.\nStory\n-This part is weird becuase its almost like a noir mystery but even once you beat the game and find a secret there is still a lot of unanwsered questions.

I love the art and the gameplay mechanics. There is a lot of attention to detail here, from spent shell casings, to shooting through walls/floors/doors with a strong enough caliber, to splinters and debris from the surrounding environment, to destrubtible light sources, on and on... Very well done!\n\nFor me, the only thing that sometimes gets in the way are the aiming controls when changing levels.  The need for accuracy in getting clean headshots is welcome, but at times the point of aim can shift in ways that aren't anticipated immediately after transitioning to a different floor. I don't know what a solution to this may be or if it's even a problem at all... It's a minor nitpick that I'm growing accustomed to as I play the game more. \n\nIf anything, it helps me appreciate the \"simple\" controls of Hotline Miami and how it's top-down perspective allows it to streamline around an even tighter gameplay design. In contrast, the added verticality that Deadbolt introduces in being a fast-paced side-scroller makes lining up shots a teeny bit more involved.  But that's also what makes it so engrossing :)\n\nWell done Hopoo!", "timestamp_created": 1459375103, "timestamp_updated": 1459375103, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0,

You WILL die picking up weapons instead of closing doors because both actions are bound to the same button.

Deadbolt pulls it off, for sure. You have the tactical, wait-and-pounce feel of Gunpoint, but then sometimes you've got to get in there and mash in some faces like in Hotline Miami. It can be both frantic and tactical and the game is more than happy to move at your pace right up until you do something wrong and you end up trapped in a vent and have to face the music. Deadbolt makes you think and it makes you try different tactics. The controls are rather intuitive too, taking me only a few moments to really get into the swing of the game. Allowing you aim control with the mouse works well, and it allows you to do things like throw a hammer at a zombie who's sitting on a rooftop.\n\nIn short, it's a puzzle game with an opened way to complete your missions. There's usually no right or wrong answer, though I have found some missions to really only have one way to complete them. You'll get a few of those, but normally you have a few good choices of where to start.\n\nMy only gripe about the gameplay is that placement of objects and interactive items, such as cover and vents, can be marred when there is a gun sitting next to them. The cover and vent take priority in that case, so it seems there's no way to pick up that sawn-off shotgun if it falls next to air vent. But that's a minor gripe indeed which I can normally forgive because this game otherwise plays great and looks good while I'm playing it.\n\nI need a sense of style and cool to draw me into a game. Whether that's Hotline Miami's grindhouse 80's film style, or the humour of Stanley's Parable, I need a game to stand out before I make any other decision. And Deadbolt's style immediately jumped out at me. Because it's kinda crazy and weird.\n\nDeadbolt's weirdness doesn't come from a over-the-top, hyper violent antics and killing people while wearing a pig mask, nor does it have a deranged bunny(Lord) trying to take over what I believe to be England. Deadbolt goes after the dark, poetic feel like Edgar Allen Poe jumped in bed with Oldboy and then added a teaspoon of Ghost Rider for ribbing. Deadbolt has a trench-coat wearing, questionably moral hero who is, I'm sure, Death or some avatar of Death, and this is helped in due part with the characters.\n\nYou have a bunch of weird-ass characters like Charon selling you guns and Zombie drug-dealers trying to blow your bemasked head off. You have a fireplace whose fire talks to you and gives you missions often in poetic free-verse. The mobsters are all zombies and undead monsters, but sometimes those zombies like to wear gold chains or nice suits. You drive an oh-so-sexy 1934 LeBaron to your missions. Deadbolt makes you feel like you really are a contract killer going after the undead, which is so comic-booky and ironic it works. \n\nOf course, the art in this game, being a Hopoo game, is gorgeous. If you're not into pixel art, then there's not too much here for you; however, if you're like me and you enjoy pixel art, then Deadbolt has your back. Hopoo's style is always extremely detailed despite how far back the camera is. You can easily see minute details on characters like a set of buttons on your coat or undead's necktie done up in a windsor knot, and it all animates so very nicely.\n\nI think that Deadbolt can gladly call the Knock-Knock-You're-Dead genre, which I just made up, it's home and it can easily stand with the best of them. And better than that, it can stand out amongst those other games despite borrowing heavily from key components of Gunpoint, Hotline Miami and Not a Hero. With it's dark, slow, evil tone Deadbolt does something a little zany by going more serious.\n", "timestamp_created": 1459210623, "timestamp_updated": 1459210623, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22115171": {"recommendationid": "22115171", "author": {"steamid": "76561198169119291", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2598, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510091426}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 would reap again. but seriously really good, quick and challenging game.", "timestamp_created": 1459210579, "timestamp_updated": 1459210579, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22113174": {"recommendationid": "22113174", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162154457", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 890, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478805124}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome game!

That's really the main reason I have for not recommending this game. It's just frustratingly tedious.\n\nWhen I heard that there was a Gunpoint/Hotline Miami mashup, I thought that it would be perfect for me straight away. Turns out I was wrong.\n\nDeadbolt is exactly like I said above, essentially a side-scrolling Hotline Miami. It's a lot like Gunpoint too. 2D, side scrolling levels filled with all kinds of enemies that you can take out in different, creative ways. Sounds great. The gun fights are viscerally satisfying, as the game handles blood and dismemberment extremely well. I grabbed a high powered revolver near the beginning of the game and stuck with it throughout the game, blowing heads off and smearing blood all over walls in intense gunfights. The shooting mechanics are tight and responsive.\n\nThe game itself is short. I can imagine one would blitz through the entire thing if the later levels weren't tedious grinds. The levels themselves aren't very consistent. Some are really well designed, but then others end up just being a flat layout of a few rooms in a grid formation.\n\nAs for the actual story, it was interesting enough. You play as a reaper called Deadbolt as you investigate a gang called the \"Zombie Kingz\", and you find yourself wrapped in a city-wide operation between a load of other gangs.\n\nNow, onto the bad part.\n\nThe frustrating tediousness of Deadbolt is entirely due to its lack of checkpoints. You see, in Hotline Miami, the system was perfect. Each level was split into multiple parts filled with enemies, and once you finished one part, you'd hit a checkpoint and you'd be done with that part of the level, which meant you wouldn't spend too long on the same level. In Deadbolt, however, you get the entire level all at once, with no checkpoints. You die in one shot and have to take on everyone else in the level without taking any damage at all.\n\nThe tediousness comes from having to restart the level. In a game like this, you're meant to die many times and keep restarting and working out a routine. The routine is a small plan you form on how to take out each enemy in the most efficient way. You start the level thinking \"Knock on this door, shoot this guy at this time, then grab his gun and shoot this other guy, then close this door to avoid being shot and hide behind this cover at this exact moment to avoid another shot.\" The routine works, so you keep doing it every time as you begin to learn each enemy's mindset and they become predictable.\n\nThe problem is that Deadbolt will force you to keep killing the same enemies, again, and again, and again. Even if you've nailed it down the science, EVERY time you die, you'll have to kill them all again. Sure, it sounds simple enough, you just keep using the same routine and move onto the next group of enemies, but then you attack the next group of enemies, and they kill you instantly, and then suddenly you're back to the beginning again, killing the first group again.\n\nEventually, killing the same group of enemies in the same way again and again gets boring, after which you start to lose interest, and just wish they'd be dead already so you could move onto the fresh content and stop playing through the same part you've already played. The earlier levels of Deadbolt are alright, as they aren't so densely populated, but as you go on, you can spend a half hour killing the same group of enemies over and over, just to finish ONE level.\n\nThis tediousness pretty much killed the game for me, and left me wishing it would just end. I haven't even unlocked all the weapons, and I couldn't be bothered, because the last 4 hours I spent in this game were just mindnumbingly repetitive and boring.\n\nAlso, I should add that controls are little bit inconsistent. To swap weapons, you've gotta scroll up for your primary, but down for your secondary. But then when you're using a staircase, you press W to go up and W to go down. Just confused me a little bit at first.\n\nFor the smaller, earlier levels, this game really shines. Later on, it's just a pain in the ass. As much as I'd like to love Deadbolt, and as much as I'd love to put it in the same category as Superhot, Hotline Miami, Gunpoint and Mark of the Ninja, it just isn't fun to play.\n\nOh, I should also add that the soundtrack is really fuckin' good. Like, really good.

The story left me with one of those feelings you cant explain, but its good and left me wanting more, a lot more, and it really comes together at the end.

In a rather novel twist on gang life and the undead mythos, you play as a single entity to push the recently unliving to the afterlife, though there are greater things at play. It's quick action, so all your moves matter...which can be unfortunate in a lot of settings.\n\n[h1]Abstract - [/h1]\nAs said before, you play as a reaper. Just a reaper, not the Grim Reaper, just a reaper. That said, for a reaper, you're frail and easily outnumbered. Guns are your scythe and souls, your harvest. While the game is intensely challenging, a lot of it can be chalked up to AI acting weird, damage being inconsistent, and overall crappy placement of enemies when you get into the heat of things, leading to many a restart.\n\n[h1]Who you are - [/h1]\nA reaper that is guided by a strange flame and a lotta neat guns. Plus you have connections with Charon, which is pretty cool in its own right.\n\n[h1]What you do in game - [/h1]\nYou usher the undead willing to pass on back to the living by planting .32 calibre bullets right between their eyes or eyesockets. There's a story, but a lot of it is hidden behind RNG drops of \"cassettes\" that you may never actually totally acquire without grinding levels. You earn souls for completing levels and earning achievements, which help get some of the cooler toys that Charon offers in exchange. \n\n[h1]Gameplay - [/h1]\nHonestly? I have to say, the gameplay was less fun, more frustrating. The challenge is real, sure, but a lot of the time it was trying to get the right conditions. Sometimes a bullet doesn't instant kill something upon a headshot. Sometimes you die within the same frame of going into a vent. Sometimes enemy placement is different than the last time things went down. Sometimes enemies will hear you shoot the lightbulb in the floor below, and sometimes they won't. A lot of the game is summed up in \"Sometimes it happens\". It becomes muuuuuuuuch worse near the end of the game. The ending really does nothing and leaves one unsatisfied with the plot but satisfied that the game is finally over. It's a shame, since the people who have played this game said good things. I only found this to be \"Hotline Miami\" with a different theme; Story wasn't entirely apparent and required some hunting/grinding in certain situations, gunplay is amazing but the AI change behaviors inconsistently, music is pretty great. No trippy colors though.\n\nI recently started my foray into Hardmode, but I'm not really sure if I want to dive further into the game on a difficulty that'll most likely leave me saltier than brined shrimp.\n\n[h1]Envionment - [/h1]\nLike I said, the music is pretty great and the pixel art is impressive. The animations are fluid and well done, despite being pixel art. Even the housings were given a really nice \"decrepid\" look.

But after spending so much time playing through it I have finally decided on my review. It is absolutly wonderful. It has a few flaws that stand out but most can be overlooked.\n\nGameplay 8/10\nThe gameplay is really enjoyable. It is heavy on Hotline Miami style stealth where it isn't \"hide behind cover and sneak past enemy\" instead it is more of \"Shoot this enemy behind another from far enough away so he doesn't hear the gunshot\". For me most of the guns I didn't like too much except the lever Action Rifle in the Dredged stages, and the different types of revolvers. I prefered the melee weapons as they could be thrown with the exception of the sledgehammer and scythe. the scythe, once I bought it, was my personal favorite. Fast swing, high damage, good range all in one lethal weapon fitting of the Reaper. the only issue is some stages I don't know how you can complete without the scythe as a few involve either timers or needing to clear a large room very fast without letting anyone know you are in there.\n\nStory 7/10\nThe story isn't really the main focus, but I liked it. You play as the Reaper who is hired by a talking fireplace to do jobs after the undead take the world over. The Missions can be anything from gathering intel, killing a target or targets, to finding out where one of the Fireplaces Candle servants went missing. Plus you can find recording tapes after killing undead that can be listened to(they display text so more of reading) that give a little bit of insight to the undead's thoughts.\n\nMusic 10/10\nThe music is divine, truely and utterly divine. It is made by the same man who made the Risk of Rain OST, Chris Christodoulou and a few others I don't know. The music changes from stage to stage and each one fits well. The music ranges from Strong but quiet Electro-dance in the Vampire's nightclubs, Heavy rock and metal during the Demon mercenary's jobs, Multi-genre Soft smooth music that slowly ramps up but never gets too fast during the Zombie's drug hideouts, to powerful atmospheric music filled with tension during the magic obsessed Skeleton bases. Not to mention the final level, the last song is wonderful.\n\nArt: 8/10\nThe art isn't anything special as it is pixel graphics but it does really fit well. It has that kind of effect where after playing for a few hours you kind of forget it is even pixelated.\n\nFinal score 9/10\nA wonderous game with a really enjoyable challange, heavenly music by an amazing composer and great stage design plus a level editor for those who like to make their own.

It's cool, dark, and fun, and who doesn't like sending the undead back from whence they came as a grim reaper like character?\n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1458830918, "timestamp_updated": 1458830918, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22018862": {"recommendationid": "22018862", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017608538", "num_games_owned": 227, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 672, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458971243}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros:\n[list]\n[*] Challenging, yet rewarding\n[*] Fun, well executed gameplay \n[*] Shooting requires skill\n[*] Variety of weapons\n[*] Great soundtrack\n[/list]\nCons:\n[list]\n[*] Cover system feels a bit wonky\n[/list]\n[i] Verdict [/i]\n[b] 4/5 [/b]\nIf you liked Hotline Miami, this is right up your hairy ass.", "timestamp_created": 1458808140, "timestamp_updated": 1458826839, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.649763", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22018749": {"recommendationid": "22018749", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047660976", "num_games_owned": 376, "num_reviews": 73, "playtime_forever": 1116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488459310}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0414\u0438\u043a\u043e \u0421\u0442\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f!\n\u041d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043b\u0438\u0448\u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e , \u043d\u0438 \u043a\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0430.\n\u0411\u0435\u0437\u0443\u043c\u043d\u043e \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0430\u0440\u0442.\n\u0412\u043e\u0441\u0445\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430.\n\u041a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u043b \u0438 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u044e,\u0434\u0440\u0443\u0437\u044c\u044f\u043c \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0436\u0443.\n\u041e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0430\u0442\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0444\u0435\u043d\u0430.\n\n\u042d\u0442\u0430 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c \u043d\u0435 \u0442\u043e , \u0447\u0435\u043c \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f.\n\u0413\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u044b\u0439 \"\u0412\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043d\"", "timestamp_created": 1458807292, "timestamp_updated": 1507553726, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490424", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22014550": {"recommendationid": "22014550", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035586686", "num_games_owned": 199, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 942, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514174770}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought this game as soon as I saw it on steam I played the game before hand when it was unfinished and was hoping they would add this game to steam.

If you have a plan and a steady hand, you can beat any level without dying.\nI've heard it being compared to Gunpoint, which I played, and you can draw some obvious comparisons, such as the fact Deadbolt is 2D, ect, ect, but I wouldn't call it very Gunpoint-y, because you play the two games very differently, and they don't actually FEEL that similar.\nNot so sure about Hotline Miami, from what I've heard there's a live, die, repeat sort of feel to that game, and its the same with this game. But Gunpoint was really weird because I never actually got frustrated? I don't know why, I SHOULD have, purely because the amount of failures I had.\nThere is a plot, but you don't actually have to take note of it. I was having too much fun playing the levels, so I kind of whizzed through the plot, not because it's boring, but because reading the plot and piecing it together is entirely optional. From what I've heard, its got a pretty great plot too!\nAll in all, I'd say you might play through it once or twice, the second time on hard mode, which is about 8 hours of play, not including custom maps, or acheivement hunting.\nI enjoyed it. I'm not really a pro, but I think its quite nice that in Deadbolt, dying isn't actually an obstacle, just a learning experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah its good buy it.", "timestamp_created": 1458774049, "timestamp_updated": 1458774049, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503106", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22009350": {"recommendationid": "22009350", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133343586", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 374, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514798482}, "language": "english", "review": "great but difficult game and if you like hotline miami-like games you will LOVE this one", "timestamp_created": 1458759162, "timestamp_updated": 1458759162, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22008082": {"recommendationid": "22008082", "author": {"steamid": "76561198176507757", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 515, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462932891}, "language": "english", "review": "I R8 8/8 m8", "timestamp_created": 1458754974, "timestamp_updated": 1458754974, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22001842": {"recommendationid": "22001842", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119483550", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458831178}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best game on the market.\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1458737147, "timestamp_updated": 1458737147, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21997649": {"recommendationid": "21997649", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085558934", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 554, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 28, "last_played": 1516179302}, "language": "english", "review": "First off, some advice:\nSAVE UP FOR THE SCYTHE, IT COSTS 200 SOULS AND KICKS ASS!

Go with the 'silent assassin' technique, it feels badass to do it too heheh)\n-It's one of those games that's frustratingly hard, but in a good way (if that makes sense)\n-The game is kept fresh by constantly bringing in new content and enemies, with some very interesting ideas behind it.\n-A great 'weapons purchasing' system\n-An interesting storyline that proves voice acting for dialogue isn't always needed\n-Definite replayability value, for $10 it's totally worth it.\n-Custom levels, for those who want more!\n\nCons:\n-Haha, that's funny, really.

Add a thin story [enough to make interest and not bog you down.. GOOD THING!] Where you are a reaper for the God of Life. Nice chats by the fire with him, cause he's the freaking fire.\n\nZombies, vampire, then skeletons [a fourth type I won't mention]. Often combined. Every enemy is unique and you can't be too relaxed. One shot or hit and you are.... whatever the Reaper is when he gets poked? Anyway fast restarting [from the map you are on, few have more than one screen.] makes this less frustrating.\n\nGoodies: Multiple weapons you buy with souls. Many more to find in levels that are or are not buyable. \nHINT, to get your goodies go to your car trunk starting each level. You get one primary and a secondary.\n\nHighlights: Setting, gunplay, melee fun, enemies with phylacteries and Twins that are a vampire boss set in a level. One is the other phylactery so you have to quickly kill one then the other before revival. Each enemy is neat. Zombies without heads and can't see. But their head is chained to the ceiling or on a table. Figure it out from there. Each weapon is neat but I wish you could buy most that are unbuyable.\n\nDev, please add a few like the mines or whatever to buy from the docks!\n\nMore Highlights: #1 is the level editor. Developer, thanks, please help me find out how to make phylacteries for any enemy or expand it for stuff not done in game too please! Hard to learn the editor for being the best part.\n\nBad stuff: Rare enemies that just appear. In a one hit death game this is a mortal sin. Not common happening here but enough to think it was not tested at all or tested by unattached people. to the project IMO \n\nAlso the game really doesn't have much bad for it. If you are pushing against a wall and shoot you will shoot at or through the ground/floor [due to armor piercing in some guns] and make noise by accident. Little things really. Not terrible,\n\n*Fun* 10/10 -2 if impatient\n*Music* 8/10 +/- on your own opinion here\n*Gameplay* 10/10 : cover/limited ammo/guns in level/guns in trunk to start with/ amazing visual feedback to playing, with the walls spattering and the doors full of holes. Shells on the floor and bodies coming apart.\n*Graphics* are defining. Hard to score so I won't, just read Gameplay. Amazing graphical feedback to what happens.\n\nBEST: Enemies and level design, two here because they are almost married in perfection.\n\nWORST: Weapons. Many are too similar. Quite a few unique ones that give an advantage [the Scythe is great to move fast like a dodge while killing at the same time. IMO get this ASAP, no ammo needed] \n\nTo be fair though, bullets are bullets [though not all equal] and can kill lights, phylacteries [the out of reach ones], and enemies. More bullets is good even if the gun isn't amazing. Still, few memorable guns all of which are low capacity and no ammo for them to get almost ever, [2-4 levels at most depending.]\n\nBuy the game! If it's on discount especially absolutely get it and apologize for robbery and attempted murder on the developer[s].\n\n100% Rating IMO.", "timestamp_created": 1458551369, "timestamp_updated": 1458551697, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512781", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21960469": {"recommendationid": "21960469", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050040015", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 443, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498209427}, "language": "english", "review": "amazing", "timestamp_created": 1458548820, "timestamp_updated": 1458548820, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21960162": {"recommendationid": "21960162", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004065216", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459350922}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u597d\u6e38\u620f...BGM\u6ee1\u5206...\u53ef\u6f5c\u884c...\u53ef\u86ee\u5e72...\u7f3a\u70b9\u5c31\u662f\u6574\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u5b98\u65b9\u6d41\u7a0b\u592a\u77ed\u4e86...\u53ef\u4ee5\u8d2d\u4e70\u7684\u6b66\u5668\u4e5f\u7565\u5c11...", "timestamp_created": 1458546268, "timestamp_updated": 1458546268, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21959705": {"recommendationid": "21959705", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127294094", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 658, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506306252}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.\nGood mechanics.\nThought the game was over quickly at the end of the first level tree, then more trees appeared.\n\nWould love to see DLC/extra level packs.\n\n8/10.", "timestamp_created": 1458542602, "timestamp_updated": 1458542602, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21958853": {"recommendationid": "21958853", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056071497", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 969, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497211941}, "language": "english", "review": "Had to Alt-Enter to fix some of the user interface problems I was having but this game.

Worth buying the whole game just for that.\n\nThe bad:\n\n- While most levels allow a wide variety of approaches, a couple of them fall short. In particular, one of the levels has a time limit, and another one can't be beaten with just melee. Both occur about halfway through the game, and thankfully it gets better afterward. Hint: in the timed level you can just wait in the vents until the time runs out.\n- Buying weapons isn't very useful. You'll only get enough money in the entire game to buy two or three good weapons, and some of the coolest ones can't be bought at all, you can only use them in a couple levels where they spawn.\n- Stairway camping is a bit OP. You can quickly aggro some enemies, slip through a stairway, and pick them off with melee as they emerge one by one. Maybe the devs should make it slower, IMO it should be at least as slow as moving through vents.\n- Apparently thrown melee weapons were OP, and the devs fixed it by not allowing you to retrieve them. If you have a knife, you can only throw it once. It's not gamebreaking but it's a bit weird.\n\nOverall, many cheers to Hopoo for making another amazing game! Though the story campaign was quite substantial and challenging, now it feels to me like it's only an introduction to the game's palette. There's even more fun to be had in hard mode and in user-made levels, so that's where I'm heading next :-)", "timestamp_created": 1458507463, "timestamp_updated": 1458507463, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21950250": {"recommendationid": "21950250", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010570315", "num_games_owned": 345, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 839, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461155458}, "language": "english", "review": "Lots of fun.\nit reminds me of Hotline Miami but with a side-scroller twist to it.\n\n10/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1458496920, "timestamp_updated": 1458496920, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21950143": {"recommendationid": "21950143", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148980748", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 793, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487548294}, "language": "english", "review": "So much fun.

developer's other game, and know that they can put out something truly incredible. The atmosphere is flawless, setting its own universe into stone using snippets and pieces of imagery, and the art design is just grim enough to set the mood without taking itself overly seriously. The gameplay is somewhere in-between Hotline Miami and Gunpoint, as many others have said, but I can see obvious influences from Risk of Rain. Every hit feels satisfying. Every win feels earned and yet barely earned. Every loss is crushing. It's clear that, after only two games, this team has got its style down, and the game design is so well-crafted that it never left me wondering, \"Why did they put that there?\"\n\nThe story had me hooked all the way through, and although I yearn for a bit more of it, what's there already wraps up extremely well. I didn't want to kill the final boss, but he certainly wanted to kill me. I'm reminded of Providence, the Bulwark of the Weak. Hopoo certainly knows how to make a player feel conflicted...\n\nAll of this is wrapped together like an undead Christmas present with Chris Christodoulou's incredible soundtrack. He blew me away with Risk of Rain and he's done it again. I'll be listening to these tracks for a long, long time coming. Too tired right now to state just how fucking awesome this OST is- just finished the game!- but all I can say is, listening to this is most of what kept me from alt+tabbing away from the game for 5 hours straight.\n\nLast thing: it's pretty hard.

Path of Exile cribs its gameplay style from Diablo, the granddaddy of all action RPGs. Darksiders cribs its gameplay style from games like Zelda, God of War, and at one point it outright steals the gun from Portal. Deadbolt cribs elements from Hotline Miami (kill-them-all systematic clearing of every room in a given building), Gunpoint (one level is literally a level full of traps hooked up to light switches, and the pixellated art style is what Tom Francis, the developer of Gunpoint, would have gone with if he listened to nothing but bands from Metropolis Records), and Hitman (differing approaches to the same problem of killing all dudes, depending on how suave or murderous you want to be).\n\nThe first thing I noticed about Deadbolt was that it doesn't have that many reviews, and that's weird, especially since the reviewers treated Risk of Rain with 8/10 praise. I thought Risk of Rain was pretty cool - a 'single-player MOBA-style RPG', I called it. It was damn fun, so why isn't the followup game getting much press? I don't have any idea why.\n\nThe second thing I noticed is that Deadbolt is definitely Hopoo Games' sophomore slump. While the visual design and layout of the game is pretty distinctive, the mechanics are less so. There's all sorts of mechanical design flaws - for instance, if you need to turn off the lights and there's a gun in front of that switch, then God help you. Same goes for weapons you've dropped on top of each other. The way the game does AI, gunshots, detection means there's always an element of uncertainty to everything - sometimes a good plan falls apart due to whatever RNG forces inhabit the world of the dead. There was one particular level where I had only 60 seconds to complete an objective, and going back to change my guns didn't pause the game, and I didn't realize that up until I was about to complete the objective. Then the game said HAHA NOPE, NEXT TIME CHOOSE FASTER, SKULLBOY and made me do the mission over again.\n\nDid I mention there's barely any checkpoints in this game? So if you finish a level and reinforcements get called in, and you get shot to bits trying to sneak past said reinforcements to your car, you gotta DO THE WHOLE THING OVER AGAIN. This game can be extremely challenging, but sometimes it can just be an unreasonable prick when it comes to spotty little things.\n\nBut Deadbolt itself kept reminding me of other games to a fault. A lot of the missions are in the Hotline Miami-style vein of killing them all, but it intentionally made me focus on single rooms rather than just whirling around in ice-cold violence just straight up murdering dudes. It's like Gunpoint, except the puzzles involve tricking the skeleton to come downstairs so you can pop him in the back of the head with your Derringer. It's like Hitman with its boss missions, except the puzzles aren't as well thought out (except for the one with all the traps, that's my favorite one). It mashes and tries all these combinations with these games I recognize but it doesn't really come into its own, I feel. You can't have Hotline Miami and Gunpoint, those two have completely different styles of play. Same with Hotline Miami and Hitman. \n\nDeadbolt doesn't really come into its own and that's kind of disappointing. I definitely would have enjoyed it a little more if the mechanics and storytelling were refined a bit more. It's still a solid tactical shooter and if you're into this sort of thing where you bang your head against a level until it clears, it won't steer you wrong for five hours.", "timestamp_created": 1458449347, "timestamp_updated": 1458449347, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.646044", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21937265": {"recommendationid": "21937265", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980497474", "num_games_owned": 196, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 414, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496969708}, "language": "english", "review": "Buy it for the music.

THAT IS WHY YOU DONT USE THE SAME BUTTON FOR THIS MANY FUNCTIONS! how do you make a game with no controller support while not using any more then 5 keys at most, hell i  can fix a huge problem right now, MAKE W ACTIVATE COVER! doorways are never near cover, nor are stares and getting down is more a movement then any form of interatction so that solves half my issues, guns and doors are still a hell combo but at least the cover is fixed.\n\n2, \"take breaks\" is the games way of offhand dismissing angry players as, \"playing wrong\" when the game fails to function as in puppy guarding undead and half the time the AI will get hung up on doors just like Hotline miami and  you will die because it will at any second snap into kill mode or better yet later there are hidden undead so good luck finishing a map before the game asks you not to get mad, ill never understand why it tells you to give up after only 3 attempts when you respawn soo fast. \n\n3, playing old levels gets you nothing even if you max out the score so playing old levels is useless. \n\nstory has its moments, reading the thoughts of the undead is depressing and cool, getting it all right is awesome but most of the time the game is out to screw with you, jobs go wrong and the restart gets painfull when you finish a hard part, kill the backup and you read \"return to your car\" only to get shot by more backup off screen as you aproach the car. im not having fun, trying and failing because of glitches, lies and sucker punches dont get covered up because you respawn instantly. if anything it ruins the game when you destroy soo much of a players work over something soo petty and cheap.\n\nCounting the deaths and not explaining what the stars are tied to pisses me off, for all i know i should restart the entire job not just respawn because i cant tell if deaths takes away stars. just lazy, i shouldnt be guessing any of this crap and deaths shouldnt ever be counted in this kind of game.

A lot of people have compared it to Hotline Miami and I would mostly agree with that.\n\nYou play as Death as you are trying to usher the souls of zombies into the underworld. Of course, the best way to do this is with your handy six shooter. You go through levels that are designed to look like homes and kill every zombie in the area using your starting weapons and whatever you can find in there.\n\n\"But,\" you might say \"that doesn't sound very stealthy\". Well shut up, I'm not done yet. Death can infiltrate these buidlings by slinking through air vents to get the jump on your enemies. That, in tandom with the fact that enemies can hear what is going on, makes it important to remain unseen so that you arn't overwhelmed by enemies.\n\nTo add more options, you can also buy starting weapons, allowing you to enter levels with different weapons. These range from a piddly 9mm to an automatic shotgun, to (my favourite) a good old knife.\n\nThis all culminates to make a fairly fast paced and quite fun game. Now, there are a few issues I can see. The A.I. is rather predictable. They will wait a second and then come check on you, meaning that you can easily build ambushs.

If you liked Gunpoint, NOT A HERO, or Hotline Miami, then you'll love this.\n\nThe game, for what it is, looks great. The animations are great and smooth. The gameplay works very well; the gunplay is fun and the cover system is similar but not identical to NOT A HERO. The story [which I have not fully completed yet] is similar in depth to Hotline Miami, and the missions progess it well. The sound effects and music are also really well done, and pair nicely with the graphics in creating a cool atmosphere. One particular mission, which is set at a nightclub, is particularly well done and has the badass-ness of John Wick in The Red Circle.\n\nOne thing I will say is that the game is challenging and unforgiving, which I see as a plus but casual players may find frustrating. You will die, and it will start the whole level again. In this regard it is very similar to Hotline Miami, and may leave you raging after you make a stupid mistake during a good run through a level. However, as much as you'll rage, you'll want to come back and complete that mission. \"If I can just kill that guy first/If I can just lure that guy to the next floor/If I can just shoot that prick at just the right angle to blow his head off then I can do this!\".\n\nOverall, I heartily recommend this game. It's not expensive (\u00a36.99 is a fair price, for sure), and it will give you a lot of enjoyment. Trying to perfect a mission will add to the replayability, as will purchasing different weapons to try a run-through with a different tac.

On y incarne rien de moins que la mort elle-m\u00eame et on va avoir du travail! Il va falloir accomplir plusieurs missions plus ou moins vari\u00e9es dans lesquelles on devra analyser des niveaux et ensuite aller remplir les objectifs pr\u00e9vus en essayant de ne pas se faire rep\u00e9rer. M\u00eame si l'on jour la mort, un seul coup suffit \u00e0 nous faire perdre le niveau, il faudra donc bien faire attention.\n\nLe jeu est assez \u00e9loign\u00e9 de Risk of Rain dans son cheminement, il faudra faire preuve de finesse et de tactique pour parvenir \u00e0 terminer les diff\u00e9rentes missions. On a la possibilit\u00e9 d'utiliser des armes achet\u00e9es ou obtenues dans les niveaux pour \u00e9liminer les diff\u00e9rents adversaires qui s'y trouvent. Les ennemis sont vari\u00e9s et les situations int\u00e9ressantes m\u00eame si on peut regretter le manque singulier d'histoire malgr\u00e9 un univers original et une ambiance au top.\n\nDEADBOLT reprend la patte artistique du studio avec une r\u00e9alisation sobre mais l\u00e9ch\u00e9e et surtout une bande son \u00e0 tomber! Je vous conseille tr\u00e8s fortement l'achat de la dite OST tant elle est excellente et colle \u00e0 l'univers du jeu. Le jeu ne n\u00e9cessitera pas une machine de guerre pour tourner et il se contr\u00f4le plut\u00f4t bien malgr\u00e9 quelques touches pas toujours pratique \u00e0 utiliser dans le feu de l'action comme la touche W par d\u00e9faut qui vous permettra de monter ou descendre les escaliers.\n\nOn commencera donc les niveaux \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur et il faudra analyser les situations et tenter diff\u00e9rentes approches arriver au bout avec un maximum d'\u00e9toiles (5 si on r\u00e9ussi parfaitement le niveau). On aura le choix des armes d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but du niveau en fonction de nos achats sur les docks gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 un vendeur que l'on doit payer en \u00e2mes obtenues en terminant les missions. On a le choix entre des armes \u00e0 feu et des armes blanches et autres marteaux sachant qu'il est possible de lancer les couteaux sur les ennemis pour les tuer. Il est \u00e9galement possible de se cacher derri\u00e8re des \u00e9l\u00e9ments du d\u00e9cor ou de taper \u00e0 la porte pour attirer l'attention d'un groupe d'ennemis. Le jeu est \u00e9galement int\u00e9ressant avec son utilisation de la lumi\u00e8re, on peut ainsi pr\u00e9parer de jolis pi\u00e8ges bien sournois!\n\nM\u00e9caniquement le jeu est int\u00e9ressant, on doit viser avec la souris et se d\u00e9placer avec les touches du clavier dans des niveaux en 2D. Le r\u00e9ticule de la souris vous montrera la zone d'impact de votre arme en grossissant ou en se r\u00e9duisant. Il faudra bien viser pour tuer en un adversaire standard en un coup car les munitions sont limit\u00e9es et il faudra se d\u00e9brouiller pour aller en chercher d'autres sur les cadavres ou dans les niveaux. Le jeu nous permet surtout de jouer en fourbe gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la possibilit\u00e9 de notre h\u00e9ros de se transformer en fum\u00e9e pour passer dans les conduits ou en passant directement par les \u00e9gouts pour arriver par les toilettes et \u00e9liminer un adversaire fa\u00e7on Street Trash.\n\nLe jeu est plut\u00f4t difficile de prime abord mais il est rarement frustrant car on trouve toujours un moyen pour parvenir \u00e0 terminer les niveaux. Une fois le jeu termin\u00e9, c'est l\u00e0 que l'on d\u00e9couvre la vraie difficult\u00e9 avec le mode New Game+ impitoyable! La dur\u00e9e de vie est excellente avec de nombreuses heures n\u00e9cessaires pour d\u00e9bloquer un maximum de niveaux et d'achievements. DEADBOLT supporte le Steam Cloud ainsi que les cartes \u00e0 \u00e9changer Steam. Il permet \u00e9galement de cr\u00e9er ses propres niveaux ce qui devrait permettre de lui octroyer une dur\u00e9e de vie impressionnante une fois les outils maitris\u00e9s par la communaut\u00e9.\n\nDEADBOLT est une exp\u00e9rience singuli\u00e8re qui privil\u00e9gie \u00e0 la fois l'infiltration et la planification des missions. Les r\u00e9flexes sont toujours n\u00e9cessaires pour bien viser et \u00e9viter certaines situations difficiles mais on est loin du successeur spirituel de Risk of Rain et c'est tant mieux. Il est assez difficile de ne pas tomber sous le charme du jeu une fois les premi\u00e8res missions effectu\u00e9es, on essaye de r\u00e9aliser le meilleur score possible pour obtenir le plus grand nombre d'\u00e9toiles et ainsi pouvoir d\u00e9bloquer des \u00e2mes.", "timestamp_created": 1458253046, "timestamp_updated": 1458253046, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.716721", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21893516": {"recommendationid": "21893516", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017086103", "num_games_owned": 441, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 284, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458366044}, "language": "english", "review": "I have mixed feelings about this game.

enjoyed hotline miami, get this. This review will focus on those who haven't played hotline.[/b]\n\nThe gameplay of this game usually involves killing all the enemies in a level, possibly performing a task of some sort, then exiting the level to start the next. The gameplay involves maneuvering around the environment, and killing enemies with guns or melee weapons.You must do all this without being hit a single time, as you can only be hit once before dying and restarting the level. The combat itself is satisfying, each gun has little details that set them apart, as do all the melee weapons. Headshots are satisfying.\n\nThere is a good mix of strategy and reaction based gameplay. The game lets you look around the level at the beginning, and take in all the details, such as enemy placements and weapon locations, Then you can build up a strategy from there, separate this enemy from the rest, kill him, take their weapon, turn off the lights so enemies can't see you as well, then lure them in the room and take them out one by one. Watching your plans pan out like this is satisfying, and watching the last enemy fall to the ground gives you a sense of accomplishment.\n\nBut improvising and rushing right in is still very much a viable option, You will die much more, but you'll see yourself learning more and more what to do in what order, gradually inching towards success. Keep in mind these are two extremes, your actual gameplay will definitely involve a mix of both. Sometimes your plan goes wrong, and being able to get yourself out of a sticky situation fast is again, satisfying. Sometimes things won't go as you wish, and an enemy might suddenly jump in, and it's up to you to quickly deal with the situation.\n\nLevels in this game are varied, and each one is different in several ways (Except at the start of the game, which is understandable because you are still learning how to play). The game frequently makes use of special \"pipes\" which are ventilation systems/ water pipes within housing that you can use to rapidly move around a level, and it allows the player to tackle a level from many different points. some may opt to use the front door, others may go around back, go on the roof, or go right in the middle of a room and drop on an enemy. There is one level which almost entirely makes use of traps, and while it plays very differently to the rest of the game, it is definitely an interesting level, and is a welcome \"break\" to the regular gameplay. The levels are all set in quite varied locations, from regular housing, nightcluibs, drug labs, and car shops. and each level will look unique and interesting. Enemy placements is usually pretty fair, the game mostly lets you deal with tougher enemies comfortably one on one in the beginning, but later on makes it so that you need to start thinking about engagements. Like separating enemies so you can fight more easily, and conserving ammo so you can deal with stronger enemies.\n\nThere is one level, however, which i feel was absolutely terrible, and has very little place in game. It involves a time limit, and has some unfair enemy placement. With 2 strong enemies, and engaging them causes several other enemies to aggro and come as well in a few seconds. and unfortunately, the only reason i could get through it was because i used a purchasable weapon, the scythe. A player may not be able to access this, due to spending their money on other weapons, so this level is pretty bad, hopefully the developer can tone that down.\n\nSpeaking of enemies, there is a good variety. You get your basic grunts who use guns, or a melee weapon, and you get some with gimmicks. For example, there is a certain type of zombie, whose body and corpse are separated, and both are connected, meaning if you shoot the head, the body will also die. There are 4 different main \"races\" of enemies in this game, and each of them have their own type of weaponry, and gimmicks that set them apart(except for zombies, who are pretty standard). \n\nI won't delve too much into graphics, i think they look really fantastic, and their is a very high quality throughout the entire game. If you like what you see in the screenshots/trailer, you'll like it in the game.\n\nThe plot of the game is pretty simple. You're the reaper, and you kill the undead for your job. However, the game does have some deeper stuff hidden away. If you know how Dark Souls' story/lore was, deadbolt is pretty similar. It mostly just gives you questions to think about (Like Risk of Rain, by the developer of this game). The plot is there if you're interested in it, and you can easily ignore it, so it's like an \"opt in\"  system in that regard. That being said, it isn't executed very well, cause there are only a few characters in game that i want to know about ,but there isn't much to learn about them...\n\nThe soundtrack of this game is fantastic, as is the sound design. I especially like the diagetic music. If your outside of the buildings, the music will be \"muffled\", but if you're inside, you'll hear it proper. \n\nThis game would be pretty suitable for both casual and hardcore players. Playing it once will definitely get you your money's worth, especially if you buy this on sale. For hardcore players, there is hardmode which is unlocked by completing the game once, and some hard achievements, like Beating a new game entirely within 1 hour, or beating a new game without dying a single time. It took me around 16 hours to beat the game on both normal and hard.\n\nHard mode, as i mentioned, allows you to replay the game making it more difficult. It alters enemy placements, so levels will usually  be much more complicated. During hard mode, the game forces you to play smart, so rushing in is no longer viable. Ammunition must be managed well, as due to the increased amount of enemies, you'll need more ammo to deal with situations. As well as forcing you to melee to conserve the ammunition. I think a little bit of dialogue is also changed in hard mode, but i haven't logged any of it, so hard to say how much has changed. Other than that, \"hard mode\" is indeed hard.\n\nThere's also a level editor, so you can expect some more conent from the community. But this largely depends on the popularity of the game, so maybe you should contribute some stuff if you decide to buy.\n\nThere are issues, however. Sometimes you'll have weapons drop right next to a door or vent, so you have to inch towards guns very slowly, accidentaly enter a vent, or open doors you weren't supposed to, when you were trying to pick up a gun. the game needs to refine in this case.\n\nI played through the game with a keyboard, so i cannot comment on using controllers yet. I also played a decent amount of hotline miami, hence me finishing the game fairly quick.\n\n[list]\n [*] Gameplay is good, both tactical and reaction based.\n [*] Levels are all varied and interesting, only a few bad ones.\n [*] Enemies are all different, and each of them have good gimmicks and designs\n [*] Graphics are good imo, soundtracck is also great\n [*] Good for both casual and hardcore players\n [*] Sometimes guns can drop in places that can screw up the controls.\n[/list]\n\nI will update this review as i play more, do more playthroughs, and see what i think then. I'll also give the level editor a shot and see if it's bad/good.", "timestamp_created": 1458230270, "timestamp_updated": 1458404132, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.660788", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21887812": {"recommendationid": "21887812", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049171527", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 228, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492274272}, "language": "german", "review": "Hey people,\n\nif you like to reap some souls on a daily basis, I totally recommend this game for you!

To keep this review short, until the game is patched for this, or the Engine (Game Maker Studio) releases a hotfix for this issue as it happens across other games, Such as [b] Undertale, Risk of Rain, and Nuclear Throne [/b], I cannot recommend this game. \nWord to the wise; If you can run any of the listed games above, or any other Game Maker Studio titles (with few exceptions such as Hotline Miami and Gunpoint), you'll be able to run this game. If those games crash on startup, I'd best avoid this title for now.\n\n[u][b]Edit ('16-03-19) [/b][/u]\nThis doesn't pertain to everyone. To some people, this applies, and to others this doesn't. I can't guarantee that this game will crash for everyone, and I can't say that everyone will be able to play without a hitch.

Being a hitman in the underworld is coolio, and the pixel art style really adds to the charm. It could have been fleshed out some, maybe have other friendlies you could meet and chat with besides your weapons dealer and your boss. So it's style over substance here, but for a quick little action game I'd err on the side of style too.\n\n[b]Music[/b]\nThe music is pretty damn good. Most of it is some play on the same theme, but it's a damn good theme that fits the game's setting perfectly. I listened to the album on bandcamp and some of the songs are still stuck in my head.\n\n[h1]Slightly Amiss[/h1]\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nSo it basically boils down to alerting as few enemies as possible, and flitting around the vents to pick off stragglers before you set off any large alert chains. That's pretty satisfying overall but there are a few nagging issues.\n\n1. E does it all\nThe E key is used to swap weapons, enter vents, take cover, open doors, and interact with other environment bits like light switches. This basically means that if any of those things overlap physically (and they will) the wrong thing is likely to happen. This is especially frustrating when you're on the run- picking up a weapon instead of closing a door or entering a vent killed me many, many times. Having to inch up to highlight the right item also breaks up the game flow even if you're not in danger.\n\n2.Cover is wonky\nThe cover system is just not what it needs to be in an action game like this. The side you hide behind is decided by what half of the thing you're on, so if you misjudge you'll be taking cover with your back towards the enemy. The cover objects are drawn at an angle so it's an easy mistake to make sometimes.\n\n3.Enemy AI\nAt best the AI is expoitable, and at worst it's erratic. If you sound the alert and disappear down the stairs, the enemies will file down one by one for you to kill at your leisure. This isn't super satisfying but since it's sometimes difficult to lumber to some cover in time, the game kind of forces your hand. Other times if you alert a pack of enemies and they lose sight of you, they'll walk back and forth endlessly in one spot. This behavior makes it impossible to re-engage in any stylish way, you simply have to come back with enough bullets to gun the crowd down.\n\n[b]Missed Potential[/b]\nThis one is kind of nit picky, and for $9.99 it's a non-issue. The game has the feel of a Hotline Miami mixed with Gunpoint. The Gunpoint bits it got right, flitting around the vents and taking out single targets without being seen feels good and works well. Once you have to alert more than a few enemies the Hotline Miami bits *should* kick in, where you stylishly slaughter the group with skill rather than tact. But that's when the clunky controls really show themselves, and the lack of combat options becomes apparent. There's no movement ability to get you to cover faster. There's nothing to do with an empty gun but look for something else to replace it. Once a group is alerted there's no real option to outplay the AI, you just have to have the bullet count to take them all out.\n\nNot to mention you're the REAPER. You should be gaining abilities over the course of the game, like death stares or turning into invulnerable smoke temporarily or possessing enemies or wall-phasing or whatever else sounds cool. You're not a human in this game but they take advantage of it with vent travel *only*. If not through magic abilities, you should be getting new toys to deal with enemies as the game goes on. Remote explosives you can put on doors, noisemakers that could attract enemies, sleeping darts, what have you. There's enough to cover the game for it's length, but I have no desire to play it again because all that's left to unlock is other guns.\n\n[h1]Pretty Gud[/h1]\nSo yeah it could be better, but the game oozes style and I had a good time. Maybe the next one will iron out the control kinks, flesh out the gameplay and the setting and become a real cult classic.", "timestamp_created": 1458175113, "timestamp_updated": 1458175248, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541395", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21878814": {"recommendationid": "21878814", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099183674", "num_games_owned": 540, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496038889}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u6b3e\u6f5c\u5165\u7c7b\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u4e00\u822c\u90fd\u5305\u542b\u4e86\u534e\u4e3d\u4e3d\u7684\u6f5c\u5165\u53ca\u4e0d\u8981\u547d\u7684\u7a81\u7a81\u7a81\u3002\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u7684bgm\u6709\u70b9Hotline Miami\u7684\u611f\u89c9\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4e3b\u89d2\u7684\u8fd1\u6218\u80fd\u529b\u6ca1\u6709Miami\u90a3\u51e0\u7237\u5b50\u5389\u5bb3\uff0c\u6361\u4e2a\u9910\u5200\u8981\u6233\u6233\u6233\u51e0\u4e0b\u624d\u80fd\u6740\u6b7b\u654c\u4eba\uff0c\u8d64\u624b\u7a7a\u62f3\u66f4\u662f\u8981\u6253\u5f88\u591a\u4e0b\u624d\u80fd\u6253\u6b7b\u654c\u4eba\uff0c\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\u4e0d\u4f1a\u6709\u8fd1\u6218\u6b63\u9762\u521a\u654c\u4eba\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u51fa\u73b0\u3002\n\u76ee\u524d\u9047\u5230\u7684\u654c\u4eba\u6709\u8fd9\u4e48\u51e0\u79cd\uff1a\u521d\u7ea7\u7684\u62ff\u67aa\u654c\u4eba\uff0c\u8840\u539a\u7684\u62ff\u67aa\u80d6\u5b50\u654c\u4eba\uff08\u6253\u5934\u6700\u5c11\u8981\u4e09\u67aa\uff09\uff0c\u8fd8\u6709\u8eab\u9996\u5f02\u5904\u7684\u62ff\u67aa\u654c\u4eba\uff08\u6253\u8eab\u5b50\u5f88\u8d39\u5b50\u5f39\uff0c\u6253\u5934\u5c31\u80fd\u4e00\u51fb\u79d2\uff09\uff0c\u8fd8\u6709\u5438\u8840\u9b3c\u4e00\u6837\u7684\uff08\u6709\u65f6\u5019\u662f\u5012\u6302\u5728\u5929\u82b1\u677f\u4e0a\uff09\u7626\u9ad8\u62ff\u67aa\u654c\u4eba\uff08\u80fd\u591f\u7206\u5934\u79d2\u6740\uff09\uff0c\u8fd8\u6709\u50cf\u591c\u603b\u4f1a\u821e\u5973\u7684\u53cc\u5200\u5c0f\u59b9\uff0c\u661f\u5149\u5927\u9053\u963f\u5b9d\u9020\u578b\u7684\u8fd1\u6218\u654c\u4eba\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u67d0\u4e9b\u5173\u5361\u51fa\u73b0\u7684boss\n\u573a\u666f\u5185\u7684\u53ef\u4e92\u52a8\u5143\u7d20\u4e5f\u633a\u591a\u7684\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6572\u95e8\u5f15\u51fa\u654c\u4eba\uff0c\u6709\u65f6\u5019\u5f00\u95e8\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u9501\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u8001\u6eda\u8f90\u5c04\u7684\u5f00\u9501\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u5f00\u9501\uff08\u4f60\u4eec\u81ea\u5df1\u8bd5\u8bd5\u5427\uff0c\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e0d\u6e05=\u3002=\uff09\uff0c\u623f\u95f4\u7684\u684c\u5b50\uff0c\u6c99\u53d1\uff0c\u51b0\u7bb1\u90fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f53\u505a\u63a9\u4f53\uff0c\u706f\u6709\u5f00\u5173\uff0c\u6709\u4e9b\u706f\u662f\u654c\u4eba\u5934\u505a\u7684\uff0c\u88ab\u7167\u5230\u4e86\uff0c\u5c31\u4f1a\u5f15\u53d1\u5176\u4ed6\u654c\u4eba\u8b66\u89c9\u3002\u5f53\u7136\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u7279\u8272\u662f\u4e3b\u89d2\u80fd\u4efb\u610f\u7a7f\u68ad\u4e8e\u5404\u79cd\u4e0b\u6c34\u9053\uff0c\u901a\u98ce\u53e3\uff0c\u6d74\u7f38\uff0c\u9a6c\u6876\u3002\u3002\u3002\u3002\u80fd\u591f\u7ed9\u654c\u4eba\u51fa\u5176\u4e0d\u610f\uff0c\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u628a\u81ea\u5df1\u7f6e\u8eab\u4e8e\u4f5c\u6b7b\u4e4b\u5730\u3002\n\u73a9\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u8fd8\u662f\u5f97\u9700\u8981\u52fe\u5f15\u90e8\u5206\u654c\u4eba\u51fa\u6765\uff0c\u5404\u4e2a\u51fb\u7834\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u6709\u5927\u795e\u80fd\u884c\u4e91\u6d41\u6c34\u901a\u5173\uff0c\u6b22\u8fce\u6307\u6559\u3002\n\u6069\u3002\u3002\u8fd8\u6ca1\u6709\u901a\u5173\uff0c\u5148\u5199\u4e2a\u611f\u60f3\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u80fd\u6709\u66f4\u591a\u73a9\u5bb6\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u5427\uff0c\u633a\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1458174748, "timestamp_updated": 1458174748, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.677124", "comment_count": "31", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21878743": {"recommendationid": "21878743", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036480269", "num_games_owned": 745, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 32, "last_played": 1515953417}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is the sort of game where after figuring out the solution to a level, you then have to try and execute it.

The gore looks fantastic in every level, and only in the end game missions did it begin to bug in the slightest.\n\nThere weren't too many crashes, only two happening in my entire time with the game so far. \n\nPacing of the levels, as I said before, was fantastic in the first and third chapters, and got a little rough in chapter 2.\n\nMusic was amazing, and better than Risk of Rain's in my opinion.\n\nGame was fairly short, though, only taking 5 hours for the full game, but hard mode is proving to be an incredible challenge.\n\n\nTL;DR- Game is $10. 5 Hours of gameplay. Even more on hard mode. Fantastic visuals and music.

People are simply comparing the two because of the blood and difficulty. If you want Hotline Miami gameplay, play Hotline Miami.\nMy view of the game may be skewed a little because Risk of Rain is one of my favorite games of all time, but I can't help that.\nDeadbolt is a very challenging game, but it is very easy to learn. That is one of the most frustrating parts about it: you know how to play it, but you keep dying. This is the type of game that you will rage quit and come back after a half hour to try again. The gameplay is 2d stealth, like Gunpoint. But again, this game is NOT Gunpoint. \nThe art style is distinctively Hopoo, and the character sprites along with the warm lighting and \"rustic city\" atmosphere almost reminds me of Dishonored without the steampunk. While a lot of the art in Risk of Rain focused on stressing the fact that you are very small and very alone, Deadbolt keeps things closer, with focus on you and the nearby rooms.\nThe music, like Risk of Rain, is very beautiful and fits the game perfectly. Some of the songs even sound familiar to Risk of Rain, which I sort of enjoyed.\nOverall, while I haven't even beaten the game yet, I enjoy this game immensely. I'm not sure how replayable the main story will be, but the Steam Workshop will probably fix that if it isn't.

the genre.  The combination of the setting and gameplay make this game very enjoyable.\n\nThere are two modes, story and custom.  In story mode you play various set missions, there isn't much replayability in this mode.  You can replay missions to earn a 5 star rating and that's about it.  You also earn souls for completing missions and achievements, you can use souls to buy weapons such as shotguns, smgs, silenced weapons, melee weapons, and grenades.  In custom mode you can download and play user-made maps, this is where the replayabillty comes in.  You can also make your own maps and let others play them as well.\n\nFor gameplay mechanics, when using a gun there is a reticle on-screen and you manually move it to aim and shoot the enemies, so some skill is needed to pull off headshots consistently.  You have melee weapons such as the knife and hammer, pretty self explanatory, you go up to the enemies and stab/bash them to death, a fun thing you can do with a knife (and other throwables) is you can throw it and kill enemies.  You can also throw the knife at various angles and land on top of enemies as well.\nA mechanic which I found interesting was that you can enter vents and traverse the level without being detected.  In certain situations you can kill enemies when you pop out of the vents.  Combined with the alertness of enmies, his feature opens up a lot tactics that you can utilize to kill, sneak past, or distract enemies.\nLastly there is a \"cover\" mechanic where you can flip over tables or hide behind bigger objects to protect yourself from enemy fire.  \n\nSome issues that players might have with this game is the difficulty.  You only have one life and if you get shot or hit, you die and have to start the mission over; there are no mid level save points.\n\nFrom a hours:gameplay ratio you'll get a lot of hours out of the game IF you play custom maps, this is the meat of the game.  If you're playing the game purely for story mode, then I would wait for a sale and get it a bit cheaper.  But that is not to say story mode is not enjoyable it is quite fun.\n\nWith all of this said, overall I feel the game is very fun and refreshing.  This game is a must have, if not now then for sure later on in the future.  I hope this review is helpful to you.", "timestamp_created": 1458119586, "timestamp_updated": 1458208385, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 67, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.853128", "comment_count": "11", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21865864": {"recommendationid": "21865864", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023092843", "num_games_owned": 326, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 450, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462627441}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u672c\u4ee5\u4e3a\u62ff\u7740\u9570\u5200\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c3d\u60c5\u6536\u5272\uff0c\u7136\u800c\u5e76\u4e0d\u884c\uff0c\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u592a\u96be\u4e86\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1458116358, "timestamp_updated": 1458116358, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21865505": {"recommendationid": "21865505", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012680835", "num_games_owned": 221, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 440, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458113658}, "language": "english", "review": "Hotline Miami with slightly worse soundtrack but far better story.

As I do reccomend this game 100% to anyone looking for a challenge (with a great soundtrack / effects!) there are just some small gripes I have with the game. \n\n1. [Level design]: In one level a part of the screen would be so dark I couldn't see what I needed to see in one level. During a certan level where you are running around for your life, I couldnt see the elevator button because I am pretty sure it got shot with a bullet hole.\n\n2. [Controls]: The E button is used for A LOT of things, and there are a few VERY frusterating deaths that happened while attempting to close a door or fleeing to a vent, and I pick up a gun instead or something to that effect. It was one of the few times that I could truely \"blame\" the game for my death instead of myself.\n\n3. [AI]: Enemy AI is pretty good and predictable for the most part (as it should be in this type of game) but when enemies start layering on top of one another in corners attempting to get at you, they can at times get stuck or durp out. Id almost prefer the enemy have the ability to climb a ladder, or fan out after some time instead of patroling one single room after they find a body.\n\nOnly bug I found other than AI getting stuck rarely is if you close a door on a weapon, you can make if fall through the floor sometimes. The difficulty curve seems to go up and down near the end, but at least at the start of the game they do try to slowly increase the difficulty and shake things up little by little. Anyway, if you loved hotline miami, you will get a simiar feel in this game. So turn up that screen brightness a bit, accept you are going to die, A LOT, and you should find an enjoyable 6 or 12 hours depending how stuck on levels you get.", "timestamp_created": 1458100976,

The graphics is what sets the game apart from others, they're dark and gritty with a \"VHS\" look to it which gives the game an outstanding style and feel.\n\n Overall an excellent game for a hard to beat price: 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1458076603, "timestamp_updated": 1458077095, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.575961", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21859237": {"recommendationid": "21859237", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044262273", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481516473}, "language": "english", "review": "A gem among gems.\nFrom the developer who made Risk Of Rain we have an excellent stealth action hybrid game \nthat manages to challenge and entertain you.\nI love the artwork and especially the gore.\nSoundtrack is awesome and the gameplay is outstanding and executed flawlessly.\nI can't wait for more content already!", "timestamp_created": 1458076335, "timestamp_updated": 1458076389, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500588", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21858505": {"recommendationid": "21858505", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092563412", "num_games_owned": 271, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 524, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499049307}, "language": "english", "review": "A delightfully brutal game.

I was having so much fun deep in thought, excecuting my cunning plans, patiently progressing without getting too greedy. After all if you aggro too many enemies at once you're in for a bad time.\n\nEverything was going swimmingly until the balance shifted tremendously against the player. Too many enemies and not enough bullets to go around. Only a select few enemies drop firearms for me to reuse and for some reason I can only carry two. I can't refill my ammo at the car, nor can I pick up a different weapon mid level to progress. Throwing a melee weapon magically makes it vanish into the target's body, unable to be reused. \n\nI could probably overlook every single one of these games stacked flaws if just one of them were solved. Combined as they are though, the game doesn't hesitate to stifle your progress with an array of tricks that get cheaper the further you get. \n\nGo ahead and vote this review down though--You'll come to agree with me once you start making a little progress in the game :D", "timestamp_created": 1458015796, "timestamp_updated": 1458015796, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 56, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.345204", "comment_count": "25", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21846348": {"recommendationid": "21846348", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035173756", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 850, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459037242}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm only through the second \"campaign\", but I'm already certain that this game is an easy recommendation, and probably my favorite game of 2016 so far. Here's why:\n[list]\n[*]Exceptional visuals: The art direction of hopoo's previous game, Risk of Rain, was what initially attracted me to buy it, and the art of Deadbolt is even better. What's more is that the gorgeous visuals never obscure the gameplay, which can often move very quickly. This is hugely important and vital to keep the challenges Deadbolt presents fair.\n[*]Fantastic soundtrack: Those who've played Risk of Rain will undoubtedly recall the game's unique, wonderfully atmospheric soundtrack, entirely composed by Chris Christodoulou. Chris collaborated with hopoo again for the soundtrack of Deadbolt and the result is just as memorable.\n[*]Exhilarating, fun gameplay: Most importantly of all, Deadbolt is a seriously fun game. It captures the visceral gameplay of the Hotline Miami series but not without its own notable spin. The vents prevalent on every map make the game far more mobile than Hotline Miami and also open up a ton more possibilities for dealing with situations. This also means the game lives up to its description; you can play this game as deliberately or spontaneously as you want and still come out on top. Finally, the feeling of success in this game is seriously rewarding: there's something to be said about the twisted pleasure of watching a vampire's head explode after landing a particularly nice shot.\n[/list]\n\nThere's a ton of little things I love about the game, too (for example, the Reaper's apartment is super cozy and he even eventually gets his own playful little cat!). These may not mean a ton for the overall game, but are nice little touches that really tie together the world hopoo's crafted.\n\nThe freely included level editor is an (insane) bonus and hopefully gives this game some much deserved longevity. Deadbolt is a delight of a game and for $10 I eagerly recommend it to anyone who's even remotely interested in stealth, action, or even puzzle games.", "timestamp_created": 1458014075,

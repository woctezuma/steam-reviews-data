As soon as I saw the acting in the game, especially the main character's (Jenkins or Jenks), I had a gut feeling that this game is going to be a huge cheese ball. Just straight up I didn't like the acting in this game. Everytime, Jenks asks a questions he makes weird overly acted facial expressions which can be okay sometimes but he just does it everytime when the camera cuts to him. Second negative thing for me was the sound. I'm not talking about the soundtrack, actually I kinda liked the soundtrack to be honest, but the audio recording of the scenes and actors are poorly done. I don't really know about how they record it some of the scenes, but they should have been more careful about it. Its just annoying to me when you hear ambient sounds in the middle of the scene. Lastly, you only find contradictions when you examine the suspects. For instance, once you done examining Emma, you could also examine Simon about the same topic, however the game doesn't let you put what has Emma told you when you are examining Simon on the contradiction boxes. Meaning that you can't really use what other people have told you about the same topic to find out who's lying or not. For me, this paved the way to a negative review. \n\nAlthough, I have to say this is not a bad game. If you don't agree or don't care about these issues, you can enjoy this game a lot. \n\n5/10", "timestamp_created": 1514192522, "timestamp_updated": 1514656789, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38645086": {"recommendationid": "38645086", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047685083", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 460, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505536701}, "language": "english", "review": "Lot's of charm to be found here.

Contradiction's storyline kept me engaged throughout the whole thing, and the conclusions you have to draw weren't outlandish or illogical - it all felt very streamlined and made sense. Had a flow to it. It very much felt like an interactive episode of Midsomer Murders (a great british mystery tv show), which I can only expect is how an FMV game SHOULD feel. No action buttons, no strange mini games, just story. *\n\nMystery games all have varying degrees of success in mechanical aspects, the story aside, and to compare Contradiction's interface to other mystery games doesn't really achieve much - it's a bit clunky, could use some polishing, yeah. That is however what I've come to expect in this genre and doesn't at all affect the score I would give it. Not even close to game breaking, just a bit disorienting a few times.\n\nThe production value of it is also really great? It's nicely shot, the acting is pretty great (engaging and entertaining!), the sound is beautiful. As good as graphics have gotten these days, as an animator, I'm still disappointed in face-focused acting in 3D games.

The abilities to call the chief, see tips, and even \"cheat\" if you get too stuck, made the game very user-friendly and mitigated the frustration that is commonly felt with these games. The acting was perfectly well done, really overdone for comedic effect which kept the game lively and entertaining. There are a few criticisms: several areas in the game are only useful to visit a few times, and I would have liked to have every space utilized more effectively. In fact, the game noticeably is missing any extras, which it should have been possible to film; just a few groups havin dinner in the pub perhaps to justify the murmur of conversation. One character, in fact, you only have a single conversation with and then disappears. This is toward the end of the game, and it makes me think that the conclusion was very rushed. You continue finding contradictions, and then suddenly you more or less stumble into the end of the game. I'd like to have had to use more of a detective method to drive home the climax. Maybe there could have been a kind of lightning round where you have to ask about the right things quickly enough to arrive at the necessary solution. I don't know, but there should have been something different to signify an exciting ending. \nThe game is a real trailblazer, and I hope that more of these are produced.

The integration of video clips into overworld movement, combined with the relatively high quality FMV cutscenes and GODLY TIM FOLLIN SOUNDTRACK make the whole experience much more immersive and cinematic. The actors are decent-to-great and the dialogue works almost all of the time, although the lead character's expressiveness borders on immersion-breaking at points. The fast travel system is a nice QOL feature that makes visiting the different suspects far more painless but still retains a level of cinematic flair, with the map changing appearance depending on the direction from which you entered it and other various nice touches. The story, being the main focus of the game, is simple but relatively strong for the majority of its run, only suffering towards the end (I will discuss this later).\n\nHowever, despite the strong FMV qualities of the game, UI and general control issues make me hesitant to recommend this game wholeheartedly.  There are a couple game-breaking glitches (luckily quitting and re-entering the game is quick and painless) and some very inconvenient UI decisions regarding information display, making for annoying and unecessary amounts of scrolling or clicking just to keep track of all the clues or items at your disposal. Some contradictions/clues are clear from the beginning and cannot be selected due to the progression of the plot, and many of the items you use to progress further are not unlocked through clever puzzle-solving or ingenuity--they just appear in various areas as you get to different stages of the story.\n\nMap design was another sore point for me, and an aspect of the game that I think could have been handled a lot better. Certain areas, like the Restaurant or the End of West Street, are used only once in the entire game, making them really a waste of resources and time as players are encouraged to check all areas of the map repeatedly for new clues or hints. These areas will be completely empty otherwise and cannot be fast-travelled too either. On the other hand the three clearings in the woods are unmarked and verynondistinct from one another, making their various story significances seem pointless...why isnt there just one clearing? It all seems very inconvenient to have to travel all the way through the forest checking every clearing each time one suspects someone will be there. It's all very arbitrary to the player, especially considering some locations are so barren they could have been combined into one scene, like the Jetty and the Site of Death. Clearly  this was done due to requiring real onsite filming locations but the Site of Death is used only 1 time regardless for investigation and all the cutscenes taking place there could all easily have taken place on the Jetty if the camera was simply a bit more zoomed out there. To me this simply shows off more of how underutilized much of this game is due to its limited budget and perhaps overambitious writing/design.\n\nNow, obviously the above two paragraphs, while taking up a bulk of the review, do not really mean much since this is an FMV mystery game. However, its story as well is limited by its small budget and scale. Despite the strong character/story progression within the admittedly very linear story, all our investment in said story is revealed to be for naught at the end of the game. A huge amount of setups, sideplots, useless clues, weird qualities of characters, and the like are left completely unaddressed as the game abruptly ends and baits a sequel. This was one of the most frustrating aspects of playing this game, and although I understand the constraints put on the game by its nature as a Kickstarter-backed small-scale FMV, I still wish Tim and his crew had instead reigned back the writing so the story could have remained tighter while not having all these loose ends. Several aspects of Simon's character in particular are brought up only to never be mentioned again, not even in the epilogue.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is an interesting and promising purchase but not in my opinion a worthwhile one, especially considering its short playtime and blue-balls story. I enjoyed my time with the game, but still believe it could have been streamlined a lot more and would recommend waiting until a sequel or sequels are released that better tie up the many loose ends left behind by this game.", "timestamp_created": 1502955618, "timestamp_updated": 1503008111, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553201", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34298704": {"recommendationid": "34298704", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123285567", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 328, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502938319}, "language": "english", "review": "Just finished the game, and I am absolutely amazed.

My only other gripe is that there is the occasional moment where you just have to wander around until you trigger a cutscene & the game gives you no indication you can't progress until doing so but it is kind of predictive of player actions, not knowing what to do leads to wandering and inevitably to finding the solution you need, so, fair enough there.\n\nThe story itself is really engaging too, dealing with some... weird stuff for sure, though unfortunately leaves a few too many loose ends dangling for my liking - the game ends just with solving the mystery of the murder while many other plot points go unresolved. I know the developer plans for a sequel but I don't feel it's reasonable to leave these plot points hanging, at least a few of them felt pretty major. But in general the atmosphere is great and the story keeps you interested.\n\nPresentation wise... okay maybe this is on me but the video was very glitchy the whole way through, though other than being a bit distracting at times it didn't really have a major impact on the gameplay itself. And the acting is all pretty solid, though one characters' audio quality felt really off. The UIs are all pretty basic but work well enough too and the music keeps the atmosphere feeling tense.\n\nFor the price the story is fairly reasonable in length too - I spent around 10 hours though a bit of that was spent idling doing other things, and someone picking up on the clues a bit faster could cut that down even more so, something like 8-12 hours depening on the type of player you are I guess (and if you don't use cheats which I never did).

I mean, it's not bad, but not as good as other said. There's lot of things that doesn't work.\n\n1) Acting is really bad.\nSome of the actors act quite well but the others are so bad, especially the main character who over-act each sentence. You can't believe in him one second...\n\n2) You can't talk about everything\nIf someone said something about another person, you can't ask her/him if she/he doesn't speak about it first. That's the basis of an investigation and make nonsense to me.\n\n3) All contradictions are not recognized\nI don't want to spoil but, when someone says \"I've never heard of him before he died\" and later \"I sold him some stuff\", there is a contradiction here, but the game doesn't want it. Why ?\n\n4) The story is so clich\u00e9\nThink about an investigation that take place in a lost small village with a sect-like institute, what do you imagine ? Yes, secret society with some black magic, that kind of stuff. And we're not that far here. So predictable...\n\n5) The investigation is not even legal...\nThe detective enters back doors, pick up some stuff without a warrant and noone cares about it. He's not a PI, he's a policeman. He can't do that...\n\nBut, the game is not that bad neither. The filmmaking is good, the logic behind subjects and evidences works well (most of the time) and, even if it's clich\u00e9, the story is well driven.\n\nThis is clearly a game with small budget, made by thriller fans, with a good atmosphere. And it deserves to be encouraged. But... it's not the AMAZING game others said here. It is a small, honnest, amateur game with its imperfection and it should be taken as it.

They all did good jobs.\n\n\nAnd there are several suggestions:\n\n\n1. Tips are sometimes not clear enough. I remember at 9pm or when, the tip said: \"You have 5 things to talk with Ryan\" but I can't enter Atlas. Then I found there is a contradiction to find before Atlas became availalbe. The tip should be improved to be more precise.\n\n\n2. The daylight is changed after 11pm. I know technically it is hard to achieve the outdoor regular scene daylight changing as time goes by.

If you remember the FMV of the 90s you'll be amazed at how far it's come. It really had me thinking of Gabriel Knight -The Beast Within, when 20 years ago  I used the amenities PC (when I could get on it) to complete the adventure - it was a genuine Proustian moment playing this game.  This is essentially a point and click adventure with actors and it seems obvious that they are enjoying it, some real hamming it up at times, it isnt taking itself too seriously but it wants you to have fun - a few real laugh out loud moments.\n\nI started to play it on my own and I had solved the case afer 5 minutes, but the option to ask the question I wanted didnt appear until the end of the game (trying to avoid spoilers here).  If you've played LA Noire you'll see all the blatent lie-tells, but until you've got the evidence you cannot do anything and thats a bit frustrating but it makes the game last longer.  There were only 2 occasions I was a bit stumped and looked at a walkthrough and only of one of those did i think - well thats a bit tenuous. Another bonus was seeing Avon from the cult 70s sci-fi show Blakes 7 (now really showing my age)  - really giving it his all.  Though Rupert Booth, who plays the lead - is really comical at times, it seems apparent that he's really about enjoying himself and pasing it on - taking the mickey out of himself. The best bitch slap ever later in the game - I know Police brutality. There are more than a few red-herrings which were very much left open for a follow on I hope, the ending was a bit scooby-doo.\n\nBUT - this is a great fun game to play and for 7 quid you are going to get at least a few hours entertainment - again it's an Indy game and there is a lot of ambition in this.  It is apparent that a sequel is in the offing - and if its a kickstarter I'll put my money in, because things like this deserve support. I would really recommend you give it a shot - and i'd seriously recommend playing it with  your non-gaming significant other to demontsrate that PC gaming isnt just about blowing peoples heads off -it's an ideal 'gateway' game.", "timestamp_created": 1493938405, "timestamp_updated": 1493938443, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31532133": {"recommendationid": "31532133", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968448928", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 635, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493849804}, "language": "english", "review": "The game was outstanding, and on such a low budget, bravo to the actors, crew, and developer!

I can't recommend this enough.\n\nI want to warn that this game does dabble in politics. As a center-left with libertarian sympathies, I could easily see the narrative offending some people who are strongly libertarian. In particular, it takes a lot of stabs at Ayn Rand and her philosophy of objectivism. There's literally a cult-like group called Atlas run by a guy named Rand. I was not personally offended, but I know people who could be and I think it is fair to add some warning to this review.\n\nIt's a great game.

Barely any lead up or drama to final reveal. The use of the tape as the final piece of evidence is very frustrating, any player with a pair of eyes would have seen the tape immediately, and would proceed to wonder why it was being deliberately obfuscated as a piece of evidence or line of questioning. The fact that the player would immediately suspect the correct character is frustrating and ultimately unfulfilling. \n\nThe final \"contradiction\" to Paul Rand is a frustrating neglect of the rules the game had set a precedent to e.g two statements being very clearly written in juxtaposition to one another. For this one moment only, the player must actually recall an event in the game, after being repeatedly and deliberately denied the opportunity to use their deductive powers.

Takes between 5-10 hours to complete and see everything (depends if you are stuck or not and if your are compulsive enough to talk to every characters about every clues). Charming and memorable characters with good acting, mostly serious but there is some hamming to it. A good balance I would say. The main character, the detective Jenks, is like a cross between the 10th Doctor and Columbo. You need to find clues and interrogate people to find contradictions (lies) in their statements, because of course it's a murder case and you have until the end of the day to find the culprit(s)! Would rate this a 7.5/10 (consider it a 6.5/10 if you can't stand FMVs and a 8/10 if you are a massive fan of the genre).\n\nCons: \n- the interface is a little bit clunky with some bugs that are not game-breaking (if you can't click on a statement or exit an interview, you need to view again any video, it will debug your cursor). I recommend the mouse interface and not the keyboard one. Don't bother with a controller.\n- the save function is not well implemented (no auto-save and when you save it is not always apparent that it worked, but for me it worked 100% of the time). Don't forget to save manually. You only have 2 slots to save though.\n- the game windows launch offscreen and you don't have settings about it, but the fullscreen works, so it's more of a nitpick really.\nFor a very small budget title, these flaws are understandable.\n\nPros:\n- No moon logic. For the most part, it's easy to advance in the game and it's probably impossible to get permanently stuck. The game is generous with the tips.\n- the main gameplay element, finding the contradictions, is really satisfying. You will feel like a badass when you will find the less obvious ones. There is a way to \"cheat\" if you are stuck or, well, you could always check a guide on the Internet but it's really not necessary.\n- the intrigue is good enough, you won't get bore.\n- gorgeous and real visuals (it's full FMV, no distracting computer rendered backgrounds and effects)\n- the acting is definitively top notch for an FMV game, just don't expect any Oscar-worthy performances. \n- my computer is old and it runs very smoothly on it. Loading time is minimal and transitions between locations are shorts and realistic (it's a rare occurence in FMV). The map system is also a great way to navigate more quickly between locations.\n\nNeutrals:\n- the ending. It feels rushed but at the same time it's a great setting for a sequel. A lot of red herrings and loose ends could be explored, but the lore is interesting enough on its own even for a sequel  with minimal ties with the first game.\n- we have a good chance to get a sequel (neutral because expectations will be way higher for the sequel)\n- the music: it is good enough but lacks variety and it is a tad too loud compare to the voice acting for my taste.\n- there is no cross-examination between multiple characters' statements, only between two statements of the same character. It makes for a simple and focused game, but a lot of waste potential too. Should definitively be a part of a sequel.\n- the game don't overstay its welcome but at the same time can feel a bit too short especially because of the ending. IMO, it feels like the production runs out of time/money to make the ending they wanted to initially.

And it clearly shows.  Some aspects of this game (writing, acting, atmosphere, the mystery until the very end where it just falls apart) are superb.  However, other aspects are very poor.  Setting aside some technical matters with the game (I view this game more as an interactive movie than a game per se so I give it a pass on the simplistic interface), I feel that this game had severe problems in the development of the plot.  The writers often seem to have trouble in finding ways to move the plot forward naturally - often the inspector just something on the ground (I can recall three keychains or fobs that people just seem to drop for no reason for the inspector to find).  Then are moments that pull you out of the game, when the main character's behavior is simply bizarre and unnatural.  This was particularly the case in matters involving police investigation methods (he frequently behaves more like a burgler than an investigator) or in how he responds to threats of violence to himself or others (shrugging and acting exasperated instead of calling in armed backup to arrest everyone in sight). And the conclusion was very disappointing.  It might have been meant as a twist, but you spend 90% of the game investigating strands in direction X and it turns out in the last interview that actually it was direction Y and the guilty party just confesses for no apparent reason.  Still, for the price I enjoyed my time with the game and have no regrets in purchasing it.  The acting and writing were frequently very good.

First. I really loved the old point and click adventure games and Contradiction has some elements of them in its mechanics. Second, I have a soft spot for FMV games, as flawed as they can be. \n\nPros:\n-The cast of Contradiction is really fascinating to watch. Even though Inspector Jenks (played by Rupert Booth) gives off weird reactions and skirts the edge of acting hammy, I couldn't help but laugh and enjoy him. The Rands were so sinister in their own ways that I couldn't wait for the next moment I had to talk to them. Heck, even some of the side characters had their own moments that made me laugh. Sure most of these performances are wacky, but they're done in a way that let's you know they know what they're doing and they're not breaking your immersion like a bad FMV game would've done.\n\n- The main mechanic, going through interviews and spotting contradictions (well, most are, but a few aren't really contradictions by definition), does something I really appreciate: it makes you think. Some of these contradictions can be hard to pick out, you'll have alot of clues and pieces of conversation to go through, so there's more work you'll have to do before you reach your conclusion. However, once you do you feel good about yourself and say \"ha, got you you lying SOB!\" \n\n- The narrative as well is interesting. There are multiple threads that come up that could lead you think you know what's really going on and they all are legit. Even when I got to the ending I still enjoyed how it transpired and how the game's creators played with your expectations. \n\nCons:\n\n-This doesn't bother me as much, but this is a short game. If you're perceptive and/or using the tip system, you could probably beat this game within 3-4 hours. If you're hoping for a long game, this isn't for you.\n\n-Not replayable; there isn't no new game plus or extra material after you beat the game. Again, this does not bother me as much, but this will be a turn-off for some.\n\n-I will not get into spoilers, but...there are going to be alot of open plot threads that it might irritate you when you reach the end. I'll admit, I thought they'd close some of these plot threads in the end. Unfortunately, that is not so. It is true most of this was because the developer hit their budget limits and that they want to return to this story in the future to jump from those plot points. However, that is just an explanation, not an excuse.\n\nNevertheless, I think most that enjoy narrative focused mystery games will enjoy this one. There's enough elements in here to keep you engaged in solving the mystery and chuckle while you're doing it. It's not a comedy game, but it's a game that knows what it is and plays with some of the sillier elements in service of it's story. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1488670587, "timestamp_updated": 1488670587, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504985", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30286797": {"recommendationid": "30286797", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099434601", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 452, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488500950}, "language": "english", "review": "Five Stars!

Thankfully, the interface for the PC version was changed to acknowledge the different input schemes between the two; while it's not the most visually appealing interface, it's functional.\n\nYou play as Detective Inspector Frederick Jenks, tasked with looking into the supposed suicide of one Kate Vine, a PhD student found by the lake in the small village of Edenton, having drowned. You go about this task by exploring Edenton looking for clues, bumping into people, and asking people questions about evidence found or given by others. The people you interview aren't always telling the truth, however, meaning you have to pick out when characters make two statements that are at odds with each other\u2014these namesake contradictions\u2014and Detective Jenks will give them a chance to explain themselves. These mechanics work decently well, although it can be frustrating when statements that logically should be at odds with each other aren't considered contradictions, and having to explore all of the areas of the village to find the one area that has a scene that will advance the plot can be annoying, especially due to the fact that the transitions between areas are completely unskippable.\n\nThe entire game is shot rather well, but has a few spots of less-than-stellar audio quality\u2014excusable, given the rather tight budget constraints the game was made on. It's never bad enough to be an actual problem.\n\nSpeaking of audio, the soundtrack (and indeed, most (all?) of the game) was made by Tim Follin, well known for pushing the hardware of '80s and '90s consoles and computers to the limit to produce some amazing soundtracks. While Contradiction's soundtrack isn't as recognizable as much of Tim Follin's earlier work, it manages to set the mood perfectly.\n\nThe acting and writing is fantastic. Jenks is goofy and exaggerated, which can feel a bit at odds with the more naturalistic tone of the rest of the actors, but I find the contrast between Jenks and the others amusing, especially when up against some of the \"obvious bad guys\" of the cast. My only real complaint with regards to the writing is that the mystery is solved before many of the other questionable things you find along the way are resolved, setting up for a sequel that might not happen, unfortunately.\n\nIt's not perfect, but I have no doubt in my mind that it [i]is[/i] worth your time, if you're interested in it.

You are Inspector Jenks and have seven hours to solve a murder in a secluded English village. As you may suspect, there is more to the town and its inhabitants than it seems. \n\nSimular to LA Noire, you interview various people in town and try to spot the liar. How? By finding the contradictions. The more they talk, the more likely they will slip up and contradict themselves. Challenge their contradictions to learn more and progress the story. The game starts you off easy, but ramps up the difficulty gradually throughout the game as you collect more conversations and more information about a wide variety of inquiry. \n\nDon't worry. If you ever get stuck, you can always phone the chief to hash out what you've learned so far. I did this several times. By listening to him and Jenks talk it out in a new way, it was always enough to put a new perspective on what I had learned and push me in the right direction. This is different than a \"cheat\" which actually gives you the answer. Try not to use those. There are several achievements to be won by not using them. There is something else...\n\nIt's live action!\n\nFMV games of old, like Wing Commander 3 & 4, used FMV for part of the game play, but Contradiction does so 100% of the time. Navigating the town and knowing what to ineract with are made obvious through text and picture overlays on screen. Remember, the \"game\" is solving contradictions, not a pixel hunt. And to this games credit, the narrative never felt \"jumpy\", like in other story driven games, like Telltale's Walking Dead. In that game, there are obvious jumps in the script depending on the choices you have made with odd camera cuts and disjointed dialogue. That was not so here.\n\nClean, crisp and enjoyable.

It was a surprise when I started playing, not exactly what I had expected.\n\nPurposefully avoiding reading reviews, summaries and clips of the game I dove right in without knowing a single thing about it. It's kind of like playing along with a Murder, She Wrote episode.\n\nThe filming is surprisingly crisp quality, so detailed you can see facial hair pores and dandruff on shirts. The acting was good too - my favorite characters were probably James and Ryan. James just because he reminds me of a friend and seems cool (though quirky odd), Ryan because he was a very entertaining, mysterious character - the actor did a really good job interpreting the personality of Ryan. Over all, the characters had a very real feel and as this was filmed in an actual place in actual locations, the scenery of course has a real feel as well. Which really helps to bring it together.\n\nIf you are expecting a super interactive game, where you control the walk down the paths, have 360 degree views and such, you will be disappointed. This is a very linear, static game, which is understandable since you are actually playing a movie more so than a game. To put it simply, imagine you are watching a movie and it can't continue until YOU make the next decision (where to go, who to see, what question to ask), the detective in the movie can't piece things together until YOU point out the 'contradictions' in suspects' stories.\n\nOverall, a very simple idea when you break it down to the bare bones, but the execution and presentation of the idea is what matters. And the team at Pneuma Films did a very good job. I hope to see a sequel at some point.\n\n\nNow all of that being said, the game does have some negative points. Already the linear/static quality of the gameplay will turn off a large portion of people, but I still implore anyone looking for a VERY casual, yet interesting, game to play in between their rounds of CSGO or Fruit Ninja to try it out. It's a short game, only about 6-8 hours if you keep good track of things along with the game system.\n\nThe saving system is very frustrating. As far as I can tell, the only time you can save is when you are planning on quitting the whole game (Save and Exit in the Menu). From personal experience, this is a very, very hindersome quality. I... accidentally knocked my tower over while I was playing and that of course caused my computer to shut down. Well, when I got  back into the game, I went from 48% completion to 4%, because I never saved between those two points.\n\nGranted this is my own fault, but I really didn't want to keep quitting the game just to save.\n\nWhen you are selecting contradictions in peoples' stories, you can't unselect. So, if you accidentally picked the wrong option, you HAVE to pick a second option to get it to clear the first so you can select the appropriate one. Since this doesn't affect the events in game, it really isn't that bad. Just a personal frustration.\n\nThis is the first game of it's style that I have played and I highly enjoyed it. \n\nOne 'disappointment' I did have is that I thought it would be more like a Choose Your Own Adventure book than a static mystery. It didn't detract from my enjoyment of the game, but it was a thought that popped up a few times while playing. It would be fun to have multiple endings where you could arrest the wrong person or something.\n\nThe second disappointment is a bittersweet one. It was the ending. So as not to spoil it for everyone else, to put it simply I was expecting one thing but got the other. While it really wasn't a bad ending, it just was in comparison to what I was expecting. Which I suppose is something real detectives sometimes suffer in their line of work, lol. But still, it felt good to solve the problem no matter what the out come!\n\nAnyway - if you get the chance to play this game, I recommend it.\n\nAlso - You can get all achievements on one play through so long as you don't cheat. I looked up the cheating method just because I was curious how you could even cheat in this game. It probably would make more sense if I tried it, but after reading how to do it, I don't see the point as it would completely ruin the game and the whole point of even playing.", "timestamp_created": 1482703893, "timestamp_updated": 1482704356, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.717653", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28602509": {"recommendationid": "28602509", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963699606", "num_games_owned": 577, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 317, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453325897}, "language": "english", "review": "I spent 5 hours on this game, and got 47% of the way through (to 9pm).  I found the super linear aspect of this game to be quite frustrating.  While the story is good, and the acting is fun, the gameplay killed it for me.  It boils down to:\nForeach Hour\n  Systematically visit every location, and ask each suspect every question available.\n  Each time that this reveals some new information, repeat this process, until the hour advances.\n\nWhile some smart gameplay can cause you to skip perhaps 20-30% of suspects, I really don't see advancing much faster with better game play.\n\nThe gameplay also stalls out sometimes when trying to find a contradiction.

It's not \"amazing\" by some standards, but the actors all seem to have a blast playing their parts, and that is very enjoyable to watch (to name a few: Ryan alway taking a drink after finishing a dialogue, Paul almost literally spitting poison as he speaks and inspector Jenks'... uhm... \"interesting\" ways of asking certain questions);\n* Really atmospheric environments;\n* Pretty good soundtrack, adding to the atmosphere;\n* Really good FMV quality;\n* Can be enjoyed on a \"weaker\" PC (most people with high-end PCs seem to forget the importance of this aspect. Not everyone can afford a \"monster\", so it's good such games are still being made. Same goes for retro-style / pixelated games);\n* While not the best detective story, it's still solid and kept me interested, intrigued and wanting to play through it.\n\nPROS (of playing with someone):\n* This game isn't about gameplay, so it doesn't matter who's controlling the mouse;\n* Anyone can get up, go grab some more pizza/snacks or go to the bathroom in between ANY dialogue without missing a thing;\n* The plot moves along smoothly because more people are thinking together and noticing things (we've each got a fair number of contradictions right, so everyone was involved);\n* More engaging than just watching a movie;\n* It's way more fun making detective Jenks run up and down the stairs behind the farm.\n\nCONS:\n* Some of the contradictions seemed a little odd and not quite fitting while others that were (in our minds) obviously fitting - weren't at all;\n* The story seemed less realistic and more far-fetched at times;\n* Minor bugs and glitches here and there (we couldn't stop questioning a person at one point because the cursor \"disappeared\", so we've had to restart the game);\n* You couldn't question people about the screwdriver :( (for some reason this was a big issue to us).\n\nSo yes, most of the pros don't matter if you play this game alone.

A delicious mix of Agatha Christie, Midsommer Murders, and contemporary thrillers. You play the part of Jenks, a policeman investigating the death of Kate Vine. As Jenks investigates the case in a quaint little English village, he learns that it may not be quite so quaint and cute after all. Secrets, lies, hidden agendas abound as Jenks learns that there was more to Kate\u2019s demise than meets the eye. \n\nHarkening back to the golden years of FMV adventure gaming, Contradiction goes some way to recapturing the highlights of that time. FMV adventure games went the way of the dodo in the late \u201890s, due to the rising costs involved and the twilight of the adventure game genre. So, it\u2019s great to see it\u2019s emergence here. \n\nNow that is not to say that Contradiction has the same level of sophistication of the old favourites of the genre, such as The Pandora Directive or Phantasmagoria, as Baggy Cat was working within a very tight budget. The mechanic is therefore much simplified, but this does add some degree to nuance to the game\u2019s primary mechanic. As the title suggests, the main method of progressing the plot is to spot contradictions and inconsistences in the responses of the people Jenks questions. Catching a character in a lie will usually prompt them to give Jenks a new piece of information to further the case. Some of these contradictions are easy to spot; others call for you to have been paying close attention to cut scenes and the story. As I say, this is a deceptively simple game mechanic, and it gets you to look deep into the story and nut-out who has been telling \u2018porky-pies.\u2019  \n\nThe acting is quite good, overall. One of the old beefs with FMV games was horrendous actors, but Contradiction\u2014while hammy at certain points\u2014comprises believable and relatable acting. You come to feel like you know the characters, how they think, and what they might be concealing from you. Filmed on location in an English town, the overall atmosphere is great. The music is another high point and perfectly suited to the mystery setting.\n\nI have few gripes with the game, most of which can be attributed to its limited budget. The games UI can glitch out from time to time, but this can usually be solved by performing an action to reset the UI\u2014replaying an answer or moving to a new location. The character of Jenks is also somewhat incongruous. A cop with a sort of wing-bat demeanour, a stickler for the rules and yet he performs several searches without a warrant. Also, he is investigating the murder all by himself. Aside from being able to the call the police chief, there are no supporting officers\u2026in a murder investigation! This is probably a budget issue, to keep the cast list low, but it still strikes one as \u2018off.\u2019 It may have been easier to swallow if he were a PI, rather than a cop? My last niggle is that there were occasions where it does seem that characters make contradictions, but the game does not recognize them as such. In the interests of keeping this review spoiler free, I will not go into details. It only happened a handful of times, but it can be quite vexing. \n\nOn the whole, I loved the game. The engaging story and nicely developed atmosphere made for a highly immersive experience.

For those that don't know Paul Darrow was Avon in the classic Scifi series known as 'Blakes 7'. Blakes 7 on the other hand was definitely low budget. So with that in mind where is the esky in the game? The cardboard computers with flashing lights? The paper Mache houses? Seriously if this was low budget then they spent every penny the best way they knew how. Sound, music, effects and acting was all pretty much top notch and quickly teleports the gamer into the world of murder.\n\nThe biggest appeal to this game is its use of storytelling. You take control of a private investigator known as 'Jenks' who appears to be more a wannabe detective than a real one with his over the top acting, catch phrases like 'Have you seen THIS!' and his careless sloppy police work like handling forensic items instead of using evidence bags. Whatever evidence he does discover would be thrown out of court in the real world because of this. ANYWAY...\n\nAs you stroll around the sleepy town of Edenton questioning the members of the town regarding the death of a local girl known as Kate Vine, your task is to interrogate everyone you come across, gain more and more snippets of information and look for contradictions in the statements of each person you interview. Only then can you progress the story further by accusing the aforementioned of a contradiction and watching them squirm out of trouble by revealing more.\n\nWhy the death of Kate Vine is even warranted for further investigation in the beginning is beyond me as the questionable evidence regarding her drowning involving narcotics and alcohol seems highly plausible, but what seems to be only as a unwarranted gut hunch is enough for Jenks to knock on everyones door bothering them every single millisecond like he is some type of Jehovah's Witness hyped up on speed. \n\nSeriously! Every time you find an item, you have to go back and knock on everyone\u2019s door again asking them, 'have you seen this!' Stranger than that, is the fact that everyone seems okay with this and none of them try to take out a restraining order on you. You start knocking on everyone's door at 5pm and you continue to do so every hour until you get to 12pm and the murderer confesses.\n\nWhile the game has a great use of gradual story telling in a superb delivery deserving of a standing ovation at the Oscars, there are a number of things I thought could have been improved. For one thing there are a lot of loose ends which go nowhere, but only hints towards maybe a future sequel if donations are ever acquired. Secondly the murderer simply only tells you what really happened in the end instead of the gamer getting treated to a cinematic flashback. This seemed disappointing in comparison to many other movie treats you get rewarded with as you progress through the secret society known as 'Atlas'. Thirdly there seemed to be a rather low use of Easter eggs in the background, this surprised me since there were so many opportunities of placement that any crime/gumshoe/sci-fi fans with a keen eye could have been rewarded with. Fourthly there is nowhere i can see where one can buy merchandise from this game like T-shirts, coffee mugs, masks and freedom necklaces which so many have hinted their pleasure towards and finally there is no multiple endings or choice decisions which change outcomes as the game plays out entirely the same way for everybody making the whole journey more play out like a visual novel than an adventure game.\n\nWith the above grunts placed aside I would highly recommend this game for everyone, especially if you are looking for a game which you can play with a few around the lounge as it was intentionally designed for that purpose. Regardless of the ending provided in the game I am still personally convinced that Servalan was behind it all, with her new mind control weapon. What really happened well you will just have to buy it for yourself to find out aren't you? As Jenks would say,\n\n\"Have you seen THIS!!!\" (Holds up a copy of the contradiction game)...\n\nBelow is me playing the first chapter there should be enough of an example for you to work out if this is a game for you...\nhttps://youtu.be/rnPD5RJ9MXs\n", "timestamp_created": 1479102729, "timestamp_updated": 1479102729, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547893", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26578413": {"recommendationid": "26578413", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019636670", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 956, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479034940}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent game !

These things were huge back when Myst came out and popularized the genre. This was a nice throw-back to those games, with an interesting mystery to explore.\n\nThe premise is simple, you are a detective tasked with investigating a questionable suicide in a small town. Your job is to talk to the victims friends and piece together what happened by finding contradictions within their statements. Without spoiling too much, you soon uncover a deeper mystery, and its up to you to get to the bottom of it all.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty straightforward, talk to everyone you can about any evidence you've found, then find out who's lying by catching them in a contradiction. Unlike with most point and click games, you don't have to scan enviornments with your mouse, instead you're given a magnifying glass icon when something relevant is on screen. Another staple of the genre is using items on objects to advance, and again this is made simple. Objects will have a fairly obvious use outside of dialogue, you will never get to the point of trying every item on every thing to try and advance.\n\nIf I have one complaint about the game, its that it's a little too easy. With the exception of contradictions, the tip menu directs your investigation very obviously if you ever get stuck. If you have people to talk to, or evidence to find, the tip menu will tell you exactly where to go. Another thing, is there is no way to lose. With no branching story paths, there is no way you can dead end your investigation or get it wrong in the end. As long as you can find evidence and contradictions, you will advance the plot.\n\nAll in all I enjoyed the game, though it is more a visual novel than a game. There are no puzzles, no way to lose, and no branching story paths. I will say I thoroughly enjoyed the story, but I do wish there were more paths to take story wise. When the game ends, you feel like theres a ton more to investigate, and it leaves you feeling like the ending was a bit rushed.\n\nIn conclusion, its a point and click throwback, with a pretty interesting story to explore, but there is room for a lot of improvement if the game ever gets a sequel.", "timestamp_created": 1478797537, "timestamp_updated": 1478797717, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26516968": {"recommendationid": "26516968", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972268032", "num_games_owned": 3367, "num_reviews": 88, "playtime_forever": 647, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478937610}, "language": "english", "review": "Wonderfully involving FMV game.

Just finished the game and thought I'd comment.\n\nContradiction has you playing the role of a police inspector (not a very good one who doesn't carry around evidence bags, but hey). The game consists of you questioning people about a death to determine whether it was suicide or murder. The game part comes with trying to find areas where a witness contradicts *themselves.* \n\nFirst, I love that the old FMV style has been updated. The acting was pretty good (a little over the top with some, but not horrible). It's nice to see what can be done with modern day technology.\n\nThe story wasn't bad. I read a ton of mysteries and am always very critical when it comes to them. There are two cardinal rules: 1) Checkov's smoking gun and 2) you play fair with your reader.\n\nI found it frustrating that I couldn't learn something from one witness, discover it contradicted what another witness said and then go back and re-question the original witness. (i.e., like you could do if it were a real investigation). You can only find descrepancies in individual statements. I think the game could have been greatly improved had the player been allowed to better simulate an actual investigation. \n\n#2 is the reason why I cannot give this game full marks. In the very first hour you come across something you should be able to question a couple people about.

This is not how you should write a mystery. If they need to rely on not playing fair with their readers/players then they need to rewrite until the story works. Make it a red herring.

Contradiction plays more or less like a point and click adventure game of old, you move about a location, talking to people, solving puzzles, figuring things out, and advancing the storyline. However, in this case, the puzzles are about finding 'contradictions' in the stories of the characters you question. The main game loop is questioning suspects and finding cracks in what they're feeding to you.\n\nEverything each character says is aggregated into your trusty little notebook, and you have to figure out which pieces of information contradict with each other. \n\nOnce you find a contradiction, you put together the two bits of information that are odds with each other and present it to the suspect. It feels extremely natural and engaging. As the game progresses, you get more and more information, making it harder to figure out exactly where the contradictions lie. Instead of the brainless pixel crawling of old, trying to randomly mixing up items in your inventory to what comes out, or using every item on everything, I believe this game's system actually requires more thought than other games in the genre, and it doesn't fall into the usual pitfalls of \"cheapness\" of the genre. Even if you're stumped, the game uses a supremely clever \"tips\" system, in which you call your police department chief, who after being appraised of the current situation will more or less point you in the right direction without giving you the answer.\n\nThe game uses entirely real locations, and is professionally, beautifully shot.\n\nAn FMV game pretty much lives and dies by its cast, and I think the people here are fantastic. Inspector Jenks (you) brings about the perfect amount of slightly over the top acting, with at times a tinge of modest self-awareness, such as when you ask something entirely ridiculous that your subject would obviously know nothing about. The tone is just right for the game, it doesn't take itself 100% seriously and yet doesn't feel like outright cheese either.\n\nAs an aside, Contradiction was developed by famed 8bit/16bit composer Tim Follin, known for Silver Surfer, Plok and Solstice, among others. He has been working in the advertising/film industry for several years, so he knows what he's doing. Like I said, everything is shot professionally and looks very classy. It's almost like an interactive TV show.\n\nAnyway, to any fans of old PC adventure games, I can't recommend this game enough.

Dabei muss ich allerdings festhalten, dass das Spiel bzw. die Charaktere immer irgendwo zwischen cheesy (wohl sogar bewusst, wie es sich f\u00fcr ein FVM geh\u00f6rt ;)) und richtig gut/\u00fcberzeugend agierten! Eine Mischung, die stets zu gefallen wusste. Davon ausgenommen war eigentlich lediglich der Hauptdarsteller, welcher f\u00fcr meinen Geschmack etwas ZU  \"\u00fcberzeichnet\" r\u00fcberkam. Vielleicht war dies aber auch nur der englischen Natur geschuldet, das vermag ich nicht zu beurteilen. In jedem Fall war es bzw. er stets charmant genug, um dar\u00fcber hinwegzusehen bzw. mit einem Schumzeln abzutun.\n\nSpielerisch bleibt Contradiction - nat\u00fcrlich - dezent zur\u00fcckhaltend. Abgesehen von einigen Gegenst\u00e4nden und einer Karte bzw. diverser Orte, die man ablaufen kann, beschr\u00e4nkt sich das Spiel im Wesentlichen auf das Finden von Widerspr\u00fcchen (wer h\u00e4tte es gedacht?) in den diversen Aussagen etwaiger Personen. Bis auf 1-2 kleinere Logikl\u00fccken war dies auch sehr fl\u00fcssig und spannend zu bewerkstelligen. Sch\u00f6n h\u00e4tte ich es noch gefunden, h\u00e4tte man Widerspr\u00fcche auch \u00fcberkreuzt finden k\u00f6nnen, sprich Person A w\u00fcrde Person B z.B. widersprechen in seiner/ihrer Aussage. Aber zum Einen w\u00e4re dies wohl zu viel Aufwand gewesen, zum Anderen wohl auch f\u00fcr den Spieler irgendwann etwas zu konfus geworden.\n\nDie Geschichte selbst wei\u00df von Beginn weg zu \u00fcberzeugen, schafft es trotz relativ weniger Schaupl\u00e4tze spannend weitergesponnen zu werden und in den Bann zu ziehen. Lediglich 1-2 Situationen empfand ich pers\u00f6nlich als fast schon zu \"l\u00e4cherlich\" inszeniert, als dass sie sich harmonisch in das Gesamtbild eingef\u00fcgt h\u00e4tten, aber wie schon oben erw\u00e4hnt, das geh\u00f6rt wohl zum Charme eines FMV-Spiels.\n\nTechnisch gab es von Beginn bis zum Ende keinerlei Probleme. Als sehr angenehm empfand ich die optionalen Untertitel, auch wenn diese nur englisch zur Verf\u00fcgung standen/stehen. Allerdings waren die Schauspieler meist sehr gut zu verstehen (abgesehen von 1-2 etwas \"rauschigen\" Ausnahmen).\n\nInsgesamt empfand ich den Preis dem Spiel sehr angemessen, da es mich \u00fcber die gesamte Spielzeit hinweg sehr gut unterhalten konnte. Von spannend, mysteri\u00f6s, abstrus, bis hin zu schallendem Gel\u00e4chter war Alles dabei.

I saw Contradiction and managed to convince her, with a bit of hesitation, that we should give it a shot. We had a lot of fun and laughs with it.\n\nContradiction: Spot the Liar, is a point and click murder mystery game that revolves around finding clues, spotting lies and contradictions in the characters responses, ringing the Chief, and, most importantly, watching loads of FMV scenes where the characters are portrayed by flesh and blood actors. The story revolves around a the death of Kate Vine, a student of a pretty dodgy libertarian Ayn Rand style business school set in a small English hamlet.\n\nWhat really makes the game is the acting. In particular, Rupert Booth brilliantly plays Jenks up to 11 in terms of his mannerisms, and comes across as a mashup of Richard 0'Brien and David Tennant. Every sign of the horns he pulls was a source of hilarity, and although it was a little cheesy, it is also incredibly endearing. Another special mention has to go to Paul Darrow, who does a wonderfully sinister and creepy portrayal as Paul Ryan. All the other actors do a great job with their respective characters but it's these two that, for me, stand out the most.\n\nThe gameplay of finding clues and spotting contradictions, for the most part, is very solid. There are a few times where both of us felt like the contradictions were a bit of stretch, but for the most part they sit in the virtuous mean of not being too obvious and requiring some thought, while also not being a complete stretch of the meaning of the term. It's difficult to get these things right, and the few times where the game was a bit obnoxious in this regard is totally forgivable and forgettable. \n\nPOTENTIAL SPOILER BELOW\n\n[spoiler] Another weaker part of the game is the rather abrupt ending. I certainly felt that we were leading up to uncovering some big conspiracy, but that never really came to pass. So a little lack of catharsis here, but again, nothing unforgivable.

That's why contradictions format of a detective trying to piece together a mystery works well. The actors can give away subtle clues, they may be lying or feeling uncomfortable that only LA Noire with it's advance facial capture comes close to recreating.\n\nThe characters are all pretty interesting from the very quirky Inspector Jenks, the reserved and frosty Rebecca Rand and of course the excellent Paul Darrow as Paul Rand sneering his way through dialogue. \n\nThe mystery has lots of red herrings and false threads so unlike a lot of mystery games not every clue matters and must be used and sometime the most innocuous thing leads to a big revelation.\nThat's not to say there are not flaws. Although the video is great quality the sound is a little tinny in some scenes.\nBeing an FMV game there is a low level of interaction but it suits the format. It can get a little frustrating having to sit through the transition scenes (though they do get shortened)\nThe interviewing is a bit stop and start as you will find out a bit of information from person A that allows another conversation stream with everyone else. So you have to go round asking each person that one extra question. I swear I knocked on one characters door 30 times and mostly with only 1 extra question to ask.\n\nThe menus are simplistic but functional. The clue system generally is good, but can sometimes get stuck on suggestion (you have 5 questions for person A, when that person isn't available to answer them), but overall keeps you from becoming too frustrated. The cheat system will spell out for you pretty much what you need to ask next, as sometimes the contradication can be stretching the term.\n\nOverall very enjoyable, it's different to the usual fare and shows the potential FMV games still have.\nSimilar games would be the Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective series.", "timestamp_created": 1475278135, "timestamp_updated": 1475278135, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25782285": {"recommendationid": "25782285", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051483652", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 371, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475245578}, "language": "english", "review": "Me likey, me want to blay 2nd part.", "timestamp_created": 1475245682, "timestamp_updated": 1475245682, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492500", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25774893": {"recommendationid": "25774893", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982313116", "num_games_owned": 229, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 936, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475198988}, "language": "english", "review": "Let me say that I'm fairly sure that this is the first game I have ever reviewed, I love it that much.

And, unlike many FMV exercises, the acting manages to be well above-par, though some actors tend to ham it up. Clearly an heroic effort on a shoestring budget, the game is worth a shot even at full price. \n\nBe aware that whileany reviews herald this game \"difficult but not frustrating,\" I think be conflating \"difficult\" and \"unnecessarily obtuse.\" When a game like Resonance requires me to open a mathematically locked door, and I pull out a pen and paper for high-school-level algebra, that is upping the difficulty without adding frustration. When Contradiction's in-game hint system recommends that \"It's time to check out the woods again\" with no narrative justification, it's being obtuse-- and therefore frustrating. The hint system shouldn't be a necessity, but here it clearly is.\n\nI don't really mind, though, because I had extremely low expectations. It is, after all, an FMV game, and very few of those were exceptional (GK2 and Black Dahlia, for instance). Sure, at one point they were touted as the pinnacle of gaming technology, but few managed to become anything but campy (Phantasmagoria 1&2), goofy (Under a Killing Moon-- still fun, though), and messy (Ripper). Ultimately the core \"fun\" of an FMV game lies in the quality and interactivity of the video production. Contradiction takes smart steps in that direction despite failing as a hardcore adventure game.\n\nI've expect the protagonists in adventure games to randomly pocket/steal items, quipping \"Maybe this will come in handy later.\" If you're not familiar with that sort of suspension of disbelief, Contradiction may not be fun for you-- nor would most adventure games, honestly. The finale in Contradiction, for instance, tosses out a good chunk of previous interviews when a suspect makes a connection between two clues. Yep, even if you already figured it out yourself, you have to ask someone else to do your police work for you. If there were a way to properly examine inventory items, the game could've and should've ended before the halfway mark. It's typical suspense/police drama fashion to have a \"gotcha\" moment like that, though; in that respect Contradiction is more film than game.\n\nStill, I liked it, I had fun, and I would recommend it to the right audience.", "timestamp_created": 1473091128, "timestamp_updated": 1473445392, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25365032": {"recommendationid": "25365032", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144307309", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 349, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479055734}, "language": "english", "review": "Story that was fleshed out for no apparent reason - ending really rushed and disappointing.

TL:DR 9/10\n\nThis is the first game (that I can remember) ever deciding to write a review for.  I loved it first and foremost.  Devs, if you are reading this, please read to the end as I have a question about Darrow (an actor's name, no spoiler), and a comment regarding a bug at the end.  As for everyone else... There will be zero spoilers here, but enjoy!\n\nThis was a fun and remarkable tale first and foremost.  It is a brave slice through a genre that has far too little games in it (L.A. Noire is the only other one I can think of off hand).  It's engaging, well executed, and, for the most part, well acted.  Darrow was an excellent actor and capped the game off, and Rupert's acting and quirkiness left me smiling (again, using actor's names so no spoilers of any sort).  Being in America, and a Realtor, I absolutely loved the United Kingdom setting.  The images of homes, pubs, and nature has always been captivating to me, and I never got tired of exploring the streets within the story.\n\nThe progression often felt realistic, as I can only imagine how little real life detectives have to go off at times.  That being said, while it was often a challenging yet fun experience of finding the contradiction in the townsfolk's statements, there is ultimately only one path, so it varies from L.A. Noire in that sense.  This is something that, if there is a follow-up ever (not that it needs one or doesn't need one necessarily), or if there is a spiritual secessor, I'd like to see incorportated. \n\nI understand that for the devs, the idea of story boarding hundreds of more scenes where paths are led to nowhere sounds daunting, but it also sounds and feels more realistic.  The possibility to accuse or arrest someone wrongfully or incorrectly would make the game feel more expansive and intriguing, as you'd know there is always a possibility of getting things wrong.\n\nThat being said, Contradiction doesn't necessarily need that to still stand out.  It's an engaging mystery that I simply had to help solve.  The story can be slightly linear at times, and repetitive at others.  A few scenes intended to be serious were just impossible to take seriously without laughing, but all-in-all you won't find another game out there like this (as a bit of an aside, there was a game I believe on the Super Nintendo that tried to do something similar to this and it was vile and done poorly; so if you've played that, I wouldn't make your decision to play this based upon it).\n\nIn the end the game, for me, earned itself a 9/10.\n\nNow for a quick aside for the devs... I noticed at the end 2 things.  First, a question: Based upon the dedication at the end, did Darrow pass away in real life?  I seriously hope not as he was an excellent actor and played his role to a T.  Second, a comment: At the end, once completeing the game, there is a small bug that keeps you at 96% completion after the credits role, and puts you back in the location you were at prior to experiencing the final scene, however, you cannot click on anything (the ! that means you are in a scene and cannot make an action pops up).  The only way I was able to resolve this was to save the game, close the application via right-clicking on the icon at the bottom of the screen, re-open the game, load my saved file, and then things were fixed.  Doing this gave me the 100% completion, and allowed me to save my game with this standing (although the final achievment for completing the game without ever using a cheat had already recorded itself prior to closing and re-opening).

I really enjoy this game!\nFirst, I must say that English isn\u2019t my mother tongue and I\u2019m now a video games player in his 40ies ..\n\nSo, Yes, I\u2019ve played all the FMV video games from the 90ies : Gabriel Knight, Phantasmagoria, the 7th guest, etc. \n\nThis game is way better, regarding the \u201cmovie part\u201d, if you compare to the \u201cfirst generation\u201d : everything works smoothly and in \u201cHD\u201d good looking. Actors are good in this game. You play a real video game and not a \u201cVCR recorder games\u201d\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s an investigation game, so you will need to do the errant boy, in order to get facts, objects or to meet people...\nThe story is rich and you need to be prepared to a lot of  unexpected developments \u2026\n\nThe interface is easy to get with and I can\u2019t find any big flaw. \n\nIf you are into \u201cinvestigation games\u201d, this is a good one ! \n\nNow, If you are a non-native English person, you will need to play with the subtitles on\u2026\n\nThe most difficult part in the game are the contractions : it\u2019s really easy to search and find the right facts: you will need to check all the answers of the suspects\u2026 Luckily, you take notes \n\nThe only drawback is the way that Baggy Cat carries on the story : you need to go to the wood in order to see specific acts \u2026 and  to revive the \u201cgeneral story\u201d\u2026. It\u2019s a little bit \u201cunnatural\u201d but if you are stuck you can check the light-bulb and get a tip, in order to unblock the story.\nIt\u2019s easy and it\u2019s not really cheating\u2026 because, Yes, you can cheat in this game (but you won\u2019t have all the achievements of the game....) \n\nA very good and affordable game\u2026\n\nI hope to see more of Baggy Cat\u2019s games in the future !\nThanks for Contradiction !   :-)\n", "timestamp_created": 1470909394, "timestamp_updated": 1470909394, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541256", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24771547": {"recommendationid": "24771547", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018094575", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 657, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470629669}, "language": "english", "review": "Overall, this was a fun mystery for anyone who may want to play detective.  The main character, Detective Jenks, played by Rupert Booth, was a bit on the goofy side, which keeps the story light and fun.  The background music (By Tom Follin) sets the tone perfectly.  Paul Darrow gives a brilliant performance as the sinister Paul Rand--the sort of character you love to hate.  The story was a bit strange, but this kept things interesting.  My only real complaints are: \n1) the game mechanic in which you must spot the contradiction from the same character--this became a bit of a frustration in that you might spot a contradiction between two characters but be unable to pursue it.\n2) Once you start, don't plan on doing anything else for the next twelve hours.\n\nI recommend this game.

The camerawork was very professional looking and the actors' lines were delivered well, which would have made the game particularly immersive if the map didn't open abruptly every time I wanted to go from street corner to street corner. Gameplay never seemed tedious, even after visiting the same characters multiple times; after a lengthy introduction video the first time you met someone, every subsequent conversation cut right to the chase.\n\nI absolutely recommend the game to anyone--regardless of your interest in detective games; I myself was less than thrilled by the concept of a point and click detective game until I played this title.

We all know how bad they can be at times. Not here. Solid camera work, and a very defined and artistic style. Music also did wonders in this title. The mood was always perfect, and did so effortlessly.\n\nThe navigation can take a bit getting used to, but once you get the hang of it, it is very effective. Few minor tech issues with things not being clickable unless you go back and come back into a menu, but otherwise very solid.\n\nThis one is worth full price, and honestly compared to some games I have played, worth even more than asking price.

It has a linear plot that accepts only the sequence of activities that it wants, and to me some of the contradictions you're looking for require information you don't have.  This is the very rare exception to the general rule that the flow is logical.  Consumer advisory:  Pay VERY CLOSE attention to the way that responses are written in the notes provided.  If you miss a word, the contradiction is much more difficult to find and the connection requires much more effort to find.  One thing I did miss in this implementation is that contradictions between characters aren't fair game.  That is, if different characters give you different versions of a situation, that isn't a contradiction -- a contradiction exists ONLY a character contradicts himself.    Perhaps contradictions between characters require a lot more effort to supply data allowing them to be resolved, and the timeline is much harder to implement.

That was really really good. It's 4:30 AM for me right now because I didn't want to stop playing until I finished! I learned about this game from a Let's Play, but I actually stopped watching after the first video because I already wanted to buy it and play it for myself. And boy am I glad I did; I can't recommend this game highly enough!\n\nThe story was incredibly engrossing, and it left me thirsting for more. Jenks is fabulous -- his facial expressions are perhaps the best thing about this game. There were a couple points where I knew /what/ the contradiction was but had trouble figuring out the precise pair of statements to trigger the cutscene. It was also a little frustrating that info you got from one person couldn't be used in a conversation with another person (besides the things added to your \"inventory\" anyways). Sometimes (especially after rewatching a clip and stopping it partway through) the buttons on the side would just...not work anymore. And sometimes the screen would flicker like it was trying to play a different clip before realizing it wasn't supposed to. Ok I'm stopping with the negative things now because I'm probably making it sound terrible, but honestly I loved the game so much that these weren't really that big of a deal to me.\n\nWhen you start out, this seems pretty straight-forward. A girl died, but the circumstances of her death are a bit odd, so you're investigating. As you start to learn more, things get so bizzare that you can't help but want to dig even deeper into what exactly is going on. Actually, the way it progresses reminds me of my programming job. By the end, the solution seems straightforward in hindsight, but it took a lot of work to realize how straightforward it was. But despite the amount of work needed, the process makes your understanding of the situation so much deeper and richer that the time is well worth it.\n\nThis game is just begging for a sequel, or at the very least something more with Jenks!

Not \"Hollywood movie\" good, but quirky and entertaining where it needs to be and serious where it doesn't. I loved it. Jenks, Ryan Rand, and Paul Rand were tremendously amusing. Everyone else was fine as well, of course. But they were the stars.\n\n2) The music isn't too bad.\n\n(Though it does have its troubles, mentioned below in the \"cons\" section.)\n\n3) The scenes are shot well and the transition clips are good.\n\n4) The look of everything is enjoyable.\n\n5) Unpredictable, at least to me. I had no concrete ideas (only educated guesses) regarding who was responsible for what up to the end. Everything about the clues and what it gave you to work with was very interesting, and its narrative weaves an intricate web.\n\nCons:\n\n1) The UI was a bit buggy a couple times. The first time I spoke to Ryan Rand I couldn't exit and had to restart the game (thus forcing me to do the conversation again). But I never had that issue after and the other minor UI issues I had during interviews weren't game-breaking.\n\n(Be sure you save semi-often! Perhaps after every round of questioning on a new clue.)\n\n2) The ambient noises had a mild sound of compression that I could hear, and being something of an audio engineer, I found it slightly annoying at first, but it stopped bothering me pretty quickly. I also have the EQ set on my PC in such a way that these noises might appear to me when they may not to others (necessary for when I edit audio).\n\n3) The music is cool and mostly fitting, but nothing overly memorable, and while I did also list the music in the \"pros\" section, I will note that a couple of times the music that started during certain scenes for mood continued into other parts such as interviews and sort of drowned out the actors as they spoke. I tried to correct for this by adjusting the (limited) in-game audio settings, but that didn't actually resolve the issue entirely. The game does have subtitles, however, so at least there's that, and this wasn't that big of a difficulty. It only occurred twice or so. I also found that closing and opening the game once stopped the music from playing. Regardless, I suppose they could've cleaned this up a bit.\n\nRating:\n\n9/10.\n\nContradiction is definitely worth the price (I'd pay a little more for it, to be honest), and just the right length for someone like me who doesn't have too much time to devote to games.\n\nI hope there's a sequel!\n\nP.S.

I never had to use a cheat or a walkthrough, by which I don't mean to pat myself on the back, but rather to say that as a non-detective I would've liked to struggle more. To be honest, I would cut the \"tips\" option completely. It told the player exactly where to go, who to talk to, and when there was nothing left to do but sit in front of suspects looking for a contradiction. Eventually I just stopped using them as I started to feel more like I was just leading Jenks through the game than actually solving a mystery by myself. Instead, I'd pull more focus to the Cheif calls. The subtle tips the Chief gives are more than enough to lead you in the right direction of who to ask about what and were amazingly emmersive. I even caught myself scratching my chin a couple times over his words! However, I didn't think the game did a good enough job highlighting the Chief as a rescourse, or using in-game hints to let the player know that now would be a good time to call him (i.e.: maybe Jenks inner monologue after disturbing events/interviews). \n\nContinuing with the difficulty idea, it would be nice to have the magnifying glass icon traded with an interactive screen of sorts. If possible, maybe a way to scroll through views of a certain area? For example at the jetty: (SPOILERS) the shot used does not display the ground plane of the jetty, yet after clicking the magnifying glass Jenks finds the broken pendant lodged between the wood panels. If there was an investigate mode, or something that could allow the player to look and click on suspicious objects for themselves (IF they can spot them out!) would lend HUGELY to a sense of acomplishment.\n\nOn to audio/visual aesthtics: The music and ambient noise was wonderful, though the former could be a bit repetitive.  Also, a few other recordings of Jenks' \"aha!\" noise for found contractions would be nice. Lastly, I was a little disappointed with the video-editing decision to make everything \"blue\" for nighttime; however, knowing that the budget was low, that time contraints are a factor, and that high-quality video/lighting equiptment may not have been avalible, it's a passable offense as it got the changing time-of-day message across.\n\nDespite all of that, so SO much fun!!! As the game progressed and my percentage completed climbed, I had to keep reminding myself that good stories must end, and so did this game. I can't say that my heart didn't beat a little bit faster at the prospect that ATLAS would return! Look forward to my name on the kickstarter.

That said, this is very much a classic point and click adventure with what at first glance may come across as almost a gimmick. That is the fact it's actually a well shot movie instead of the usual 3d graphics we are used too. This while seeming odd really does the game good as it sets it apart as the actors help sell the story being told here. If you are a fan of point and click or if you missed out on the great heyday of the point and click adventure games this is a great pick up for you. It isn't perfect but it is solid and really shows the care of its creators and its actors. I would like to see this game get the sequel it so deserves. While it might seem somewhat expensive at first glance the value for money is there. I find it more enjoyable than some movies I have paid for to rent or to own so don't let the price be the ultimate deciding factor in this.\n\nPros:\n[list]\n    [*]Engaging Story\n    [*]Good quality video\n    [*]Good actors, especially when you look at how much they had for a budget\n    [*]The \"Chief\" tip system is very solid and very good at helping you get back on track\n    [*]Integrated cheat system for when you are really stuck\n    [*]Solid audio and it's really nice to see subtitles available\n    [*]Actors do a good job of \"telegraphing\" when they might be hiding something\n    [*]Reasonable price\n    [*]Easy to follow logic (anyone who has played old school point and click games can understand how this is a good thing)\n[/list]\n\nCons(these tend to be very minor annoyances):\n[list]\n    [*]The hints the \"Chief\" give can come off sounding a bit cryptic at times.\n    [*]No real replayability, but this is common give the genre\n    [*]While the acting is good there are a few scenes and lines that come off cartoonish or they break the fourth wall a bit.\n    [*]Would be nice to have the option to skip some transitions\n[/list]\n\nTL;DR: Solid point and click detective adventure game, with good acting and a good story. Suffers from lack of replayability but makes up for it with a unique take on interactive storytelling and point and click style games. Worth the money, if $10 is too much to spend at this time, then add to your wish list and pick up your first chance you get.\n", "timestamp_created": 1467513625, "timestamp_updated": 1467513625, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510194", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24028387": {"recommendationid": "24028387", "author": {"steamid": "76561198167747561", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467494208}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game and interesting format using video.

Since I love detective games and tv-shows I decided to give this one a go. This is a lovecrafted masterpiece, great from start to finish. I'm gonna try to explain why.\n\nYou play as detective Jenks, investigating a girls suicide in an english village. Mysteries surrounding the suicide quickly leads to a murder investigation. Jenks only have a day to solve the mystery. He quickly finds out about a private school for adults called Atlas that uses some questionable methods, and you learn more and more as you go. Every chapter is an hour in the game, but every chapter took me more then an hour each. It's a pretty tricky game, but you can use clues if you get stuck.\n\n You interview people that live in the area and find clues. You look for contradiction, opposites, that a character has said and use that against him/her. It's very exciting and satisfying when you prove that someone is lying.The FMV is very nicely done, captured with HD cameras and different view-angles. They re-used a lot of footage for the enviroment and moving, but added filter to it once it got later at night, a quite smart technique actually. It's made by a small studio with limited resorces after all.\n\nJenks is very funny, and he really acts out. You will smile a lot during the dialougues. Don't get me wrong though, the voice actors did a great job. Most of the characters are very serious, so it's kinda nice that Jenks mixes it up a little with some humor. The best actor is the boss at Atlas, he is an old grumpy man with some great lines. \n\nYou can also find the FMV game on IMDB, if you want to see the list of actors. Score is at 8,9/10, which is a really high score, but I think Contradiction deserves it. I looked up some of the actors and they have been doing lots of movies and shows before. They feel believable which is of course important in a game like this. I could never figure out who the killer was until the end, and the plot was great.\n\nI won't spoil anything, but let me just say that the ending is kinda open for a sequel. Yes, you do get a satifying story from beginning to end, but there is some loose ends that scream for a sequel. Things that weren't investigated enough, characters that obviously had more to them. I looked at the forums and comments on the internet and it seems like everyone just wants more, a follow-up game. It really hope so too, because I really like these sorts of games.\n\nThere was some spooky moments in the game, or somewhat creepy at least. It added to the mystery in a nice way and it keept me playing until the end. The old english village with stone houses, lots of wierd things going on and with a bunch of intrigues between the characters just gave me that \"murder in midsomer\"-vibe. You know, that english tv-show about a chief inspector solving crimes. I really love that, cause I think england is a good place to film these sorts of detective FMV (full motion video) games.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed my time with this game. It was different, and I love to combine two of my favorite things, crime detective drama and video games. I would recommend this game to anyone else interested in this sort of experience. I hope this game get the success needed to fund a sequel, because I really wish to find out more about the village, the characters and some of the unsolved mysteries.

Everything is HD and the audio quality is good, but they do just slap a colour filter on some scenes to make it seem later in the day. A small detail but I found it a bit odd.\n\nThe acting varies from great to being a bit campy. Overall I didn't mind but the main character, Inspector Jenks, did come across as too 'happy' or 'nice' when he is supposed to be investigating suspects in a murder case. Paul Darrow as Paul Rand was superb though.\n\nMy two biggest complaints are that you can't actually get the wrong person and the inventory is a bit of a mess.\n\nYou progress through the investigation 'one hour' at a time and are supposed to solve it before midnight. But time only passes when you reach a certain point in the story and confront a character with contradictions in their statements. Until then time doesn't pass in-game, so the time limit is a bit arbitrary. You also can't fail, something which would have been interesting but is not explored at all and would have added some replay value.\n\nThe 'inventory' is cluttered, including items (screwdriver, torch etc.) as well as evidence to present to suspects and statements to ask them about. But when you are interrogating someone you are given a list with all of them in, even things you can't actually speak to them about and items that you only use once in the story. They are colour coded but I think that splitting them up would make a lot more sense and make the questioning sections a little more streamlined.\n\nIt's a decent enough story, they set up/tease the possibility of a sequel which could be good. It doesn't have ridiculously tedious adventure game style puzzles but still makes you pay attention to what is going on.

The protagonist, on the other hand, is irritatingly exaggerated.  As an inspector looking into a potential murder, he almost comes across like he's having a good time and not taking any of it seriously.

And them hoping that the game recognizes it as a contradiction, because not every instance of contradictory text is necessarily something that will move the game forward.\n\nIt's charming in setting and cinematography, and the acting is winningly hammy, so the niggles with the problem-solving fade away, especially since a lot of it is easy enough that you can just keep propelling the story forward.\n", "timestamp_created": 1458583445, "timestamp_updated": 1458583445, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21942124": {"recommendationid": "21942124", "author": {"steamid": "76561198288299678", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 462, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458469461}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely loved this game!

That isn't to say this is a flawless masterpiece, there are many problems, but there are also alot of positives.\n\nI'll start with the negatives - and this is my biggest complaint. The clue/hint system itself. As you progress through the game your list of possible contradictions naturally grow, making it more difficult to scroll through the list and decipher the short, vague descriptions of what the character said. I think to counter this, there needs to be less possible contradictions, perhaps separate them with \"interest\" notes that act as a reminder of what the character said. Also, there should be more to it than simply selecting and combining two statements; introducing evidence as part of the contradiction adds more variety and, well, sense.\n\nAnother problem is the lack of direction... it's as if the game doesn't know whether it wants to be linear or not, forcing yourself to explore every location multiple times throughout the night, or use the hint system (which you will be using ALL the time). I would have preferred if the game was linear, only being able to explore areas that are needed, and introduce a sort of point 'n' click mechanic where you move the mouse over things in the room rather than a generic magnifying glass.\n\nWith that, I think the rest of the game is absolutely phenomenal (especially given this is an FMV game). My favourite elements are this game's writing, music and story. Whilst it IS your bog standard murder-mystery detective story, there are certain things this game does that spice it up, adds flavour, makes it more... involving and personal. For example, I just love seeing the short clips as Jenkins walks up to a house, or turns a corner, or up steps; showing his shoes, his hand opening a door, or his awesomely smug face that you can't help but smile at. And speaking of Jenkins, he's a loveable character, acted out well and is my favourite character of the game. However, this isn't to say the acting for every character is amazing, certain actors I feel weren't up to par or tried too hard to the point where their dialogue and execution felt unnatural. I won't name names, and I did on-the-whole enjoy all the acting, but these two characters stuck out to me as being below average.\n\nThere's also the \"aha\" eureka moment when you finally find the contradiction, Jenkins will confirm this with a Tomb Raider 2-esque \"aha\" that Lara Croft does when she finds an item. Which is awesome. Another game I feel like this is similar to is Scratches, another game set in England, with an English cast, and offers another murder mystery with a plot twist or two. I mean, even in both games you report to your colleague about updates (Scratches was Jerry, here it's the Chief). Then there's the whole British setting to it that I like and can identify with. The village this is set in was a nice change from the typical towering urban American and I like the lighting and the fact the game takes place in the evening 'til night, the idea of hours progressing based on your own actions is a neat, immersive, organic way to approach progress.\n\nI won't spoil the ending, but it does leave some threads hanging, and not in a good way. Certain characters seem to have disappeared off the face of the planet, collected evidence which were completely useless and character statements which are pointless filler. Having said that, some of that unnecessary digester flavour is what makes this game more life-like, as a real detective won't have perfect results with each candidate.\n\nIn the end, I loved the game despite its flaws, I wish they offered a downloadable soundtrack as I feel it was put to good use, the tingles and bells as you explore and find out more about the murder sounds great and as if you're making it closer to the truth.

As if the inspector knows in advance that it's a waste of time...\n\nThere are many aspects of the acting and deliveries that made us cringe, being lovers of Brittish murder mysteries, but after playing for a bit the humor of the game become a bit more obvious. The hammed up lines here and there, the over- acted reactions, and the characters that were briefly thought of as out of place become perfectly suited to their roles.  After the first night of playing we were hooked, looking forward to an hour or so here and there of playing and talking to each other about our theories of what is going on.\n\nI would highly recommend this to anyone looking for an entertaining escape from adventure games of late, anyone who enjoys BBC mytery dramas that can also stand some humor, and anyone just looking to be entertained.\n", "timestamp_created": 1457882068, "timestamp_updated": 1457882068, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21807058": {"recommendationid": "21807058", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048987865", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 987, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457847997}, "language": "english", "review": "I really enjoyed this.

I was constantly re-visiting all the locations with no clear reason, just to make sure I found any events in seemingly random locations.\n\nI can definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys any kind of mysteries and adventure games, or is looking for an unique story experience.", "timestamp_created": 1457289432, "timestamp_updated": 1457289432, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504384", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21616184": {"recommendationid": "21616184", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964159468", "num_games_owned": 1625, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 83, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450514071}, "language": "english", "review": "I love how awful the lead actor is!

With decent story and gameplay.\n\nThe basic mechanism is really just typical \"Ace Attorney\" gameplay (i.e. finding contradictions) with high quality FMVs story clips.  But unlike games associated with either features, it is not campy.  In fact, its presentation is top-notch.  The cinematics have been framed, edited and treated with exceptional care.  No green screens or CG effects.  No explosions or major action scenes.  The movies avoids the usual trap of taking on a too big of a scope.  It actually looks like a TV movie.  Except that it is not.  It is a game.\n\nBut behind the clips lie a writting team that produced a story that, although quite simple at its core, keeps you engaged like a typical page-turner.  The rich scripts are delivered by superb acting.  Your avatar, Inspector Jenks, at first appears to be a bit too expressive, an over-actor if you will.  But, much like Columbo, his quirks grows on you, and you come to accept his maneurisms (which is good, since you see him all the time...).  Then, unavoidably, there is the sinister Paul Rand, expertly played by veteran actor Paul Darrow.  If you have come to love \"Kerr Avon\" for his cynicism and egomania, rest asured that Paul Darrow has not lost any of his reptilian flair from his \"Blake's 7\" days.  The rest of the cast also handles themselves up to par.  No one acts \"amateurish\"... Well except one \"dazed\" person, but that could have been intentional...\n\nGameplay-wise, one feature that is THANKFULLY lacking is the dreaded \"pixel hunt\".  There is none.  When a location needs to be investigated, you do not need to smash the mouse button around the screen like a maniac.  You just simply click the magnifying glass that appears at the bottom of the screen, and Inspector Jenks will then handle the rest.  This allows you to focus on solving the contradictions.  In fact, gameplay can be summarized with A) walking around ( with some fast-travel points to instantly move between locations that are far apart), B) talking to people, and obviously C) finding contradictions (i.e. match two items from a conversation with a character that contradicts each other, exposing a lie...).  There are very little \"use-item-here\" situations, and when there are, they are quite obvious.  Also, there are no time-based or reflex-based situations either.\n\nHowever, there have been times when I wanted to scream at the game that \"THERE IS A CONTRADICTION RIGH THERE\", but that being said, I only needed some external help only 3 times along the way, once being my complete ignorance on a certain subject that prevented me from knowing that \"such\" with \"such\" was an impossibility.\n\nAlso, although the case do have a sense of closure, you do get hinted that there are more at stake.  So you could say that the ending is... \"partial\".\n\nHowever, these problems do not diminished the fact that I thoroughly enjoyed my journey through this game.

You play as a detective who is inspecting a suicide of a college girl named Girl, who happens to be enrolled in a business course of an organization called Atlas which has all the right amounts of shady. It\u2019s a brilliant setup and is very engrossing. I started playing this with my mom, who had never ever played any sort of video game. She immediately liked it and that\u2019s saying a lot!\n\nComing to the mechanics, I really loved it. I think it has got its roots from the very famous board game 'Cluedo' and it works on the same principle of questioning the suspects and finding a contradicting statements they have made and so spotting their lies. It\u2019s a really neat mechanic and it meshes in perfectly with this game.  \n\nThe presentation is well laid out and the menus are easy to traverse. I really loved the little cut scenes which play out when switching between areas but it got a little monotonous in the end and I wished there was an option to skip it. But it\u2019s not a very major gripe that it will keep you from playing the game at all. \n\nSpeaking about cut scenes, the main cut scenes are quite enjoyable. Mainly due to the over the top acting of Detective Jenks with his ridiculous outfit, with the more serious acting by the rest of the cast. There were some time where I felt that the acting was not up to the mark but it was negligible. I really enjoyed the acting of Mr. Paul Rynd who had a tone very similar to Professor Snape from the Harry Potter Series. \n\nThe story, wow it did grip me all the way from the beginning till the last bit. The ending for me was a letdown, I feel it was rushed and left many questions which I wanted to know unanswered. They introduced a lot of supernatural and horror elements which was fantastic for the brief about of time it lasted, but they shied away from it towards the end. Maybe due to the time restrictions they had to rush the final bits of the game. But I\u2019m sure if they had given more time it would have been a 10/10 experience. This was one of the two issues I had with the game.\n\nThe other issue was some of the contradiction puzzles seemed easy, it may also be because I was always in track with all the replies given by each and every suspect for each and every evidence, but some contradictions are very hard to find.\n\nOverall I had a lot of fun playing this game, it kept me hooked throughout until the end bit. They did throw a hint for a sequel in the end which would solve all the mysteries. I hope they manage to come out with it in the future.

Throughout the game you spot contradictions and facts that just don't add up, but you're sadly restricted to point out the contradictions the game wants you to spot at the appropriate times. The game would hugely profit if there was a way to give more freedom to the players and their own wits. Ways to actually FAIL, different ways to tackle the same problem and things like that.\n\n2) Mild spoiler alert. People who want to buy the game should stop reading here.\n\nThe game sets a lot of conflict up and admits itself that Jenks has only scratched the surface of what is going on in the story. This of course stirs the appetite for a sequel but the problem is, that it really devalues the game as a whole.

The story is chock-full of uncooperative characters, all with interesting personality quirks which makes it fun to just question them. In addition, main character Inspector Jenks is such a goofy character, his facial expressions and mannerisms are simply hilarious, reminding me of Columbo in a way. While it might sound like a knock against the game, I find it's quite accurate of the murder-mystery shows on cable TV: the actor does a fine job, as do the various characters.\n\nAs for the technical aspect of the game, it simply looks fantastic. The backdrops' quality are beautiful, the indoor shots are for the most part very well done, and the actors all work very hard to obviously show their hand when you're supposed to pick up on a contradiction.\n\nMy only real issue with the game is that the audio mix is sometimes odd: the voices sound a bit tinny or distorted. In addition, there is a striking lack of sound effects. I feel foley work would've made it even better, or more ambient noise would've helped bring the world to life. \n\nAll things considered, \"Contradiction\" is a very well crafted game with a strong intrigue and only a few drawbacks. Even the actors, who are quite good at chewing scenery and making the lines about them, manage to turn in a strong performance all-around. It makes them more believable in a way, and more suspicious which is exactly the point of the game.

THE FOOL!\nThe characters were a strong point for the game, even if the acting sometimes fell short. Jenks was intelligent, calm and occasionally humorous. The rest of the cast appeared to have depth and real individual personalitles. \nAt times it was a little frustrating as information i wanted to further investigate was brushed aside immediately after it was revealed. I also took exception to not being able to ask certain questions to avoid upsetting a character, i couldnt imagine a real detective sparing the feelings of possible suspects while attemepting to solve a possible murder.\n There were times that you would notice a contradiction between two characters but be unable to follow that obvious line of questioning. it was almost like them giving you vital clues but then shaking keys in front of your eyes as a distraction so you didnt solve the case too quick. It made the game feel as though you were looking for clues to progress the story and not looking for clues to solve the case. Kind of like being shown a giant tender steak cooked to perfection, with roasted vegetables and a small amount of mushroom gravy on the side but forcing you to eat multiple entrees made up of non delicious fillers, before sinking your teeth into that juicy rare steak. \n\nUsing the map as a fast travel can stagnate your progress as walking through certain areas at times will trigger events that you may otherwise not travel to. They regualrly feel unimportant to your progress.\nWithout revealing spoilers, the story couldve been rearranged in a fashion to make it fit together more smoothly instead of feeling like you've ignored vital pieces of information.\n I also feel that the game could have benefitted hugely from flashbacks.  I wouldve loved a chance to get to know the victim through story driven flashbacks as important  information was revealed. Maybe this was a budget issue for them and it was something they were just unable to include, which is understandable. \n\nIt was a fun FMV detective game. But some small adjustments couldve improved the immersion immensly. mainly the organisation of the story and how in the timeline you were given certain bits of information. \nIt really feels like they have opened some interesting oppurtunities if a second game was to be created.\n\nOverall it was an enjoyable game with potential to become a fun series, especially on the back of Inspector Jenks. \nWhile i do reccommend it, I do so hesitantly.

As other reviewers have noted, the acting is weird, stilted, and melodramatic. Somewhere between a latin soap opera and David Lynch project, set in a rural English town. And the UI is servicable, but not pretty or easy-to-use.\n\nBut the actual act of bumbling through interviews to solve the mystery is exciting in its execution. The game asks you to build a detailed mental model of what's really going on in the town, and rewards you for making remote connections. \n\nAnd one of the more interesting ways it does this is by not letting you \"gotcha\" a suspect by surprising them with information given by another interviewee. Every character provides plausible responses to each new piece of evidence presented, but is only pressured into breaking character when you actually find contradictions in what they have said themselves.\n\nFor example, say Alice tells you she didn't steal an envelope of cash, but Bob tells you that he saw Alice steal the envelope. You can't do anything with that information. Instead, you must look for contradictions only in Alice's previous statements that would support Bob's story and present them to Alice. It's devilishly clever, and prevents you from blindly progressing in the story without building those connections yourself.\n\nIt's not a perfect game, but a really fun way to spend around 5 hours playing goofy detective.

You are supposed to be an investigator, but you can't really do things an investigator should be able to do. If you ask two people about the same subject and you know one of them is lying, you can't really see a contradiction between dialogues of different people. You also can't investigate for yourself. It claims to be a point-and-click, but all you do is click on a magnifying glass and Jenks do all the job for you (not very nice for a game...). Basically, the game is about talking with people and just waiting for them to lie about something (because none of them are very good liars). \n\n2) The ending. It is the most disappointing ending in any murder mystery investigation game. If this was a real-life investigation and I was the investigator, I would probably solve the case in 20 minutes, but apparently Jenks takes 7 hours to do so because he's either lazy or clueless about clear evidence.\n---KIND OF SPOILERS AHEAD---\nBasically, there's an unique tape on the victim's driver's license (you can see at the trailer). I noticed it right away and early on the game Jenks comes across the same tape on window. However, this is not presented as a clue (even though it would clearly be something a real detective would notice and use as evidence). Anyway, this would not bother me if this particular tape was not the only thing that actually frames the killer. Near the ending, the tape comes across as important again, and when you ask the killer about it, he or she just confesses the crime. This to me is just the most stupid thing.\n\nTL;DR\nIf you want a good point-and-click mystery game, look for some of Nancy Drew's games.

Mouse controls are a little buggy. Some of the things that seem contradictory aren't (e.g. I met someone, but I also only heard about them after they died) and equally some are a little off (i.e. the text doesn't give you the full story, so you need to remember it from the interaction) but there's maybe 3 or 4 cases of both overall.\n\nFirst off, the FMV is excellent. The actor who played Jenks is downright brilliant at it. No cheesy B-movie; it's all solid acting.\n\nThe gameplay is spot on. Everything you need to do is logical and not frustrating.\n\nMy favourite part was the story. At no point does it suddenly decide that there is some huge worldwide conspiracy where the USA is run by the Illuminati and aliens are taking over the world and it's all hidden in this little village. It's a good murder mystery because it remains a mystery rather than a silly fantasy.\n\nAnd it does the whole 'quaint English village' thing ABSOLUTELY PERFECTLY. No more of this silly tally ho wot wot tea and crumpets malarkey; it's just a perfect setting.\n\nThe story was great through, the ending was (mostly) great, the acting was brilliant, just overall an exceptionally good game I would recommend to everyone.

The end.\n\nOkay, so without giving anything away, the game is mostly about listening to suspect interviews and trying to find contradictory statements.  There is minimal use of the traditional adventure item inventory. If you have no interest in the backtracking, reviewing conversations, or getting stuck that is typical of the last 30 years of adventure gaming, stop reading, because this game won't convince you to like those things.\n\nHowever, if you are still reading, there are only two questions worth considering for whether you should play this game.  Is the acting too cheesy to tolerate, and does it play well as an adventure? As for the acting, I enjoyed it.  The casting is good, the voices are good, and only the main character (the inspector you play) is heavily overacting, but in the most endearing way possible.  Of course realize that I am predisposed to enjoy the genuine British accents and setting, so without that bias, you may not fall as heavily in love with these actors as I did.  You've got some believable ladies, and several appropriately disturbing gentlemen, one of whom stands by a mantelpiece and channels a smarmy Tim Curry while the other sits in a comfy chair and does a condescending Ian McDiarmid.\n\nAs for gameplay, I was able to finish (and 100% the game with no cheats) in a couple of days amounting to maybe seven or eight hours without ever getting maddeningly stuck.  Regarding gameplay, here's my breakdown.\n\nThe so-so:\n\nYou backtrack a lot.\nThere aren't many locations and only a handful of items of very limited use.\nDue to the nature of the writing, you will think of tons of connections that you can't inquire about.\nYou can only get further info on contradictions (see the name) and no other connections.\nYou can't inquire about statements from two different characters that contradict each other, only the self-contradictory statements.\nThe scenes aren't really reshot for different times, just put through a blue filter for darkness (wait, that's not a gameplay element).\nThere are typos.\n\nThe good:\n\nNone of the contradictions are impossible to spot, but only a few are totally obvious.\nIt's satisfying to find a contradiction because you noticed something visual in the scene that isn't really stated in the summaries you choose from. The statements that act as inventory items are helpful enough, but a keen eye helps too.\nThere are options for hints and cheats, although I didn't use them.\nCalls to the police chief serve to summarize where you stand in the case without acting as cheats.\nThere is no lore-reading necessary.  All of the story is fully acted out or recounted through live interviews.\nThe feeling of progress is extremely satisfying, and the advancing of hours acts as milestones.\nThere are red herrings everywhere, which creates a believable atmosphere, fully fleshed out.\n\nI've played a lot of adventure games since the 80s, and I think you should play this one, even at full price.", "timestamp_created": 1450159388, "timestamp_updated": 1450160283, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510022", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19702663": {"recommendationid": "19702663", "author": {"steamid": "76561198265145250", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 533, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450135217}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely brilliant.

In other \"why is that a thing\" interface issues - you can't skip dialog, you can't skip all the minor (or major) cutscenes that take place as you walk around, and you can't focus on spots of interest after the first time you see them.

The story is interesting, the characters are varied and fun, the gameplay is easy to grasp without much explanation. Some of the acting can be a bit campy depending on the characters, though I personally find this pretty entertaining. \n\nThe keyboard option for the game feels a bit unwieldy for interrogations, but for walking around the map it functions fine. Personally, I prefer to play using the mouse. (I didn't try using a gamepad/joystick.)\n\nBut, alas, I can't recommend the game for one big, glaring reason: the interface tends to bug out randomly and stops functioning until I close and reopen the game when I play with the mouse as input method. (I did not test the keyboard mode enough to know if it's also affected.) Sometimes this can lead to losing progress, especially if you haven't saved the game manually for a while. The good news? As far as I've noticed, the interface bugs don't corrupt save files or break the game permanently, even if you save after the bug kicked in. \n\nI also have to warn you that this game's ending is a bit open-ended and has a sequel hook. It's not really a cliffhanger, but if you want your games wrapped up neatly with no questions left unanswered, you'll have to look elsewhere. \n\nIf the interface issues don't bother you, don't mind to regularly save manually using the two save slots and have no qualms with endings that don't give full closure on every detail, I think you can safely buy it, though.", "timestamp_created": 1447348607, "timestamp_updated": 1447348946, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.435908", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19028647": {"recommendationid": "19028647", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004496223", "num_games_owned": 456, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 438, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1447313288}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautifully executed from beginning to end, interesting plot to keep you hooked, sound is well fitted and each characters personality and traits are quite distinctive without making it obvious to whom is the culprit.

It's also the  games most difficult task - finding the exact two sentences that prove a person is lying.

I know, you can read it on the store page, but I need to start from somewhere now, do I?\nI think it's one of the best investigative games I have ever played, I loved it in its entirety.\n\nWhy?\n\nWell, I loved the acting. I found Detective Jenks really likeable and funny for certain expressions he makes and kind of exaggerated reactions to some of the things he hear from the people he interview.\nI loved the case, the story... it left me with the desire to have more. I really want to know more about the background of the case. I'm not going to spoil anything though, you'll have to play it yourself. Trust me, it's going to be a fun ride.\n\nGameplay wise there's not a lot to say. It's a point and click. You click the names of the locations on the screen to move around ( or use the map to move faster ), you talk with people choosing the clues you want to know more about and when you think you found a contradiction in what the guy said to you, you point it out selecting two pieces of information that contradict each other. Easy and very effective.\nIt gave me a lot of satisfaction when I actually found out what was the clue, the contradiction, I needed to corner someone.\n\nThe game runs really well, didn't encounter any real problem while playing. Just an error that occurred from time to time, inside the pub usually. When I wanted to stop asking Rebecca and tried to leave the pub, almost immediately Jenks called for Becca again as if I clicked the bell again. When that happens an error message pops up in the upper left corner saying that there was an error of some sort and that if that persisted I should have restarted the game.\nNothing bad really happens, no corrupted saves or game breaking bugs so I don't know what the error was really about.\n\nLongevity wise, I think it's long enough for a good experience. I wouldn't be concerned about it.\n\nTo wrap this up I highly reccomend this game.

But genres aside, this game was simply put the most fun, enjoyable playing experience I've had all year. Contradiction strikes a perfect balance between smooth, relaxing gameplay and painstaking difficulty. It will test your investigative skills to their limits. \n\nIt's an easy enough concept;  exploring this enigmatic village and speaking to its various eccentric inhabitants in order to solve a mysterious murder. But the challenge lies in truly paying attention to the tiniest details, made harder by an increasingly complex story unraveling all around you. A similar FMV game I played earlier this year, called Missing, showed the same kind of promise. But it was overly bogged down by quicktime events and other mechanics that felt out of place. There's none of that in this game, it's traditional in the best way possible. I would liken it more to older FMV titles like In the First Degree and the Gabriel Knight series. \n\nThe characters are intriguing and interesting, and the acting is perfection--some of the best live performances I've seen in a game. It's dramatic without being contrived or cheesy, with a good dose of humor mixed in. The main lead of Inspector Jenks, played by Rupert Booth, has quickly become a favorite protagonist of mine. It would be a joy to see him reprise this role, and the game opens up a rich world of possibilities when it comes to a sequel or series.

Although the acting comes across as fairly hammy in the beginning, it grows on you and I'd say works mostly throughout the game.\n\nI played through the entirety of the game with my Girlfriend and we both enjoyed it throughly. The only slight critique I'd have is that the game on occasion requires you to walk around the small village in order to trigger a certain event before letting you continue. There's no real gameplay reason to do this, as the map function conveniently lets you warp most places. In fact, seeing the same travel animations time and time again becomes a little tedious, so it's somewhat counter-intuitive that this is occasionally required for the sake of progression. Perhaps in a future installment the game would force these required encounters if you were to warp past something.\n\nThis is - however - a minor detail and on the whole, it was well worth the money spent.

I hated them back then, but now they're all endearing in their own special way. With the computer graphics of today, we can achieve practically anything. That really isn't as exciting as it used to be. Maybe I'm just getting old. I'd probably start yelling at clouds, but I never go outside. Whatever the case, Contradiction - Spot the Liar! is a great example of what the medium is capable of.\n\nDetective Inspector Jenks is tasked with solving the mysterious death of a young woman. Over the course of a single night, he will collect evidence, interview suspects, and discover contradictions. In terms of game-design, the process isn't complicated in any way. Take the Phoenix Wright series for example. In those games, your primary method of progression is tied to spotting contradictions. If you mess up, you're punished with a loss of \"life\". There are no punishments for mistakes in this game. You can even take as much time as you need to solve the mystery. I appreciate the more casual approach to this investigation. Due to my cautious nature, I tend to save every couple minutes in the Ace Attorney games, which really hurts the pacing. \n\nAn aspect that I really enjoy about this game is it can feel like nothing is really happening. I compare it to the Gene Hackman movie \"The French Connection\". If you take out the car/L-train chase and the shoot-out at the end, you're left with nearly an hour and a half of \"boring\" police work. A lot of attention is paid to the characters, and how their mostly fruitless investigation plays out. You'll go through a similar process in this game. With every new piece of evidence, you'll  end up asking everyone what they might know about it. Some won't know anything at all, but you're still treated to an answer. The person you're questioning might also make an odd quip or comment. Even if they don't have anything to do with the investigation, these character moments add a lot of personality. \n\nThat's why I strongly suggest that - unless you're well and truly stuck - you don't use a guide for this game. Aside from spoiling the answers, you're also taking away the immersive qualities of this game. A lot of the detective work in this game could be considered dull, but that's usually how it goes in the real world. Often the evidence won't consist of something significant like a murder weapon or a fingerprint. In any case, since you're essentially working to solve this mystery in a single night, you won't have access to a bunch of CSI gadgets. All you really can do is think about what everyone tells you, and weed out the red herrings.\n\nThis game was made on a budget of 3,000 pounds. 3,000! The more I think about it the crazier it sounds. Some of the voice recordings sound a little off, and the \"night\" scenes were filmed in the day-time, but otherwise there's nothing that really stuck out as cheaply done. The acting is fine as well, though you're liable to remember Rupert Booth's (Jenks) 1,001 facial expressions most of all.

The story is a pretty great murder mystery that most people probably won't guess until the end. Some veterans might realize half-way through, but with the characters in the game, and how well they are acted, you can be led down the wrong road pretty easy. You are kept on track without your hands being held, so you will never truly be lost, but it can steer your guess of who is guilty all over the place.\n\nAs I mentioned, the acting is pretty damn good. There are some scenes that are just decent, and the main detective, Jenks, is kind of a goofball, but it's intentional. Pretty much every time you need to know if someone is lying, there is the smallest tell in their acting, but not enough to just give it away easily. I hope they make a sequel, and I hope they keep most of the cast.\n\nThe graphics are all really well put together live-action scenes. The transitions are perfectly shot and perfectly timed. The games flow is probably the most impressive thing about it. They give you just enough flair without making you wait too long to get where you want to go. There is also a shortcut system if you want to travel to the other side of the map fast. It's a beautiful game all in all, great stills and great video, all in crisp 1080p.\n\nThe controls and UI are very good. You have everything you need and it's not in-your-face. The entire game can also be controlled with the mouse. You click where you want to go, and it gives you a 1-3 second scene of the main character, Detective Jenks, heading there. If you don't want/need any clues, you never have to use them, but it has 3 different layers of hints, not counting the acting tells. The first is a lightbulb button that reminds you who you havent talked to yet and lets you know that you need to go find out if someone is lying, without telling you who. The second is a phone call to your Chief, it lets you know who you should be questioning if you need to narrow it down. Lastly, it allows you to cheat and tells you exactly who to ask about what, if you are stuck.\n\nThe only complaint I could even muster about the game, is you end up with a LOT of clues over half-way through. This means a lot of remembering and a lot of scrolling. It keeps all your information for you very neatly organized, best it can, but it gets a little tedious to connect the clues, or contradictions, later on. It's not necessarily a bad thing and certainly isn't badly designed, but it's worth mentioning. Actually pooling similar things together would defeat the purpose of finding the contradictions, so it's nothing they can improve, I just feel bad about writing a perfect review without mentioning even something slightly annoying.\n\nTL:DR\n\nI'm not necessarily a fan of mystery games, mostly because so few of them are good, but I loved every minute of this game and it lasted about 7+ hours. I bought it in a bundle, so it was even better deal for me, but it's worth the base price of $10 for sure, I just didn't know about the game beforehand. But even if you aren't sure about the game, at least get it on a bundle/sale if you like mystery games at all, or even mystery books/movies actually, you will love this.", "timestamp_created": 1445318713, "timestamp_updated": 1445319072, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18569717": {"recommendationid": "18569717", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077161308", "num_games_owned": 737, "num_reviews": 96, "playtime_forever": 389, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1445276991}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a very cautious and very reserved recommendation. This game will not be for \"everybody\". At all. It is quite rough around the edges and suffers a few frustrating faults. But. I personally enjoyed it immensely and think it is very much worth looking in to. I got this game in a bundle without having heard of it or it's Kickstarter campaign. It wasn't on my radar at all, even when purchasing the bundle I had my eye on other titles in it, this was just going to be a \u201cthrow in\u201d. But it was easily the star of the bunch! \n\nThe game is impressively well acted, written, and shot. No Oscar performance or anything but also not cheesy in any way. A lot of \u201cFMV\u201d games or live action cutscenes in video games tend to be on the more campy side of things but this finds the balance in between. They're clearly having great fun, but still portraying the characters well. Never a \u201ccringe\u201d moment. The story and writing is solid and deep enough to mostly keep you guessing. And develops a full atmosphere. Then the cinematography or whatever you want to call it is great within the context of it being a game. Exteriors are particularly well framed. \n\nBut it is rough around the edges as I mentioned;\n\n-The \u201calong for the ride\u201d straight line story and not being able to accuse anyone or effect outcomes might bother some but I enjoyed it. Nice casual experience. You don't change the story or have options, you just figure out how to keep it going.\n\n-My biggest issues were some of the \u201ccontradiction\u201d choices. You progress the story by presenting evidence to different characters you're interviewing and then taking their answers and finding things that contradict. Doing this flusters them and makes them reveal more to the story. I found at least two of the contradictions annoying in the fact I was on the right track but you had to make sure it was the exact right two statements to get it to trigger. Even though very similar (almost identical) answers wouldn't trigger it. The first time this happened to me I was certain I was on the right track but just happened to not match the perfect two. After circling the map and characters multiple times I thought I bugged the game. Which led me to consult a guide. I felt a \"oh comeon!\" moment knowing I had virtually pointed out the exact same thing with a different answer. And I hate consulting guides! Haha. But searching for these contradictions led me back to a guide once more later in the game... I feel shame. Then some other contradictions just felt a little too buried in the grey area. And then I'd have to glance over a list of the contradictions somewhere but I also seem to recall an early one not even feeling like a contradiction, but don't quote me on that.  \n\n-The last chapter has a lot of clues uncovered by stumbling across corners of the map manually. Which is fine because I like checking corners and had developed a habit of it every chapter. But the game up to that point triggered these events automatically when fast traveling over the area. Might get someone stuck/annoyed.\n\n-Ending was fine with me but might leave some asking for more. There was a deliberate attempt to put more information than needed in the game to make the detective work worth it but this led to more story arcs that went nowhere. And some unresolved that did go somewhere for a bit. Which is kind of the point as well... We live in a world of sequels. And with some fine tuning and smoothing out I'd look forward to a sequel from the same team! Though I think an entirely new adventure would be more thrilling. Either way I hope the people involved from the gamemakers to the actors have more up their sleeves in some form. \n\nIts a fair price for the entertainment value if you aren't expecting deep gameplay or any replay value. Me being cheap and the higher percentage chance of the average gamer not enjoying it, I would recommend waiting for a sale or getting it in a bundle of course. But I think $9.99USD is fair for what you get if its in your budget.

Interactive fiction, yes.  A full-motion video game (FMV), sure.  But more than either of those, it is a modern-day implementation of the age-old tradition of art commission.\n\nA small team of talented and passionate people reached out to the gaming community and humbly petitioned them for support; the help they needed to bring something they truly believed in to life.  In the end, an understandably skeptical KickStarter community offered \u00a34,010.  Let me repeat that.  \u00a34,010.  At that funding level, Contradition is an astonishing achievement; not only in its polish and enjoyability, but also in what had to have been the colossal charity and collaboration of everyone involved in its making.\n\nContradiction is an interactive fiction experience in the form of a high-definition, full-motion video game.  A young woman has been found dead; drowned in a lake at the outskirts of a charming hamlet in the English country-side.  Detective Jenks arrives on scene at 5:00PM to investigate and finds the inhabitants of the village not nearly as wholesome as their idyllic surroundings.  At the center of it all is an inscrupulous father and son duo and their cut-throat, corporate executive training program, Atlas.  Jenks has until midnight to solve the mystery,  Tour the town, gather the evidence, and interview the witnesses.  Spot the contradictions and help Jenks close the case.  The Chief is counting on you.\n\nThis is British Detective Pulp at its finest.  From the quirky and unflappable Detective Jenks to the deliciously villainous patriarch, Paul Rand, great performances throughout elevate the story-telling well past what I would have alllowed a work of this budget and format could deliver.  The settings are lush, but genuine.  The makeup and costumes are \"just right\" in their tasteful understatement.  The music and sound effects create mood and communicate enviroment in as expert a fashion as I have ever heard.\n\nThe game design is both intuitive and innovative.  The control interface is clever and unobstrusive; an asset to he gameplay instead of a necessary evil.  The offering of both a hint system and a full-on \"cheat\" bailout welcomes players of every commitment level.  Chapter progression marked by advancing hours and subsequent nightfall are perfect for communicating urgency in a natural and realistic way.  The game is altogether worthy as a vehicle for delivering the quality acting and engrossing story.\n\nI ran into only two challenges with the gameplay and those are easily overcome with a couple of no-spoiler hints:\n\n1.  Start every new chapter by walking the entire length of the village, including the nooks and crannies, and entering evey location.  The quick-travel map can result in a vital progress point being missed for a frustratingly long time.\n\n2.  The hourglass symbol that signifies that there is something in the scene for Jenks to investigate is easy to miss.  Watch closely for it, especially when making the aforementioned new-chapter walkthrough.", "timestamp_created": 1444719596, "timestamp_updated": 1444722947, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18448539": {"recommendationid": "18448539", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054492615", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 408, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1444753036}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]This is my opinion of Contradiction [/h1]\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]Aspect[/th]\n        [th]Rating[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Story[/td]\n        [td]8.0[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Acting[/td]\n        [td]7.0[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Sound[/td]\n        [td]8.0[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Gameplay[/td]\n        [td]7.0[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Overall[/td]\n        [td]7.5[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n[i]Scores are out of 10.

I wasn\u2019t expecting much from the game. To my delight, Contradiction \u2013 Spot the Liar made for an entertaining evening\u2026 and late evening\u2026 then early morning\u2026  I hooked my pc to the big screen and played along with a house guest who doesn\u2019t play a lot of video games. We were hooked almost from the beginning. \n\nThe navigation is simple and reminds me of DVD games. I thought the gameplay would get dull \u2013 location, interrogate, repeat, but the pace of clues and strength of the acting kept that from happening. Like most games that rely on questioning suspects, there are questions the player wants to ask that never come up. As this relies on finding contradictions, this does become more of an issue at times, but not to a point that crippled gameplay. There are lots of red herrings or lines of inquiry that go nowhere. I can\u2019t tell you how many times we picked up an item and said \u201cDon\u2019t forget what Simon said about that. That\u2019s important.\u201d only to have nothing happen. Rather than annoy, it left us with a longing for a sequel. \n\nThe acting is great. I found Jenks\u2019 shoes and hat a bit annoying, and every time he flourished the evidence at a suspect I expected him to say \u201cIs this your card?\u201d, but it added to his quirkiness. Paul Darrow is great. He brings nuance to the role and is still one of the best \u201creaction\u201d actors I\u2019ve seen. \n\nThe only real downside is replayability. I\u2019d love to get my game night group together to do this, but it won\u2019t be as much fun for me. I\u2019ll still probably do it. \n\nIf I were the producers, I\u2019d make a 20 minute playable demo using the existing material and mechanics to help sell this and get money for a sequel on Kickstarter. Something that shows off the ease of interrogation and introduces most of the characters would be a great marketing tool and short enough to share with friends (particularly the non-gamer 40-55 demo who would love this game if they knew it existed). \n", "timestamp_created": 1444590792, "timestamp_updated": 1444590792, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18430382": {"recommendationid": "18430382", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991279915", "num_games_owned": 343, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1444539304}, "language": "english", "review": "This a great idea of the adventure game format.

Echte Schauspieler, echte Orte und Umgebungen, nur wenig erinnert an ein Spiel. Also mal was anderes...\n\nDie Handlung spielt in einem englischen Kaff und ein Inspektor aus London ermittelt in einem Todesfall, der sich hier ereignet hat. Selbstmord, wonach es zun\u00e4chst aussieht oder doch ein Mord? Unsere Aufgabe ist es, diverse Personen zu interviewen und aus den Antworten R\u00fcckschl\u00fcsse zu ziehen und so am Ende L\u00fcgen bzw. die Widerspr\u00fcche zu entlarven. \n\nDie Handlung schreitet stundenweise voran und bis Mitternacht wei\u00df man Bescheid. Man muss sich aber nicht gehetzt f\u00fchlen, denn die Stunden drehen sich nur weiter, wenn man alle Hinweise zusammen hat und die richtigen Schl\u00fcsse gezogen hat. \n\nDie Personen zu befragen und die wenigen Orte zu besuchen stellt jetzt keinen hohen spielerischen Anspruch dar. Vielmehr ist es so, dass man von einer Person zur anderen l\u00e4uft und die neuesten Hinweise abfragt. Die wichtigsten Eckpunkte des jeweiligen Gespr\u00e4chspunktes werden notiert und dann hei\u00dft es kombinieren. Zwei Notizpunkte ergeben einen Widerspruch; hat man zwei richtige zusammengesetzt und eine L\u00fcge entlarvt, wird die Person dazu befragt. Ein Beispiel: Jemand sagt, er kenne sich mit Pflanzen nicht aus, hat aber weiter vorher gesagt, er h\u00e4tte mal Pflanzenkunde studiert. Das Beispiel ist schon fast zu einfach, es gibt n\u00e4mlich weitaus knifflerige Aussagen. Und je weiter man in der Handlung ist, umso mehr Notizen hat man, die augenscheinlich nicht immer zusammenpassen. Da muss man entweder sehr sehr aufmerksam sein oder zur Not eine L\u00f6sung konsultieren. \n\nNach 5-6 Stunden Echtzeit hat der Inspektor den Fall gel\u00f6st und man darf sich zufrieden zur\u00fccklehnen. \n\nIch bewerte das Spiel positiv, weil es sich nicht unbedingt in die L\u00e4nge zieht, auch wenn man mit neuen Hinweisen immer wieder bereits besuchte Personen aufsuchen muss, was in der Realit\u00e4t in etwa so w\u00e4re, als k\u00e4me der Inspektor 20 Mal an einem Nachmittag vorbei. So ist das halt, wenn man in einem Spiel ist. \n\nDie Darsteller machen ihre Sache gut, das Ganze wirkt recht rund. Weniger ins Gewicht f\u00e4llt, dass bei manchen Befragungen zur sp\u00e4ten Abendzeit (wenn es schon dunkel ist), im Raum offenbar noch Tageslicht vorhanden ist. Auch hat mich der Inspektor nicht hundertprozentig \u00fcberzeugt, er kam mir etwas \u00fcbersteigert vor, vielleicht w\u00e4re ein anderer Darsteller \u00fcberzeugender gewesen. Aber sei's drum, das sind Sachen, wegen denen eine Abwertung nicht gerechtfertigt w\u00e4re. \n\nEine Fortsetzung darf gerne kommen!", "timestamp_created": 1444483730, "timestamp_updated": 1444484820, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530379", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18411100": {"recommendationid": "18411100", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059282857", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 391, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1444481599}, "language": "english", "review": "Started playing due to Jessie and Dodger.

It was quite to my surprise that Follin was returning to the industry to work on a game not only as a composer, but as a designer and writer as well. So how does a game made by someone with no design experience who's been absent from the industry for 10 years play? It plays about how you'd expect, for better or for worse. It's not all bad though, Contradiction is charming in a unique way that I think can only be accomplished by a first-time designer who, as far as I can tell, has been isolated from the popular design trends, progressions and philosophies that have developed in the last decade or two.\n\nContradiction is a full FMV murder mystery game straight out of the 90s which I admit would have been way more eye-rolling if I hadn't just played the excellent \"Her Story\". You play as Fredrick Jenks, a British detective who is tasked with investigating a murder in a small fictional village. All locations in the village are essentially still frames, even though some are animated, and you can move between the frames by clicking on UI arrows displayed on the screen which always triggers a short movie of Jenks strolling to where you guided him. While interviewing suspects, Jenks has a list of topics he can ask about which when selected, loads an an FMV scene where Jenks grills the suspect about whatever you selected which often then reveals more topics to ask about. The main gameplay mechanic in Contradiction is to find pieces of the suspect's story that don't quite add up or are downright contradictions, hence the title. Most of the contradictions are pretty logical, but some are a little more of a stretch or are otherwise debatable. Thankfully, this game is pretty generous with hints and gives them to you in a way that doesn't make you feel stupid or like you're cheating. Jenks can go to the phone booth and call his chief who will generally point you in the correct direction to progress the game or also may hint at contradictions suspects have made.\n\nFollin, whose composing career work dates all the way back to the Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum days, also composed the music in Contradiction. It's not quite as in-your-face as some of my other favorites of his. It's more appropriately subtle and blends in perfectly as Jenks traverses the village looking for clues and interviewing suspects. Aside from the music, the extremely cheesy acting is another standout in Contradiction, especially with the actor portraying Jenks who loves to smirk at his suspects with his trademark goofy deductive grin. In fact, Jenks is so excitably overanimated and the acting in general is so cheesy that it makes me wonder if it was an intentional directorial choice or if Follin actually thought his actors were delivering believable performances. In any case, I'm happy about it. The delightfully cheesy acting seems to fit the style of this game perfectly as does the music.\n\nBut in addition to the cheesy acting, there are several other strange design choices and signs of low budget production you should be at least aware of before playing this game, especially if that sort of thing bothers you. I've heard this game was riddled with UI problems at launch that have since been corrected, but one holdover is the strange combination of topics Jenks can ask about with the physical items he's carrying into one functional grouping. Your items and your topics appear together, but you can't use a topic like an item and most items you can't bring up in conversation, making this a puzzling design choice. I've also encountered a bug a few times where none of the suspect's answers were selectable as contradictions and I had to leave and re-enter the scene in order to fix it. (Minor spoilers ahead). The budgetary constraints this game was made were apparent in the poor sound quality in the FMV scenes but especially obvious in the ending to this game. The latter half of the game really seems as though its building up to something as the plot starts sprinkling in elements of the occult and mysticism. But it's all thrown away at the last second when the murderer is revealed and the game just ends quickly and unceremoniously - but not before strangely setting itself up for a sequel. I later read that this abrupt ending was apparently due to financial constraints and a sequel would only be possible with enough support of the first game\n\nSummary\nIt has design problems, bugs, obvious budget problems and wonderfully cheesy acting but I really enjoyed Contradiction in spite of itself. It was a flashback to the old puzzle games I played as a kid. All things considered, Contradiction is a pretty good first attempt at making a game for someone who has no experience doing this sort of thing. At the very least, I'm glad Follin is back doing things in the games industry and I hope he gets the funding and support to make a sequel so we can see what lessons were learned and what improvements can be made\n\nFor more game reviews, check out http://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/", "timestamp_created": 1444354789, "timestamp_updated": 1444354819, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18386748": {"recommendationid": "18386748", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014906882", "num_games_owned": 1755, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1444334052}, "language": "english", "review": "Watched someone play this game and I bought this game because it was so good.", "timestamp_created": 1444334069, "timestamp_updated": 1444334069, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18385405": {"recommendationid": "18385405", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965071551", "num_games_owned": 561, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 434, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1444326590}, "language": "english", "review": "PRO: An excellent game, really involving, good story.\nCON: Terrible, OTT acting from the main lead.\n", "timestamp_created": 1444327437, "timestamp_updated": 1444327437, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18383333": {"recommendationid": "18383333", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009807540", "num_games_owned": 461, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 634, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1444338374}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic FMV game, one of the few in the genre that I've truly enjoyed.

Contradiction, while it didn't get me into a serious mood, it did get me into a mood that made me really care about Jenks, very invested into Atlus, and wanting to close this case. Also, the actors... Though the acting is kind of weak at some points it really added to their personality and how you feel about them and this game (Jenks, Paul, Rebecca, and James being my faves).

You can't really mess this game up - you'll just be left to walking around until the puzzle solution dawns on you.

Not perfect, but almost certainly the best FMV game I've ever seen & quite possibly the best FVM game made so far. I made my way through it in just under 6 hours, and feel I got excellent value for money at that, because of the unique nature of the game when compared to most games out there.\n\nI played it solo and it's great fun that way, but I imagine it'd be even more awesome played with friends/family (that's certainly what I'm currently planning if/when there's another one - possibly even with this one once I've had time to forget enough of the specific contradictions). \n\nAnyway: the visual quality is great,  the soundtrack is awesome (both music and environmental sounds) and the acting is pretty much spot on for me. Yes Jenks is rather over the top, but I get the feeling he's meant to be. It certainly worked well for me, because Jenks, being 'my' character, ended up reflecting my sense of triumph at finding a contradiction, or my bafflement at asking about the same mundane thing again, as a result.\n\nThere are still things that could be improved. In a future patch, or a next instalment, I'd love to see hybrid keyboard/mouse control added. I preferred the mouse driven interface for questioning, but as things stand that meant also using the mouse to walk around, which I actually liked the keyboard better for. It's not a huge issue though, and the game is certainly quite playable with either.\n\nAt times it can also be annoying that the game doesn't permit follow-up questions except by finding contradictions. This is an inevitable limitation of the format, but it can be annoying to have spotted something (or have made a conjecture) and find yourself unable to ask about it for quite a while, until something comes along to create a contradiction that does allow you to ask about it at last.\n\n\n\nComing up: some minor spoilers, you have been warned!\n\n\n\nSorry, don't mean to bother you, but you have been warned about minor spoilers, right?\n\n\n\nYou're sure?\n\n\n\nQuite sure?\n\n\n\n[b]Spoiler Section![/b]\n\nOkay then, let's start with the ending. I'm fine with it, but can see where some people would find it annoying. Inspector Jenks gets his alien/man/woman/demon/killer-rabbit (I'm not going to spoil that much) as you would expect from a game like this. But a lot of other loose threads are left unresolved. For me personally there is enough closure this way to let the game stand alone, but quite a lot of it does seem to be setting up/teasing a sequel (and I enjoyed it enough that I hope it does get one).\n\nThe story does have a few weak spots, the most obvious one being Jenks having apparently no way to leave the village or call in support when he feels threatened. Or the fact that there's no way to request more information on anyone beyond what you're given in the introduction.\n\nStill, in the end, the story holds up well enough and makes an excellent vehicle for some terrific gameplay, which is what matters in this case.", "timestamp_created": 1443948668, "timestamp_updated": 1443948668, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18320092": {"recommendationid": "18320092", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983690518", "num_games_owned": 768, "num_reviews": 181, "playtime_forever": 224, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443958059}, "language": "english", "review": "I watched Jesse and Dodger play this and it was awesome so I had to give it a go myself.", "timestamp_created": 1443935466, "timestamp_updated": 1443935466, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501916", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18319939": {"recommendationid": "18319939", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970126700", "num_games_owned": 547, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442670557}, "language": "english", "review": "TLDR: Absolutely worth buying if you like FMV games (like Tex Murphy) or want to try them out. ~5-7hrs gameplay.\n\nAbsolutely loved the game, reminded me a lot of the old Tex Murphy games. Good mystery and suspense.

Having said that it is enjoyable enough to maybe play through a second time. For me personally the price felt about right for the content received. \n\nActual interactive gameplay is minimal, however the challenge and fun comes from finding the right contradictions within the interview system. \n\nThere is only a small amount of text acting as a tutorial and if you miss it some aspects of the game can be confusing and frustrating. Such as why can't I use one characters responses against someone else? . Once you get use to and understand the system however you will find it works really well within the game.\n\nThe main downsides from the game are twofold. \n\nFirstly the story feels incomplete like there needs to be a bit more to give a better conclusion to the Atlas sotryline. While you complete your origianl goal the ending feels somewhat abrupt. Hopefully a sequel or some DLC will fix this.\n\nSecondly the navigation feels clunky - with a lot of clicks to move around the place (a better mini map might be a suggestion, or better placed pins. Also there are a number of areas that are only used once in the entire game, yet remain clickable - there either needs to be things to do there, or they need to dissapear once you discover what you need to. \n\nOverall this was a great game, well worth playing and I eagerly await the sequel so I can rejoin Jenks on his investigations.\n\nLike others I ended up buying this because of the Jesse Cox and Dodger LP.", "timestamp_created": 1443934583, "timestamp_updated": 1443934583, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18317107": {"recommendationid": "18317107", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057201562", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 145, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443888467}, "language": "english", "review": "I absolutely love this game, especially Jenks quips, they're amazing xD but seriously, there's too many questions left undone and I REEEEEAAAAAAALLLY wanna know these mysteries behind Atlas, especially if it was named after the book Atlas, anyways I'm hoping for a sequel because of so many reasons!

I really love the delivery from the actors/actresses since that's the meat of the game when interrogating them as suspects (OMG Jenks!!! xD). \n\nAlso another aspect of Contradiction that should be praised are the different levels of hints available to you for support. If you get stuck after asking everyone around and collecting any items available at a time, you can call the Police Chief who can give you subtle hints as to where your should focus your attention on to progress through the game. If all else fails, the tips or \"cheats\" can give you straight answers, meaning the game itself bypasses the need to leave the game and look up the internet for solutions. This means you remain in the experience but also can afford to see solutions to your current problem without spoiling yourself with accidental glances at a whole walkthrough.\n\nThe music is subtle but very appropriate to this game with an orchestral flair. Upbeat as it may be at times, I also found that most of the time there seemed to be an overarching sombre atmosphere. This made me feel sad that as fun as playing a detective solving a mystery can be, the story is still dealing with a tragedy. Props to the soundtrack.\n\nGameplay wise, the choice between using the keyboard or mouse only is very much appreciated. Also the inclusion of an overhead map that is accessible at all times (except when interviewing suspects) really helped to get to places quicker than slowly walking scene by scene to places.\n\nIn terms of criticisms, I really don't have any at the moment except for two small things. Without getting into any spoilers, personally the ending was a bit rushed and left a few story threads unresolved. Also there aren't any branching paths in terms of progression meaning progression is rather linear. However having delved into a little history behind the development of this game, it was a marvel that the developer managed to create such a smooth and wonderful FMV gaming experience on such a small budget. Also the way the story is set up, a follow up sequel would definitely make sense to expand upon the intriguing world and characters introduced in Contradiction. \n\nBut don't let this intimidate you as I personally felt the majority of the story isn't necessarily left on a major cliff-hanger as this game presents a rather great self contained plotline with a potential for more on the horizon.\n\nAll in all, loved playing what is essentially a choose your own adventure game wrapped in a film like presentation.\n\nTL:DR Really fun game with a slick and simple interrogation system accompanied by hilarious characters with entertaining acting.", "timestamp_created": 1443873911, "timestamp_updated": 1443908100, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18302260": {"recommendationid": "18302260", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055071827", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 518, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443852719}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, would love a sequel.", "timestamp_created": 1443852825, "timestamp_updated": 1443852825, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18295296": {"recommendationid": "18295296", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042062909", "num_games_owned": 336, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449879155}, "language": "english", "review": "Contradiction is a fun and immersive experience for those who enjoy a FMV-style mystery game.

You will find yourself yelling at characters to notice things that seem so obvious but they totally ignore.  But if it can happen to Sherlock I can forgive them a bit.

If you like British television, especially their mysteries, or really any sort of whodunnit style entertainment then this will be right up your alley.

There's a distinct satisfaction in discovering that contradiction and seeing the text go green. The acting of Jenks IS over the top and sometimes threw me out of the story. He was wonderfully hammy and it wasn't horrible though. So while I comment on the acting, I also almost feel it was charming. The cast in general acted very well and I felt genuinely intimidated by one particular character even though he was somewhat stereotypical villain. They did a good job of rewarding falling back to check areas you've already been to. Overall, it's been a ton of fun and the only real qualm I have about it is sometimes the music got too loud... even when I had ambient music turned off so that it wouldn't echo in my chat with my friend. \n\nHonestly, considering how much fun it is to play with another friend, I'd love it if any future games like this considered some sort of chat integration or way to ease playing together rather than just timing it.

It's a quick but highly engrossing game with plenty of Christie-style twists and turns that should keep any player interested from start to finish.\n\nAll game play is HD full motion video with real actors.  This is part of the \"experimental\" aspect of the game.  The idea is that the player is interacting with a short movie, or possibly a TV show, on a fundamental level.  While I feel like the game missed that intended mark, the FMV added charm and personality to the game that traditional CG graphics wouldn't have achieved.  The acting is on-point.  The characters are stocky but effective.  The writing results in several genuinely heartfelt, menacing, and terrifying moments that make unlocking scenes and finding the next clue exhilarating.  The story is linear--there is one murderer with one motive--and while this doesn't bother me, I would be interested in seeing any future installments playing with a \"choose your own adventure\" theme.\n\nMechanically, Contradiction is a simple point-and-click adventure.  You use your mouse (or the arrows on your keyboard) to move around the map, choose clues from a list, and find contradictions.  It doesn't bring anything new to the genre, except for maybe the cut scenes, and it does fall into a lot of the same issues that other traditional adventure games are prone to.  My playthrough involved a lot of walking back and forth between locations whenever I got stuck, easily adding on another hour to an hour and a half to my play time.  There were also a few extended cut scenes that definitely felt like they were intended to be part of a longer interview section, but were gutted to meet the developers' very strict budget.\n\nI can't say that Contradiction is a difficult game.  The contradictions themselves, with an exception here and there, were easy enough to find.  Rather, Contradiction runs the risk of being frustrating.  There is a lot of evidence, a lot of characters, and a lot of dead ends and red herrings to sort through in order to get to the end of the game.  The game keeps track of everything each character has said, but it's on the player to remember what six different characters said about upwards of two dozen pieces of evidence.  Increasing potential frustration is the fact that contradictory statements have to come from the same character to count.  The player can't use what character A said against character B until character B slips up.  And then characters A through F say the exact same thing about a piece of evidence, which doesn't get you anywhere.\n\nAnd while I found the ending of the story to be satisfying and clever in hindsight, I thought that the last piece of evidence was a little disappointing, if only because it was maybe too obvious, especially after all of the running around we did.\n\nOverall, I would give Contradiction a 9/10.  The developers have done a lot with a simple concept by focusing on what makes the game unique.  By keeping it a relatively short game--5-7 hours tops--Contradiction stands out as an excellent Friday night game to share with friends.  Like any good story, there's room for speculation and growth.

The actor playing Jenks kept the entire story light and fun despite the dark connotations of the events. He might have gone a bit too far with silly faces from time to time but honestly it was refreshing and entertaining given nonstop wicked overtones.\n\nPros\nThe acting is well done for such a small budget, Jenks is straight up wacky in some scenes and calm and reflective in others. I cant imagine he takes his job too seriously. Its a shame because I feel like there are some specific scenes where acting more like a professional and being more concerned for his personal safety would add to the character rather then feel disjointed.\nThe musical score was very involved as well, gave a nonstop air of foreboding that really helped to set the mood and atmosphere of the game. It also sounded like the major plot points and reveals happened to often coincide with heavy piano notes being played. Could be my imagination but I think that it was done intentionally.\n\nCons\nThe interface was a bit jarring at first until you got used to it, various topics would highlight as green while others stayed blue but this didnt actually translate to any hints or topics you should try to converse next. It felt random and led to lots of extra time spent re-exploring topics that werent needed to find contradictions that didnt exist\nYou will find dozens of things that people say that are contradictory by definition that dont lead to cutscenes, this can be  frustrating over time as you feel that you caught a person in their lies but the payoff never results of actually discussing it with them. Likely this was an error of budget contraints or logical omissions in the games story and script. Either way I would highly encourage the developement team to either include cutscenes for each of these in future games, or more carefully write the dialog so that we dont spend half the game pouring over linking contradictions that aren't intended by the developer.", "timestamp_created": 1442715524, "timestamp_updated": 1442715524, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497678", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18109848": {"recommendationid": "18109848", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034297875", "num_games_owned": 4978, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 323, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442715137}, "language": "english", "review": "Best FMV adventure game in a long time, great actors and plot.", "timestamp_created": 1442715246, "timestamp_updated": 1442715246, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 140, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.816607", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18109757": {"recommendationid": "18109757", "author": {"steamid": "76561198211741119", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 438, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442713925}, "language": "english", "review": "creative and interesting murder mystery to solve! hope there is a sequel!", "timestamp_created": 1442714710, "timestamp_updated": 1442714710, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18108998": {"recommendationid": "18108998", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039114242", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442900181}, "language": "english", "review": "I watched Jesse Cox and Dodger play some of this game and I was incredibly excited to play it, but I've been waiting for it to load for over half an our now.

If you don't there's nothing here for you.\n\nQuestion is, is it good?\nThe short answer to that is yes. \nThe story is excellent. It's interesting and at every part you know what's going on, there's no real plotholes or things that seem too far fetched.\nThe acting is just lovable. It's serious, but it got charme and actually that charme keeps you playing. You just want to see the next line of dialoge. You want to see inspector Jenks asking \"what do you know about this?\". You want to see the response from the the villains. This could easily become a boring experience with the wrong actors, luckily they are just perfect, with Rupert Booth (Jenks) and Paul Darrow (Paul) easily the best. Everything also is also very fitting, the scenery, the directing, the edeting. Everything that is film in this game is just very good.\nAre the riddles good? - Yes they are. Without any more spoilers all the dialog riddles are good. It's enjoyable.\n\nSo are there any downsides? Certainly there are\nCharacter have a habit of conveniently dropping stuff on the floor - to the point of it beeing so ridicoulous, it's almost a running gag, seriously, if a character drops one item accidentally, it's believable, if it's rougly 10 items... it's a bit less believable. \nThe items are used to unlock sites and further conversation, These little item riddles are more for the immersion and the feeling of doing investigation outside the dialogs, but are real no-brainers. It's all very conveniently placed and the feeling of accomplishment isn't there in those moments, the meat is really in the dialog, not the item-riddles.\nThe interface isn't the best either, but the game can get away with it and my biggest complaint. The interface tends to bug out. Sometimes you can't click on stuff, have to go to the menu and come back. Really guys, in a game with such minimalistic gameplay, you can still do bugs?\nAlso there are several contradictions in the game, which you can't spot or can only spot later. There's a guy drinking whiskey and claiming there's no alcohol around. One guy claims to have known the victim, yet claims she was blonde, when the was in fact brunette and a couple more of these and most infamously, the last contradiction, which I won't give away at this point.\n\nAll in all the pros largly outweigh the cons for this game. Yes there is stuff I expect to be made better in a hopefully comming sequel, but nothing that diminishes the experience of this game. It's a nich\u00e9 game and if you aren't into this, it's certainly not for you, but it's one of these projects where the lacking budget had to be compensated with even more passion for the project and it shows. I had about 10 hours of fun out of this 10 bucks game. I was uncertain about the purchase at first, because it looks like a game that really easily could have failed at so many points.

The story is okay, but could have been solved almost immediately with the all-important clue being blatantly obvious and yet the option to compare and contrast the statements given yielded no results.  Not until the final in-game hour anyway.\n\nThen there are the elements of a paranormal/horror plot, which sadly was only touched upon and could have made this much more of a game. More than likely the budget constraints put paid to developing that plot, but at least there were little touches in the form of short scenes informing the player of potential events (one I recall being optional, that being the scene in the Reading Room where you're told to go away because \"we're about to start a session\").\n\nAs it stands, I achieved a 96% completion rate by the end of the game. This says to me that there is a way to solve another murder mystery that crops up, but there isn't any warning box/prompt before selecting the option that ends the game.\n\nYou cannot fail to get the murderer of the student that Inspector Jenks is investigating the death of, which for me makes the whole experience feel more like a guided tour that you unlock pieces of if you compare the right choices, but that's it. If Contradiction had much more of a budget? Then we could have had a potential Tex Murphy-esque game to play, but right now I can only recommend this to those who don't want to wait for the aforementioned (or any other) Let's Play to be completed or as a party game given that \u00a36.99 is a fair enough price and I got some enjoyment out of it with about 9 hours of play.\n\nAll said and done though, there is potential here and I would like to see the developer take another stab at making a detective adventure game.\n\nADDITIONAL: This, as per the game's Steam store page, is perhaps best played with two or more people as opposed to solo like I did. In that case, I'd say it would play out like a Cluedo-esque murder mystery evening. Approaching Contradiction in this manner would, in my view, override any qualms about the acting and improve the experience overall.\n\nThere are some glitches in the form of typos (\"North [i]Lane[/i]\" instead of \"North [i]Road[/i]\" when outside the pub) and also in the conversation with Rebecca (her name is sometimes spelled as \"Rbecca\" and a summary statement of hers that should start with \"Usually\" has been misspelled as \"Ususally\", I've preserved the casing for the developer to quickly get to the problem); Steam integration isn't perfect (the Steam overlay and the taking of screenshots isn't possible at this time); when you get to the end of the credits, the \"resume\" button is available and Jenks acts as though the conversation with the person-in-question ended normally, however the final end credit text is still overlaid on the screen and prevents access to the game's UI (ALT+F4 to the rescue at that point).  Given the developer is [b]very[/b] quick at updating (again, as per the game's Steam store page), I expect all these will be fixed soon enough.\n\nI vaguely recall other typos being present, but I can't recall them right now. To the developer, be assured I mean no disrespect and I have added all this to help you/yourselves in refining your game. :)\n\nFurthermore, I've tidied up my own review for the purposes of clarity. :)", "timestamp_created": 1442477224, "timestamp_updated": 1442530161, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 246, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.895091", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18067184": {"recommendationid": "18067184", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018862288", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442459383}, "language": "english", "review": "I had high hopes for this game but unfortunately, despite a shiny exterior, it left me frustrated and bored.  I'll start with the bad and then skip to the good stuff:\n\n1. I quickly tired of circling around and around and around and around asking a handful of characters one or two questions at a time.  I appreciate that the makers *tried* to make it less repetitive by letting us skip around on the map but it was still a couple steps each time - e.g. to get from Simon's to Atlas, you could skip all the way across the map, but then you had to click to get into the grounds, click to get into the entryway, click to get into the next room (forget what it's called), then click to get into Ryan's office.  Every time you wanted to visit.  It just got VERY boring going James-Rebecca-Simon/Emma-Ryan-Ryan-Simon/Emma-Rebecca/James, with the occasional search the woods & call the chief thrown in for, uh... variety?\n\n2. Semi-related to the above, one's pace in the game felt extremely restricted.  I couldn't decide I wanted to ask about \"such and such\", I had to wait for the game to let me.  I couldn't decide \"I want to go further this way\", I had to wait for the game to let me.  What was really frustrating was when I looked up the solution and a major clue - as I see someone else in another negative review has already mentioned - shows up almost immediately, and you *can't ask about it*.  I mean it's so bloody obvious that I wasted a lot of time in the beginning trying to *find* a way to ask about it because it seemed impossible that an actual inspector wouldn't take one look at that clue and say \"... hey, waitaminute.\"  I eventually gave up, but throughout the game I felt like the questioning method functioned the way it did just to slow you down and increase the gametime (e.g. you have to find something *one* character has contradicted themselves on, you can't say \"hang on, so and so said this about you and that contradicts what you said\" - again, what kind of lousy, lousy detective would you have to be...?), and that, well, kind of reinforces that feeling.\n\nThings I did love:\n\n1. The live video idea is a lot of fun and I admired it even as I grew more and more bored with the actual story.  I would like to see this done again, just with a less repetitive, restrictive game behind it.  I especially like the guy playing Jenks (he's very clearly enjoying the hell out of himself) but of all the characters I saw, they were all doing a good job at the acting - which you can't always depend on in smaller games.\n\n2. I really love the system where you can ask for hints or outright 'cheats' without any real punishment (except a 'count' of cheats if you use those).  I've always felt that story-based games might as well let people who aren't as good of players enjoy the game by giving them a helping hand - it's a lot less intrusive to the story to be able to click on a quick 'hint' icon and get a nudge in the right direction than to alt-tab out, go search for a walkthrough, try and find the point you need without spoiling yourself for the rest of the game, alt-tab back in and continue.\n\n3. Despite my complaint above, I do like *some* of how questioning was set up - i.e. you had a list of things you wanted to ask about, it let you know if you'd already asked them and kept a record of their responses, and you could review people's responses by person or by item.

I'm not gonna lie, at first I expected a disaster because the premise reminded me a lot of the FMV fad in the 80's and 90's, where you could get these \"interactive movies\" that had little prompts pop up on the screen sometimes and you could use the remote to choose what will happen. Haven't heard about those? No wonder, the fad never really caught on, and for good reason: IT WAS HORRIBLE. The story was almost always stupid as hell, the acting was atrocious and the production value usually rivaled a ground school drama play. But it wasn't always just movies, FMV was mixed into video games at the time, which made it even worse. The corny acting and pixelated, low-res video was jarring against the blocky 2D (or faux-3D) graphics of the era. In short, technology just wasn't there yet. Fast-forward 20 years, and we get Contradiction. I'll be honest, I didn't expect much, but the premise of seeing an FMV disaster after so many years just made me itch for nostalgia. It was surprisingly cheap, so I bought it for sh!ts and giggles. Turns out, I was wrong on so many levels. \n\nApparently, technology advanced far enough to make FMV a pretty damn viable form of storytelling. Contradiction looks very good! High definition video, pretty locations with nice sets and I really liked the little cutscenes of transitioning between shots/scenes. Most of the locations have different views depending on where we arrive from, it's a nice little touch that adds a lot to the immersion I think. The technical aspect is also nice, really good editing, shot composition and angles, it's all unexpectedly high quality work for a pretty low-budget production. But, not matter how pretty the window-dressing is, what makes or breaks a medium like this, is the acting and the story. \n\nThe acting is...okay. Which in itself is far better than any FMV thing I've seen back in the day. The actors' performances range from \"pretty good\" to \"don't quit your dayjob\". I really liked Paul, Emma and Rebecca was okay, the rest of the cast is kinda forgettable. Except for one guy, Inspector Jenks, who was pretty much a disaster. This is particularly bad, since he is the protagonist, and we have to watch him all the time! His performance is truly cringe-worthy, the guy dreadfully overacts every single line, so he comes off more like a circus clown instead of a police inspector. It really grates on you, it's nails-on-chalkboard level at some parts, so the game becomes more of an endurance test instead of a detective story. (I would criticize Ryan's performance too, but since that character was designed to be a pompous, annoying jerk, I can only say: mission friggin accomplished!)\n\nAs for the story: it's better than I expected. It has a few twists and turns, but nothing spectacular. There is more mystery and intensity in an episode of Murder She Wrote, but Contradiction essentially being an amateur garage project, you can't really expect Sherlock-level storytelling, can you? It starts out really strong and keeps the interest up with new reveals and builds momentum constantly, but...there is one huge problem: the ending. I won't spoil anything, but this was without doubt one of the worst, flimsiest endings I've seen in a long while. The story was doing a great job of building up to a potentially grand finale, and at the very end it just goes and throws all that away in favor of a shoddy cop-out. I don't get it, if it's supposed to be sequel-bait or something like that, but it really overshadowed the whole experience for me...\n\nFor gameplay, well, there isn't much to tell. It's a sort of \"point&click for dummies\". The game mainly consists of interrogating people around town about facts or things you've found, and finding contradictions in their answers (hence the title). At first, it's pretty straightforward, but as the story unfolds, your list of clues and answers grows exponentially, to the point you'll be strained to sift through everything when looking for contradictions. Some of them are quite hard to get, so sometimes it devolves into flat out guesswork or the good 'ol \"rub everything on everything until something works\" method puzzle solving. Thankfully, the game is pretty generous about handing out tips, and there is even a cheat system, when activated, it outright tells you what you should do next...you know, in case you wanna rob yourself of actually playing the game.\n\nDespite all the criticism I leveled at Contradiction, it was truly a nice surprise. It's an FMV video game that DOESN'T SUCK, in fact, it's pretty decent for what it is. It's surprisingly cheap and has plenty of content. It's an enjoyable detective story with a few good twists, and if you can excuse the tedious endgame and the terrible finale, it's a really nice experience! I'll be getting the sequel, if there's ever gonna be one. I really recommend this game if you wanna try something unique, or if you wanna finally wash off that awful taste those old and horrible FMV games left you with all those years ago :)", "timestamp_created": 1442355606, "timestamp_updated": 1442355606, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18047999": {"recommendationid": "18047999", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966620466", "num_games_owned": 552, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 412, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442345504}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Written, directed and produced by Tommy Wiseau[/h1]\n\nI cannot put into words, how stupid this game was.

There are a couple loose ends at the finish.  Nothing too annoying.. but rather obvious (So wait.. but what about that guy? -  sort of thing) 3. For 99% of the story, you don't really feel like you're getting any closer to solving the mystery but are just randomly collecting miscellaneous clues, character backstory,  and factoids.  Then literally right at the end, the very last thing you do  - is get a Columbo confession out of someone - where the perp could literally avoid capture by just shrugging their shoulders and saying \"Yeah I dunno,  that IS weird inspector.\" So rushed ending,  could have used more characters.  perhaps a more convenient clue system.

Contradiction didn't have any of these problems and is one of the only adventure games I have ever completely finished. The story was captivating. By using real actors (only two of which had talent, but the rest were decent enough) and very high-quality video, the game made the story feel real and compelling. Inventory puzzles are downplayed (almost non-existent) and are replaced instead by dialog puzzles. Basically, to win the game, you need to interview the towns people, carefully listen to and understand everything that everyone is saying. By cross-interwiewing multiple people, contradictions in their stories emerge and by identifying these contradictions, you unlock new clues, new suspects, and new bits of the story. Despite the fact that that this game feels a lot like a British mystery TV mini-series, the interactivity is still quite high as it is up to you to figure things out. The puzzles are all logical but often not immediatley obvious, making this a satisfying and well-balanced game.

I found them all interesting and compelling. Some of them had me fooled and at times I would go back and forth as to who was the murderer. \n\nThe narrative itself was engaging and drew me into the story's web of characters and contradictions. I kept wanting to play more and more to learn about Atlus and the mysterious circumstances of Kate Vine's death. There wasn't really a dull moment. However, there are some red herrings scattered about and some loose ends that don't get tied up by the end. I found these issues to be a double edged sword. On one hand, they leave you wanting more but on the other, it seems that the writers just didn't know where else to go or didn't have the resources to flesh out certain plot points. \n\nFinally, the contradictions: the game is based around finding the contradictions among the witnesses. The system works, for the most part, and really shines when various contradictions jump at you and you have an \"Ah-ha!\" moment. Some contradictions, however, were tenuous at best. In fact, I think some could be argued not to be contradictions at all, yet the game will not progress unless they are pointed out. I regrettably had to look at a walkthrough after getting stumped two times. I hated the fact that I couldn't find the remaining contradiction those times. When I learned what it was that I missed, I found myself rolling my eyes because the contradiction was a little too convoluted to have spotted and wasn't really intuitive.

Everything is saturated with style and charm, including the main character. Your job is to guide our detective as he interviews and gathers clues in this seemingly dickensian like village. Of course not everything is at it appears and it up to you to unravel the mystery. Being a FMV(Full-Motion Video) game, Contradiction is completely based off its acting. Which it does exquisitely. The mechanics of the game while very simple, are complimented by the clever writing and eerie atmosphere. As hours go by in the game, more of the story is slowly revealed to you and the plot thickens. The contradiction system in the game has you matching statements and clues, trying to catch suspects in a lie. This isn't easy in the least but there are helpful hint systems in place if you do get stuck. While many will compare this with Her Story, this is a completely different experience. You are far more involved and progress is completely based on your keen senses of listening and deduction. There are times that Contradiction can feel a little cheesy but that all plays into the genre of the game.

Looking at previous titles however makes me wonder if it truly was ever popular, as many FMV titles seemed to be all about the technology and visual wow factor rather than the gameplay or story-telling aspects. Contradiction must be familiar with this trend as it shirks the all style, shallow substance method, and instead brings an engaging story with a varied, likable cast who\u2019s performances only add to the experience as you progress along the game... Even if most of said performances are outright the most bizarre, silly examples of acting I\u2019ve ever seen. (It\u2019s a good thing, really.)\n\nContradiction is set entirely within and around the limits of the sleepy British village of Edenton, and has the player character, Inspector Jenks, investigating the apparent suicide of a resident. There\u2019s a pseudo time limit to complete the case, but each passing hour acts like a chapter, rather than pressure to hustle you along. Being an adventure game, hopping around the different areas will reveal potential clues to pick up, events revealing new characters, or more information on your current suspects once your leads have run dry. Jenks\u2019 journal at first has only a handful of clues and subjects, but getting your gumshoe on will eventually have a plethora of possible lines of questioning (and a few red herrings, to be expected) to use on people of interest. Most of your time will be spent interviewing the various Edenton residents with said collection of clues, and unlocking more subjects in the process. This is where Contradiction\u2019s gameplay lies, as you might expect in a game based on police investigation, people end up lying or trying to mislead you, and Jenks must use their testimony against them by taking two statements to reveal a titular contradiction, and break the witness\u2019 lie to get the truth - Or more fibbing. Rinse and repeat until the game is over. While this sounds like it would become mighty old in a mighty hurry, the actors and their performances is what keeps the game engaging right to the closing credits... Not because of sheer brilliance that should be reserved for Broadway, but because of the sheer campy, humorous way in which things take place.\n\nI wonder if the director is secretly a mad genius, since the acting can get so silly at times yet remain so believable that it\u2019s both comical and interesting how characters won\u2019t react or call out each others quirks, save for moments of intense emotion. I will confess my expertise on live action acting is severely lacking in order for me to truly explain performances, but look up some videos and you\u2019ll begin to understand what I mean. The way Simon (Magnus Sinding) seems to act sketchy and suspicious after nearly every question he answers, the way Rebecca (Melanie Gray) hardly budges in her seat and speaks like she is in ownership of an evil spy empire, how Ryan (John Guilor) cannot help but speak and gesture like he is always trying to impress, and his posh-ness makes it impossible not to giggle at him constantly. And of course there\u2019s Jenks (Rupert Booth), who\u2019s wild eyes, head bobs and expressions make me wonder if it\u2019s a police tactic to seem a bit weird in order to lower the guard of witnesses. I am certain that if the actors played the script straight and with the severity that the story had, this would be a much tamer if not duller experience. The campy acting may not be for everyone, but I can only applaud the actors and director for allowing the goofiness to run rampant and free, entertaining the player more for it.\n\nAfter the praises I have previously sung, my complaints against Contradiction are quite minor, and are generally tied to the menus. At some point, you will end up with a lot of clues and subjects to sift through, which can be an annoyance when looking for two specific statements to use as contradiction fodder. You\u2019re given a master list of testimony to thumb through everyone\u2019s answers regarding a certain clue which is nice and all, but the game follows a very tight script on what is and is not a contradiction, and the script doesn\u2019t budge for lesser lies. Things that should feel contradictory are ignored, as the game only wants the big, apparent lies to be revealed to keep the intrigue and story going. Still, it\u2019s quite satisfying when Jenks finds a contradiction, as he goes from generally friendly and approachable to snarky, sarcastic and borderline demeaning once he catches someone in a lie, and watching the witness squirm is only icing on that cake.\n\nI like Contradiction a whole bunch. The acting is wonderfully nutty, the story is dark yet becomes very engaging as more is revealed regarding the secrets of Atlas and the skeletons in everyone\u2019s closets, and one can see their way to the end in about five or six hours.

The gameplay really focuses on the player finding contradictions in people\u2018s statements and reactions to items you show them and tales that you tell them.

There were actually a good number of tense moments, and, whether by the drama, mystery or comedy of it, I was enraptured by the game throughout my entire experience.\n\nThe choices feel somewhat constricting at first, as your map, cast of characters and actions are quite small, but as the game progresses the first two grow somewhat and the latter exponentially.  As stated before, there were many a time during the course of the game that I sat there, befuddled, trying to put the pieces together and not realizing I had spent half an hour or so doing so.  I absolutely loved the ability of the game to keep the pacing nice and light but also engaging and entertaining.\n\nI'll sum this up by saying this was an immensely pleasant surprise, especially considering it was done off of Kickstarter (which seems to have a reputation for producing big expectations and equally big let downs).  I actually went into this experience expecting to be let down (disclaimer: hadn't been a big fan of FMV games) and pretty much having my socks knocked off.\n\nIf I had to criticize about this game at all, it would be the following:\n\n-A few times I wasn't able to actually select two options to see if they were contradictions.  I would have to exit the screen and re-enter it to do so.  This, to my awareness, is the only bug in the game.\n-It would have been fun to be able to interact with the environment in a little more detail, rather than just having a magnifying glass pop up that leads me directly to an important clue.\n-It may have been more enjoyable to be able to choose some of the questions while interrogating suspects, at least some of the follow up questions.\n\nPlease bear in mind absolutely none of those \"faults\" detracted from the game at all.  There was absolutely no point where I felt disappointed nor did any of them detract from the immersion.  This is to say, even if the next game contained the very same flaws, I would still play it without complaint.\n\nIn terms of value, I would say if you are either a fan of FMV style games, murder mysteries, or (even better), both, you absolutely must play this game.  It is worth every penny of it's $10 price tag, possibly more.\n\nIf not, I would still recommend it, but may be better to wait until its on sale.\n\nFor those who have played it and loved the experience, please comment.  We need to support more efforts like this, and I am frankly on pins and needles waiting for the sequel (which I will absolutely pay full price for, no hesitation).", "timestamp_created": 1439518436, "timestamp_updated": 1439518436, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17525437": {"recommendationid": "17525437", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981234632", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 988, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508531931}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best games i have played in 2015.

I think the biggest weaknesses were the sheer amount of back and forth; a staple of the genre, but seemed odd here, that people were happy for you to keep dropping in at any time of the evening and act like nothing had happened? I understand this will be required to a certain extent, and appreciate that the developers didn't have much to play with, but it just seemed a little odd.\n\nThe other is that sometimes the summaries of statements made by the characters seemed too similar. There was one particular point where I ended up using the \"cheat\" function because I was stumped, only to discover I had basically found the contradiction, I just hadn't combined the particular statements the game had expected. Though for the most part this wasn't a problem, and the amount of red herring statements was great actually, did give it some depth and difficulty, as well as fleshing out the characters.\n\nThe characters were pretty decent too, and the acting was actually really good, very cleverly done that it was hammed up the TINIEST bit, which lulled you into the tone and made it all much easier to take in. \n\nThe other main problem I had is that the final deduction you have to make to complete the game is reliant on you picking up on something you see only once (as far as I could tell) right at the beginning of the game. Now, to me, it stuck out like a sore thumb and I wanted to be able to follow up on it far sooner, so it was frustrating that it ended up being brought into it as the solution right at the end... however, if I hadn't noticed it then I would have been tearing my hair out trying to figure out what the game was getting at. This wouldn't have been so much of a problem if it was a mid-game puzzle, but as it was literally the final player action it left me underwhelmed.\n\nThe ending itself I liked though, although it left a lot of loose ends (which is explicitly acknowledged in the dialogue) it seemed believeable enough in the context of everything else, and the detective/police procedural TV shows that the game is obviously inspired by.\n\nI also loved the music and actually found the keyboard control scheme pretty good, once I'd gotten used to its quirks. The cinematography was great too, lovely colour grading on the day-for-night footage. \n\nI do hope that the game is a success and continues to get great reviews, because I would love to see what the team behind this could do with a bit more scope and budget. Something with more varied locations, and perhaps even multiple cases? Maybe this isn't viable, but I would be more than happy to pay \u00a330 for a sequel with 20-30hrs content spread over four cases with subtle links, like the Ace Attourney games.

The hint system also works well, providing subtle clues if needed, as well as \"cheats\" if completely stuck\nFMV sequences- Overall, the quality of the video is fantastic, though the sound quality could perhaps be slightly better in one or two scenes, though its nothing terrible, and an extremely minor complaint\nWriting/plot - Generally, the plot is interesting (again, im only through half of it). I feel, thus far, that the quality of the writing is fairly well done as well, and the actors portraying the characters do a good job at making them seem believable.\nFinal thoughts- I think for the 10 dollar price tag this game is easily more than worth it.

I loved this one.\n\nThis is a nice FMV detective game with lots of charismatic characters and surprisingly engaging story. It's just enough hammy to be unforgettably charming and just enough serious to be actually interesting. It has quite simple and no fail-state design with very stylish presentation and not too much unskippable repeating imagery and very simplistic, but interesting gameplay focused on interviewing people and crossreferencing the things you are being told. There's just enough interaction and thinking to spot the contradictions and just enough entertaining watching parts with dialogue for the game to not get boring in the 3-5 hours it lasts.\n\nIt does have some issues - the controls for the game are surprisingly clunky and do not use mouse at all for one. A rather strange choice for the clearly point-and-click-perfect game, although, this may have been intended for touch controls, hence the werid limitation. The story focuses a lot on the bigger plot for most of the game, which doesn't actually get resolved by the end, with only the initial whodunit potential murder being solved, while everything else left for the openly hinted potential continuation. And the game doesn't really have enough contradiction gameplay happening overall - there's tons of facts you can gather, but most reveals happen in quick succession due to one-two new items or encounters, and then don't happen at all no matter how much you talk to different characters about different things. Game being linear and having encounters you need to get around town to progress the story (most of which just happen, you don't expect them to) also doesn't help the situation. All these things are not deal breakers, but certainly aren't good.\n\nOverall, this game was very fun to play and I'd love to see more of these characters.", "timestamp_created": 1438879331, "timestamp_updated": 1438879331, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500727", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17408799": {"recommendationid": "17408799", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969597072", "num_games_owned": 707, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 485, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474084786}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely fantastic game.

He has been sent to check this little Twin Peaksy town somewhere in England (I presume), because someone there has died under suspicious circumstances involving a suicide claim, a creepy business school and alcohol.\n\nOur protagonist seems to be a tad old-fashioned, as he goes around asking questions and generally snooping around the town. The main game mechanism is to review the statements people give you and then call any contradictions you might find in their answers. Now let me say it: this is the coolest aspect of the game! We had tremendous amount of fun and frustration alike trying to spot the one or two contradictions in the rather large amount of statements. Some of them are dead obvious, while others are sneaky as a still animal in a forest: hiding in plain sight but hidden by the vegetation. Sometimes you even have to listen their statements again to get that piece of missing information.\n\nSpeaking of forest again, this broke us to a small inside joke that I'll give out here as a tip: if you don't know what to do, go to the woods because random shit happens in the woods and sometimes that's the only way to go forward. This is because to ask questions you got to have questions and you could find additional evidence in all kinds of places. In addition to exploration the progression sometimes involves minor puzzle solving like using items in correct places but nothing fancier than that.\n\nStory is all paced through one busy evening, during which you meet the quirky locals: various students, misfits and businessmen and -women. Everyone seems to know more than they are letting out. Acting is nice despite the actors being fairly unknown. Editing has been done very well, movement between places by video feels fluid and quite natural. I am not totally sure if Mr. Jenks' actor was taking it seriously though as his actor could be described as rather \"expressive\": he was making surprised and curious faces all the time, which was frankly pretty hilarious and actually fits the quirky detective-type.\n\nThere are four minor flaws I must bring to attention. The most serious one is perhaps the user interface. To be honest it isn't that bad once you get used to it, but when you start playing it can be confusing. Walking around map and asking questions is easy enough (just using arrow keys and Enter), but there are three special buttons that are at default mapped to 'A' (menu key), 'D' and 'S'. Especially the menu key is weird, as 'Esc' would be the logical one. For all I know these issues could and hopefully will be addressed in the future. For example, when we played it there was no mouse support yet but it's being implemented bit by bit as you read. \n\nThe other minor qualm is the lack of Steam Overlay (so you can't take screenshots in the regular Steam-fashion). Also for some reason the unlocked contradictions and event videos have been hidden in the main menu instead of, for example, a log book or similar that would feel more logical or authentic. Finally, in the outdoor areas there were occasional green screens, a flicker of sorts, like the video was \"cut\" and suddenly restarted. This was a minor annoyance but might be an issue of editing or perhaps my rig.\n\nNow, an observant reader will have noticed me referring to \"us\" multiple times. We would play this with my wife every evening for several days and she would anxiously wait for me from work so that we could continue the game, unusual as normally she'd just play or watch whatever: I deduce she really enjoyed it. It took us 18 hours to finish the whole story (which is actually just a few hours long) and we enjoyed it thoroughly, only having a couple of frustrating moments when we were stuck at some part of the story.\n\nContradiction was a very nice experience and it stayed exciting throughout. We bought it at full price of 10 euros, which in my opinion was cheap for this game: I would have happily paid at least 15 or 20 euros for this.

I'll say this is patently false. On top of the hint system, players can call the Chief, and even get flat-out cheats to help them along when needed.

By saying the game should directly tell the players when new events are available at locations, when contradictions are left to be made -- and with whom -- the author only put his inability to appreciate freedom on display. TellTale's The Walking Dead this is not. This is very much a game, and not an interactive story. The only valid point that review brought forth is the game's technical shortcomings; it is true that the lack of resolution options is jarring, and the general UI and presentation is odd at first. But not only is it absolutely not a deal breaker, I feel like it kind of gave the game a very distinct, simple vibe. It was never distracting or frustrating. It took me a couple of minutes to get used to it, then I never gave it a thought again.\n\nReally, for all fans of classic, hardcore adventure games, looking for a modern take (in terms of presentation) on the classic genre, Contradiction is a gift from the Gods.

This is what the FMV games of old always aspired to be but could never actually quite achieve.\n\nContradiction is a fittingly theatrical experience that plays just like an interactive movie. You play as Inspector Jenks, who is merely a polite and humble police officer going about his job. Little else is shown about Jenks, except for occasionally emphasized spades of moral fortitude and righteous indignation, and helpful hints and speculations in the form of brief inner monologues. His more hollowed out vagueness serves as an appropriate vessel for the player to experience the story in, where the progress of the plot hinges on their every move, while managing to avoid coming off cliche or one-dimensional.\n\nJenks is investigating the death of a young woman named Kate Vine who was found in a lake in the woods, and has less than an entire day to solve the mystery (fortunately, the game does not progress in real time or possess a time limit, or else this would be much more difficult). His suspects and witnesses include a well-rounded cast of characters each with their own quirks and individuality, each of whom are equally amusing and interesting. \n\nContradiction is a thoroughly cerebral experience, as it requires you to constantly remain engaged in every detail you come across, similar to how classic Sierra Adventure games encourage players to explore every proverbial nook and cranny. The game doesn't hold your hand when you feel sure enough to try to figure things out on your own, but will give you just enough information to get back on track when you're stuck. You progress by investigating numerous places and seeking out evidence, as well as interviewing suspects and witnesses and checking the evidence against them, as well as their responses to that evidence, and whether or not their stories add up.\n\nUsing only filmed footage and photographs in place of computer generated graphics, it works remarkably well with presenting a gorgeous environment and sets, along with aesthetically pleasant costume designs. Even more impressively so given that it was all shot on a low budget, funnily enough reminiscent of the kind of thing you might see on BBC.\n\nThe acting may not exactly be Oscar worthy, but is still quite well done. Overall, the game's cinematic presence is easy to appreciate. With just the right balance between a plucky Sherlock mystery and a seedy film noir, it establishes a darkly playful tone, feeling right at home with themes such as the occult and Satanic forces, along with a balanced critique of Objectivism not unlike the first BioShock (major plot points even revolve around an institution called Atlas being run by a father and son team named the Rands; at one point, the phrase \"greed is good\" is quoted).\n\nFor $9.99, Contradiction is worth the price. The overall length of the game itself may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I believe that it ultimately depends on how quickly the player can figure out what's going on and whether or not they ever want to rely on any hints or cheats. I could also see replay value in trying it again after some time, like The Wolf Among Us, and it would be a delight to share with friends and watching them try to unravel the mystery. The game even ends with the tentative teasing of a sequel, left on such an open ended note that it just begs to be made. This would be an absolute steal on sale, and a solid investment at full price.

It works just enough that you can play the game\n-You can only ask characters about their own statements - you can't ask them about the statements of others.

It does a great job of keeping the plot moving. \n\nThe director of the game has you watching the faces of each character intently, with close ups on the eyes, and body language cues.

The acting is SUPERB, rivalling a solid BBC whodunnit. Rupert Booth as Jenks was excellent, oozing charm and wit. (And THE CAMP. Oh my lord, the CAMP. When Jenks turns to each suspect in turn and flourishes his hand into the \"devil sign\" asking people if they know \"WHAT THIS MEANS\", in ever more over the top ways, I near fell over laughing.) Paul Darrow as Paul was incredible as well, with his tongue flicks and delightful inflections at the end of select, tasty words. The rest of the cast was excellent as well! (Shout out to James, that ol' rogue. What a character he was.)\n\nThe writing was top notch, with believable dialogue and realistic fast paced storyline. Solid mystery whodunnit with multiple believable suspects, and an overarching mysterious setting.\n\nThe actual main/inventive game mechanic of \"Contradiction\", of catching the statements that don't line up - to piece together the mystery, is unlike anything I've played in this genre. Quite fun, challenging, and enjoyable. Also, very much enjoyed how the map/world unfolded as you progressed through the game, each area unlocking as the night progressed.\n\nThe score was tremendous, weaving in an out mid-FMV scene, and as the mystery started unfolding. VERY seamless.\n\nThe only 2 minor gripes I had were, A) the control scheme at default on PC was a bit wonky, compared to the standard for this genre, but the keys are all customizable, so it's fine. Wish there was some actual use for the mouse as input though. Would have loved a bit more challenge looking for the clues.\nB) At times the audio seemed inconsistent and muffled. Different interrogation locations, had a different tone to their recording. After a little while I got used to it, but for a game with as EXTREMELY high production values as this, I just felt it to be a bit jarring.\n\nStill, if you have ever felt the joy or love of a good whodunnit, in ANY form, be it BBC dramas or video games like the Sherlock Holmes or \"The Raven\" series, you will CERTAINLY enjoy this. You will be wrapped up in the story, obsessively trying to find the culprit and come to the ending, and enjoying it all the while.\n\nAlso, check this link (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzQFPkAerfw) out at 7 minute mark: One of the actors, Paul Guilor (played Ryan) explained that he thought it was important to ham the acting up and advised Rupert Booth (Jenks) to do so as well.

The game has a novel problem solving engine which involves identifying contradictions in individual character statements.  The interface was a bit unusual, and took some time to get used to, but was also weirdly satisfying once the routines sunk in.  The story is compelling and the characters have the right balance of richness dimensionality for a story of this kind.  A couple complaints would be that the storyline itself has some small internal inconsistencies, which are not identified as contradictions within the gameplay.  This proved to be mildly frustrating at times.  The other complaint would be that the process of finding contradictions only took place character-by-character and not across characters (unless it happened to come up in that context).  This made the game more manageable as a puzzler, and still satisfying.  But there were times when characters would say contradictory things with respect to each other, and there was no way to cross examine suspects and access those kind of conversation threads.

That said, I jumped at the chance to play through Contradiction, an adventure game with a bit of a twist on the traditional formula -- there's actually no \"point and click\". The character you control, Inspector Jenks, is controlled entirely via a few keyboard keys. Furthermore, the vast majority of puzzles are dialogue-driven (spotting contradictions in the statements of Edenton village's residents). There are few inventory-based puzzles, but the use of inventory items is very simplified, so just a heads up in case you were expecting more traditional adventure game elements such as combining inventory items.\n\nThis different take on adventure gaming is refreshing, and I found myself growing to like Jenks' character quite a lot, as he charmingly asks questions regarding the suspicious death of a university student, Kate Vine. Afternoon turns to evening as Jenks' investigation progresses, and I loved how the atmosphere got a bit more suspenseful as time went on. It's the \"little things\" that demonstrated so much attention to detail that impressed me -- for example, as Jenks walks past a bush, its leaves rustle in the wind, showing us that as night approaches, things are getting a bit more eery. The camera-work in this adventure game is excellent, as is the music soundtrack. The acting overall isn't bad, and I was very happy with the game interface. I particularly enjoyed being able to fast-travel to hotspots within the village via the map (the \"d\" key by default), as well as the handy built-in hint system, accessed via \"a\". The hint system gives the player a gentle nudge in the right direction without any spoilers, and it was a very cool thing to see.\n\nWhile I could go on about the many things I enjoyed about Contradiction, I want to stress that I don't think the actual storyline was of a very high standard. I've written a bit more about my opinion on the storyline at the end of the review, underneath a MINOR SPOILER warning.\n\n[b]TLDR; I recommend this game, but with reservations.[/b] The actual dialogue-driven puzzle-solving is excellent, as is the general atmosphere (to include cinematography and music). However, I think the storyline gets more and more ridiculous as Jenks' evening progresses, to the point where there really is no cohesion in storytelling (in my opinion).\n\n[b]MINOR SPOILER REGARDING THE INVESTIGATION SUBJECT MATTER BELOW:[/b]\n\nAs Jenks' delves deeper into Kate's mysterious death, he stumbles upon the subject matters of hallucinogens, paganism, business ethics, mind control, AND satanism.

I do enjoy adventure games and the nostalgia of FMV, so I'm a little biased.  I thought the dialogue got the job done, and the acting (ranging from campy to outright ridiculous \\m/\u0337  ) certainly sold it to me.  There isn't much in terms of gameplay beyond cycling through dialogue regarding evidence and notes you happen upon in your adventuring while weighing potential contradictions, but I think the minimalism of this approach works in the game's favor.  It's refreshing to enjoy an FMV game that isn't too cumbersome about gameplay for this price! While I was a little mixed about the ending, I'm okay with it being an issue of time and budget on the developer's end, I still think the overall package presented of Contradiction is awesome and I'm definitely left wanting for a sequel.  \n\nBy the way (this is a bit of a tangent), if people liked the darker undertones of this and was looking for something even more graphic and unsettling while being open to the prospect of digging up a visual novel, Kara no Shoujo is probably my all time favorite among murder mysteries across gaming media.

You play as Inspector Jenks, a British Policeman who goes to investigate the death of a girl named Katie in a small outskirt village. Her death was investigated and called a suicide, but there was morphine in her blood at her time of death and her driver's license was pinned to a tree in the forest away from the scene of her death, leading our character to suspect there's more involved in this case which he takes personal interest in. His work quickly leads him to find there is indeed something going on in this town...\n\nSo, like many FMV games, this game does have an edge of B-charm, laugh-out-loud moments, a lot of this comes from some of the acting and facial expressions the actors can have in specific scenes. But that's not to say this is a so-bad-it's-good type of game, in fact the opposite, it actually got kind of gripping as it developed and in contrast some moments were acted out rather well. It's got a multi-layered mystery that gets deeper and deeper as the night goes on, and is actually surprisingly interesting.\n\nGameplay is rather basic. You walk around a town and look for clues hidden about, and people to interview. When you interview people, you take out clues, both physical and conversation topics you earn from talking to others, and watch FMV scenes as they interact. When the scene is done, your character has taken 'notes' to the key points of the discussion. You then can take the key notes from that discussion, and every other discussion you've had with that character, and try and spot any 'contradictions' the character may have said. If you find a contradicting point, it triggers another scene, which either will lead to you having to do further digging or creates a new conversation topic you can raise up to others. Other conversation topics can be found around as objects or weird things in town that strike up a good conversation topic, and some rare objects found can be used to explore deeper certain areas in the village.\n\nThe game has a solid cast of something like 10 main characters, and is backed by some rather good-quality video for the backgrounds, FMV scenes, etc., and an actually pretty wonderful soundtrack. Music added a lot to specific scenes, and there were a few moments without music where you can hear the atmosphere sounds and drone noises that made some scenes legitimately creepy. On that, while the game is down-toned most of the time, there's the odd scene that plays every once in a while that can catch you off-guard, something that's just kind of creepy, or unexpected, shocking in some cases. I won't spoil anything with that, but the game has a few sudden scenes that happen as you investigate that might catch you off-guard.\n\nIt's got a few minor flaws. There are a few times where something the character said was obviously a lie or a contradiction to something you already knew, but because you didn't have the 'conversation topic' piece, you couldn't accuse them of this. A few contradictions (or what seem like contradictions) the game doesn't think quite are. Also the game, while it does have an ending and wraps up the case, proposes more questions, especially near the very end, and has several loose plot threads. They seem to be a sequel hook, and past the game credits a message pops-up confirms this saying  \"Thanks For Playing!\", they'd like to make a sequel, but the only way to do so is for the game to do well-enough, and they appreciate reviews/videos/the like on their project.\n\nSo that raises the question, \"Is it worth it?\" To which I say, for me, absolutely so. I liked it, I enjoyed it. There were a few moments I got stumped on what to do (get too stuck and you can use a cheat system to tell you what to do next, a feature I never used, or call your chief for a vague general hint) and as you collect more clues you're given maybe too many conversation points to look over, but I actually ended up enjoying the mystery that unveiled in the game, the loose plot threads interest me to see continued, and the story had some fun twists and turns, was sometimes unintentionally amusing, but other times more consciously so, and was gripping at times. Worth it if an FMV Murder-Mystery sounds up your alley, and want something between hammy entertainment and something more gripping and interesting.

He only has until the end of the day to work out what really happened, so he's going to be bothering the people of this small town continuously for the rest of the night.\n\nAs for the actual game:\nThe gameplay is about 80% talking, 10% \"finding\" items, and 10% running into people in the woods.  The acting ranges from \"pretty hammy\" to \"extremely hammy\", but I would rate that as a good thing, personally.  The interface isn't the best and the controls take some getting used to (don't even try to set up a controller on PC, it's essentially keyboard-only at the time of this writing), but once you stop hitting Escape hoping for a menu, it all works out.\n\nThe game is about 7-8 hours long, depending on how much time you spend thinking about what people have said, but does have a built-in hint and cheat system if you just want to move on.

You basically interview a few different people about a murder.  As you interview them you discover more information.  The goal of the game is to catch people in lies, which then advances the game's progress and reveals more clues.  Eventually you solve the case.  \n\nEarly on the game is a bit of a slow burner and finding contradictions can be a bit tedious.  But as more characters and information becomes available, the game hits it's stride.  \n\nUnfortunately there are are few instances where you will spot an obvious contradiction but the game won't recognize it.  Additionally, you'll become stuck at some points because the only way to progress is to go to some secluded spot on the map that you've already visited and would have no reason to visit again.  Fortunately there are hints and even cheats that you can access if you become stuck but this takes away from the immersion.  \n\nThe acting is good in most cases, although the main actor Inspector Jenks seems to \"over act\" much of the time.  For example... he'll be interviewing a witness and pull out a simple driver's license and say, \"What do you know about.... THIS!\" and hold the driver's license up as if it's a smoking gun of evidence, then the witness will dully say, \"Um, I don't know anything about that, why would I?\"  So there seems to be a dissonance in the acting and in the overall \"mood\" of the conversation, although Jenks' wonky personality does lend some color to the conversation as well.  \n\nAnyhow, definitely worth $10 if you enjoy this sort of game and I look forward to the sequel.", "timestamp_created": 1437009782, "timestamp_updated": 1437058105, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487437", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17068564": {"recommendationid": "17068564", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040068728", "num_games_owned": 1788, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 478, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1437002492}, "language": "english", "review": "Oh was this an experience to play. It was incredible and I was hooked from the start. Not many games can have me playing for 3 hours running and have me feeling like i've only been playing for about half an hour. \n\nI feel like there isn't a whole lot I can say about this game without spoiling the story to readers so i'm going to structure this review into a few smaller sections explaining the main premise of the game and linking in my opinions/experience. \n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nContradiction is an FMV style game. I'll admit though I have never before played an FMV game. I wasn't around during the FMV craze that I heard about. So I am not sure what typical gameplay is like in them type of games. But I can explain how gameplay functions in Contradiction. \n\nYou play as a detective. You are investigating the death of a character named Kate Vine. You do this by exploring the small village and finding the clues along the way. All areas that you explore are real areas and nothing is animated. The clues that you find can be used to interogate other characters that you meet accross the way. After asking all the questions to people your goal is to spot who is lieing. You have to put two responses together that disagree with each other and then interogate the person more about this Contradiction.\n\nThe game is an investigatory experience. It could be compared to the likes of L.A NOIRE or Sherlock Holmes. But Contradiction decides to strip it's core mechanics down to the basics. They decide to focus on the questioning mechanic. The responses are well thought out and it is very enjoyable to listen to what the characters have to say. You often find yourself linking replies that you got right at the start of the game to ones that were said very late in the game. This means you need to have a good memory or else you could find yourself having to look through pages of replies. Although boy is it satisfying when you finally find a contradiction amongst all of the replies. \n\n[b]The UI[/b]\nNow this game is controlled entirely with the keyboard. The UI is key to making sure the experience is fun. It does this well to an extent. The initial controls the game gives you are horrible. You probably want to rebind them to more appropriate keys as soon as you start playing. Although even navigating the controls screen isn't great. There is no way that I could see to just rebind one single key. You have to go through the entire list and rebind each key instead of just picking one. What I would like to see is the introduction of mouse control, even if it was just across the main menu. It would definitely make the experience a bit better. \n\nThen you have the map. Initially it is kinda confusing to use. You have 2 choices of how to explore. You can use the map and go to a location straight away using that. But you can only use the keyboard to control it again. Originally I didn't realize you could use the map for movement because I was trying to use the mouse to click on the location. But once you realize that you can then it is a much better form of movement. The second way of navigation is through the arrow keys. You get given a choice of places to go to next from your current location. The problem with this is that the game seems to confusingly decide to change orientation. This means you can't just spam up for example to keep going in that direction. You need to keep an eye on what direction orientation the world has randomly decided to go to. This factor confused me for quite a while and made me go in the wrong direction numerous times. But I did get used to it in the end. \n\n[b]The Characters[/b]\nSo each character is played by a real life person including the person you play as. The character development throughout the game is great. Your really do get to know the characters which is key in an investigatory game where your main focus is to spot the criminal. Some of the acting is vastly exagorated, especially Jenks(Your own character). But this is OK I think because it makes sure you don't miss anything but sometimes it is a little bit cringeworthy. \n\nSome characters in contradiction I felt were amazing actors and definitely gave their characters a personalilty. To name a few the characters of Ryan, James and Simon were played excelently and I want to take the time to praise their actors. Obviously the rest of the other actors were also great as well. But there were some moments were I felt the acting was kinda bad. I have to wonder if it was the bad dialog that the script writers had given them that made these moments cringeworthy. But the majority of the dialog and acting was amazing and I definitely enjoyed it. \n\n[b]Summary[/b]\nSo would I recommend Contradiction. YES, YES, Oh boy yes. It was an incredible experience the likes of which I personally havn't seen before. If you love detective games this is definitely the game for you. It sees the detective experience from a different perspective that isn't usually focused on in games. The game ends gearing up for a sequel. But they need peoples support on this game if they are to make another game. I really hope this game succeeds because I would love to play another game of this and experience some more backstory behind the characters. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone. Especially at the very reasonable price point of \u00a36.99. It is a bargain for how much fun you get out of it. It took me 8 hours to complete which is well worth the price.\n\n[b]TheIronicGamers rating system[/b]\n[list][*] Don't ever buy this game. \n[*]Maybe consider it on a sale. \n[*]An average game.\n[*]A good game that should definitely be considered.\n[*][b][u]A must play![/u][/b]\n[/list]\n\nDisclaimer: I was given a early press key by the developer to make this review.", "timestamp_created": 1437004823, "timestamp_updated": 1438380738, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 60, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.797010", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17067888": {"recommendationid": "17067888", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017008483", "num_games_owned": 226, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 794, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1441023032}, "language": "english", "review": "I enjoyed this game a lot.

The acting can get a bit hammy, but mostly it's pretty good (Paul Darrow is excellent) and the detective is reminiscent of Hercule Poirot (which is always fun).

But they have a certain charm to them, just like watching an 'interactive movie' as such games are often described. You don't get that alot of that feeling with the artifical rendered characters and scenery anymore. With that said, being an adventure-enthusiast, it's quite a treat to see 'Contradiction' has found it's way onto the steam store.\n\nWhat is the game about? You play as a scotland yard officer investigating a supposed suicide in a small village in england. Many facts of the initial investigation didn't quite fit into the whole picture, that's the reason the player has until 12pm to find any evidence that proves that the victim did not kill itself, but that other circumstances where the cause of death. The game progresses one hour at a time, effectively dividing the game into several \"chapters\".\n\nWhat is the gameplay like? You navigate about the village through your cursor keys, and all the interactions with characters and the general shots of the locations are actually filmed by a film crew and actors. If you are of a somewhat older generation you can perfectly compare it to games like 'Gabriel Knight 2', 'Ripper' or the 'Phantasmagoria' series. A big part during your investigation includes interviewing several suspects and otherwise involved people in the case. This is the main component of the game, as you have to find contradictions to the statements a person has made throughout the game after you asked them about different topics. In general, whenever you found a contradiction you'll get new clues regarding your case or you get people to confess something to you that they have been hiding from youn earlier. Finding those contradictions basically moves you onto the next chapters of the game and is a meassure of progress so to speak. This goes on until you finished the game, and only occasionally you have to use 'items' in certain locations, so there is no complex inventory management or combining of objects of any kind.\n\nNoteworhty things:\n- The FMV is high quality and the actors are not as cheesy at you would expect them to be. Each actor has quite a unique personality to them and although it is understandable that they could not hire top stars from hollywood, the actors they have chosen do a good job in general.\n- The game becomes harder as you progress, since you have more and more topics and statements to speak about with each character you meet with every chapter you advance. This can get quite frustrating after some time but it actually helps to give you a more lasting experience. You have to pay very very good attention to everything everyone says.\n- There is no replayability, at least I don't think so.\n- A few contradicitons (about two or three) are quite tricky and can give you quite a headache since the important scenes for them can not be replayed anymore. You have to pay very close attention to what you see and hear as mentioned above.\n- The controls are quite awkward at first, but you get used to them quite quickly. Menu navigation is the most confusing part when you begin playing.\n- Everyone who has ever played FMV games knows that e.g. transitions between locations can be quite annoying if there are video sequences playing and you have to travel back and forth all the time. This game actually fascinated me in the way how smooth and well done such intermediate shots are integrated. I never felt that any cutscene, as short as they might have been, was annoying me at any time. Especially the intro/outro scenes of an interview.\n\nOverall I'd recommend the game to anyone who likes adventure games, and for anyone that wants to play a good FMV this game is honestly a must. Very well done, good puzzles (in the sense of contradictions to be found) and a good amount of game-time for the asked price and considering the amount of work behind movie based games. Anyone not interested in adventure games may like the game if they are into TV crime series. Otherwise you probably won't enjoy it.\n\nI'd certainly like to see more!", "timestamp_created": 1436879184, "timestamp_updated": 1436879184, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.615520", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17037510": {"recommendationid": "17037510", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969243442", "num_games_owned": 312, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 536, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1436842120}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun adventure/interrogation game.

The original generation of FMVs are a bit before my time, but I understand that the tech often didn't live up to the ambition. Well, that one's more area where grasp has now caught up to vision. The video works beautifully with well-chosen angles and smooth movement between shots. The characters are well-cast and well-rounded - it feels like an interactive BBC drama - and the contradiction game play works really well. The setting feels genuinely eerie and tense without being heavy-handed, and the ominous atmosphere only built as the sun went down (lovely touch, by the way). It's challenging enough to cause some head-scratching without becoming completely frustrating (see the Steam walkthrough if you need it - the cheats function doesn't appear to work). The game's plot kep me guessing, tying the main investigation up at the end while creating an intriguing world that I hope will be built upon in further installments.\n\nThere are a couple of things Pneuma could do to improve. Auto-playing the prologue video when the game starts would help set the scene for the player. As it is currently, you just land in front of the pub feeling a little confused. A run through of the controls at the start would also benefit the game. I was told to use the 'investigation' and the 'inventory' buttons by text boxes, however, there had been no explanation what these were ('s' and 'enter'). That said, there are control instructions on the Menu screen so it's easy enough to figure out. Going back to the Prologue Video, there's a fair bit of unnecessary exposition. In the next game I'd cut this down to scene-setting only and let the game do the rest of the work (which it does, very well). Last point, a couple of the scenes where Jenks attempts to assert his authority felt a little silly. A bit more research into police descalation techniques would help remedy this. \n\nAll of the above are just suggested improvements and don't detract from the fact that I enjoyed playing this game a lot.

While still in its crib, a generation-long curse was laid upon the genre, dooming all creations branded with the FMV tag to receive nothing but scorn and contempt in every village around the world. And to be honest, the reputation was wholly deserved.\n\nDecades later, hard drive space is now cheap and the codecs plentiful. The creators also seem wiser this time around, focusing on small and intimate, non-branching storylines and cutting the flashy sizzle reel tricks and animations altogether.\n\nContradiction is, like other recent FMV games such as Her Story and Tesla Effect, a detective mystery: A girl has been found dead in a small rural British town. You play as Inspector Jenks who's been sent to investigate, mostly interviewing the residents about the incident and doing some minor inventory-based sleuthing.\n\nChats with people open up more points of discussion, and the idea is to find contradictions in the statements of the suspects. This is easier said than done, since the conversations always bring up dozens of possible subjects and pinpointing the slips of the tongue requires attention and thought. Just randomly trying things will get you nowhere.\n\nI was surprised at how engrossed in the game I got. The characters are intriguing and I have no major problems with the acting (Jenks himself can get a bit over the top on occasion, though). The setting and the plot are also atmospheric, with a lot of hints towards something truly sinister. The music properly sets the mood, and the village itself is visually a rather charmingly beautiful little slice of English countryside.\n\nPacing around the town can get slightly frustrating if you get stuck, but the game has its own elegantly integrated hint system so you're never truly lost. The game is definitely no walk in the park either, so expect your little grey cells to get an outing they probably deserve in this day and age.\n\nThe only downside of Contradiction is that you can sometimes see a few corners cut where budget limitations apparently came into play, however, cheapo after effects are blessedly kept to a minimum. Biggest bummer is that some of the major story strands are never brought into conclusion after the case is cracked, but are left to be resolved in a potential sequel.\n\nAnyhow, this is FMV gaming done right. I finished the game in one nine-hour sitting and had fun the whole time.

Outside of Tex Murphy though few developers got it right. Contradiction brings back everything that was good about FMV gaming while avoiding most if not all of its negatives. For a low budget game this has very good acting and a fairly polished and easy to use interface. There is just something very appealing about getting to play the detective and this story has a lot of interesting clues and sub plots that keep you driving to a solution. The basic gameplay premise works very well. Collect clues, interview subjects and spot contradictions in their testimony. This is much more challenging than you would think as you end up with a large amount of testimony from several suspects throughout the 7 to 8 hour experience and finding the contradictions as you get towards the end can be very challenging. You also end up with a large number of red herrings that can distract you from what is important in the information you uncover. There are a couple of hint systems available in the game, but it's very satisfying to work through the testimony on your own to find the solution.\n\nPros:\nHD quality video and solid acting\nSmooth interface that is easy to navigate once you get the key commands down.\nBacktracking is helped by map that allows you to quickly return to locations\nVery interesting mystery that keeps you pushing towards the solution\n\nCons:\nAudio is a bit over compressed causing it to be tinny. Hopefully this is fixed in a later update.\nStory ends with many of the subplots unresolved, but open to a possible sequel. \nController support broken on Windows currently. \n\nYou will have to backtrack and speak to suspects over and over as you unlock more clues. This part does have some of the downsides of old 90\u2019s games, but I enjoyed Inspector Jenks so much I didn\u2019t mind and was willing to overlook this. Also, over the course of the many in game hours of interviews the suspects will mostly be in the same places. Drinks will stay the same level and suspects will stare into the same fireplaces. This can take you a bit out of the experience, but I\u2019m sure all the dialog was recorded at the same time and this was necessary for the game design.\n\nOverall this is one of the best FMV and Mystery titles ever made and is quite the achievement on the very small budget the game was made with.

The quaint British village setting and the cult/occult storyline make you think of classic British TV.\n\nOnly real criticism so far is that sometimes the audio for the actors speaking is a touch distorted.

He knows how to frame shots, and in almost all of the \"idle\" screens I've seen, there's something moving without being distracting. This is notable because I haven't seen any compression artifacts, the video is always crisp and sharp whether there's movement or not. Everything looks fantastic. The dialogue is a bit tinny on occasion, but never during suspect interviews, and it's not even close to being distracting or inaudible. The game had a very small budget, and that's really the only time it shows, yet it's still not enough to be considered a detriment. His background in music also shines through, and I hope the soundtrack will be offered as DLC.\n\nI've played for about an hour and a half and according to the story's deadline - you have 7 hours to investigate, with time advancing an hour with each pre-defined major breakthrough - I've only advanced 2 of those 7 hours.

emergence (and sad demise) of the FMV sub genre.\nGames like Gabriel Knight, Phantasmagoria and the Tex Murphy titles started to embrace Full Motion Video footage.\nInitially it was viewed as a novelty, real actors playing out the narrative in all the interlaced video glory the 90's could muster.\nFMV seemed liked a perfect fit for cut scenes and narrative heavy titles and I loved it!\nEven some real \"Hollywood\" actors were seduced by the rise of the interactive movie, with the likes of Mark \"Skywalker\" Hamil heading up the Wing Commander games and Christopher \"Pulp Fiction\" Walken starring in the 1996 FMV thriller \"Ripper\"\n\n\n[b]RIP FMV[/b]\n\nUnfortunately, my love for all things FMV wasn't shared by my peers,  I was in the minority and the FMV trend had almost died away completely by the end of the 90's.\nThis was partly due to the technological limitations of the time.\nThe video was often interlaced or blocky, the frame rates were poor and the amount of space required by the footage used up a huge amount of CD-Rom storage, the game Ripper I mentioned earlier was spread across 6 CD's!\n\nMany FMV games also suffered from cheesy writing and equally bad acting.\n\"Phoned in\" performances were the norm and as such a stigma began to emerge in the media around the whole \"interactive movie\" genre.\nThis stigma probably had as much to do with the death of the genre as the technical limitations of the 90's, but whatever the reason, the interactive movie died, I mourned its passing and moved on, but now I've discovered a game which has rekindled my interest, a new, modern FMV experience in all its interactive movie gaming glory.\n\n\n[b]The Stage[/b]\n\nContradiction: Spot the Liar! to give it its full (and unnecessarily long title) is a \"whodunnit\" detective adventure set in the sleepy little English village of Edenton.\n\nEdenton isn't just a stage for the players either, its a character in its own right.\nFrom the village pub to the surrounding woodland, all the locations are beautifully realised and tie together to create a charming and peaceful setting, you'll even see the odd Union Jack fluttering in the breeze.\nThis rural tranquillity gives Edenton a charm of its own, it feels like a real location that you'd find if you drove out  into the green and pleasant land that is the English countryside.\nIt's this tranquil charm which makes the recent events in Edenton all the more shocking.\n\nThere's been a suspicious death in the village, a young woman, Kate Vine, has drowned but was it suicide? a terrible accident? or something more sinister?\nYou've got one night to find out, let the investigations begin!\n\n\n[b]The Players[/b]\n\nYou play as Detective Inspector Jenks, an interestingly likeable character with a compelling interview technique which is sure to make you smile, he's also somewhat of a kleptomaniac and has the added side effect of making me want to start wearing a hat.\n\nAs you explore the village you'll come across some equally interesting locals, friends and acquaintances of Kate's all getting on with their lives, each with their own personalities, view of events and secrets to hide.\nI can't overstate how well written these characters are, without exception everyone you come across feels like a fleshed out and fully realised person, from the landlady at the village pub to the father and son team who run \"Atlas\" an exclusive business training course which seems to be popular with the local students, they're all engaging and make each interview a pleasure to play through.\n\n\n[b]One Week Later...[/b]\n\nJenks arrives in the village of Edenton one week after Kate Vines death, it's a Friday evening, the locals are going about their business and it's your job to snoop through their things and interview them regarding the death.\n\nEverything in this game is presented through video footage, from the navigation of the village through to the interviews themselves, but more on that later.\n\nMovement around the village is a simple, go  left, go right affair, each location has its own video loop, there are no static screens here, Edenton is a living, breathing village.\nStand by the lakeside and waves will ripple in the light whilst branches move and creak  in the wind, the level of immersion this creates is undeniably impressive.\n\n\n[b]The Questions[/b]\n\nYou'll find yourself searching through locations, finding clues and interviewing the locals.\nThese interviews are the meat of the game, initially you'll only have a couple of \"conversation pieces\"  to enquire about, the dead girl, Kate Vine and her driving license which was discovered some distance away from her body.\nQuestioning the residents of Edenton quickly opens up your investigative  options as you uncover more information about events leading up to Kate's death and \"acquire\" items to ask about from your inevitable snooping.\n\n\n[b]The Play[/b]\n\nIt's not just a case of ask everyone about everything you discover either, that's just part of it.\nYou actually need to listen to what people say,\n\nWho's lying?\nWho's telling the truth?\n\nIt's listening out for contradictions in characters answers that will help reveal this information.\n\n\n[b]The Lies[/b]\n\nThe actual mechanic of spotting these contradictions is well implemented too.\nAs you question a person, notes of their relevant answers are recorded in your journal.\nYou can go through these notes and if you spot two that contradict each other you can question the person further regarding the holes in their story.\n\nWhy did they lie?\nWhat are they hiding?\n\n\n[b]The Lost[/b]\n\nThis game is by no means easy either, you're not going to breeze straight through the story without actually thinking about what people have told you and going through your notes.\nHaving said that, there is a hint system if you find yourself stuck at a dead end.\nThe hints are given by going to the phone box in the village (Jenks is an old school kind of guy and doesn't seem to have a mobile) and calling the police chief who will offer an insight to help get you back on track.\nIf these hints aren't enough there's always the old faithful option of just plain cheating too, but try and avoid it if you can, the satisfaction of catching someone in a lie is what this game is all about.\n\n\n[b]I Spy[/b]\n\nOne thing I wasn't keen on with this game was the snooping investigation mechanic.\nWhen you reach a scene with something interesting for you to discover a giant magnifying glass icon appears in the bottom right corner of the screen.\nClick on it and Jenks will investigate whatever it is that he has spotted at that location.\nIt works fine but I would have enjoyed a little more subtlety here.\n\nThis mechanic is likely a throwback to the titles mobile gaming routes but as a PC gamer the ability to scan your mouse over a location to discover something for yourself would have been more rewarding.\n\nI'm just being picky though, this didn't tarnish my enjoyment of the game,  it's a just a change that would have added something to what otherwise was an excellent experience.\n\n\n[b]HDTV[/b]\n\nVisually this game is hard to fault with high quality full motion video throughout.\nThis is an FMV title with the production values of a primetime TV show.\nFrom the camera angles to the sets themselves, everything works to draw you into what feels like a real place populated by real people.\nThe sound is equally impressive, with an excellently appropriate musical score to accompany the ambient sounds found at each location.\nThe voice recording itself is generally of a high quality, occasionally

However, the 'miss' acting ends up being pretty funny, \"THE LAAAAANDLADY\", and doesn't detract from the game at all.

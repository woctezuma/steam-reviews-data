And they're not related, so you can learn and start everything here even if this is your first Quell.\nGraphics and music are great, and keyboard controls too are perfect.\nThe game's mechanics are quite easy to understand - you have to obtain all the orbs by guiding with your directional keys one or more bubbles and dealing with the increasing obstacles and difficulties that the game will pose. They're all very intuitive anyways and you'll never be stuck :)\nThe new mechanics too add much variety to this game so that it isn't definitely the same as the other Quell games!\n4\u20ac may be a little too much, but this one to me is one of the best puzzle/logic series on Steam on every aspect so if you love these kinds of games you won't be disappointed for sure, and it has a lot of replayability value too being that long and different :)", "timestamp_created": 1512917926, "timestamp_updated": 1512917926, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.650255", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37988123": {"recommendationid": "37988123", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159553780", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510782896}, "language": "english", "review": "Better and improved from the first quell game.

Except ordinary walls, there are also deadly traps which pop our bubbles. \nThere is no rush while playing, there is not a ticking clock. The quick precise movement is not required neither. What is really needed is a good thinking.\nEven though some levels are difficult, the player has always a chance to buy a solution with coins that they receive for solving levels.

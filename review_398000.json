You can just tell how much love went into creating this game in 1997. While the graphics are aged now, it's still very playable and holds up pretty well. The world feels very alive because every character you meet has a unique dialogue. It always impresses me how much was achieved with this game back then.

Y ya me habia jugado a muchas aventuras graficas de Lucas que por cierto Monkey Island es mi saga favorita en especial el 2. Como les decia entre a un local por la zona de martinez y mire la caja del twinsen oddyseys. Y se me hizo familiar ya que habia jugado muy poco al Relenttles o Little Big Adventure 1 que me habia gustado pero era muy chico y no sabia mucho las mecanicas. Cuando llegue a casa lo instal\u00e9 y cuando vi la intro me enamore del juego mal. Me encataba jugar los Sabados en casa en esoa dias de lluvia torrencial. Donde en esos dias mi mama pedia empandas y comia jugando. Ese juego es exclente amo su historia. Sus personajes sus mundos y lo que mas me gusta su musica. Lo que me costo terminar este juego fue tremendo. Lo termine sin NINGUNA GUIA. y mi mama a veces me traducia algunad cosas que no entend\u00eda. Y me llevo algo mas de 1 a\u00f1o y medio en terminarlo. Cosa que cuando lo termine arranque con el 1. Queria contarles mi experiencia con este juego que para mi esta en el puesto numero 2 despues de monkey y delante de Grim Fandango.\nMe agarra la nostalgia.

I adored it then and I adore it now!\n\nQuite obviously the graphics and cutscenes haven't aged well, but for a game originally released in the late 90's this can be easily forgiven. One thing that brought it down for me is the quality of the voiceovers. Twinsen's VA in particular very clearly sounds like he's reading lines off a script. There was one very humorous cutscene where Twinsen discovers the moon base and his mouth drops open in shock. There's a half second of silence, followed by a tame \"wooo...\" Surprisingly there's a flubbed line that somehow made it into the final game. The French ferry man on Otringal noticably stumbles over his lines. This is all nit-picky though and I don't mean much by it. It certainly doesn't take much away from the game. But then again when it comes to dialogue, the standard wasn't the highest to begin with.\n\nAside from this, the world is vibrant, and I love the characters to this day as much as I did as a kid, wooden VA's aside.\n\nI'd definitely recommend this game to my friends, although I feel that a lot of the nostalgia might be lost on them. For younger players that crave cutting edge graphics and instantly lose interest in anything less (GENERALISATION, HO!), this might not be the game for them, but I could definitely see myself mentioning it to someone my age or older who has a taste for these sorts of games.\n\nMoney well spent and I'm still enjoying it!

I used to play this a lot back in the day and still find it good now a day.\nBEFORE YOU READ ON: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS (MINOR) SPOILERS.\n\nThe story starts out quite small with the lighthouse keeper missing, but it will see you travel over 3 planets in total by the end. Every character I spoke to in the game is fully voice acted. Although I would like some options when talking to someone it is also funny when Twinsen asks someone out loud if they are part of the underground movement planning to overthrow the current goverment.\nThe game overal is light hearted, but does have some more serious undertones. For instance several alien races bickering with one another over a lot of things and instead of working together they expect a magical prophecy to solve everthing. The goverment has soldier/policemen everywhere to make sure nobody misbehaves.\nLocations you visit are nice and varied. At the start you are on an island with a small town and a cave system in the slightly more hilly part of the island. On one of the alien planets however there is a town with a castle, a store, 2 ferries, a casino, customs, a spa and some more.

At this time, I only had the German version of the game so the synchronization was a little odd. Like it used to be for nearly all German synchronizations back then.

Jos\u00e9 Dias of Adventure Classic Gaming said \"Relentless: Twinsen's Adventure is among the most original and intriguing adventure games ever released.\" and gave it a 4 out of 5. \" \n\nBut let me tell you. Do you remember the first time you launched a game that you were so excited about? Like many of us we played black and white games like Castle Adventure ( 1984 ), Pac Man ( 1980 ) or one of the best-sellers from Apogee like the Duke Nukem, Cosmo, Crystal Caves and I could continue for hours! And suddenly you find this game with a UFO on the cover, a blue coated man with a S-pendant around his neck and this beautiful woman next to him. You flip the big carton box and you see these amazing 3D pictures. You are thinking \" Is this real gameplay or just a short clip? \" Remember, back in the days we didn't had any source of information about videogames like we have today. I bought the game and decided to give it a try.\n\nThat, my friends, is where my adventure began. I never seen anything so well detailed in 3D graphics. I could turn 360 degrees and see my character from all sides. I saw all these funny, but not terryfing creatures that I never seen before. There are bunny-people, fox-like creatures, walking sausages and evil citicens from Esmer who are trying to invade your world. The magic is in the storyline, where Twinsen needs to save a terrified group of schoolchildren who were abducted by an evil villian ( no spoilers! ). One of the best parts of this game is the humor that Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rick Raynal and his designers put into this game. Trashcans and catuses have villians in them, funny conversation lines, pun-intended puns and an amazingly well formed story. Where Link would raise the item above his head, Twinsen is happily waving his arms up and down! Don't forget about Jo\u00eb, the clumsy but joyfull elf that always seems to get Twinsen and himself into trouble! And what about Dinofly? You ever played a game when you were young where you ride a dinosaur?\n\n\nTL;DR\n\nCombat 10/10 --> Combat you never seen before. There are many magical spells that can help you fight enemies, but there are obstructions in this game that you need to overcome. Your magic ball is standard level 1 and can only hit certain enemies. You need to find ways to upgrade your magic ball to hit tougher enemies. The magic ball bounces which means you can kill enemies from afar bouncing the ball against the wall. The allout powerfull Ring of Lightning will make all those juicy sausages feel like they just came of the barbecue! And don't forget about throwing pointy darts, spit seeds with your Blowgun or simply fight of your enemies with your Emperor's Sword. Your behavior is a big part of this game that is relevant to how you throw your ball, how you wield your sword or how you preform certain actions with items. \n\nAdventure 10/10 --> You travel from Twinsun, the planet of our hero Twinsen, to the Moon together with Baldino, you go to the casino on Zeelich and you are trying to follow a robot-chicken to find a key. Biddi Biddi! Biddi Biddi! And don't forget Island CX, that is the most deadly island in this world. For those who are willing to explore the whole game there are special items and spells you can collect that can help you later in the game. \" What is Island CX you say... I... I don't know. I been there before but now I am all burned selling souvenirs next to this giant statue... I advise you to not go to Island CX... \" \n\nMusic 10/10 --> The biggest part of what made this game for me was the amazing music that Phil Vachey made. The Temple of B\u00fb from Little Big Adventure 1 and Emerald Moon from Little Big Adventure 2 are amazing classic masterpieces. What is that you say? Voice acting? Yes ofcourse there is voice-acting! VOICE-ACTING IS SO 1994!\n\nGameplay 10/10 --> Twinsen has different behavior he can adept to. Normal behavior is used to interact with people, to find hidden objects or to flip switches. Sporty behavior is used for jumping and running, while Aggressive mode is.. well, for beeing aggressive. Please don't beat up Zo\u00eb, she is pregnant with your child! On the other hand, you are ALLOWED to beat LITTLE BRATS on top of a ROOF that shoots at you with his SLINGSHOT ( Please, go punch him! )  Discreet mode is the opossite of aggressive, in certain cases you want to align yourself a little bit better, or you want to throw your magic ball higher in the air over a wall to kill an enemy, or if you want to sneak past enemies to avoid confrontation. Each behavior corresponds differently with each weapon, which makes killing enemies a lot more fun. \n\nGraphics 10/10 --> For that time, 1994/1997, the graphics were astounding and amazingly well. Comparable to what Half Life 1 and Unreal or Quake did amazingly well for their time, Little Big Adventure 1 and 2 did that for their time. We could almost say that Little Big Adventure is the start of the 3D adventures which we see today, like Wolfenstein was that for the future of shooters. I gave a 10/10 because your game will come supported with INGAME VIDEOS when something magical has happened.\n\nOveral 10/10 For new and younger players, don't expect to be blown away by the usual standard of a good game according to today, the graphics are not what you seem to be used to ( even for Minecraft standards ) but be prepared to see what we all find a masterpiece in it's full glory! I got this game on CD-rom and I'm just buying it again! It brings a tear to my eye everytime I play this game. I love you Adeline Software\n\nSupport this game developer and let's all cross our fingers for Little Big Adventure 3!", "timestamp_created": 1446248670, "timestamp_updated": 1446249472, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583333", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18768808": {"recommendationid": "18768808", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128464102", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1446221088}, "language": "english", "review": "Best Game EVER MADE !!\nmake lba 3 !!!", "timestamp_created": 1446221095, "timestamp_updated": 1446221095, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493926", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18732773": {"recommendationid": "18732773", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052210469", "num_games_owned": 109, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 95, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484847902}, "language": "english", "review": "Buy it.

I always hoped for a new edition but it will probably never happen. However we can play LBA2 now through steam. Excellent!\n\nThe original came out in 1997. It was one of the best games on PC. I had great times running around and enjoying the world of Twinsen. It came with mysteries and opportunities, puzzles and action. The music was enjoyable and suited the game well. The cut scenes added an extra dimension and the social interaction between the characters was also nice. It has this unique atmosphere which I find hard to describe. As you can hear, no real cons. \nThe only things with this version is that it is running in dosbox, which runs as 640x480 in a window. I don't see any options to change that. (SEE EDIT BELOW!) Also, it is not running smooth yet, however back in the days I remember my PC not running it smooth either. Not a real problem for me since it is still a great game.\n\nEDIT: You can change the resolution of the game!

You know that Australian guy on youtube who hates solar roads (see EEVBlog)?  He's in here too.  :)\n\nInstead of playing Shenzhen I/O, you could buy a breadboard, and a few components and maybe an Arduino or rPi or a demo board and play with real-world components.  And you should!  But if you aren't sure, or you have no idea what all that stuff is, this can help you get your feet wet for pretty cheap.  Also this doesn't use any girly-man C compiler like Arduino, or sissy LInux operating system like rPi - this uses ASM.  That's not sexist either - regardless of your gender, if you code in ASM you are a stud!\n\nI bought Shenzhen I/O on sale and figured this has everything TIS-100 has plus some.  Correct game: Check!  Correct price: Check!\n\nThen I openned it up for 1 minute, saw the RTFM references, shut the game down, and printed out the manual and never had time to look at it for at least 6 months.\n\nAnd the whole time there's the LITTLE DEMON ON MY SHOULDER saying \"ASM?  Are you kidding me?\"\n\nSo there's a time and a place for everything.  [For PHP that time would be \"never\", but for ASM apparently my years of programming experience and hand porting one processor to another purely in ASM still had some room for this game to be played.]\n\nIt's not _really_ ASM - for anyone who knows the difference, you might get a slight pain in the back of your neck when you notice some of the differences.  Those differences are extremely slight, and can actually be appreciated for what they are.  The game does not take you all the way down the binary rabbit hole (at least from what I'm able to tell after 2 hrs playing).  But it's a start.  Also the amount of ROM available is cleverly the # of lines of code you can see without scrolling!  Very cool game design!\n\nThis game will give you the sick thinking that comes with ASM.  By sick, I mean, writing code that's almost as bad as PERL, you'll have trouble reading it later, you'll wonder why you added 3 and subtract 7 with a label in between.  It all becomes very cryptic.  But the ideas that lead you to this monstrosity - that's where the beauty lies.  You wind up making some convoluted mess that actually works, and is optimized so much it won't make sense without drilling into what happens at every step.\n\n--->>> Usually though, the best solution proves to also be the most elegant - and seeing that elegance immerge is something very beautiful. <<<---\n\nWhat really blows me away, is how perfectly designed the puzzles in this game are.  The amount of space for your code is just enough to squeeze out the functionality you need.  It's really very impressive.  The effects of very minor changes can also affect battery life in unexpected ways - just raising that kind of awareness, I think, is a very cool feature.\n\nWhen I was a kid, I learned a sort of equivalent to ASM on a TI programmable calculator.  Shenzhen I/O could be thought of as modern equivalent.  You can take it as fast as you like.\n\n\n<mumbles something about \"It's SOOOO RTFM!\"...>", "timestamp_created": 1512840083, "timestamp_updated": 1512944395, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.625850", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38185986": {"recommendationid": "38185986", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101864161", "num_games_owned": 555, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 385, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 25, "last_played": 1514236150}, "language": "french", "review": "Probablement un des jeux puzzle les plus complexe que j'ai pu jouer.

I really like puzzle games, my favorites are Enigma, Fish Fillets 2, Toki Tori 1 and 2, and Talos Principle.  Something about figuring out the solution in those games gives you an Aha! moment that make you feel clever in a way Zachtronic games do not. Zachtronic games are going through the steps to get to the end result, I have played deep into all of them and they just get longer and more complicated, but they never seem to require you to figure anything out, which would give you that Aha! moment.\n\nThey do have a nice moment at the end where you are watching your completed thing and see how it functions just the way you'd imagined.  It's an almost artistic sense of movement, and maybe the choices you make in the game are artistic rather than logical.  In creating the sandwich maker for this particular game, I made in extremely inefficient, but made sure every step and loop still had a purpose.  I think my code might actually make a person smile who had played the game, but is that the game?  I've played hours hoping it would get more difficult on its own, not that I would make it more difficult.  Each level just takes longer.  And at this point I'm thinking, why don't I just code my own programs and then at least I would have something when I was done with all this work.\n\nAlso, these are a lot of the same feelings I'd had after playing TIS-100 and I might have stopped buying these things then, but I was partly attracted back by people celebrating the solitaire mini game in this game, but it is no good.  I don't think the designer really understands what makes a solitaire game good.  It is just much too easy.  and it is possible to lose by random chance.  (i don't object to the latter in solitaire at all, but in comparison to free cell, which is almost the same game, you can't lose by random chance AND it is more difficult.)\n\nThe best part of the game is the little news snippets about tech problems in the near future, like self driving cars being stuck in a loop.  They are quite clever.\n\nI might end up going back and playing a bit more of the game and updating the review if my experience changes, but I have logged quite a bit of time already.",

Games like Infinifactory and SpaceChem do not really draw me in.\n\nHowever, I have to say that SHENZHEN I/O is pretty amazing. Coming from TIS-100 to this is like getting slapped for even trying out TIS-100. That's not to say that TIS-100 was not a good game, but the whole storyline and appeal to SHENZHEN is just much better, in my opinion.\n\nYou are getting to build hardware with physical chips that you program and get to see the effects as you continuously test, like observing an animated electric sign. Being able to see the hardware signals and learning whether you are sending something out in a weird way is very nice in comparison to the low-level assembly of TIS-100 where you could easily get lost (which was a big part of that game's point).\n\nThat doesn't mean that SHENZHEN is drastically easier by any means. There's a lot to think about here, especially because you are still constricted in the amount of physical space you use for the chips as well as the amount of code lines you can program on them. There's still a lot of planning in how you want to build these digital circuits, but the planning still has more freedom here than in TIS-100.\n\nI just have to say that I enjoy the amount of content and variety here a lot more. The emails in the company are pretty weird, yet interesting. Each character has an unique personality. The projects you get assigned to definitely keep you going, especially with the art style of the game and that you get to see what you are actually trying to build or program.\n\nIt's funny that the Solitaire game inside has so much popularity, but then I guess it's not surprising because I've spent a decent amount of time playing it too.\n\nOverall, I think that the graphics, the sound, the storyline with this awkward company, the mechanics, everything... They are all great, and the game has so much content.\n\nSHENZHEN I/O is quite amazing.", "timestamp_created": 1511845127, "timestamp_updated": 1511845465, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.809268", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37844038": {"recommendationid": "37844038", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968574177", "num_games_owned": 1546, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1005, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511835866}, "language": "english", "review": "Perhaps my favorite programming game and favorite zachtronics game yet.

Die zweite Aufgabe dauerte schon etwas l\u00e4nger, da mir die Funktionsweise des Moduls und vor allem die Programmierung desselben noch nicht ganz klar war. Mit etwas T\u00fcftelei gelang mir aber auch dieses irgendwann.\n\nAber schon beim dritten R\u00e4tsel (Pulse Generator) bin ich (fast) verzweifelt! Ich legte das Spiel nach mehreren Fehlversuchen erstmal ad acta und wollte es nach einigen Wochen schon fast deinstallieren, weil ich dachte, das ist dann wohl doch eher was f\u00fcr Elektronik-Nerds, bis ich mir z\u00fcf\u00e4llig und eher unaufmerksam nebenbei ein paar YouTube-Tutorials angeguckt habe... Pl\u00f6tzlich machte es \"Pling\" in meinem Kopf und der Ehrgeiz war wieder geweckt! Also wieder das Handbuch rausgekramt und das soeben gesehene versucht, nachzuvollziehen. Und siehe da: Nach ein paar Anl\u00e4ufen konnte ich auch diese Aufgabe l\u00f6sen. So schwer ist das gar nicht, wenn man es erstmal verstanden hat.\n\nMittlerweile bin ich bei Aufgabe 8 und bisher lie\u00dfen sich alle Aufgaben mit nur ein bis zwei Modulen und ein paar einfachen Befehlen (Addieren, Subtrahieren, Multiplizieren, Wenn-Dann) l\u00f6sen. Wenn ich aber sehe, was im Verlauf des Spiels noch f\u00fcr Module auf mich warten und wie manche L\u00f6sungen ungef\u00e4hr aussehen, dann ahne ich, dass ich noch viele verdammte Stunden an diesem Spiel (und \u00fcber dem Handbuch) sitzen werde...\n\nKlare Kaufempfehlung f\u00fcr alle Bastel-, T\u00fcftel- und vor allem Elektronik-Fans!\n\nP.S.: Ich finde dieses Spiel \u00fcbrigens viel besser als TIS-100, welches oft als \"leichter\" empfohlen wird.

The only other Zachtronics game that I have played is TIS-100 and that will be my benchmark in this review (since Zachtronics games are quite different from other types of games).\n\n~ Gameplay ~\n\nBy far the most intimidating thing about Shenzhen I/O is the 40+-paged manual. However it was a pleasant surprise to discover that most of the pages are just \"filler.\" The only pages that we need to read to begin playing are those in the Language Reference and Parts Datasheets sections.\n\nCompared to TIS-100, Shenzhen I/O is actually enjoyable! The problems that we solve serve a clear purpose, and sometimes we can even see our programs in action! For example, when we are asked to create a program for a gardening robot, we can actually SEE our program in action as the robot executes our code.\n\nIn the early game, most of my gameplay involved tinkering with the components and code, trying to understand the nuances of the game. Towards the end, I found myself spending most of my time away from the code and thinking about the problems instead. \n\n~ Story ~\n\nWe play the role of a young enginner in the near future (around 2024) who is forced to move to China to find work. Despite the initial culture shock of a dystopian society, we quickly find ourselves surrounded by a dynamic cast of coworkers, including other expats facing the same circumstances.\n\nOver the course of the campaign, we discover the nuances of their characters, including their hidden insecurities and grandest ambitions.\n\nIn my opinion, cast of Shenzhen I/O feel just as alive, if not more so, than even some characters from story-based games!\n\n~ Visuals/Music/Ambiance ~\n\nThe interface is mind-blowingly good, especially for a puzzle game (or perhaps I've simply been traumatized by TIS-100). Everything feels smooth and satisfying.\n\n~ Last Thoughts ~\n\nI think that this is a great game for everyone.

Shenzhen however is a more shiney, soulful version of its predecessor, which was based on a computer you discovered from the 1980s of which you unravell the previous (now mysteriously dead) owner's story. This game's situation is quite different in that your tasks are simply just your job. Shenzhen places you as a tech engineer who has moved to China, for some reason, working for a company called Shenzhen, where you log into a mock operating system with an e-mail inbox, with levels presented in the form of e-mail chains containing specifications to build circuits for. Amongst these e-mail chains are colleague banter which I can't say is particularly interesting or entertaining and would rather it was just 1 e-mail to get to the point, or better yet, no e-mails at all and just a task listing instead. The feel of an office environment for a puzzle game actually makes the goal of each task motivation seem as simply 'the company wants to make it' not 'you're solving a problem/puzzle'. The products you're building circuit boards for can be completely uninteresting, such as a sandwich maker and a fake haunted doll audio mechanism. These levels can take many hours, sometimes days to solve, and with the more dreary products at the end of it, it can be hard to press on.\n\nThat being said, the puzzle solving itself is challenging, though requires a lot of patience. There's no hand-holding here, you're pretty much on your own. I find myself pacing around the room thinking of ways to approach things and some levels can go on for several days in my case. I can't say I have this amount of patience for any other game. It feels very rewarding when you complete a level successfully, that is until you are presented with an online score comparison at the end of each level. I hated this in TIS-100. To spend so long cracking a puzzle and to be shown that you've made a comparably inefficient product compared to the rest of the world can be annoyingly anti-climatic. How many of these players simply Googled the best method anyway? We'll never know but the score board doesn't care and there are the numbers right in your face every time. If you're a competitive person however, then you should be alright with this.\n\nLike TIS-100, there is a PDF manual to lay out all the syntax and special in-game devices that you need to know about. The syntax itself is very similar to TIS-100, however a couple of handy commands were removed, such as SWP, though a couple of new ones have been introduced. That being said the very basic language syntax made sense in TIS-100, which was based in the 80s, feels remarkably out of date for a game meant for the present day. You cannot enstate everyday programming features such as variables, methods, functions, proper looping techniques and arrays. The code often becomes spaghetti code with 'GOTO' style (JMP) commands that no programmer would even dream of using today, and 'IF' (TEQ etc.) style conditions that intertwine with each other due to a simple proceeding + or - that could actually be triggered by more than 1 conditional line. Things are quite limited, too, such as just 1 or 2 integer storage module per circuit to work with, limited lines of code available, limited room for circuits and wires on the panel, can all cause frustration and reduce creativity. In fairness however the developers can be appreciated that some limitations are necessary, or the puzzles would be too easy, but I feel that relying on language oddities to make the coding run more efficiently is all slightly unnerving.\n\nAll in all the game is worth it if you're up for a challenge. This is not a fast-paced game and you have only your own brain to rely on. Much of your hair will be pulled, but can all be very rewarding once you crack a level. The player situation of a person simply doing their job is rather unappealing but can be overlooked to access a great experience. I'm 40 hours in and suspect I have at least 40 hours more until I reach (if ever) the end!

However, what I think these people miss is how much better of a programmer doing puzzles can make you. \n\nThe key to developing your ability to think algorithmically is to approach familiar problems in new ways. The easiest way to do this is to give yourself arbitrary constraints, such as limiting the data types you allow yourself to use, etc. Putting yourself in tight constraints forces you to think creatively and that skill will put you miles ahead of where you would be if you always took the easy route. A great analogy is the skill guitar players are encouraged by their teachers to develop from day one: learn where all the notes are on each string. When you start out you might not understand how important this skill is, but then one day you watch the video of Jimi Hendrix playing Red House at Woodstock and, after his high-E string snaps, plays one of the most legendary solos of all time with only five strings. \n\nShenzhen I/O is a game that will help you become a better programmer in the same way that learning every note position on the guitar will help you be a better musician. The game, due to its sparse and creatively constrained assembly language, will force you to think outside of the high-level programming box. For example, what is the optimal way to create an AND condition with only IF conditionals and instruction jumps? These types of \"arbitrary\" constraints are difficult to force yourself into in practice, but the environment of a puzzle game helps alleviate the sense of arbitrariness. \n\nShenzhen I/O, like TIS-100, uses a made up programming language. However, as any third year CS student will tell you, all Turning complete programming languages allow you to compute the same exact things. The real world skills you develop from playing this game are not that of learning a powerful, new language that will make every program you write in the future trivially easy. The skills you gain are the same stated above: an increased ability to think algorithmically. Realizing that CS is a giant tapestry of computable functions and there's more than one way to compute a function is the first step towards becoming a good programmer. Increasing your ability to creatively implement algorithms will help you in the long run more so than sticking with one language and implementation scheme could ever do.", "timestamp_created": 1494492527, "timestamp_updated": 1494492527, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 84, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.886726", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31628911": {"recommendationid": "31628911", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024498006", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1940, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510162575}, "language": "german", "review": "+ geniales Programmiergame\n+ vereinfachte Programmiersprache\n+ Abwechslungsreiche Aufgaben\n+ Grafisch in Ordnung\n+ Solitaire f\u00fcr eine Kopfpause^^\n\n- die Schwierigkeit steigt fast zu schnell\n- die Hilfe ist nur eine Verkn\u00fcpfung auf eine pdf-Datei\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1494260112, "timestamp_updated": 1494260112, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31589277": {"recommendationid": "31589277", "author": {"steamid": "76561198201460258", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 905, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511978248}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041a\u0410\u041a! \u041d\u0443 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u041a\u0410\u041a \u043a\u0442\u043e-\u0442\u043e \u0443\u043c\u0443\u0434\u0440\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e 2 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0438!? \u0412\u0441\u0435\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0442\u0438\u043f, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0435 \u0442\u0435\u0431\u044f...", "timestamp_created": 1494102088, "timestamp_updated": 1494102088, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561753", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31575251": {"recommendationid": "31575251", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963345526", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491027228}, "language": "english", "review": "Strongly recommend for those who like puzzles and especially little code puzzles.

SpaceChem, TIS-100, and Infinifactory are some of my most favorite puzzle games of all time. That said, if you've never played a Zachtronics game, they are infamous for one thing: they are hard puzzle games. And I mean, REALLY hard. The kind of puzzles that make your brain feel like it's turning to mush. The kind of puzzles that stick around in the back of your mind for hours or even days when you're not playing, keeping you wondering \u201cwhat am I missing\u201d or \u201chow else could I solve this.\u201d And then, even after you've solved them, you want to go back and refine it as much as you can to make the most efficient solution. \n\nAs with TIS-100, you're writing pseudo-assembly for fictional microcontrollers. But, instead of having a static 'game board' of microcontrollers, you're now free to arrange your own system using a variety of microcontrollers and other components. I'd say this is a pretty even exchange to TIS-100 in the sense that you're not restricted to a static board and you have freedom to move parts around which can reduce complexity and frustration. But, the catch is, now there are an innumerable number of ways to configure the board which can simultaneously add to the complexity of solving the puzzle. \n\nAs with TIS-100, you're going to be programming at a fairly low level. Background knowledge of the general concepts of assembly language (regardless of architecture) will help, but only to a point. Those who haven't programmed before may very well feel overwhelmed and lost (though, it does start slow and offer a very detailed, yet blunt manual). That said, even people with programming experience will still need to review the manual and keep it handy to complete the missions. If that sounds like too much, I'd suggest going with Spacechem or Infinifactory (both are equally as difficult, but are more user friendly to non-progammers).\n\nBut, if you're a programmer, engineer, computer science student, or anything related to that, and you enjoy the idea of solving brutal programming puzzles using a classic-looking opertaing manual, you'll love this game.", "timestamp_created": 1491421101, "timestamp_updated": 1491421101, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540052", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30952188": {"recommendationid": "30952188", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018242591", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3221, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512670272}, "language": "english", "review": "If you're at all interested in Computer Engineering or Software Engineering, this is the perfect puzzle/intellectual game for you!

It's not exactly \"beginner friendly\" if you've never been exposed to this type of thing, but if you have a bit of time to learn them or better yet understand the underlying principles, this game is a win.\n\n10/10, do recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1485122834, "timestamp_updated": 1485122834, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29423693": {"recommendationid": "29423693", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023302797", "num_games_owned": 274, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 1248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509453278}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent puzzle games for nerds, very polished, no bugs encountered so far.\n\nHighly recommended!", "timestamp_created": 1485097161, "timestamp_updated": 1485097161, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29395416": {"recommendationid": "29395416", "author": {"steamid": "76561198312805620", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489733683}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4ee3\u7801\u957f\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u6076\u5fc3\u5f97\u4e00\u7b14\u3002\u3002\u3002\u4ee3\u7801\u6324\u5728\u4e00\u8d77\u7b80\u76f4\u903c\u6b7b\u5f3a\u8feb\u75c7", "timestamp_created": 1484998012, "timestamp_updated": 1484998012, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543786", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29393715": {"recommendationid": "29393715", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055036003", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 362, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490936178}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e0d\u5c5e\u4e8e\u6211\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\uff0c\u8fc7\u5173\u90fd\u662f\u6309\u7167youtube\u7ed9\u7684\u653b\u7565\u7167\u6284\u7684\uff0c\u7a7a\u5f53\u63a5\u9f99\u5012\u6bd4\u8f83\u6709\u610f\u601d", "timestamp_created": 1484991852, "timestamp_updated": 1484991852, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.204517", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29360066": {"recommendationid": "29360066", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031851310", "num_games_owned": 461, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 360, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484674365}, "language": "english", "review": "This game makes me so God damn angry.

Charging documents and video recordings released to the press indicate Cool Dad was instead arrested after a copy of Shenzhen Solitaire was discovered in his luggage.\n\n\"It is important that we correct erroneous reports,\" stated Shigeru Miyazaki, Ministry of Justice spokesperson. The initial press release two days ago was the result of \"a regrettable translation error\" of a phrase more accurately translated as \"something far worse than amphetamines.\" \"Amphetamine dependency is a treatable condition. Had Cool Dad only been in possession of amphetamines, he could have sought treatment,\" Miyazaki said, \"As this was not the case, it is important his fans understand the severity and danger of his crime.\"\n\nCool Dad's fans and detractors alike have been actively discussing the arrest on social media. Miyazaki presented as examples of rumors necessitating the press conference LikePics expressing bewilderment that the singer/songplayer was arrested and held without bail and TweetPosts alleging he was actually arrested for a conspiracy involving the murder of a music blogger.\n\nShenzhen Solitaire is believed to have been first synthesized in Shenzhen, China and quickly spread worldwide over digital distribution platforms. Security experts are unsure whether it was created by organized crime or an enthusiastic amateur, but all agree its impact has been dramatic. Estimates place economic damages and lost productivity in the billions, with similarly dire health tolls. Electronics manufacturers are particularly badly affected, with tens of thousands of engineers \"completely unable to function\" according to the latest World Health Organization report. Over a dozen countries, including Japan, have outlawed the software outright in an attempt to curb its spread.\n\nThere was no official statement on why the clarification was not issued sooner, but some legal experts believe it may have been due to pressure from Cool Dad's lawyers. \"Cool Dad is simply too Cool to be caught up in something like this,\" stated Hans \"OnlineLawyer\" Lawyermann, one of his on-retainer lawyers, \"It is unfortunate they can't keep their story straight. We're already writing songs sure to convince any jury.\"\n\nSome foreign policy experts, however, argue the delay was due to a mild crisis involving Japan's relations with the newly formed nuclear power, the Meth States of America. Since it split from the United States of America three years ago, multiple diplomatic tensions have evolved over MSA's reactions to real and imagined slights, the most recent of which included a British MP's comments about the MSA's state motto, \"Tweaking so hard right now.\" Experts note the fledgling country is notoriously touchy about drug-related statements.", "timestamp_created": 1484819580, "timestamp_updated": 1484819580, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498241", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29320126": {"recommendationid": "29320126", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115324959", "num_games_owned": 219, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 554, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509374317}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

programming experience and as a computer hobbiest dabbled in assembler programming (Z-80 from Ye Olde Radio Shack days)\n\nSo I came across this game that is part puzzle, part microelectronic engineer.\n\nYou are a new hire at an electronics company in Shenzhen, China and work in a company office to complete tasks given to you from your boss and fellow co-workers to complete. One task requests you to animate a neon sign, another to design a laser tag handler, and so on. You work on a board with a series of wires and microprocessors that tie into other devices like LEDS, Random Access Storage and so on, interconnected witih wires. To make some of the microprocessors work you have to use a programming language very similar to Assembler language which uses registers and accumulators in op code mneumomics. Completing these tasks advance a story of some sort, which is basically work life at a microelectronics company in China.\n\nSimple, yes?\n\nNot quite as simple as you may think. The board has limited space to work on and the pieces can only \"click\" in certain areas. You can't rotate them freely except maybe as a flip, and some pieces like a wire bridge do not rotate at all.  You can't overlap wires, though (as I just learned in the discussion area) you could run a wire UNDER a component.  When you complete the task, you get some feedback from the associated people and access to more functions (like the sandbox where you have a VERY generous work area to work on) and pieces become available. \n\nThere's no tutorial, but you do not need it if you read the manual that is supplied. You don't need programming or microelectronic expertise, since you can \"dope\" out through experimentation on what the programming language and hardware does and how important it is to get all the pieces of your work to talk to each other within a \"tick\" or interval of time that passes. Timing really is important especially since you need to move data from one part to another, otherwise you may miss an event or worse lock the entire board up. \n\nThis is a good game to play, and I highly recommend it for several reasons.\n\nThe first is the sandbox itself once it unlocks. Once you unlock it, you can take a break from the tasks that advance the storyline and go play in the sandbox and make some pretty cool things that make noise, light up stuff, or display on a screen. Making a simple game with limited I/O interaction is not out of the question and can be fun.\n\nThere's also that sense of accomplishment that you got a task solved and it gives your brain a workout. At 52 years old I'm looking for things that keep my middle aged grey matter active so I don't go senile. This game will definately do it but your head is going to hurt at times. Really. This is not some random shoot'm up game. You will need to use your brain but that does not mean it can't be fun. \n\nThe one thing -- and I've mentioned this in the discussion forum ---- is that there should be no set limit on the size of the workspace. You should have a generous amount of room to come up with any solution and setting the size of the board to something that, in my opinion, limits the alternatives to finding a solution, especially since the tasks will get progressively harder and demand more pieces and wires. That one thing could be something that could put you off continuing with the game progression because it's going to pXss you off when you run out of room. I can come up with any solution but I need the space to do it. It's like trying to build a space shuttle in a closet.\n\nAgain, do get the game, for the sandbox feature alone. It is pretty cool and you can do some neat stuff with it.", "timestamp_created": 1484013009, "timestamp_updated": 1484166453, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523449", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29127412": {"recommendationid": "29127412", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975101989", "num_games_owned": 417, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 4674, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484529837}, "language": "english", "review": "You may be wondering why I'm thumbing down a game I've spent over 70 hours playing. I did enjoy the game, but I simply cannot recommend it to anyone except the most hardcore fans of Zachtronics' other games. And Shenzhen I/O is the only Zachtronics game which I've had no desire to replay. \n\nMy biggest complaint is the size of the boards. They are unfairly small. \nIn Zach's other games, constantly adding and testing parts is how I would work my way through the logic of the puzzle, step by step. You could make a big messy solution at first, and then worry about optimizing it later. But Shenzhen I/O actively discourages you from playing this way, especially after the first campaign is over. There is simply not enough room on the later boards to reasonably work with.\n  \nIt's extremely frustrating when you have an idea for how to solve a puzzle, but you're too busy playing tetris with the chip pieces to implement it. \nI would spend so much time screwing around with chip and wire placements that I would lose my train of thought, and be unable to solve the puzzles within the game. I would have to turn the game off and go meticulously draw out a board plan on paper before even attempting to solve it again. This is just too much like real work to be fun.\n\nAnother complaint I have is that compared to TIS-100, the instruction set for sending commands between chips is much less robust. TIS-100 had a \"Jump Relative Offset\" instruction, which meant all you had to do was tell the other chip what line to jump to in the code and it would run it. In Shenzhen I/O you can't do this. So you end up using much more code to accomplish the same thing, which quickly fills up the limited space within the chips, forcing you to add more and more chips, exacerbating the problem of the small board sizes.\n\nI feel Shenzhen I/O would be a much better game if the board sizes were bigger, or the chips smaller. Zach's other games had restrictions on solution sizes, sure. But not like this. Shenzhen I/O takes it too far. It's claustrophobic.\n  \nInfinifactory and TIS-100 are two of my favorite games of all time. Infinifactory in particular I could recommend to anyone.

I spent my first 40 minutes of playing this game not actually playing it. Rather, I left the game open idling on my desktop, and personally got up from my desk and started painstakingly searching my house for a proper 3-ring binder and other menial office supplies to store the game's 40+ page instruction manual, a manual that is pretty much mandatory to even start playing the game.\n\nAnd you know what? I loved every minute of it.\n\nThis game's way of world building through something as simple as a printable instruction manual is something I've never seen a game do before (at least, not in the past decade or so). The way the individual pages look like they were hastingly printed from random pre-Web 2.0 webpages, or the way you're highly encouraged to build the equivalent of a portfolio just for this game alone, is all really incredible. It makes the game feel less like a video game, and more like an elusive second job.\n\nI could also go on about how much I love the actual, like, \"game\" part of SHENZHEN as well, but I have a feeling that's been long talked about by others. Basically, it's computer programming in its sheerest form: pure problem solving and quantitative logistics, without any of the \"aimless probing through 10+ year old internet forums to figure out why a certain function just isn't working,\" a familiar staple to actual programming. It's highly dependant on whether that sort of stuff sounds appealing to you, but even if it doesn't, I recommend checking it out simply because of how innovative the game's approach to freeform logic puzzling is.\n\nI should also mention as a sidenote how much I love the game's visual aesthetic/presentation. I've always been a fan of neofuturist-Asian settings, and this game's attempt at it fits it perfectly. It even complements the very gameplay of it as well: your job in the game is to create ultra-cheap microcontrollers for a near-future Shenzhen electronic market, so your goal isn't so much to make super fancy designs or something that's even relatively reliable, but rather to create something that just works and is cheap enough to ship without angering upper management.", "timestamp_created": 1483863862, "timestamp_updated": 1483863941, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529234", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29105491": {"recommendationid": "29105491", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983328534", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486009360}, "language": "english", "review": "Full disclosure: I only play this game for the solitare.", "timestamp_created": 1483844617, "timestamp_updated": 1483844617, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29093564": {"recommendationid": "29093564", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070696095", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 971, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483824626}, "language": "english", "review": "It is a good game to feel own stupidity after ten years in real programming.

I happy to play Shenzhen I/O and wait more games.\n\nAnd if you real programmer, and guess what better buy TIS-100 or Shenzhen I/O - buy both of them, this is a great games!\n\nHappy New Year and best wishes to all!", "timestamp_created": 1483809292, "timestamp_updated": 1483809292, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29078736": {"recommendationid": "29078736", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142499102", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 607, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499587586}, "language": "japanese", "review": "mov? slp? slx?...\u3068\u4e00\u898b\u3057\u3066\u3001\u3088\u304f\u308f\u304b\u3089\u306a\u3044\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u305f\u304f\u3055\u3093\u51fa\u3066\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\n\u6700\u521d\u306e\u65b9\u306f\u305d\u308c\u3053\u305d\u300c1\u3068\u6765\u305f\u30891\u3068\u51fa\u529b\u3057\u308d\u300d\u307f\u305f\u3044\u306a\u7c21\u5358\u306a\u554f\u984c\u3067\u3059\u3002\n5\u554f\u76ee\u3050\u3089\u3044\u304b\u3089\u300cp1\u3068p2\u3092\u6bd4\u8f03\u3057\u3066p1\u304c\u5927\u304d\u3051\u308c\u3070\u3042\u30fc\u3057\u308d\u300d\u307f\u305f\u3044\u306a\u8907\u96d1\u306a\u554f\u984c\u306b\u3002\n7\u554f\u76ee\u3050\u3089\u3044\u306b\u306f\u300c\u9023\u7d9a\u3067\u307e\u3068\u3081\u3066\u304f\u308b\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u51e6\u7406\u3057\u308d\u300d\u307f\u305f\u3044\u306a\u611f\u3058\u3067\u982d\u304c\u30d1\u30f3\u30af\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\u3002\n\n\u305d\u308c\u3067\u3082\u3002\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u597d\u304d\u306a\u4eba\u3001\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u30b4\u30eb\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u3001\u30a2\u30bb\u30f3\u30d6\u30ea\u8a00\u8a9e\u3092\u5b66\u3073\u305f\u3044\u4eba\u306b\u306f\u304a\u3059\u3059\u3081\u3067\u3059\u3002\n\u306a\u304a\u3001UI\u306a\u3069\u306f\u5168\u90e8\u82f1\u8a9e\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001\u8a00\u8a9e\u30ea\u30d5\u30a1\u30ec\u30f3\u30b9\u3068\u554f\u984c\u306f\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u7248\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9\u304c\u5b58\u5728\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1483765498, "timestamp_updated": 1483765498, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29057543": {"recommendationid": "29057543", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272195705", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502886326}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5236\u4f5c\u8005\u5f88\u597d\uff0c\u6211\u901a\u8fc7\u90ae\u7bb1\u63d0\u95ee\uff0czach\u53ca\u65f6\u56de\u7b54\uff0c\u5bfb\u627e\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6cd5", "timestamp_created": 1483701966, "timestamp_updated": 1483701966, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500499", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29051687": {"recommendationid": "29051687", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976622984", "num_games_owned": 536, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 230, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492566829}, "language": "english", "review": "I have never programmed anything more complicated than my TV in my life.

Some of them are quite difficult and some (even later puzzles) aren't really that hard. The puzzles all have some practical application and a story behind them and I really appreciate that. That aspect was lacking from TIS-100.\n\nThere is a leaderboard where you are compared to everyone else who has solved the puzzle. This brings up an interesting point - too many people seem to all have solved the puzzles in the same (usually very efficient) way. It's pretty obvious that a whole lot of people are cheating and looking up the answers. If you want to cheat maybe find another game. Cheating takes the whole point out of a programming game.\n\nThe only really bad thing I could say about the game is that I think they tried too hard to make the game hard via making the electronics in the game really, really bad and the processors have very low memory. That's all kind of artificial but I suppose the alternative would have been to make the programming more difficult through harder algorithms and maybe people would complain about that too. I just wish it were possible to put more lines of code on each processor and/or use more processors and other components on a single design.

If you enjoyed games like tis-100 or the human resource machine than this game is a must own. The game has a fairly steep learning curve, if you don't understand an assembly language I would recommend playing tis-100 before playing this. The learning curve in tis-100 seems to be a bit better paced for an absolute beginner, while this game is well paced for someone who knows a thing or two about assembly, but while tis-100 is a great game, this is my favorite by far. The puzzles are fun and engaging, each puzzle makes me feel like I have accomplished something. Many of the puzzles have animations tied to your output, so you can see how the machine that you are creating works while developing it. If I had any advice I would say read! the manual is part of the gaming experience, similar to the manual in tis-100 except way better done. The story bits are nice as well, each character in your company has a distinct personality and the dialog is a good relief after solving a difficult puzzle.

Alt-Tabbing back and forth can be really annoying.\nAnd I don't know whether the fact that the parts of manuals written in Chinese is intentional to add 'the fun' or we'll have full English manuals some time soon. \nMy rating 4/5 (for not providing English manuals).", "timestamp_created": 1481658685, "timestamp_updated": 1481658685, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497378", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28338671": {"recommendationid": "28338671", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978266558", "num_games_owned": 1456, "num_reviews": 230, "playtime_forever": 2788, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505099493}, "language": "english", "review": "If you've played a Zach game you know what you're getting in to. This is a well-designed and polished programming puzzle game. The solution space is massive and then it's all about grinding out optimizations versus your friends or world histograms. Hours of fun if that's what you're in to!\n\nIt looks most like TIS-100, but it functions very differently. In this you use threads that sleep and wake up on timed or interrupt schedules. Your process must sleep between frames, but otherwise there\u2019s no time restriction on how much processing it does in a frame. You\u2019re given a grid to assemble various processors and parts connected by ribbon cables (similar to Spacechem pipes). Your goals are cost (each processing part has different prices), power (each instruction run counts), and total lines of code.\n\nThe story is simply that you\u2019re a programmer at a Chinese engineering company. Company emails set up the product goals and then you build the products. Some products have in fiction reference specs which come in the form of the printable PDF. The characters are great and there\u2019s fun bits of trivia and scifi sprinkled throughout. There\u2019s also a solitaire minigame which is pretty fun.\n\nThis is one of the most difficult Zach games, but once I wrapped my head around the hardware limitations the challenges became very interesting. High scores can really take some creativity and it fun gloating about a crazy exploit you found while friends believe your score is impossible.

If that scares you do not bother :) What is not in the manual you have to figure out yourself during the game, or hear about in the ingame mails. The game is a bit light on story but I found the ingame e-mail discussions really amusing. The puzzles can be difficult, although previous assembly experience helps a lot, Having that I find especially the floor planning - laying out the boards so that everything fits - challenging. For the ultimate challenge you can try to optimize out the last instruction, or power usage, or circuit cost, comparing scores with other players. Also a lot of fun is the sandbox where you can freely play around with the components.

Diese Spielen fallen unter anderem in die Kategorien \"Puzzle, Simulation und Programmieren\".\nShenzhen I/O f\u00fcgt sich hier perfekt ein: \nMan ist neuer Angestellter in einer chinesischen Firma, die kleine elektronische Ger\u00e4tschaften baut. \nUnsere Aufgabe ist es nun, diese aus unterschiedlichen Bauteilen a) zusammen zu bauen und b) auch danach zu programmieren, was sie denn sp\u00e4ter leisten sollen. Das ist am Anfang noch einigerma\u00dfen einfach: Wir sollen eine Attrappe  bauen, die blickende Lichter einer \u00dcberwachungskamera simuliert. Dazu haben wir einen kleinen Mikrocontroller, den wir in einer Art Assembler programmieren k\u00f6nnen. In sp\u00e4teren Auftr\u00e4gen kommen dann nat\u00fcrlich weitere Bauteile hinzu und es wird auch komplizierter. \nEs gibt bei diesem Spiele KEIN Tutorial, das an einen an die Hand nimmt und zeigt, wie es gemacht wird. Stattdessen hei\u00dft es hier sehr deutlich RTFM! (Read The Fine Manual oder F*cking, aber das Manual hier ist wirklich brauchbar).\nMit Hilfe des Manuals kommt man dann auch gut zurecht.\nWie bei den schon genannten Spielen (Space Chem und TIS-1000) muss man hier kleine Anweisungen schreiben und pr\u00fcfen, ob diese auch sinnvoll umgesetzt werden k\u00f6nnen. \nKlar, das Spiel bietet so gesehen keine Action, die musikalischen Effekte sind unaufgeregt und die Grafik dem Spiel ausreichen angemessen. Aber darum geht es auch alles nicht hier. Es hei\u00dft, dass (auch angehende) Ingenieure wohl noch viel von dem Spiel lernen k\u00f6nnen. Aber auch Nicht-Ingis werden, so sie diese Denkspiele m\u00f6gen, Gefallen an dem Spiel finden. Wer sich nicht sicher ist, kann man TIS-1000 anfangen, das ist etwas g\u00fcnstiger (grafisch aber noch minimaler), aber verfolgt ein \u00e4hnliches Konzept.\nKlar Kaufempfehlung!\n", "timestamp_created": 1480171806, "timestamp_updated": 1480171806, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27671577": {"recommendationid": "27671577", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018592660", "num_games_owned": 284, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496267593}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like puzzle games and programming this is a great game.", "timestamp_created": 1480170623, "timestamp_updated": 1480170623, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518519", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27670915": {"recommendationid": "27670915", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126291015", "num_games_owned": 1426, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 984, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480445273}, "language": "english", "review": "best solitaire you can buy for $13.49\n\nwould become immortal again 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1480170377, "timestamp_updated": 1480170377, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.461847", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27654196": {"recommendationid": "27654196", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028229179", "num_games_owned": 440, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481336582}, "language": "english", "review": "Combines puzzle solving and programming...sure you may have to read a manual, but you might actually learn something as well!

You use a limited instruction set to program small chips to accomplish a variety of tasks given to you. You'll program an animated neon sign, a sandwich maker, an alarm system, and various other electronic thingamabobs. You'll rage at needing just one more line of code but having no space for it, needing just another register to store data in or needing more space on your board to place another chip.

It is also a strangely strong immersive experience - considering it lacks all the \"fireworks\" of AAA game intros, I felt totally absorbed in the world. I even had to look out the window to check I was still at home and not in China...\n\nThe tried and tested formula is that there are puzzles with no single optimal solution. Instead, the solution to each problem has to find a balance between competing measurements - do you make it fast or do you make it cheap? This is supported by excellent leaderboards and comparisons that make competition with \"the rest of the world\" fun.\n\nThe problems in SHENZHEN are in the world of integrated circuits - you get a bunch of chips and several lines to program those chips. These instrcutions are very simple, but also expressive - meaning that (relatively speaking) the game is easy to play and hard to master. I say relatively speaking because, it's not \"easy\" in the arcade games sense - you do need to invest some time to get started, and it will continuously strain your brain, but in a very fair way. \n\nIt also comes with a great sense of humor, a relaxing card game (which would make a great standalone phone game.. please :D?), tons of puzzles and a prototyping freeform editor that lets you build all manner of crazy.

The more you can optimize the code, the fewer processors you have to use (and often you need the space), so the game becomes much more of a puzzle than simply writing code.\n\nThe game has a good level of difficulty, such that it's a reasonably difficult puzzle to complete each level without worrying about efficiency, but as your scores for number of parts and number of instructions executed are shared to the world and compared with the rest of the players, there's a drive to make your solutions as efficient as possible, which adds worlds more difficulty. If you're into that, you can spend half an hour just figuring out how to make part of your code one line shorter so that it fits into the memory of a single processor. Or you can give up and decide merely finishing the levels is enough for you.\n\nIf you like programming puzzles or open-ended puzzle games with countless ways to reach a solution, this is one of the best such games I've played.", "timestamp_created": 1479955101, "timestamp_updated": 1479955101, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26989500": {"recommendationid": "26989500", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022244234", "num_games_owned": 1210, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3661, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491977231}, "language": "english", "review": "Zachtronics continues their streak of really good games and brings fresh new ideas to Shenzhen I/O.", "timestamp_created": 1479953937, "timestamp_updated": 1479953937, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26987559": {"recommendationid": "26987559", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027647767", "num_games_owned": 431, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2038, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499961238}, "language": "english", "review": "Really polished, really addicting puzzle game.

If this appeals to you, read further.\n\nUnlike SpaceChem and Infinifactory, which focus on spatial reasoning, SHENZHEN (and its predecessor, TIS-100) dive into coding in assembly. What this loses in presentation, it makes up for in depth: the puzzles generally have more compact solutions, requiring more planning, and almost always require a divide-and-conquer approach to succeed.\n\nIf this is not your thing, stick to other Zachtronics titles or other puzzle games. If this _is_ your thing and you have yet to play TIS-100, play that first. Puzzles in SHENZHEN will build on the principles of sorting, searching, and solving that you'll learn there.\n\nTIS-100 can thus be considered the 100 level course to SHENZHEN's 200 and 300 level courses. Since many of the puzzles in both games are inspired by real algorithms and computer architecture principles, you'll learn a thing or two about how professional software engineering works, too.\n\nThe biggest improvement over TIS-100 is story and scope. The story is _fantastic_, easily exceeding the writing quality of SpaceChem and Infinifactory (and providing depth and heart that would be too spoilery to describe). The language and modules give you far more freedom than any other Zachtronics title to date, even allowing you to design your own (TI Calculator-like) games within the game. Seriously, check the forums, those games are amazing.\n\nThe primary drawback to SHENZHEN I/O is its difficulty and its reliance on the manual (by design). SHENZHEN is unashamedly not a casual puzzle game -- it is a game that requires investment, paying that investment back in triplicate.\n\nIf you're a puzzle game affectionado or a programmer looking to expand the limits of what you thought yourself capable of, pick this up. If you made it through TIS-100 and hunger for more, pick this up.

Therefore, you will probably have to find 3 different designs to optimize each one of these and that is where the replayability of the game is great.

It builds and expands from TIS-100 by giving you different kinds of parts to work with, with heavy focus on the microcontroller chips in between. The familiar elements of problem-solving, discovery and optimization define their own puzzle subgenre, a \"zachlike\".\n\nThe game starts with an optional real-world quest of assembling your own manual by going to a supply store and buying a three-ring binder and a 5-part divider. Then you print the 40+ page manual and divide the pages according to the instructions. I absolutely loved this part, bringing back memories from my youth when games shipped with real manuals.\n\nThe game starts with easy puzzles, which jog you through the assembly language the game uses. Real-world programming experience helps tremendously here. As you progress through the puzzles the difficulty curve picks up delightfully, although I felt the suggested order was somewhat off for a few of them. Luckily the game always offers multiple puzzle options for progression, so you can make progress even if you get stuck on a puzzle.\n\nI've seen some confused opinions about whether the programming in this game is real or not, so take it from a professional software developer: this is real low-level programming, albeit in a very limited fictional environment. This game tickled my brain just like a good programming task does. Too bad it often doesn't make sense to optimize my real world code to this degree!\n\nThe game is still listed as early access, although there is already tons of puzzles to solve.

I'll break down them into three separate and simplified categories:\n\n1) Optimisers. These people compete within their circle for better scores, and will get the most out of this game.\nPeople who are good at code and have competed in other zachtronics games will generally be in this category.\n\n2) General. People who played through the game, but do not have much incentive to optimise any of their code due to lack of interest.\nMost of the community is here.\n\n3) Casual. People who played through part of the game but has stopped due to it having a steep learning curve or disinterest in the gameplay.\nA lot of people are here, and bought the game without enough research, has expectations from previous games, or just do not enjoy the gameplay.\n\n\nI'll say this much: this game requires you to make friends to have a good time. Yes, in this single player game, having friends helps.\n(1) will have many people competing and constantly interacting, (2) will have some friends, but in the same category, they will not have enough incentive to keep going. If you have a lot of friends that have quit or stopped, then some of the experience will be less enjoyable.\n\nI personally fall in category (2). I don't have enough desire to optimise, or desires to keep up with the top. I did not enjoy some of the later puzzles. One of the only reasons I am still here is because I am waiting for the level editor.\nI'd place myself in my own separate category that focuses on creating the experience and puzzles I want, as opposed to playing through the campaign that I may not enjoy. I have created several puzzles for the past 2 games, and hopefully for this as well.\n\nPurely singleplayer, it is a mediocre experience. The more you engage with the community on steam and reddit, the better it will be.

If you like Zachtronics games and/or you're a filthy nerd like me, don't hesitate to pick this one up. \n\n[h1]Overview[/h1]\n\nShenzhen I/O is a game where you play a budding young engineer who moves to China to pursue an engineering job at Longteng Electronics. Your tasks consist of constructing and programming simple gadgets out of microcontrollers, logic gates, memory units, and so on. Also in your job description is fighting badly-translated datasheets, scribbling down undocumented behavior, exploiting the hidden assumptions within the automated testcases, and turning a convenient blind eye to the increasingly suspicious entities that Longteng takes contracts from... \n\n[h1]So... is it fun?[/h1]\n\nIf assembly programming and RTFM is your kind of thing, then yes! Definitely print out the manual on paper and bind it for extra authenticity. \n\nThe learning curve is well-balanced. The early puzzles are straightforward, and the increase in difficulty is fairly gradual, but the eventual difficulty ceiling is very high. A hallmark of Zachtronics games is that they're not overly hard to beat per se, but they are incredibly difficult to master. Any solution is good enough for you to progress as long as it's correct, so you might not have trouble scrapping together a [i]passable[/i] solution to a problem, but beware! The game will show you histograms of how your solution compares to players around the world. If you're anything like me, this will drive you to improve every solution to be at least above average, so you're not that shmuck on the bottom end of that bell curve. \n\nIf you're the tinkering and experimenting type, iterating (heh) over your past designs hugely extends Shenzhen's potential gameplay time. The histograms display your [i]best[/i] design cost and your [i]best[/i] design power, so you can make a dedicated design for each metric. Over time, you will accrue more knowledge about the hardware you're working with, you'll have access to more hardware choices and little programming tricks, and this will make you want to go back and see how many yuan/watts you can shave off your old designs. Hell, you will more than likely find yourself going back to the [i]very first tutorial puzzle[/i] to optimise it with your new-found knowledge. I know I did. \n\n[h1]I've already played TIS-100, how does Shenzhen compare to that?[/h1]\n\nTIS-100 is a more rigidly structured, purer programming game with a heavier emphasis on speed and parallelism. Data comes in as fast as your design can accept it. One of my best TIS-100 programs used 7 processors pipelined together to process data in huge batches. \n\nShenzhen is different in that the structure is much more freeform, and the emphasis is on cost and power, meaning the lowest amount of effort required to meet the specification. Your layout and component choice is just as important as your programming ability. There's no real notion of 'speed' since your microcontrollers are infinitely fast and you sleep to advance to the next game tick, so there's rarely incentive to parallelise.\n\nThe assembly language itself is also different. Rather than the conditional jumps which formed the basis of control flow in TIS-100, you set ARM-style comparison flags using test instructions and then conditionally execute [i]any[/i] kind of instruction, allowing for an appreciably different programming style. \n\n[h1]I'm a complete newcomer to programming. Will I struggle?[/h1]\n\nI would say that Shenzhen is approachable enough for non-programmers (as long as you put in some effort), but a challenging game for even seasoned assembly programmers to finish in its entirety. If you want a more gentle (but probably less interesting) introduction, try Human Resource Machine instead. \n\n[h1]How useful is knowing Chinese?[/h1]\n\nNot very. You will mostly glean a bit more backstory.\n\n[h1]Why not just do some real programming?[/h1]\n\nThat's like saying \"why play FIFA when you could go out and play real football.\" It's just not the same experience. If it was, there wouldn't be so many people playing Shenzhen after arriving home from the programming they get paid to do. \n\nBesides, you do develop the same kind of skills, so it's not like your time is wasted, far from it.  \n\n[h1]Why should I not buy this game?[/h1]\n\nDon't buy this game if you don't like (or think that you would like) programming. ~20% of the game is high-level (routing and placement and whatnot), and the remaining ~80% is hardcore assembly programming. If you know that that's not your jam, then neither is this game. \n\nDon't buy this game if you're impatient or don't like feeling dumb sometimes. The later puzzles are devilishly difficult and will have the smartest among us kneading their temples.

When the game tells you 'Part not recommended' it's often 'lying' - if you know what you're doing you can often make a much cheaper and better design using the LC7 parts which burn no power.  Also, think really hard about what the + - test stuff can do.  [spoiler]It's much more powerful than it appears[/spoiler]\n\nThis is basically a cross between TIS-100 and SpaceChem.  If you don't know those, then you're playing the part of a firmware engineer for a Chinese firm.  You get little projects and it's up to you to do board layout and programming of the microcontrollers (UC, tiny CPUs with I/O).  Challenge comes in because the board space is limited, the UCs are ridiculously limited, and you've got a metagame of minimizing your parts cost and power usage.\n\nThe projects are fun - do an advertising display, do a drinking game scorer, do a fraudulent audiophile sound 'optimizer'.   They're doable chunks. And once you've got one working then you can copy it and try to improve it - the game doesn't require it, but you WANT to.\n\nThe funny thing is that this is my day job as a firmware / board engineer and I still enjoy it because they're little bite sized fun things you can do and then you're done with them.  I also feel that if you're decent at this 'game' you would stand a decent shot at being a firmware engineer.

Puzzles are really great and challenging, but this is only part of the story. Another part that makes this game so awesome is internal mails. The storyline in this game is about engineer from Europe who relocates to China and joins company that develop circuits. You receive new puzzles as emails within conversations with your colleagues and these email threads are super funny and awesome! Special thanks to occasional emails that give some insights about China and Shenzhen, I personally find them super interesting and very natural in this storyline.\n\nHere is some suggestions for improvements that came to my mind after some time playing.\n1. please make comments as part of the workplace, not as a separate module. I use this extensively for code drafts and snippets during problem solving and the fact that it is limited in space and consume space on the circuit is really frustrating. I believe that ordinary text field without any limitations and adjustable in visual size (so you can make it bigger or smaller depending on your needs) is much more natural and just make things more convenient without affecting gameplay\n2. I was really surprised that some pretty basic (in my opinion) modules are missing: like scale signal (multiply by constant), shift (add constant) or inverse (like 100-value) are missed. Yes, they make some of the first puzzles a little bit easier, but from my perspective these are very good basic primitives on top of which you can create some very interesting challenges.\n\nAnyway, thanks for a great game, really enjoying playing it!

And it looks like it's going to be replayable as well, considering that on some of the puzzles I went for a \"let's get this working and worry about getting a cheaper board next\".\n\nOn top of that, the story, in-game emails and characters were pretty entertaining to follow, and having to refer to the documentation was surprisingly fun and immersive.\n\nThe only drawback, I guess, is that it expects the player to either know (a very basic subset of) assembler or be ready to learn it -quickly, too, because it soon jumps into not-that-straightforward solutions.\n\nI'm definitely going to check the rest of these guys' games now.

It might look like a game at least partially about electronic engineering but it's really not. Yes you place down parts and connect them with wires but that's not where the challenge of this game comes from. Designing the circuit is easy because the space restricitions are very loose. The hard part is chosing the right parts and programming them with the fake assembly language the game provides.\nThat being said, the game is really good at this. The level design is amazing and the difficulty curve is almost always just right. Except if you have no experience in programming whatsoever. In that case you will hit a crazy brick wall just in the first level. Instead of a tutorial, the game provides a manual which is written in-lore. While this is super charming and a very interesting challenge for experienced software developers, I feel this will be a nightmare to anyone without any experience in programming. That the manual is not doing a great job at explaining the assembly language at all, doesn't help obviously.\nOverall the game is really good and feels like a more polished version of TIS-100 while being different enough to not just feel like more of the same. While learning TIS-100 might be easier than learning SHENZHEN I/O, the difficulty curve is way more friendly in the latter.\nOverall it's great fun if you into this kind of stuff and I highly recommend it.\nA word on Early Access: The developer Zachtronics has an amazing track record on Early Access with Infinifactory and TIS-100. As the other two SHENZHEN I/O enters Eearly Access in a close-to-finished state already and if it follows its two predecessors, it will fully release in a couple of months with a little bit more polish and a bunch of extra content.\n\nIf you want an even more in depth opinion and an introduction to the games mechanics, you can watch my video here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOa9Lq11F1k", "timestamp_created": 1476388000, "timestamp_updated": 1476388000, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533135", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26016697": {"recommendationid": "26016697", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968062714", "num_games_owned": 363, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 519, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476627669}, "language": "english", "review": "I have 245 games in my Steam library at the time of writing this review and I have NEVER reviewed a game before on Steam.

Basically, a modern and shiny TIS-100, minus lonely/creepy part, plus the \"corporate atmosphere\" part.\n\nBasic gameplay: you get puzzles, you solve them, then you see some metrics for your solution, then you spend an hour trying to optimize stuff to beat everyone else.\nYou can skip this part and just rush forward, but it's amazingly satisfying to find the solution that is better than your friend's solution.\n\nWhat makes this game unique compared to many other puzzle games (even the nerdy ones) is the anmosphere. You don't get a tutorial, you get a 40-page-long manual. Wild, unreliable, with some marketing BS (not the real one, it's just for the flavor) and the part of it is in Chinese (10/10 for realism), and you need to dig into it to solve your problems. You don't just get normal levels: you get emails that contain a lot more than just your task. You don't get just \"scores\" for the solution, you get the cost and energy consumption metrics that you are trying to minimize.\n\nRemember that time when programming was fun for you? If you do, try this game, it's totally worth it even in the current EA state. If you don't (or if you don't get it why some people go ecstatic after making their program 2% more optimal), than this game may not be for you, unfortunately. But you are totally encouraged to try: there are no \"frustrating\" parts that can make this game unaccessible if you are not familiar with programming.\n\nGame helps you everywhere it can (Ctrl+Z totally works, you can clone you solutions to fiddle with them without any risk of destroying the original, etc.), and it's unlikely that you will hit a brick wall that you can't overcome no matter what you do. It's always possible to make a \"terrible\" solution (slow and expensive), and revisit it later, when you'll get better (or unlock new elements). Yes, there is a progression system that unlocks new stuff as you go. You won't get immediately overhelmed with all these micro-controllers that you see on screenshots. Game has a very comfortable learning curve (at least so far, I haven't finished the EA version yet), and it's a lot more novice-friendly than TIS-100, for example. It doesn't mean that this game is \"shallow\" though. While I think that TIS-100 had a lot more room for optimizations (so you could spend more time on finding the best possible solution), these optimizations sometimese where quite exhausting if you was trying to minimize the runtime (you had to write a lot of code to make it marginally faster). Here the game uses different metrics that encourage you to write compact code, and this just feels nice. Best solutions don't feel \"bulky\". They feel \"clever\".\n\nThe only complaint I have right now is that the information about other players' solutions is very unprecise (it's just a clunky histogram). I mean, the whole game is about optimizations, why can't I see if I found the best known solution or not?

There is no middle ground. While the puzzle aspect of this game is strong and the interface is great, the fact that you have to scratch your head and dig into manuals everytime something is introduced to you can be little bit off putting to say the least. In addition to the fact that the game requiring you to read through 41 page manual, it also require you to debug your chip if anything goes wrong. Sounds familiar, right? Yeah, this is exactly how you process through the actual project, if you ever have programmed something. The only difference is, this is much simplified and less infuriating because \"it's just a game.\" \n\nAs for the engineer wannabes like me (well, to be fair I am an engineer but majored in chemicals), the game is fun and pushes your mind in a right way for a challenge. However, for everyone else, the game can be bit overwhelming. So Shenzhen I/O is more like OOP for the dummies instead of a game in a traditional sense. Yes, it's a puzzle, but at the same time it's bunch of engineering projects that requires you to actually carefully plan and think hard before you do anything. \n\nSo If you're up for time-killing fun or puzzle that only requires you to think within the set of mechanics it directly introduces to you, then look for something else. The game is great but it also is impossible to grasp without (really) basic understanding of programming. But, if you loved TIS-100 and love to torture your brain even when you're resting, then you chose the right game.

Personally I found it overwhelming in the extreme, because the way in which the manual is written assumes you already have a base level of competence with programming, and there is absolutely no effort made within the game to familiarise you with practical implementations of the functions the manual describes. If you're after a game that might teach you a bit about programming, this is not it.\n\nSpacechem is my favourite game of all time, and Infinifactory is not far behind, but if Zach intends to make his future projects as unwelcoming and opaquely explained as TIS-100 and SHENZHEN I/O, this is simply a path down which I cannot follow him. I very much hope that his next game might cut neophytes like myself some slack, otherwise I guess I'm done with my favourite developer.\n\nEdit: I deliberately kept my playtime low to keep the possibility of a refund open (one I've since taken up), however I spent at least an hour poring over the manual before even booting the game up, and closed and restarted the game many times after consulting the manual to try and come up with a solution. I gave it much more than 30 minutes of my time, but it just didn't click with me.\n\nAnd before giving this a thumbs down, please keep in mind that 'Did you find this helpful?' is not synonymous with 'Do you share this person's assessment of the product and find that the level of enjoyment they derived from it closely matches your own?'\n\nEdit 2: This review has attracted way more attention than I had anticipated. It was written quickly on a first-and-last-impressions sort of basis, so I didn't go into much detail. At this stage I feel I have a duty to provide more context about myself and how this affects my enjoyment of the game.\n\nAn argument could be made that I was stupid for buying this after having difficulty with TIS-100. I bought SHENZHEN I/O because it was made clear that TIS-100 was a side project created for a very niche audience, and the visually dreary interface itself reinforced this. From the trailer, SHENZHEN I/O seemed like it would have much broader appeal - an attractive interface that made use of the mouse, the usual great Zachtronics music, actual promotion in the lead-up to its release. I thought that, while employing similar concepts to TIS-100, it would make them more accessible. I was wrong. And it's possible that assembly programming mightn't ever be something I find accessible.\n\nPersonally, I suck with numbers. I hate them. As it turns out, assembly programming deals with almost nothing but numbers. I didn't go into this blind, however - I had a quick look at what assembly programming looked like, and, true to my username, I made an erroneous assumption: I assumed that the numbers were not used in the sense of [i]value[/i] but, rather, purely as [i]symbol[/i]. For example, in a sudoku puzzle, the numeral 9 doesn't actually represent a quantity of nine units, it's just a symbol interchangeable with any other character which simply represents a guarantee that there are certain other places in the grid within which it cannot appear. In the context of assembly, I assumed it would work on the basis of 0 representing an off position and 1 representing an on, and similarly simple functions. Numbers [i]can[/i] function in this way, however they also often need to be used in a quantitative context, functioning within complex, infinitely repeating algorithms. If this doesn't sound like your cup of tea, don't bother with SHENZHEN I/O, or assembly programming in general.\n\nI got along with Spacechem and Infinifactory because their circuits used sensors which worked on the basis of 'if x = true then do y'. Simple stuff, with which you can make extremely complex devices. Assembly works more on the basis of 'if x = more than n squared divided by acc then do y, else do z'. Complex stuff, with which you can make even more complex devices. I'm sure that someone more experienced could give a far better explanation than that, but I think I at least have the nuts and bolts correct. SHENZHEN I/O requires not just the purely visual logic of Infini/chem (i.e. how do I combine and transport these ready-made products) but numeric logic as well (i.e. how do I make these ready-made products function differently by playing with the digits within them). One works with objects, while the other works with concepts.\n\nI have to reiterate, there is no problem with the game - its standard of presentation is right up there with any other commercial release from Zachtronics and it plays just fine. That said, there is a portion of the Zachtronics audience to whom this game will not appeal, and for whom this game was not made, so I've written this for their benefit. I put it into the 'not recommended' category, not to disparage it, but because I truly would not recommend the game to a person with my tastes. My abilities with programming and numbers in general are not of such a standard that I could write a 'recommended' review which would offer anything more than uselessly facile, vague praise, directed towards an audience I'm unfamiliar with. I instead put it into the category where I could offer honest opinions of my own.", "timestamp_created": 1475981388, "timestamp_updated": 1476192999, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 840, "votes_funny": 29, "weighted_vote_score": "0.756399", "comment_count": "54", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25938455": {"recommendationid": "25938455", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960545342", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 767, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475980032}, "language": "english", "review": "As an embedded engineer, this game triggered me so hard.  10/10 Would like to work for fun.", "timestamp_created": 1475980351, "timestamp_updated": 1475980351, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500694", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25938059": {"recommendationid": "25938059", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991055450", "num_games_owned": 783, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 938, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 23, "last_played": 1513661744}, "language": "english", "review": "It plays exactly how it looks, if you can't make up your mind I envy you", "timestamp_created": 1475978283, "timestamp_updated": 1475978283, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500919", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25938015": {"recommendationid": "25938015", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995170229", "num_games_owned": 217, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 713, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477813514}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a great game - some really great puzzles and a well thought out set of components.

If you can manage to squeeze your program down from the \u00a55 microcontroller to tiny variant that costs just \u00a53, you'll have incredibly constraints to work with, but you'll be at the top of the cost-leaderboard.\n\n- Energy Usage: Thankfully program-size itself is no longer scored (that's already paid for in the parts-cost), but instead the number of executed instructions during each \"turn\" is. This not only is more interesting from a real-world applications point of view (sleeping is essential for battery-life), but it means the game fundamentally provides synchronization-points between the processors in each puzzle, since they now *must* sleep at some point.\n\nOh, and Shenzhen also offers Zachtronic's best story-telling structure to date. It's both quick to read and stays relevent to the puzzles on hand, since each puzzle is embedded in a short email-chain that describes both the setup and consequences of each product being engineered. Another nice touch is that most of the puzzles come with context-appropriate output animations that help make it feel all the more like you're actually engineering a product.\n\nThis is a game I look forward to playing with friends, both cooperatively on the couch, and competitively through the leaderboards. :)", "timestamp_created": 1475938962, "timestamp_updated": 1475938962, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25926981": {"recommendationid": "25926981", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038420032", "num_games_owned": 280, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1687, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498926257}, "language": "french", "review": "Mise \u00e0 jour post sortie du jeu :\n\nMon \u00e9valuation pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente reste compl\u00e8tement valide, et le jeu ne s'est que am\u00e9lior\u00e9, augmentant la dur\u00e9e de la campagne, rebalan\u00e7ant les anciens puzzles en fonction de retours utilisateurs, et allant m\u00eame jusqu'\u00e0 d\u00e9sormais int\u00e9grer le Workshop.\n\nBref, si vous \u00e9tiez tent\u00e9 par ce jeu, rien \u00e0 voir avec une pseudo simulation de programmation : vous allez programmer des puzzles toujours plus vari\u00e9s, et il va falloir r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir.

L'interface est polie au possible, les niveaux s'int\u00e8grent d\u00e9sormais dans une histoire avec des personnages attachants, et les possibilit\u00e9es des puzzles sont nombreuses, ajoutant de nouveaux composants au fur et \u00e0 mesure pour toujours plus de complexit\u00e9.\n\nJe n'ai pas encore termin\u00e9 le jeu, mais je suis tr\u00e8s content de l'originalit\u00e9 des puzzles. Un coup on programme une machine \u00e0 sandwich, une autre fois un syst\u00e8me de vis\u00e9e automatis\u00e9e, et sans tomber dans la redite de TIS-100 (ce qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 possible vu la proximit\u00e9 des deux titres).\n\nLe manuel pour sa part est encore plus fourni qu'avant. Toujours aussi riche en divergeances farfelues, on y trouve une doc compl\u00e8te des \u00e9l\u00e9ments rencontr\u00e9s, mais aussi des annexes pour certains puzzle, ce qui ouvre encore plus de possibilit\u00e9s en jeu.\n\nBien entendu, ce titre n'est pas pour tout le monde. Sans un go\u00fbt pour la programmation, un penchant pour l'algorithmie, et un esprit analytique, vous allez avoir du mal. Le jeu vous guide un peu, mais les puzzles se compliquent assez pour rebuter toute personne n'ayant pas ce profil je pense. Apr\u00e8s tout, le coeur du gameplay est l'\u00e9criture de ligne de codes en pseudo assembleur.\n\nUne d\u00e9clinaison du solitaire bien ficel\u00e9e est propos\u00e9e en compl\u00e9ment, tr\u00e8s sympatique et bien pens\u00e9, pour se d\u00e9tendre un instant.\n\nPour les habitu\u00e9s des titres de Zachtronics, il n'y a pas de surprise.

This is an excellent addition to the collection, and I would recommend getting it immediately.\n\nIf you're new to the niche of games Zach and Co. have built, you should know that this isn't a \"puzzle game\" so much as it a \"problem solving\" game. As opposed to some puzzle games (portal, talos principal, etc.) which have more or less one \"expected\" solution laid out, in this game each challenge can be solved a multitude of ways. As such it is immensely replayable- you can always challenge yourself to improve the efficiency of your solutions. (Each puzzle is followed by a histogram showing how your solutions stack up to other players for added incentives.) Fair warning- these \"puzzles\" become very difficult. These games admittedly aren't for everyone, but if you're looking for a challenge I'd highly recommend trying it out.\n\nThe story of this game is probably my favorite so far of Zach's games. Set in the near future, you're an engineer who's moved to China seeking employment. The \"game\" is your computer you log on, and you recieve assignments and story updates through \"emails\". It comes with a 40 page \"manual\" which is is well designed and adds depth/flavor to the story, with printouts of emails, visa applications, a 90's web page, and more. The music in the game is also great and on point for working on these problems.\n\nRegarding early access- as someone who purchased TIS-100 and Infinifactory in early access, I can vouch for the devs statements. This isn't some buggy zombie survival pipedream.

The puzzles involve creating a program that runs across several microchips; you are given digital inputs, program requirements, an empty board, and several different types of microchips, and then are tasked with matching the outputs with their expected values.\n\nThe manual is basically a requirement; I got the limited edition, which comes with a physical copy of the manual in a fancy little binder. If you get the digital copy, it still comes with the manual, but I'd strongly recommend printing it out. It's very nice to just have it in front of me because I've had to refer to it / flip through it frequently. \n\nIf you like Puzzles, Hacking, Low-Level Programming, Hardware, Raspberry Pi's or Arduinos, Reading Manuals, Circuitry, and/or challenging games, definitely check it out.", "timestamp_created": 1475819858, "timestamp_updated": 1475819858, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510953", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25897447": {"recommendationid": "25897447", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987502071", "num_games_owned": 1533, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2809, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508824387}, "language": "english", "review": "In brief, it's good. If you enjoyed TIS-100 but felt it could use a bit of a face-lift, then you'll feel right at home. You get specifications in your inbox, and you generate designs, optimizing for different criteria as you see fit. As you would expect from a Zachtronics game, there's a histogram for each task showing where your solution sits vs the rest of the community.. plus a leaderboard showing where you sit vs your friends.\n\nSo yeah, you place the parts and write the microcode. You match the test output. There's a way to step through and debug. The game is about what you'd expect if you've already played TIS-100. Same as there, optimizing your microcode is a little different from real-life parts.. In this game, for example, one mul by 4 is cheaper power-wise than using two adds. So real life experience doesn't always transfer to your ability in the game. (It's still going to appeal more to people who like assembly code, though. You really can't get around the need to be able to program.)\n\nThis game requires a binder. You should have access to a printer to print out the pages to fill that binder (comes in a pdf).

Man darf jedoch nicht erschrecken, dieses Spiel nimmt einen nicht wirklich an die Hand der Schwierigkeitsgrad steigt schnell. Und sp\u00e4testens in der \"Bonus\"-Kampagne wird es dann richtig richtig schwer <.<\n\n\n[h1]Die Grundhandlung[/h1] ist schnell erz\u00e4hlt, als Elektrotechniker/Programmierer kommt ihr in die Hauptstadt der Chips und Bits \"Shenzhen\" und beginnt eure Arbeit bei der Firma Longteng. Hier werdet ihr \u00fcber E-Mails an eure Arbeit herangef\u00fchrt und nebenbei werden kleine Geschichtchen erz\u00e4hlt, mehr Handlung gibt es nicht und braucht man finde ich auch nicht. Die Ideen hinter den Dingen die man baut sind fast immer lustig und mit ein bisschen Ironie versehen.\n\n[h1]Das Spiel[/h1] ist technisch nahezu einwandfrei kleinere Bugs wurden direkt nach Release behoben. Grafisch ist es sehr h\u00fcbsch und \u00fcbersichtlich und zeigt mal wieder dass 3D f\u00fcr eine gute Umsetzung alles andere als n\u00f6tig ist. Der Sound und Soundtrack ist minimalistisch aber passend gehalten. Einen starken Rechner braucht es nicht, bei mir l\u00e4uft es mit iGPU und i5 (2. Gen) CPU einwandfrei (wobei ein Kern fast komplett ausgelastet wird).\n\n[h1]Das Manual[/h1] kommt Stilecht daher und gibt einem praktisch alles was man braucht, die unterschiedlichen Formatierungen der \"aus unterschiedlichen Quellen\" stammenden Datasheets ist sehr gut getroffen und hilft einem beim eintauchen in das Spiel. Ich kann denen die einen Laserdrucker zur Hand haben empfehlen es tats\u00e4chlich auszudrucken (evtl. halbe Gr\u00f6\u00dfe) da es an der ein oder anderen Stelle hilfreich ist Spiel und Manual gleichzeitig vor Augen zu haben.\n\n[h1]Die Schwierigkeit[/h1] ist denke ich am oberen Ende dessen wo aus Spa\u00df Arbeit wird, das muss man nat\u00fcrlich m\u00f6gen. Ich pers\u00f6nlich fand aber zum Beispiel [i]\"SpaceChem\"[/i] schwerer, wobei ich mit Programmier-Vorkenntnissen an Shenzhen gehen konnte. Dabei besteht die Herausforderung nicht in komplexen Algorithmen sondern eher im st\u00e4ndigen Platzmangel der Chips. In 9 bzw 14 Zeilen passt eben nicht sehr viel Code, und dass man nur 1 bzw 2 Register (Variablen) zur Verf\u00fcgung hat machts nicht einfacher. Umso besser nat\u00fcrlich das Gef\u00fchl wenn man es schafft die Funktion zweier Chips in einen zu optimieren :)\n\n[h1]Die Spielzeit[/h1] betrug f\u00fcr mich knapp 30 Stunden, wobei ich sicher 10-15h mit nachtr\u00e4glicher Optimierung verbracht habe.\n[i]Patch 1.3: Die Spielzeit hat sich mit der Zusatzkampagne gut verdreifacht, vor allem die letzten Aufgaben waren sehr fordernd. Gesamtspielzeit betrug f\u00fcr mich damit 80h+.[/i]\n\n[strike][h1]Mangelhaft[/h1] sind derzeit noch die Test-Cases die \u00fcberpr\u00fcfen ob eine L\u00f6sung auch in allen Lebenslagen funktioniert. Anfangs wurden hier drei immer gleiche und ein zuf\u00e4lliger Test genutzt was manchmal die M\u00f6glichkeit zu einer Fest programmierten L\u00f6sung gab, welche nat\u00fcrlich viel besser in den Rankings abschnitt. Hier wurde auch schon nachjustiert (inzwischen sind es 8 Tests) aber es besteht meiner Meinung nach immer noch Handlungsbedarf. Hier w\u00fcrde ich gerne eine \u00dcberpr\u00fcfung wie in [i]\"Human Resources Machine\"[/i] sehen, wo im Hintergrund einfach alles getestet wird und einem dann bei Bedarf der fehlschlagende Test vorgespielt wird.[/strike]\n[i]Patch 1.2: Mit inzwischen 80 Testcases die in wenigen Sekunden durchlaufen hab ich nichts mehr auszusetzen :)[/i]\n\n[h1]Geplant[/h1] ist wohl noch [strike]ein Editor der einen selbst R\u00e4tsel erstellen l\u00e4sst[/strike] und [strike]eventuell ein paar Bonus Levels.[/strike]\n[i]Patch 1.3: Es gab nicht nur ein paar Bonus Level sondern eine komplette Bonus Kampagne (inspiriert von Spielervorschl\u00e4gen) die \u00e4hnlich umfangreich ist wie die Hauptkampagne, daf\u00fcr aber deutlichst schwerer *g*[/i]\n[i]Patch conceptSPEC: Man kann jetzt auch seine eigenen Puzzles erstellen und \u00fcber den Steam Workshop teilen![/i]\n\n\n[b]Alles in allem also eine klare Empfehlung von mir, mit der Warnung, dass es \u00fcber die Schwierigkeit durchschnittlicher Denkspiele deutlich hinaus geht.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1475795879, "timestamp_updated": 1509825164, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 38, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.816664", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25892981": {"recommendationid": "25892981", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010054687", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 685, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476420353}, "language": "english", "review": "TIS-100 is the tutorial for Shenzhen I/O.\nIf you liked the first, you'll really love the latter.\n\nYou don't know TIS-100?

Really difficult.  It's like attempting to learn a new programming language without having complete documentation.  At least, that was my impression for the first 4 hours.  Turns out you do have complete documentation and the language really isn't too difficult once you get past the steep learning curve.  The programming language didn't appear all that intuitive at first, but you should quickly get the hang of it.  However, mere familiarity with the language will not make this game easy.  Your programs need to be very short (9 or 14 lines depending on your chosen processor), so you best be succinct and efficient.  After you begin to learn the language, the game does seem to get a bit easier, but then they go and throw new parts at you to ensure you never get complacent.\n\nI can clearly tell that an extraordinary amount of effort was put into this game to make it an actual immersive game rather than a programming chore.  The GUI legitimately feels like you're logging into the Shenzhen company's computer system.  The email discussions that tell the story pop up as if they are honestly being sent to you as you progress through the design challenges.  The CAD program feels like it could be a legitimate program.  Honestly, the amount of effort Zachtronics put into making this game an immersive experience is amazing and they should be commended for that effort.\n\nThis game is clearly made for people who love programming, want a severe challenge, are highly logical, are capable of teaching themselves a new language, and are willing to accept frustration beginning from the earliest sections of the game.  If that sounds like you, then absolutely buy this game.

If you do, the number will simply disappear, and you'll be asking yourself \"Uh... what just happened? Where did my output go?\"\n\n2 - Once you use an XBus input in a Chip (even if it's in a Test operation) it's [b]gone[/b]. So, if you want to use it more than once, save it in a register. Otherwise you'll be asking yourself \"Where's that friggin' number? WTH is going on?!\"\n\n3 - If multiple Chips' Simple Outputs lead to the same Board Output (where the final packets go) this one will only compute the [b]higher[/b] input, and ignore the lower one(s). So (not to spoil anything) you gotta find an alternative solution. Otherwise you'll be yelling, by yourself: \"OMG! Again?! This [i]must[/i] work!! It's f***ing perfect!!! WTF is happening!?! F**k this s**t!...\n\n...and that's how you end putting a negative review up.\n\n(4? - BTW, be careful when running Test (IF) operations. It can become confusing the way Shenzhen deals with it. Avoiding missing I/O's [b][items 1 and 2][/b] will probably spare you a lot of trouble.)\n\nEdit: 5 - Later on, the game tells you, through an in-game e-mail, that there are 2 hidden commands the manual doesn't show you. These may be helpful in 1 or 2 earlier stages, while, on the other hand and like I said, the game [i]does[/i] tell you this eventually (but you might miss it if you don't read everything) so it's up to you whether you want to know about them now or not: [spoiler] Adding an \"@\" before a line executes it only once[/spoiler] and...\n\nEdit: 6 - The other hidden command: \n\n[spoiler] \"Gen P X Y\" which means:\n\nMov 100 to P\nSleep X\nMov 0 to P\nSleep Y[/spoiler]\n\nEdit: 7 - The worst of all. In level [b]Carbine Target Illuminator[/b], the manual page you must use to solve it feeds you wrong data. It states the [b]Radar Range[/b] for triggering outputs are: 1-2, 3-4 and 5-6. In truth, they are [b]1, 2-3 and 4-6[/b].\n\n\nHopefully I got all that right... but anyway, to put simply: \n\nShenzhen I/O is not bad. On one hand, the coding is simpler than TIS-100's; on the other, managing the Chips on the board is often a pain in the S, and how some stuff works is unclear (like the ones I mentioned above). The game is very challenging -- which is good -- but when your tools don't work as you expect them to, it becomes a nightmare.

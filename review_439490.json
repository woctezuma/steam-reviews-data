I don't think anyone is going to need me to tell them about what genre this game is at this point or about any of the more superficial gameplay details - not that I'd be capable of writing a succinct, worthwhile summary of them anyway. \n\nWhat I can talk about, however, is my perspective on the game as someone who has barely any experience with bullet hell shmups and had always been intimidated by their difficulty.\nBLUE REVOLVER manages to teach its players a basic understanding of how to play games of this type in a pretty elegant way. It might seem somewhat gimmicky at first, but if you actually give the mission mode the time of day you will quickly find yourself adjusting to the overall speed and flow of not only this game in specific, but bullet hell shmups in general. \nThe survival missions give you incentive to practice the individual levels as such, the break ones teach you the bosses and the break mechanic, the invisible bullet ones show you that you shouldn't be focusing solely on your ship during gameplay, the revenge ones train your reaction times and maneuvering skills and so on and so forth.\n\nMy point is: Not only is the game fun and rewarding, it also improves your skills really quickly, allowing you to enjoy more examples of this underrated genre of gaming.

If you're interested in the bullet hell subgenre, this may or may not be a good introduction.

First-time players are forced to play with no continues, with infinite continues as an unlock; high scores are obtained through an unpunishing but still obscure system; the game's art style is wonderfully executed but probably not for everyone. \n\nIs it a good bullet hell shmup? Yeah, it's pretty good; the visuals are clear, the controls are responsive enough, the patterns and enemies are challenging and inventive, the learning curve is OK, and the scoring is, while not super-deep, pretty engaging.

The scoring system is kinda easy to understand but hard to really master since you have to max out your multiplier and be sure that you have enough ammo to explode a large ships pack. So yeah, you can practice with it at any time, but there will be key moments when scoring will be at hands.\n\nNormal mode starts easy but Stage 5 is a pain in the butt. Also, Normal mode has auto-bomb when you die, but it consumes every bomb you have on this life. So you'll prefer going manual and push dat bomb button when you feel like you'll waste a life.\n\nHyper mode is really interesting because the game becomes harder each time you pass a level. And Parallel mode is extreme mode, you'll start with a full difficulty setting.\n\nMissions are really cool and they help you understanding gameplay mechanics like Breaks, Flourish etc. Plus, it gives you stars to spend in the shop as a reward.\n\nThe OST is totally awesome, and the remixes too. You can switch to whatever version of music you want per stage (if you like original, remixes etc).\n\nArt direction is pixel art but it's done right. There's enough detail to recognize a level, and not too complex in order for you to actually read what's happening on the screen.\n\nSeriously, this is one of my favourite Bullet Hell.

It's set up like most arcade games (so once you lose all of your lives it's game over), but it's pulled off so well that it's hard not to get into that \"just one more try\" mindset. Compared to most other shmups there's a ton of content, so if you get tired of one mode you can try another mode or weapon to mix things up. It has 3 difficulty modes which provide a good level of challenge for both new and experienced players. There 8 \"special weapons\" to use which range from traditional weapons like lasers and cruise missiles to some more unique ones like force fields and a short range homing attack. The weapons all play differently, so you'll have to vary your routes depending on the weapon you pick.\n\nOne of my favorite features is the mission mode. This mode has short 1-2 minute challenges that help you learn the various stages and bosses. It's a good distraction from the main game, and once you can beat all the challenges then you'll be well on your way to beating the main game.

Although I doubt these in-game graphics would've been up to the standard of the major arcade game companies of the day. The game uses an unusual abstract style where many of the enemies appear to be rather box like, although some resemble things like aircraft or tanks. Although I suppose there's nothing really wrong with them it's kinda hard to get exited about killing a box.\n\nAside from that, the manga style cutscene and background graphics are excellent. And there's a few backgrounds, music remixes and player skins to be unlocked, as well as \"Free Play\" mode, which allows you to continue after losing all your lives.  This last one is the only one that affects gameplay in any way, and the only one I felt particularly exited about unlocking.\n\nVariable difficulty adjusts itself to the players performance, with three basic modes to keep the difficulty within a certain range. Although I find I tend to get about as far through on the medium setting as I do on the lower setting, only my score is much higher.\n\nNo weapon upgrades, although there is a choice of weapons at the start, suiting a variety of play styles. And three kinds of in game weaponry. There is a primary weapon, with unlimited power, which can be fired in rapid or concentrated mode.

Nethertheless, there is a \"normal\" mode which allows \"normal\" gamers to have a chance to clear the game without frying their brain, eyes and hands (see the \"normal\" run videos on the community hub).\nThe graphic/sound design is amazing as it offsets from what we are used to see. The music is crazy good and the gameplay seems... perfectly balanced.\n\nIf you want to go \"beyond\" normal mode, keep in mind it's a \"fail and retry\" type of game. You will need hours of training and repeating to find the right route to 1cc (One Credit Clear), which will not be the same route than a good \"score attack\" route.

Challenging for both beginner and psychos alike. The powerful soundtrack and mesmerising artwork give this game a polish and sheen usually reserved for larger budget projects, and with a novel, deep scoring system there is plenty of scope for replayability.\n\nAs someone who never really played many shmups, the genre can be a daunting experiance. Blue Revolver looked daunting at first, but once you play a few minutes (and die a few times!) and you start to get a feel for the game, it grabs you. \n\nI started playing this game with high expectations, and they were exceeded with every play. Whilst at times infurating and punishing, I never felt the game was being unfair. Every time I died, I realised my faults, picked myself up and tried again. \n\nLearning the game, and learning from the game, is an organic experiance with Blue Revolver. You complete that first stage and you feel confident. Then you hit stage 2 and you are humbled. You say to yourself \"Ok, its time to think more about positioning myself correctly so that doesn't happen again\" and you start to pay attention to patterns and enemy types a lot more. You hold onto that special weapon for big guys, but soon you get confident enough to say \"I can kill that sucker! I want more x64s not x2s!\". With every new stage comes a deeper challenge, and the game yearns for you to polish your craft before you can truely take on the next level.

This game is great for beginner's, as I had played, touhou, etc., but it is a great starter for people to play or be introuduced into these type of genres. This also helps and gives also a great amount of fun for veterans and experts at these games, and WILL certainly enjoy the asthetics of this game. Gameplay is very fluid, even though I am one off of the processing power, replay value is very high on this game, and the help and tips of different modes help any player get addicted. Even when i unlocked free play mode, exactly what it sounds like, I took it off because i wanted to become better at the game. It wasn't because of a few hours to get mehyped, but because it gives you the mindset to get better and enhance your skills in the game. The gallery art is beautiful and the unlocks are really cool. The missions are also great, as they give challenges to improve, survivability, scoring, etc. and also stage select as it helps to practice a certain level that you are stuck on. Though some things that are not well is the lack of content, even if it is an arcade like game. I kind of wish there was more things to play at, like new levels and such, but don't get me wrong. This game makes me play almost a lot of hours into it.

The combo system is pretty cool with the combo count increasing as you kill enemies but being capped unless you use your secondary weapon to increase the multiplier. It\u2019s a good system and one of my faves in modern shmups. \n\nDifficulty is good and I am a particular fan of the hyper mode where the game difficulty changes to suit your ability a mechanic that seems to be cropping up more and more recently in games and is in my opinion a welcome addition. Another welcome addition is the ability to play any stage at any difficulty to practice particular sections, something I am surprised has not been in Shmups much over the years.\n\nMy personal favourite part however is the challenges that give you a specific task and set of conditions ranging from, disappearing bullets to complete the levels in 1 life. These are a fun diversion and really add to the longevity of the game.\nBlue Revolver is probably the shmup I would recommend along with my personal fave Deathsmiles as a good entry point for people looking into getting into the Bullet Hell Genre.\n\nThis review came from our Shmup special which can be found here: [url=http://www.thegametutor.co.uk/videos/game-tutor-examines/161022_game-tutors-shmups-special] Shmup Special[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1477179960, "timestamp_updated": 1477179960, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562647", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26148374": {"recommendationid": "26148374", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085534718", "num_games_owned": 324, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 274, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492997146}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a pretty great bullet hell shooter, with some options that make it more friendly for n00bs like myself.

I cannot quite be enough ATTITUDE for sufficient GAINS, I get the concept of SHOOT THE CORE but can't quite capitalise on it. I find NO REFUGE when I need it most. Every time I play one it's like I'm being attacked by the FULLEST EXTENT OF THE JAM.\n\nShmup memes aside, this is an unrelentingly challenging shmup game. It has a Novice mode (and the fact I can't get further than the boss of level 3 even on that mode should tell you how bad I am at these games), called \"Normal\" difficulty, where the first hit you take activates a bomb instead to give you a brief period of invulnerability. Hyper mode is the game's ACTUAL Normal difficulty and plays like a standard Shmup, though by all accounts the difficulty is dynamic, and the better you do, the harder the difficulty gets. On the other hand, Parallel mode locks the game's difficulty to the max level, to give the biggest challenge. Personally, I feel both Hyper and Normal modes are challenging enough as it is.\n\nYou also get two choices of character and ship; Mae in her Mapleberry, and Val in her Urashima or ... I forget what it's called ,but something like that. They have slightly different behaviours and weapons it seems, and definately different appearances, but functionally the game plays out the same... THough the story seems quite different depending upon which character you choose.\n\nSpeaking of story, holy hell, what a cool concept! Magic that is controlled like programming code, but can build up junk data which causes anomalies in reality? Teams of \"Technicians\" that deal with Junk Data and make sure 'code' is clean and efficient to minimise appearance of junk data? Devices which help them do that? a supergroup of Technicians called Blue Revolver with mysteriously super powerful Devices? and a strange, super anomaly they investigate with readings eerily similar to their Devices?? All of my yes.\n\nCouple this with an astounding, pulse pounding soundtrack, cute character designs, beautiful graphics and a Missions system which actually is meant to be a tutorial of sorts to teach you how to play STGs (good lord I can't believe I only just found that out myself), and you pretty much have yourself a winner!\n\nIt seems to lack a multiplayer mode from what I've seen, which is slightly saddening, and if you die, you gotta restart at the beginning until you amass the 4500 star points to unlock free play mode, but considering in the short time I've played it I've amassed like 2200? I'm not far off already... There's other unlocks too, like remixes of tracks, background arts, concept arts and whatnots, so that's great too :D\n\nThis game is packed solid with features and wonderfulness, and it was absolutely worth all the wait and the pricetag.

"english", "review": "BLUE REVOLVER is an excellent STG game, and easily equals (and probably supasses imho) many of the Japanese classics that inspired it. The scoring system revolves around building short chains (thankfully limited to 8 enemies) and using a special weapon to activate a multiplier. This makes scoring a bit less strict than older chain scoring STGs like DoDonPachi, and more free form. Cashing out your chain with your special weapon also makes enemy ships explode into giant pieces of gold. This is intrinsically good \"gamefeel,\" and probably why Mars Matrix and Espgaluda 2 are classics. The other main scoring mechanic is colecting BREAK bonuses by meeting special conditions during stages (killing 90% of enemies in one section), destroying parts  of boss ships, etc. Scoring higher causes the game to increase in rank aka difficulty, by adding denser bullets and adjustments to boss patterns, and dying drops your rank. A bar at the top of the screen shows what rank you're in (green is easiest and red is the hardest). The graphics are excellent and when I die I feel like it was due to my own mistakes rather than visual clutter.\n\nThere are three difficulty modes: \"Normal\" where ranked is locked to the green section and gives you an autobomb, which is effectively severaly extra lives (good for shmup n00bs), \"Hyper\" where rank affects your credit the most, and \"Parallel\" where rank is locked at maximum at all times and theres also a special last boss if you're strong enough to get there. I'm not yet ;-( There's also 24 short training missions which teach  STG basics and scoring mechanics (plus some that are extra challenges like bullets that disappear), and there's a robust stage select system that lets you set the rank and starting point per stage.There's even a hitbox viewer that shows everyhit box, not just the player's but the hit box for every enemy and shot. Very cool option and idk why other STGs don't have it....\n\nThe controls are responsive, my DS4 works without a 3rd party program (and i'm assuming my PS4 stick will work as well but it weighs 15 lbs and i don't want to drag it over to my computer I haven't tried yet). The UI is thankfully designed with a computer in mind, so no doujin game quirks like keys you can't rebind or limited graphics options like you might get in a console port... \n\nWhat else? The graphics look very nice, and I like the color palette! There's unlockables like backgrounds and remixed music! Two different ships with differnt special weapons offer offensive firepower or defensive options like absorbing/slowing down bullets! Great music, my favorite is the stage 4 track which sounds like a goofy middle eastern disco party! And  the all important waifu component! (Val btw) \n\nBLUE REVOLVER is really good and a lot of fun, Stellar Circle put a lot of love into the game and it shows. You could even say its a \"stellar\" game ;-) ;-) ;-) ;-) My one complaint is that the announcers don't shout BOMBA every time you press the bomb button ;-( If you have any interest in STGs at all please buy this game!!!!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1476660461, "timestamp_updated": 1476660461, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.663389", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26072872": {"recommendationid": "26072872", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964867238", "num_games_owned": 211, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 245, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505677256}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like shmups, buy this game.

The scoring system is more approachable and more fun than the punishing chain systems of yesteryear.

But just like in the CAVE classics, regardless of the difficulty setting there's always a way out of every possible combination of bullets flung at you, and any configuration of attacks can be safely passed by with precise enough timing, your craft's hitbox is tiny and bullets have slightly softened edges to give you a little extra leeway, and if that somehow sounds forgiving, try pushing the rank system or outright play on 'Parallel mode'.\n\nSurvival has the game pushing back on you with its 'rank' variable that gradually raises the ferocity of enemy patterns in response to your continued success, increases it faster for elaborate scoring or lowers it with deaths. On top of making the challenge more dynamic, it provides the backbone for the three difficulty modes set apart mainly by locking it within a boundary and a couple more minor details(like the extend numbers and autobombing), which assures a smooth transition from one to the next.\nBut since unlike a number of games that inspired it with their focus on perfect execution, BR wants you to organically play around with all the kinds of available resources be it ammo, bombs or even the relatively plentiful lives, the impact of rank on your play never feels like an act of spite as much as a constant reminder to utilize everything at your fingertips.\nYet unlike some of the older games with rank systems like Ibara or Garegga which could start to feel almost malicious in nature if you kept doing well without actively trying to push your rank down, BR's was designed to be survivable the whole way through even when it's turned all the way up, which is also essentially what Parallel mode happens to be.\n\nScoring play is incredibly easy to pick up and blends with survival very well, moreso than any of the typical beginner recommendations for the genre - blow up a small chain of enemies with your primary shot and get rewarded with much bigger points through a briefly lasting point multiplier as you annihilate the reinforcements with your special weapon or even a bomb(which is frequently advantageous to do), the sound cue makes it easy to know when you can let loose, though doing that mindlessly will make you lose track of all the alternate, more efficient ways to score through keeping enemies alive to have a full chain ready for a later big enemy, extending the duration of your multiplier through bombs or just doing 'breaks' - BR's term for small challenges you get in the middle of play that involve a variety of tricks including dismantling enemy parts, not causing damage to others or ending a boss' pattern with a specific timing. Highlighted by both green sparks that pop up on break-related objects and 'shoot this/avoid hitting this' indicators, most are somewhat apparent while some will take a bit more attention to notice and a lot more to actually execute correctly.\n\nCombine that with the aforementioned approach to resources and you have a game that'll make you change up your play run after run, the penalties for small scoring mistakes never feel overwhelming and change your pattern of special weapon use for a period every time - alternating your 'breather spots', the breaks can be learned gradually, your bombs can be used liberally for a multitude of valid reasons and you have an elegant design that's simultaneously great for beginners just trying to get a grasp on the genre and more experienced players improvising their way through.\nAnd if all that somehow doesn't sound like enough to provide a varied run-to-run experience, you have your pick of two pilots that influence the ship's weapons in a way, three classic primary shot types and eight different special weapons, some pilot-specific, some slightly different depending on the pilot chosen, each filling its own role and bringing its own set of (dis)advantages to be considered.\n\nIn addition, the game features a challenge mode that has content that'll similarly both please experienced players with a bit of extra variety and help beginners push their limits and learn skills that'll matter on an actual full run, including using the entire screen for your dodges as you get chased by a very unhappy bullet that can only be slowed down and never, ever stops, keeping enemies alive as you wait for your sole means of attack - a one-shot shrapnel charge - to come back after every blast, learn to move in a way that lets you ignore projectiles already past your trajectory as you grapple with bullets that vanish from sight on approach or just do the standard survival and scoring challenges arranged so that they still provide a better structured practice experience than pretty much anything else typical to the genre.\n\nIf you are even slightly interested in shmups, or just arcadey games in general or even happen to be on the fence about trying your luck at a bullet hell shooter, you should definitely be picking this one up!\n\nDisclaimer: I've done some of the beta testing and translation for the title.", "timestamp_created": 1476620182, "timestamp_updated": 1476635121, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487342", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26056955": {"recommendationid": "26056955", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068659415", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 83, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507340098}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a good game!

The flow of building up a short chain on weak enemies, then cashing it in on a group of more powerful foes and watching them explode in cascades of gold is so satisfying that I find myself taking big risks, even though as a player I'm only focused on survival. There's  also  a ton of variety in shot and special weapon types, so if the default isn't your style you have a lot of experimenting to do.\n\nFor players who aren't confident pitting themselves against an unbroken run, the game offers a Mission mode, with short, punchy challenges that start off simple and ramp up, each one building on the last. Some of the more creative ones are Invisible Bullet, where bullets disappear when they approach you, and Matador, where one large bullet relentlessly hunts you throughout the level. Far from being gimmicks, these missions teach newbies good shmup habits, like looking ahead to bullets and planning proactively rather than focusing solely on your ship, and moving around the screen rather than hugging the bottom edge. \n\nAesthetically the game is a joy, with a lot of love clearly being put into both the protagonist and the enemies, a rarity in STGs. The character designs and VAs are adorable, and will enamour the waifuhunters in the crowd. The enemy ship designs are somewhat boxy, but this choice seems to be deliberate, as it favours clarity in gameplay, for instance when deciding what part of a boss to target first.\n\nThe music is excellent, hard pumping electronic music that isn't too harsh or overbearing, but sets a tempo for the player to blast through the level with.\n\nOverall, I think Blue Revolver is a game that can hold its own against the big boys of the genre, and is certainly the best Western-developed STG I've ever encountered.", "timestamp_created": 1476528697, "timestamp_updated": 1476528697, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26038719": {"recommendationid": "26038719", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061990583", "num_games_owned": 156, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1400, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1514165520}, "language": "english", "review": "Game made me addicted, 10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1476488665, "timestamp_updated": 1480017090, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26036989": {"recommendationid": "26036989", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000082157", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1667, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 21, "last_played": 1513699982}, "language": "english", "review": "From both an art direction and gameplay standpoint, the design in Blue Revolver is super slick.

There are also some neat challenge ideas like matador - a big bullet that follows the player around the screen and experimental weapon - restricting the player to a slow charging special weapon only while taking away bombs.\n\nOne mild piece of criticism would be the game doesn't do the best job of communicating what the breaks are for each boss/level but most can be discovered through persistent play or a keen eye. This was mainly a problem for me when trying to figure out how to beat some of the missions.\n\ni strongly recommend this game to both those familiar with shmups looking for a new, highly polished, well-constructed challenge and anybody looking to take first step into the genre.", "timestamp_created": 1476451788, "timestamp_updated": 1476452106, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535305", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26027754": {"recommendationid": "26027754", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085099432", "num_games_owned": 133, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498797034}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u3088\u304f\u3067\u304d\u305fSTG\u3060\u3068\u601d\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\n\u6012\u9996\u9818\u8702\u3068\u30b1\u30c4\u30a4\u3068\u30a8\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30c9\u306b\u8fd1\u3044\u611f\u3058\u304c\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\n\n\u8272\u3005\u306a\u4f5c\u54c1\u306e\u30aa\u30de\u30fc\u30b8\u30e5\u304c\u898b\u3089\u308c\u3066\u3001\n\u4f5c\u3063\u305f\u4eba\u305f\u3061\u306fSTG\u304c\u597d\u304d\u306a\u3093\u3060\u306a\u3041\u3068\u611f\u3058\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\n\n\u7279\u306bCAVE\u306e\u4f5c\u54c1\u304c\u597d\u304d\u306a\u65b9\u306a\u3089\u8272\u3005\u3068\u697d\u3057\u3081\u308b\u3093\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044\u304b\u306a\u3041\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1476446598, "timestamp_updated": 1476446598, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511775", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26026355": {"recommendationid": "26026355", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968483932", "num_games_owned": 235, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 110, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476312037}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic.

It's one of the few that's actually worth buying and playing on the platform. For reference, the other games I include are Mushihimesama and Crimzon Clover.\n\nThis game also embraces the computer moreso than the minimum usually offered by its Japanese doujin counterparts. There's options for hitboxes and debug info and a colorblind mode. The resolution can be changed and there's a borderless window mode. Keybindings can be changed too. In the couple of hours I have spent so far with this game, I have had a positive experience that was the oppposite of the janky Mushihimesama port.\n\nThe training mode options (named Stage Select in this game) are also a pheltora of delightful variables on par with the very best shmup ports. The game's rank system (difficulty increase or decrease depending on your gameplay) can be adjusted to various levels and even be frozen. The most helpful function, being able to start at any midboss or boss in the game, is thankfully available.\n\nBlue Revolver, while being a lovingly well-crafted in its game design, can also be brutally unforgiving to new players. A great addition, not only to this game but the shmup genre as a whole, is the Missions mode that sets goals for the player to meet in its scenarios that not only provides a challenge, but also teaches good fundamentals. The mode provides a great alternative to practice other than the norm of playing the main campaign or Stage Select modes over and over.\n\nBesides the game modes, there's the main game itself. Upon starting the game, there are two pilots, Mae and Val, to choose from, each with their own shot styles and secondary weapons. Next, there are the three difficulty options that greet the player: a Normal mode that keeps the difficulty down for novice players, a Hyper mode that is the standard game with the difficulty adjusting rank, and a Parallel mode that freezes the rank at its most hardest. After that, there are the three shot styles to select, which themselves are minorly adjusted by which pilot is chosen: narrow, wide, and follow (options that are adjusted by player movement). Finally, there's the secondary weapon choice which, depending on the pilot, can be missiles, an arc blaster, the DoDonpachi laser, something like the Dangun Feveron charge shot, a Mars Matrix-like reflect shot, and cluster missiles.\n\nAfter all that, the game starts off with an homage to the first stage of DoDonPachi. There are many elements of the familiar, but they transcend beyond just a mere tribute into a tightly designed game that can stand among the greats of the shmup genre. The game system is a pastiche of great shmups. The scoring system is about increasing the combo counter to its maximum of 8 by defeating enemies in quick succession, which then unlocks the highest score multiplier to be doled out by then defeating enemies with the secondary weapon. The combo timeout clocks down to 0 and the cycle begins anew. Using the secondary weapon before the combo counter reaches 8 then locks the number, kinda like not getting close enough in Ketsui, and can only be reset by letting the combo timeout. Unlike their source inspiration from DoDonpachi, combos aren't an unforgiving game-long affair to maintain, incentivising the player to be free-form in their scoring rather than being locked into a superplay perfect route throughout the stages. Bombing and death aren't bad either because the former gives more ammo for the secondary weapons and death lowers the rank and adds to the bomb meter.\n\nInspiration from Raizing games can also be seen. The screen being covered in satisfying x64 texts is something like hitting the maximum score multiplier in Battle Bakraid. Since the combo timeout will always expire, there isn't the sense of keeping the multiplier going for as long as possible like is often seen in Raizing games. The result is a scoring system that is easy to get into for novices and aren't outright restarts on screwups for pros. It is more about being aware of scoring opportunities and doing your best to exploit them. There are also Breaks and their scoring bonuses that are given out to players that defeat certain enemies in a particular difficult manner kinda like milking bosses or hidden \"objectives\" in Battle Garegga. This all culminates into Blue Revolver being simply one of the best scoring systems in all of shmups. I don't think it'll knock off Espgaluda 2's position for the best in my book, but it is very high up there next to it.\n\nNow that I mention Espgaluda 2, there is something akin to its tandem between survival and scoring. Blue Revolver has secondary weapons that offer greater survivability than scoring opportunities like the Dangun Feveron-like charge shot that absorbs enemy bullets or the Mars Matrix-like reflect shot that shoots enemy bullets back. These probably can lead to easier clears, but aren't that great for scoring. However, there is also a benefit to scoring other than a highscore: extends. While scoring can increase rank more, extends provide a light at the end of the bullet hell tunnel. Blue Revolver offers 4 extends that give an extra life, which can be used to replenish lives lost to keep the rank low. The extra lives gained from scoring can help carry the player forward in a way that solely focusing on survival can't. This is something like Battle Garegga where you continually score and suicide, but this style of play isn't mandated to actually clear the game and is just an alternative route through. It is possible to beat the game on the hardest rank as there is a difficulty mode that is just that.\n\nThe bullet patterns aren't just for show in this game. They are deliberately designed to stress you, the player, out in different ways. You will continually be kept on your toes, making for an intense, frantic game. Enemies will get into your face to pelt you with a swarm of bullets. Linear shots will be sent straight down the screen. Aimed shots will fly at you. A shotgun pattern of bullets will march towards you in formation. There's barely a safe spot and you will resort to all sorts of tactics to dodge the enemy bullets and stay alive, flying all over the screen. And the bullets just keep coming with barely a breath of rest.\n\nSome of the enemies in this game are somewhat tanky, but that's to incentivise the use of your secondary weapon. You will be driven to proactively attack them and take them out before they become a threat if you aren't confident in your dodging abilities. However, this can take away from your scoring potential as for example, some enemies' Breaks occur when they are kept alive for a certain period of time. This is another clever use of how secondary weapons can be used either for survival or scoring. The bullet patterns of the game's bosses are also tough, but they can be taken down quickly with the secondary weapons kinda like using the Hadou Cannon in Ibara, sacrificing scoring opportunities for survival.\n\nAside from all the same situations and multiple approaches available in the game design, there are numerous unlockables present. Continues are disabled from the start in order to encourage the proper mindset of trying to complete the game in one credit, but they can be unlocked after accuring a significant amount of the in-game currency. There are also numerous wallpapers and alternative color palettes for the player and remixed soundtracks available.\n\nAll in all, this is a damn good game. It's tightly designed in a very intelligent way and gives a great variety of fun and challenge. Probably the only real flaw that can be found in this game is that it's brutal for beginners. Nonetheless, I think that any beginner willing to learn this game will find great tools to get them up and running as opposed to any other difficult shmups in the genre. I'm sure the pros already find this game a joy to play around with and master.", "timestamp_created": 1476288503, "timestamp_updated": 1476289292, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 75, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.836807", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25999112": {"recommendationid": "25999112", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972309272", "num_games_owned": 232, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 251, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495367451}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is an absolute gem. You can really see the love that went into making it, in the art, the music, and especially the incredibly tight mechanics. The score system is really intuitive and fun (rack up an eight kill streak, then fire your special weapon for a 'flourish' and watch points roll in), the movement is fluid and the bullet patterns are challenging but fair. When I die, and I've died a lot, it's never frustrating because it's always clear to me what i did wrong and how I messed up. The exuberance of the VA yelling \"game over!\" also helps. Shes just so psyched to see me dead that I can't be mad.\n\nthe variety of weapons and setups is really cool, i've spent a good amount of time fooling around with different arrangements and characters. There are two characters, each of whom has similar (but not identical) main attacks, but a range of powerful special moves that are mostly unique to them. Some special moves are defensive, some spray missiles across the screen, while others are just a single powerful missile that fires straight ahead or a mega-laser that wipes out everything in your way. You get to pick a single special gun for each run and it really changes up how I play.\n\nI'm disastrously bad at the game, but it's got an easy mode (normal) that I'm struggling though and every run is a blast. I've also played a fair amount of Hyper mode, where i am ashamed to say I can't even beat the second boss. Hyper mode is the default difficulty, and is a very clever difficulty level that adapts to how well you are doing: die a bunch and it's indistinguishable from normal mode, but rack up a bunch of great combos and flourishes, and the next thing you know you're in full on hard mode. speaking of which, the hard mode (called parallel) starts you at the max-combo difficulty right off the bat, and I'm sure it's more than enough to satisfy actual shmup players.\n\nI really like this game and i hope to someday not suck at it.

Disclaimer, I'm pals with most of the dudes who worked on it and helped test it, but my praise goes way beyond that. It's a bullet hell shoot 'em up that was very clearly designed by someone who spent a lot of time thinking about what makes those fun. It's got a very simple, very elegant scoring system based around building up a small chain of kills, then using your special weapon to cash that in on other enemies for big multipliers. The selection of special weapons is varied (even the two lasers shared between ships have different properties) and they each have their own little quirks that make them stand apart from each other. The art is nice looking but more importantly, it's crisp and clear. I can't really think of a time where I died to a bullet I didn't see, the game is very easy to read at a glance. There's a dynamic difficulty system that isn't overbearing, it feels like it's there to give you a breather when things get tough rather than stomp you into the dirt because you're doing too good. The hidden breaks you can do in each stage are fun to figure out and execute. And there's just a ton of smart little touches, like bombs turning enemy bullets into special weapon ammo and making you invulnerable for a really long time, which makes them a viable proactive offensive option in addition to the usual panic button.

Introduction[/b]\nGameplay is simple but satisfying and gives room from playing survival or scoring. Difficulty has 3 different modes : easy, rank dependant and maxed rank. I'm far from being a good shmup player but I think it has enough options to be satisfying for the complete newcommer to the genre as much as for the veteran player.\n\n[b]2. Character, ship, and weapon selection[/b]\nYou choose one of the two waifubots and their ships, then you choose the type of mainshot direction (straight, wide, directionnal) in a fashion very similar to the most recent DoDonpachi episodes. Eventually you chose your \"special\" weapon (4 different types, with some exclusive to one or the other ship).\n\n[b]3. Game mechanics[/b]\nScoring system is very straight forward, you build up your chain meter up to 8 with your normal shot by destroying enemy. Then you fire your special weapon to kill enemies for a score multiplier based on your chain counter. Your chain counter starts depleting when you fire the first time your special, and there is no way to rebuild it but to wait till it reaches zero.\nThe special weapon uses ammo that you refill by collecting items left behind by killed enemies. Bombs work in a similar fashion, do bullet cancel, and give you a temporary invincibility.\n\n\n[h1]Design[/h1]\n[b]1. Introduction[/b]\nMusic and art style while subjective are imo awesome.\nUnlike a lot of the recently released \"indie pixel art shmups\" that are beautiful but have no thought put into game design, Blue Revolver is on par with \"professional\" shmups.\n\n[b]2. Game design[/b]\nLevels are pretty diverse, and bullet patterns can be quiet challenging and impressive, especially on rank5. Thoughts has been put behind enemies and bullets coloring as the action never gets unreadable like it happens so often with indie shmups.\n\n[b]3.

a game could be called a love letter to a whole genre, that game is Blue Revolver and the genre is maniac shmups. Anyone who has put much time into CAVE, Raizing, or Psykio's classics will find themselves in familiar, yet fresh and unexplored territory. This sense of familiarity doesn't come from superficial or visual similarities but the nitty-gritty design of the game, especially and most obviously the boss bullet patterns. These are varied and novel: you won't see anything you've played before but you will see things that riff on classic patterns, changing the dynamic with new elements. BR's patterns are down-home, working-class patterns; they mostly do without flashy razzle-dazzle bullets that add to the spectacle but not the threat. Every element was added because it constrains your movement, or forces it, or confuses the safe path, or...\n\n Bullet speed is high (and so is player speed, although there is a focus mode when you hold down fire) and density is (sometimes) fairly low; this ain't no Touhou. It feels, more than almost any other indie or doujin shmup I've played, like it originally came out on an actual arcade machine. In the best kind of way.\n \nThe scoring system is really good, and frankly a lot better than in most of the greats (looking at you, donpachi series). You build up a short multiplier killing (ideally) popcorn enemies then cash in by using your special weapon on high value targets. No stage long, game long chains. The system allows for a lot of improvisation, and single mistakes won't permanently reduce your future scoring opportunities. There are also various stunt bonuses for defeating bosses in specific ways.\n\nOkay, so if you already know you're a shmup fan then Blue Revolver is a must-buy, but what if most of the preceding was nonsense to you? More good news: Blue Revolver features a rank system that increases the difficulty as you score points, but reduces it when you die. Unlike most shmup rank systems, it's clearly designed with an eye to giving weaker players a break, rather than punishing skilled ones. This ain't no Garegga where you have to keep your rank down or the game becomes impossible: it's fully beatable at the 5th and highest rank, and indeed one of the game modes locks it at rank 5.\n\nThere's also a mode that restricts the rank to its lowest two levels, and I think that this mode is one of the best introductions to shmups you could ask for. It's not outrageously difficult, but unlike most shmups tailored toward beginners it doesn't mess around either. The action is intense and constant. You don't feel bad about dying and having to start over because there is no downtime: even the first level keeps you busy, and you can work on improving your score strategy in places where you've become comfortable just surviving. By the time you've developed the skill required to finish the game, you'll be more than ready to explore a whole new world of some of the best, most exciting and action-packed games ever made.\n\nTake a risk on Blue Revolver; I can't guarantee that you'll be glad you did, but if so, you will be VERY glad.", "timestamp_created": 1476233656, "timestamp_updated": 1476233674, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 36, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.753860", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25989776": {"recommendationid": "25989776", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060749242", "num_games_owned": 311, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477422988}, "language": "english", "review": "If you enjoyed the old schoold CAVE shumps then this is a must buy!

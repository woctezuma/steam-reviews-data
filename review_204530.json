I started playing the game without having seen the reviews on steam and I was amazed at how much fun it is, seeing the reviews it all adds up.\nWhile it is a fairly simple game, it is perfect for some quick in and out arcade/strategy fun. Its an action game that can be characterized as a mix of strategy, RTS and tower defence shooter.... Taking control of an elite squad of space marines all you need to do is kick some alien butt... actually lots and lots and lots of alien butts because there are soooo many of them.\nPart of the fun is the wild shootouts killing hundreds of aliens each step you take towards your goal. The stages are fairly similar and while the goals are very similar as well there is a bit of strategic thinking involved into what upgrades to include for each mission (there are some single mission upgrades you can buy before starting) that provide you with some extra firepower, more soldiers, healing, different weapons and they can make a difference.\nOne of the best aspects of the game is the aliens themselves, which mutate and in many ways make each experience slightly different. The graphics are  simple but server their purpose amazingly well, everything is viewed from the top down perspective and the immense numbers of aliens didn't seem to bother my shabby laptop.\nDon't expect the second coming and don't expect to play this forever, its not that... what you will do is engage quite a bit for a few days and then maybe go back from time to time for some hectic quick \"relaxing\" fun. I used it to alleviate my frustrations with my Long Dark experience.\n\nBesides the main campaign there are some other challenges you can take up.\n\nAt full price it might be a bit expensive, but it has been bundled and it has been on sale... and at the reduced price its a must, its just too much fun and quite addictive.", "timestamp_created": 1516351953, "timestamp_updated": 1516353359, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.598315", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39420355": {"recommendationid": "39420355", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159858469", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514396152}, "language": "french", "review": "j'ai ador\u00e9 jouer a ce jeux mais je trouve qu'il manque...un petit quelque chose pour nous accrocher.C'est peut \u00eatre moi mais je trouve le jeux un peu lassant a force.\nil reste n\u00e9anmoins un jeux tr\u00e8s bon avc des m\u00e9caniques simples et beaucoup de potentiel avec ses diff\u00e9rentes am\u00e9liorations et sa fa\u00e7con de g\u00e9rer sa petite \u00e9quipe en fonction de la situation.\nla difficult\u00e9e est bien dos\u00e9e et le gameplay est fluide mais un peu mou..\nl'histoire est sympa (m\u00eame si franchement g pa lu mdr exdee)\nun jeu que je recommande pour un certain type de joueurs (plus ax\u00e9 sur le gameplay et les d\u00e9fis)\nbref un bon jeux au gameplay riche,un peu r\u00e9petitif certe,mais qui a de la ressource!", "timestamp_created": 1516216674, "timestamp_updated": 1516216674, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39409842": {"recommendationid": "39409842", "author": {"steamid": "76561198350426198", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 553, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507454079}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u79cd\u6e38\u620f\u6a21\u5f0f\u7c7b\u578b\u5c31\u5f88\u5438\u5f15\u6211 \u5c31\u662f\u6ca1\u4e2d\u6587 \u53ea\u80fd\u81ea\u5df1\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e2a\u6162\u6162\u731c \u633a\u597d\u73a9\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f", "timestamp_created": 1516183538, "timestamp_updated": 1516183538, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39328426": {"recommendationid": "39328426", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062255846", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1362, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482806128}, "language": "english", "review": "A fantastic and interesting combination of real-time strategy and tower defense that will have  you at the edge of your seat as thousands of aliens hope to  get a taste of your face.", "timestamp_created": 1515904457, "timestamp_updated": 1515904457, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39326704": {"recommendationid": "39326704", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072147374", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 688, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 688, "last_played": 1515897742}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is just fun.

Bonus points if you like tower defense. Infested Planet boils down the extreneous resource management and base building elements of an RTS into something more streamlined and intuitive, making for a very satisfying and fun game.\n\nI can't really recommend this game at full price, however. There isn't much replay value. The campaign is at its most fun when you're unlocking the various buildings/upgrades, but at a certain point it just starts throwing money at you. Even when you abandon a game, you still get money, so any sense of progression eventually ceases when everything's unlocked before the campaign is even over. After that, there's just a weekly challenge and a skirmish mode. I can't comment on the planetary campaign, which is sold separately.\n\nSide note: Unfortunately this game evidently suffers from stuttering/slowdown issues if you don't meet the absolute highest system requirements. My laptop's dual core 2.7 GHz processor is apparently not quite good enough (tried all other options), so if you're planning to play it on an old laptop or something that doesn't have a quad core, you may run into problems.

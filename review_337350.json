Come one day I see that Messhof is remaking it, and I perk up. I saw the trailer, but rather than getting my hype going instead I felt as if it was a letdown: The music was different, the aesthetic was completely changed, the awesome feeling was seemingly absent. I became sceptical, and I decided I'd wait before trying it out. Then I guess I just forgot about it as I never picked it up for a good year or two.\n\nEventually I saw it had gone on sale and I decided I'd pick it up, as I still remembered the original fondly. My fears that it would be a disappointment seemed to be eroding away, at least partially. The music was just as grating and unfitting as I had dreaded, but thankfully I turned it off and enjoyed myself a bit more. Come a few hours later And I'd beaten it. Much like its predecessor, it's a rather short game. But it's also meant to be played over and over, practiced and perfected.\n\nFlywrench's story is quite rudimentary: You are presumably some nondescript hacker or something and you are infiltrating a security system via a little flying bug that changes colors to pass through gates... Yeah it doesn't make a ton of sense but it's not essential to the game itself anyways and can be freely skipped at your leisure. The strongest aspect is its core gameplay: You flap to not only go up but to turn red and pass through red walls. You let go to fall and be white to pass through white walls. You roll to turn green and become bouncy as well as passing through... well you get the idea. The complexity and challenge comes from learning this subversion of traditional \"platforming\" mechanics, and applying how each mechanic affects how you move and when you need to use a specific ability to pass through its corresponding gate. It can be difficult to wrap your head around, but once you ge the hang of it its quite enjoyable, and the game does an excellent job of using simple levels to teach you the basics as well as subtle nuances about the mechanics, while doing nothing to hinder experienced players who will blast through them no problem.\n\nThat's well and good, but what really makes the game sing is the level design. As I mentioned before the opening levels are excellent tutorials, and later the complexities of the game's' mechanics pile upon each other as new mechanics are introduced in each subsequent world, and each word does a superb job exploring ways to make each and every one of those mechanics interesting and challenging while never compromising its fairness to you, the player. The game doesn't feel like it's cheating against you; Each level might be hard, but they are short enough that you don't lose much by screwing up. The game effectively sets up a promise: A promise that every level will be short sweet and to the point; A simple and straightforward challenge to overcome before quickly moving on to the next one. And unlike games like Super Meat Boy, the game doesn't break that promise by eventually becoming bogged down with long, frustratingly tedious gauntlet levels which have way more obstacles than should be fair, too many chances to screw up, and a habit of wasting your time. (With only one exception; The final level)\n\nIt's a very simple platforming challenge game, but with a clever twist on that formula and a lot more hidden complexity than you might realize. Also a level editor and workshop support give the game a bit more longevity than is really needed, but is a welcome addition nonetheless.

Another nice perk is that there are separate leaderboards for normal and helmet modes, so you can compete in multiple ways.\n\n2.

I'm going to go in depth about this game, because I had fun with it up until a certain point. Flywrech is a type of puzzle game focused on movement and momentum. It achieves this by allowing you a limited degree of control over your character: you can freely move left and right, but you remain constantly falling and need to \"flap\" by pressing a button. You can press it rapidly to \"fly\" upward and by leaning your character in the other directions you can maintain movement to a certain degree. Additionally; flapping also changes your characters color, switching from white to red as you press or hold the button. This affects how fast you move directionally as well, along with a third button that allows you to turn green and move similarly to a rubber ball.  By having colored barriers that can only be passed if you're a matching color to them: Flywrech begins to shape up as a unique way to move through obstacles.\n\nIt's similar to the Super Meatboy brand of game. That makes sense as I noted that the creator of this game was originally a contributer to the Newgrounds community and the character \"Flywrench\" makes an appearence in Meatboy. (I'm unfamiliar to the degree of which the creator is involved with the creators of other Newgrounds related games; google it for info if you're interested). In each level there's a startpoint and an endpoint. Fail the level and you're sent back to the startpoint. There are no collectables, and it's a very straight-forward game. However, I feel compelled to note that Flywrech contains a difficulty curve that ruins the experience of anyone less than a hardened gamer. I know a lot of people disregard the notion that there are games that are too hard, and that most people need to \"git gud\", but that isn't what I mean. The levels up till the last world, Mercury, felt fair and gave relative variety to design and challenge. Mercury does not. The difficulty curve spikes harshly towards the end of the game, to almost Cave Story level. Most of the Mercury levels add challenges that cause you to rush when you normally would try to balance your movements and think, and having imprecise movement centered on momentum ruins any sense of challenge as you don't have enough time to react to anything that comes near. There is an easy mode that you can activate, but it only blocks a certain color of wall and most of the challenges on Mercury do not involve the color of that particular barrier. So it won't help you very much. This kind of ruined the experience for me, as Flywrenches atmosphere felt more reserved and dreamy with a mix of urgency that never felt outright disasterous (especially the music; dreamy electric tones overlayed with the occasional voice noise).\nFlywrench has a cool concept. You play as a spaceship or hacking tool that needs to make it to the center of the solar system. You pass through satellites as the levels and slowly increase the signal to make it to closer planets. There's indication that you're doing something more surreal as an instructor gives wisdom each time you unlock a new planet. This adds to the dream-like state that the game conveys through its visuals of clashing colors. As of now, I have not seen the end of the game because of the difficulty curve; you need to clear all the levels to access the final area of the Sun. But I felt engaged and enjoyed it enough to go back and mess around with some of the other features that unlock as you progress, including palette swaps and a Level Editor that allows you to make your own planets and zones. There is also a Time Trial mode for the exellently skilled. Not only that, but there is an option to \"unlock everything\" which I can only imagine unlocks the rest of the game defeating the purpose of struggling through the levels. However, it is nice to see that the developers thought ahead of the fact that the game gets incredibly hard towards the end.\nOverall, I'd say Flywrench is worth your money. It's short, but fun and most of the time you aren't to mad about being stuck on a certain level.

The last few levels were the only challenging ones, and it could have been made to get harder still. I found the final level in the game surprisingly easy and forgiving (the world prior was more of a challenge).

Rather than standard platforms, it is more manoevering your flywrench ship thing through space, which is set up like levels. The controls are super tight, and if you die, you know it's on you (well, I personally think so, anyway).\n\nThe main thing that makes this game unique is the main mechanic. When no buttons are pressed, you are white. When holding one action button, you turn red, which makes you flap and gives you momentum. Pressing the second action button makes you turn green, and you can bounce of walls. There are barriers that you can pass through, white, red and green, To get through them, you have to be the right colour. But, for example, when you turn red to go through a red barrier, you also flap, so that could mess you up, and so on. There are pink boundaries you can't even bounce off, too. There is more things that come in to change up the gameplay, but I'll let you discover it. My first playthough was about 4-5 hours, but my fastest run was about an hour.\n\nOne last thing is this is a great level editor. It is super easy to use, and I have made a level pack.

Instead the \u201cflywrench\u201d you play as is hard to control, the smallest misstep leads to an unrecoverable death, and the levels become ruthlessly unforgivable at the end, but beyond any mechanical  fault, the game simply wasn't fun for me in the same way as Dustforce or Trackmania is.\n\nThe basic goal of the game is to navigate small quick levels by flapping your flywrench to stay aloft while using the joystick to glide from side to side. The levels start off pretty simple but quickly expand with different mechanics, the most prominent being dodging purple barriers while pressing certain buttons to pass through colored barriers. But unfortunately not matter how much I played, I could never control the flywrench to the proficiency needed to precisely navigate stages without touching a barrier or the walls (which starts bouncing you all over the place and is nearly impossible to recover from before you hit something that will kill you), it feels like a precision platformer with terribly unresponsive controls.\n\nWhen I first started playing, I didn\u2019t mind the controls so much because the levels were really short and there wasn't much that could kill you, but about halfway through, the levels started getting longer and the path that you need to navigate smaller, but I still persevered hoping something would click and that I would eventually get better, but any improvement I showed was far outstripped by the ramp in difficulty of the levels until I gave up after completing every level up to 19/21 Mercury. And that was it, I couldn't win those last three levels and couldn't muster any interest to keep trying; I wasn't having any fun, so I quit.\n\nOverall the game has some potential if you are into really hard and unforgiving games, but most of the time when I died, I didn\u2019t feel it was my fault. Instead it felt like it was the the difficult controls and the unforgiving level design that was to blame, this made it frustrating to play. When I did manage to complete a level it felt like it was due to luck more than any skill on my part, sapping any sense of achievement from winning and not providing any incentive to continue on. So unless you really know you are the kind of person who loves throwing themselves at insurmountable challenges, I recommend passing this game bye.

It's been a long time coming anyways.\n\nIn a way, Flywrench is similar to precision platformers such as Super Meat Boy (it was even an unlockable character in meatboy). However, in many other ways it is not. For one, the game isn't a platformer, it's hard to even label the game under a specific genre. Flywrench is its own very unique thing, and plays like no other game I've played. The game has a fantastic sense if flow to it making moving through the game a really enjoyable experience. This sense of flow has contributed to me spending 60+ hours doing time trials and speedruns in this game, as moving through the game quickly is one of the most satisfying experiences I have had with a game. \n\nI do personally have a lot of problems with the game though. Firstly, I personally feel that the levels are way to short. This gets fixed later in the game however early levels only take 1-3 seconds to clear which makes clearing them feel really trivial and a bit silly. Some of the levels especially are more about getting the angle or bounce the game wants rather than taking any actual skill from the player. Get past the first half of the game however and it really starts to pick up with the final set of levels being one of my favourite parts of any game. Secondly, the game is very short. Don't let the hours on my account fool you, a first playthrough of the game will only take the player 2-4 hours, depending on their skill level. While there is a lot of extra content with time trials and the level editor, if that sort of thing does not interest you there's very little to keep you playing a long time. I would personally say that with how enjoyable the game is, 4 hours of gameplay is worth full price, but I understand that this differs greatly from person to person.\n\nOverall Flywrench is a fantastic package. Despite it's issues it remains the best experience I have had in 2015 and I will likely continue to play it well into the future.

While the gameplay is simple, requiring only a couple buttons, the game does a great job creating interesting levels. Most of the levels take between five to twenty seconds to complete but you will die a lot as you work out how to avoid all of the obstacles.\n\nGames where you die constantly usually frustrate me but due to the short length of the levels it's not so bad since you lose little progress when you die. Also a majority of the game is moderately difficult. Only the last two or three worlds become really challenging. \n\nIf the idea behind the game doesn't interest you, you probably won't like the game. If the concept does interest you though I think you will should have quite a bit of fun with game.\n\nNote: I received a free review copy of Flywrench.

It felt a lot like hotline miami, where you just zone out to the AMAZING soundtrack and fly through challenging levels, but the second you die you are immediately back in the action.\n\nUsually in games level design ramps up as you go through, meaning as levels get really hard, you will tend to try at a level for 10 minutes, just to beat it and move on to an even harder level without any sort of break. This game combats that by still leaving in challenging, but not extremely difficult levels in between really hard ones, so you have a minute or two to relax (sort of) and listen to the music.\n\nSpeaking of the music, the soundtrack is really just crazy good. the DnB, and electro in this game is some of the best I have ever heard! I stand by my reference to Hotline Miami, as while it is completely different, it has a very similar vibe.\n\nMy computer accidentically deleted my saves after I was about 3 planets in, then after playing almost to the sun, my computer decided to RESTORE MY OLD SAVE setting me back to the 3rd planet :(, so no I am playing again and I am still loving every second of it! (minus a few levels that were just really tedious).\n\nThe one feature that this game is really lacking is the ability to adjust sound effect volume. I want to be able to turn the music way up, and only be able to barely hear the SFX, but the only option is to turn SFX off completely. The game is still pretty new, so I hope this is added in a patch.\n\nEDIT:\nSo this game is really extremely fun, and has the darksouls quality of making you die a lot, but you always know it's your fault (never the game's), and that you can do better... untill the second to last planet (each planet is a series of 20 or so levels). Once you reach murcury, all the levels put you on some rediculously short timer, and it become less about skill, and more about memorizing the exact pixel perfect sequence of button pushes in order to get through the level.\n\nThese timers take the forms of pinweels that \"Push\" you through a level, or gates that only stay open X ammount of seconds after you trigger them to open, often closing RIGHT as you are passing through them. The pinweels are especially frustrating because not only do they push you from the back, but if you are going to fast (because, idk, your being chased by a SPINNING WALL OF DEATH) then you will hit the front side of the pinweel and die! This causes a margin of error that is so small it's almost feels impossible, like where the keys on my keyboard/controller physically cannot actuate fast enough to get through the obsticals.\n\nThe game was still REALLY fun up untill Murcury though, so it's still worth a buy", "timestamp_created": 1442192360, "timestamp_updated": 1442541687, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.999518", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18023009": {"recommendationid": "18023009", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141775364", "num_games_owned": 274, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1445668937}, "language": "english", "review": "Flywrench takes the essence of precision platformers and presents it through a satisfying movement scheme.

In addition, fans of Nidhogg's soundtrack will also love this game as it once again features a pounding soundtrack with returning Daedelus as lead music designer, while featuring additional highly influential electronic music artists.\n\nThis game will likely take players 3-4 hours to complete, but the game offers a degree of replayability for those wanting to do time trials, or for those wanting to use the in-game level editor to make their own levels. \n\nI believe the biggest negative for this game is the exponential increase in difficulty towards the latter part of the game.   My biggest critique of the game is, rather truly exploring and using the new obstacles to their fullest in each planet and gradually scaling difficulty, the game holds back until you get to Mercury.  On average, it took me maybe 10-15 mins to completely clear a planet. I would even often clear levels on my first try. However, upon getting to Mercury one level would take me up to 15-20 mins to complete.  Don't get me wrong, I loved Mercury because it really showcases Messhof's creativity, but at the same time why couldn't we have more of these levels?\n\nAnother minor gripe with the game is that difficulty isn't presented through use of in-game mechanics, but rather exploiting the limitations of the keyboard. Levels in Mercury often have you going diagonal, which is inherently more difficult and imprecise than using a controller. I would've like the game to be more challenging through use of spinning and fluttering than trying to awkwardly move sideways. But, as I've said this is only a minor gripe.\n\nOverall I was very satisfied playing the game and I will be returning to it.

There aren't any platforms to speak of but I can't think of another way to describe Flywrench.   You're a small white rectangle with the ability to flap yourself to ascend while turning red and tumble and bounce off walls while turning green.  You pass harmlessly through barriers of the color you currently are, whereas you die immediately if you hit a different-color wall or barrier.  The controls are extremely tight and that's good because this game quickly becomes very challenging.  Your (numerous) failures don't annoy however because upon death you respawn immediately and try again.   Also helpful is the fact that new worlds (each one introduces a new mechanic) are unlocked once a set number of stages are completed so if you find a stage particularly difficult, you can skip it and come back later without hampering progression.

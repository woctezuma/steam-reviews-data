This game is a true work of art and I have Wolfborg to thank for making this masterpiece that blows away any triple A game this year or even in the past decade. The gameplay is so easy and yet so challenging, it really shows how such a simple control as point and click can make for one of the greatest video game experiences I've had, I was immersed in the game once I made it to triple digits in the combos, as if Rapid Tap\u2122 was all that mattered, the only thing I could focus on at that moment. I cannot say the same about any piece of media that I have seen in my life time, this game has legitimately changed my view on everything, it has changed my life for the better and this will always be held close to me for truly showing me what perfection is, Wolfborg is the greatest artist if our generation and maybe of all time, This is truly his magnum opus and I am eagerly awaiting the sequel as well as Beat Grid\u2122, if they're anywere close to the greatness that is Rapid Tap\u2122 or even possibly better than Wolfborg will have my praise forever. I genuinely hope this god of a man gets recognized more for something as stunning in it's work as this. This game is something everybody has to truly experience at least once in their life, else they will never be complete and will never know true perfection for the rest of their life. Finally, the cherry on top and a must have for this work of art, the competitive aspect that will keep you coming back for more every day, to have people reach to the top to prove how worthy they are for this breathtaking experience is what makes this already perfect game even better. I give this game a 10/10 and highly recommend it to everyone, give Wolfborg all your praise.\n\nEDIT: Please remember, this game is also on Android and iOS, this is a game for everyone and you must try this out, to have the greatest creation of mankind on the go is something we all should be thankful for, I have never had a better time in my life than when I first played this on Android and I was absolutely estatic to find this on Steam. I ask you all to please get this on Steam and on your mobile device as well.", "timestamp_created": 1516813013, "timestamp_updated": 1516813347, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0,

We invented fire, we invented bread, we invented cars, we invented robots... now we have invented Rapid Tap. May mankind celebrate this momentous ocassion.\n\nWhen I think back to all the games I played last year, one stands out among them all. That was of course Rapid Tap on IOS and Android, a deep, methodical puzzle game created by the God himself Wolfborg in under 12 hours. Just when I thought perfection couldn't get more perfect, here we are today. \nThe PC version of this game is on a whole new level, introducing brand new levels of tappage. New skins, new gameplay mechanics, new options, the list goes on and on... the best part is this entire game is free.\nOverall i'd give this game a 10/10, if I could I would give it a higher score like 15/10 or 2000/10", "timestamp_created": 1516694711, "timestamp_updated": 1516694711, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39551388": {"recommendationid": "39551388", "author": {"steamid": "76561198311098388", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 18, "last_played": 1516692402}, "language": "english", "review": "There's a certain flavour of brutality that some video games possess. An intoxicating river of violence that flows through the gameplay and drives a story through to a (hopefully) satisfying conclusion. It provokes a certain appeal that transforms a potentially generic experience into a bleak, brutal journey of blood, sweat and tears. This is where Rapid Tap lives and breathes.\nIn the year 1942, the city of nazi Germany is a corrupt yet alluring hellhole. Gangs of murderous street kids roam the alleyways and corporate guards tell you where you're not welcome. The failing conglomerate Rapid Tap controls everything from military to entertainment and everyone in between is just trying to survive.\nAs rich as this backdrop is, it is a clothesline from which mass murder hangs. Your character is an internally wired lunatic whose only emotions are nods, shrugs and various moods which are displayed on an impressive LED gird. Unfortunately, this technology is easily exploited and that's where the story of Rapid Tap begins. Rebooted by a mysterious hacker named Rapid Tap Chan, you are told that Wolfborg has kidnapped your brother and you must tear Germany apart to find him. She calls you her 'Jeff' and as far you know, this is your only identity.\nVisualised from an isometric perspective, Rapid Tap demands a lethally fast playstyle balanced with a methodical view towards defeating your enemies. Blood paints the floor as you cut a path through walls of bodies with swords, shotguns, pipes, rail guns and grenades. From dilapidated gang warehouses to thunderous steaming factories, the environments of nazi Germany are your canvas for the art of death.\nWith a legion of inventive weapons and skills, mixed with abilities like a quick Tap, Long Press, and the manipulation of the grids brain, everywhere you go quickly becomes a playground of murder. Rapid Tap strides knee-deep through carnage with such precision and confidence that sometimes all you can do is hang on and hope you come out alive the other side. As you begin to become accustomed to the sometimes brutally difficult combat, the game opens its doors to inventive boss encounters, and some profoundly satisfying melee Tapping scenarios.\n \nDogs, Memes and Anime Tiddies can kill with only a few taps so if you don't keep to the mantra of \"move or die\", you'll witness your demise many times. However, Rapid Tap never feels unfair. While it gives the early perception of being unforgiving, it is always clear where you went wrong, and you immediately want to jump straight back into battle to demonstrate that you have what it takes. Every enemy encounter gives you enough rope to hang yourself and it's up to you to figure out how to escape the noose.\nThe most outstanding companion on this murderous journey is the music. Developer Wolfborg has assembled a myriad of artists to contribute to the driving, thumping soundtrack. From Polish techno to UK house tunes, the intoxicating soundscapes help propel the violence and drive Rapid Tap into that golden 'one-more-go' territory which can be difficult to escape.\n\nThe characters that populate the city are a fascinating collection of shibes. With names like Jeff, the cyberpunk landscape of Nazi Germany is littered with mysterious conversations and peculiar motivations. However, here lies Rapid Taps most glaring misstep. While every shibe has a compelling personality, not enough is done to bring them to the surface. The dialogue is well-written but most shibes you interact with are not as fully realised as they deserve to be. Loose ends begin to pile up and by the end of the story, you're left wondering if a large part of the tapestry of nazi Germany was left on the cutting room floor.\nBut this matters not when you're inhaling the blood-drenched aesthetics of this universe. Cinematic lighting peeks through robotic factories and muted neon colours paint your path into a unique world of futuristic corruption, though the overwhelming presence of the colour red begins to notably dominate everything in the wake of your actions. From in-game menus to warehouse lighting, this theme is a constant reminder that bloodshed is your currency and your pockets are very deep indeed.\nViolence in games can be designed as an incentive to move forward. When expertly crafted, it is a catalyst to continue when you might give up and go beyond where you thought your capabilities ended. In this respect, Ruiner succeeds masterfully. A lightning-fast lethality fits this cyberpunk world like a glove and pushes you into surprising tests of skill that become more rewarding with every slice and explosion.\nRapid Tap creates a future teeming with interesting concepts, fascinating people and hidden despair. But it is the combat which stands front and centre. Through the endless bodies that fall by your hand, the grim layers of the story peel away to divulge a few surprises about the meaning of life, death and revenge. It is a revealing journey that's well worth taking but it is apparent from the opening scene to the mysterious finale, the only thing that is pure and absolute in the world of Rapid Tap is murder.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1516692338, "timestamp_updated": 1516692338, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39551018": {"recommendationid": "39551018", "author": {"steamid": "76561198250031798", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 13, "last_played": 1516690399}, "language": "english", "review": "11/10 Rapid Tap > Osu  (DOWNLOAD RAPID TAP)", "timestamp_created": 1516690452, "timestamp_updated": 1516690452, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39550991": {"recommendationid": "39550991", "author": {"steamid": "76561198191239773", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 75, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 75, "last_played": 1516855690}, "language": "english", "review": "For such a simple concept for a game, it is surprisingly addicting.

On a 3X3 grid, your reflexes will be tested as one of them glows green.  Hurry and click it or you lose a life!  Click multiple tiles in succession and you get combo points which just keep stacking.  Lose 3 lives and it's game over!\n\nI love the little chime every time I click something right.  Though it is addictive (as is the music), it does get repetitive.  I wish there were more chimes, songs (maybe an ability to play your own music), and more skins to make this game even more enjoyable to waste time on.\n\nIt's worth noting that [i]Rapid Tap[/i] is more suited for a tablet or a smartphone rather than a computer screen, but it's still nice to play.

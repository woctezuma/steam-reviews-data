To me, I think a dating simulator should have either no ending, or allow you to engage with all the characters of the players desire, without any outside forces from stopping you. I hooked up with the T34, because Russian bias and the USSR memes that come with. After the night of what I assume was 57mm penetration, you awake to a knock at your door. Military police. You go to court for deserting your post, are found innocent, and charged with banging a tank, in laymans terms. The game then basically ends, tells what all of the characters do in their lives, and your character gets shot when he is reassigned to a combat position. No more hot ammo racks, and enveloping penetration for you, comrade.

The story makes no sense whatsoever, but is full of cool historic/military references and delivers some genuinely funny characters (my personal favourite being the yandere IS-2). It\u2019s definitely targeted towards World War 2 geeks such as myself and really works well in this respect \u2013 also, while short, it offers multiple \u201cromance\u201d options with different tanks/girls and your choice in that matter influences the story quite a lot, creating a lot of replayability. If you wish to explore the game fully, it should give you around 6-7 hours of decent entertainment.\n\nThe art and music are nothing special, but they work and CGs are mostly very nice to look at. [b]What I have to mention though is lack of proper options menu, no autoplay and generally very clunky interface[/b]. I would probably play it more if it had the typical \u201cskip read only\u201d option and didn\u2019t continue skipping after choices, with no easy option to rewind the text. There\u2019s also some glitches, that often can even persist through restarting or loading the game (I had all backgrounds missing on one playthrough, with just black screen behind the text and character sprites). It\u2019s easy to see that it was made as a first attempt by an inexperienced team and Devgru-p\u2019s second title, \u201cStay! Stay! DPRK\u201d is much, much better in this respect.\n\n[b]Considering the technical issues, I only recommend buying this game while on sale \u2013 it\u2019s definitely worth your time if you care about the theme, but the production qualities simply doesn\u2019t justify the 10 dollar pricetag.[/b] The core content nevertheless is very enjoyable and it\u2019s obvious that developers made it with a lot of humour and most likely had genuine fun in the process.", "timestamp_created": 1506268808, "timestamp_updated": 1506280274, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505173", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35168014": {"recommendationid": "35168014", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059289450", "num_games_owned": 502, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506474927}, "language": "english", "review": "First off, what?

Clearly the attempt was to make this higher quality than the rest of the imagery, but it doesn't work.  Tiger I doesn't look anything like she does in the rest of the game.  With one image she's skillfully transformed from a believable and human (tank?) character to a soulless Victorian porn star showing off more leg than a man can handle.

I loved all the historical references, especially the more obscure ones (such as the speculation that Panzer was in M\u00e4dchen in Uniform), as well as the irreverent (to put it mildly) sense of humor throughout. And the military-related jokes were spot on.\n\nBut the problems were present, and quite jarring. For one thing, the game is chock full of grammatical and spelling errors, and rather obvious ones at that. Then there's the bugs: Skipping in one place made my game crash so badly that only the Task Manager could close it, and even then, my Steam client thought it was still running, so I couldn't restart it or play a different game. Even using the Task Manager to close Steam didn't help here. The only thing that helped was restarting my computer. Also, there's a line of dialogue in the kitchen that is attributed to Panzer, no matter who's actually saying it, and under some conditions, the school music plays throughout the rest of the game, even when you change scenes, and even while other music was playing. Such basic errors are inexcusable, and indicative of rushed, sloppy work.\n\nThen there's the adult content patch. It hardly does anything, other than adding a risqu\u00e9 drawing of whatever tank you manage to win over. The drawings are nice, but they're really not much, and the patch itself is even bigger than the actual game. But perhaps this is due to the fact that this game was made with TyranoBuilder (hint to the creators--RenPy is much better in this regard, and many others).\n\nOverall, I give this game a 6/10.

[/h1]\n\nThis is a rather short, 6 hours tops, VN, telling a story of a guy, who was sent to the school, where all the girls are anthropomorphic version of tanks, and this fact is the main seller of the game. While this idea sounds interesting enough to buy the game just out of curiosity, after completing one route and starting the game anew to finish another one, you begin to see many problems it has.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\n\nYou are Erwin, a cadet who was sent to Japanese Tank School as a part of his training. After arriving to the school however, you find out, that all of the students are girls, and they are actually tanks. Five of them can be dated. So you choose between:\n\n- Sherman the Tomboy\n- T-34 the Tsundere\n- IS-2 the Yandere\n- Panzer IV the Ditz\n- Tiger I the Himedere (I think she's more like dandere though, but who cares)\n\nSo after choosing one, you start to work your way to the good ending, through some usual anime stuff, like school life, dates, hot springs and beaches.\n\nDoesn't sound too bad so far? Well, for the first hour and a half you can get some enjoyment from it. Panzermadels got a heavy focus on comedy and using anime related stereotypes, and while jokes and references aren't always that funny, sometimes they can make you smile a bit. Also it's interesting to find out how things will work out with the girl you chose.\n\nAnd when you get to the ending, you start to see the first problems.\n\nFirst off, the endings are pretty much bad and very bad. After doing everything right and even getting a chance to visit the insides of a tank (kinda like the favourite joke of the devs) you are [spoiler]getting court martialed and sent to the penal squad, and then you die in battle, while never getting a chance to interact with the girl you dated[/spoiler], or, if you screwed up in some way [spoiler]getting court martialed and shot immideately[/spoiler]. You know, I kinda believe that there should be a way to win in any game, even if it's VN. Getting somewhat immersed and then recieving an ending like this is pretty much a slap in the face.\n\nBut ok. Let's say you can deal with it. You start to hope there's some enjoyment to be found in completing other routes.\nBut no. As you read through the familiar intro stuff as you do in any VN, you start to see that nothing is changing, almost at all. And that's the biggest problem of the game:\n\n[b] Except dates, all of the scenes for different girls are pretty much the same, so by reading one route, which takes around 2 hours, you see 80% of the game [/b]\n\nIt becomes worst when you get to the ending again and realise, that the only difference between routes is the CG of the girl in the final scene. As a result, the only reason to replay the game is to read through a date scene and unlock a sexy art. But is it really worth it? And that brings us to...\n\n[h1] Art [/h1]\n\nTalking about art in VN suggests discussing character CG, backgrounds and fullscreen art for especially important moments of the game.\n\nCharacter CG is pretty much fair. It may be good or average, depending on your art tastes, but I don't think it can be considered bad. I do think though that the design is kinda boring, all of the tank girls look simply like girls, without any perks that can define what kind of the tank they are. I'm not talking about something mecha-related, like in Kantai Collection or Panzer Waltz. Hair clips, badges, hairstyles and clothes - all of that stuff could be creatively used for that purpose. And what can we see in the game? German tanks are blondes, and Maus super-heavy tank got huge tits. Bravo. Also there could be more variation in poses, since there's only around 2 or 3 for each girl.\n\nBackgrounds are simply lazy. By the look of it, I'm pretty sure that every background is simply a blurred photo, there are even some random people in the place that's supposed to be a school caffeterria, and random 20+ aged guy in the kitchen where only our main hero is supposed to be. Come on.\n\nAnd fullscreen art. The only important moment in the game, it seems, is the sex scene, since you only get one for each girl. And it simply shows your chosen tank girl in some suggesting pose. Also, while the game was luring people with promises of some hentai content, actual H-patch was released around year later. People in comments talk about it like it's goddamn miracle and best thing to happen in their life. In reality, only thing it did was removing pants and other stuff so you can see nipples and vaginas. Totally worth it. And it really bothers me, that those arts are done in different styles. I mean, what the hell? Even if different people done them, they should've tried to make them look at least somewhat similar.\n\n[h1] Music and Sound [/h1]\n\nNot much to say about it. Of course, it's not a voiced VN, so there are some sound effects only, which pretty much do the job. Same can be said about music, nothing out of this world, but nothing to complain about either.\n\n[h1] Technical Issues [/h1]\n\nWhile performance doesn't really matter in VN, I did encounter some problems.\n\n- Game takes some time to load, at least a minute\n- Skip button skips ALL of the text, there's no way to skip only previously read text\n- Skipping text in the clubs related part of the game makes two music themes play at the same time, restart needed\n- Loading saves in some parts of the game doesn't let you advance (you'll have to load different save)\n\nAs you can see, it's not very polished product, but chances are you won't encounter any problems at least on your first run.\n\n[h1] Verdict [/h1]\n\n4/10. Could be 5/10, if it was really cheap or free. It is too short, lazy and disappointing to be sold for its price. If you think I'm greedy or being rough on indie developers, note that they had Patreon and Kickstarter for this game and now sell it here, while much better novels like Katawa Shoujo and Endless Summer were totally free.\n\nDon't buy it unless it's on 90% discount and you wanna prove me wrong badly.", "timestamp_created": 1493589551, "timestamp_updated": 1493589674, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 57, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.653698", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31455340": {"recommendationid": "31455340", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090949099", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 451, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494564344}, "language": "english", "review": "The game was fun overall but there were some problems with it, specifically it being sorta short and [spoiler]the ending[/spoiler], but it still was a good time.\nEven better with the 18+ patch.\n8/10 (with patch)", "timestamp_created": 1493527535, "timestamp_updated": 1493528174, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520199", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31428951": {"recommendationid": "31428951", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080042816", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 389, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472876518}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is neat", "timestamp_created": 1493430276, "timestamp_updated": 1493430276, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31377781": {"recommendationid": "31377781", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079114740", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 119, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493221344}, "language": "english", "review": "Anime Tank Girls 10/10 I cannot reccomend this enough!", "timestamp_created": 1493221470, "timestamp_updated": 1493221471, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31347047": {"recommendationid": "31347047", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086626342", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 326, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494544144}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 got executed by a firing squad...", "timestamp_created": 1493073106, "timestamp_updated": 1493073106, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31346219": {"recommendationid": "31346219", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064356872", "num_games_owned": 326, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 64, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493067933}, "language": "english", "review": "The game has its ups and downs, as are listed below: \n\nPros:\n- Kawaii desune!\n- Innuendos and anime tiddies through clothes kinda, it's allowed on Twitch so is PG-13 (also a con).\n- sooka bilyadt Idi Nahui (had to re-write, because it was censored).\n- The waifus weren't that bad, and there was a selection to choose from.\n\nCons:\n- The Nurse looks like she has William's Syndrome.\n- There is no full-frontal nudity.\n- The memes aren't that good.\n- I somehow broke the backgrounds?

Hentai patch released. \n(even though you need to manually install via dev's webpage link)\n\nOverall scores.  \n-as a joke? 7/10 at best.\n-as an unironic visual novel 3/10 at best, very poor.\n\n*OLD REVIEW*\n\n1st of all, if you don't know much about tanks this game is just about pointless. \n \nShould have been longer plot for Maus or other tanks. Ending for Maus...? (I think you all sort of wished there was one) But yeah every ending to me is just super abrubt and everything felt unfinished. Maybe develepors just ran out of funding or decided that they didn't actually want to take tank dating seriously anymore. Well I do.\n\nTaking the fact that the game is probably 100% a joke, and it really kinda is, I only give it a 7/10 at best in this part.\n\nOn my first playthough I enjoyed base game but the endings felt very cut short and most of the endings really dont feel any different other the *SPOILER* of you being exucuted desertion, which is retarded becuase you were assigned specifically to the tank school in Akhibara, so I feel like devs just came up with something to end it without much thought.\n\nIf I were to take the game like any other non-retarded VN it goes way more down into the maybe 2-3/10 at best. As a joked about a hentai patch, I personally found it not even worth trying to.... its just bad.\n\n Treating it like any other vn, very bad, cartoonish sprites, very generic music-\n although the music isnt bad, its just really generic, and pretty much the same throughout it. Seems most of it is by Kevin MacLeod. The story is extremely forced, and most of the attempts at jokes either dont get across because they rely on vague references, or just poorly done. I cant recommend it at all as a VN.\n\nIts not bad that I originally approached this game with an actual mind set of wanting to date tanks and didn't just do this for the memes, right?", "timestamp_created": 1488691410, "timestamp_updated": 1515084450, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558835", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30308349": {"recommendationid": "30308349", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087339543", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488607088}, "language": "english", "review": "I can explain", "timestamp_created": 1488607120, "timestamp_updated": 1488607120, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 31, "weighted_vote_score": "0.659367", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30289915": {"recommendationid": "30289915", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049421446", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487291791}, "language": "english", "review": "T-34 chan a qt!", "timestamp_created": 1488519608, "timestamp_updated": 1488519608, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30285981": {"recommendationid": "30285981", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076859700", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 642, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506343770}, "language": "english", "review": "T-34 is best girl.

Wait, I am one, fuck... I NEED ANOTHER ADULT!)\n[/list]\n\nSeriously, though, this isn't a bad game. \n\nThe story goes like apparently every other virtual novel (this is my first AND LAST one). You're a male student transferring to another school, but in this case it's a \"tank school.\" For some reason, you're in Japan, even though you're an American soldier. You get lost and have to decide between going to a convenience store or a mechanic's shop. Going to the mechanic's shop, you'll meet a mechanic who directs you to the school. Your other option is to go to the convenience store, you'll meet the American tank, the M4 Sherman. She leads you to the school, the \"Tank School.\" Who cares about the story, so I'm justing going to skip it right now and get on to the tanks. Your options on which tank you want to fuck are: Panzer IV, Tiger I, M4 Sherman, T-34, and IS-2.\n\nPzKpfw IV is a secret nazi who hides behind her \"love of Japan\" to seem innocent. The puns and jokes about the Blitzkrieg and National Socialism were alright. Who wouldn't love a joke like, \"It's not like we're a bunch of J- just made of money people, heh heh...\" The F\u00fchrer would be proud. Hitler ist so kawaii~!  Load the AP rounds, get the war machine moving, anschluss some friends, and Blitzkrieg them all ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0). F\u00fcr des Deutsches Vaterland!\n\nThe M4 Sherman is a loud, fast-food obsessed tank, because 'murica. The best part is when you reenact D-Day ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0).\n\nTiger I is a tank that breaks down a lot. \"Hans, ze transmission broke.\" \n\nT-34 is a CYKA. We must protect the Russian-speaking minority, comrades. Crimea is ours, and the Ukraine is also ours. So is Poland, and eastern Germany, and the Baltics, and the Balkans, and...\n\nIS-2 is Stalin's imbred child who's ready to get punished ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0). Who's ready to flank some fascists and run over German children? Rape their women, comrades! Shoot the old! That is the way of Stalin!\n\nTOG 2 is a secret British tank you can do \"things\" with in a pool ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\n\nAnd who could forget about the memorable side characters like:\nChar-B1, hon hon hon\nThe tank that Deutschland Blitzed so hard it's not relevent anymore\nA tractor from the far away land of New Zealand\nThe Maus, with her big... ammo racks ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\nThat guy from Full Metal Jacket and insurance commercials\nCYKA tank v2\nShopkeeper guy\nAND MANY MORE!\n\nAlso, you're the great-grandson of Erwin Rommel. Your name's Erwin Lemmor, because you're in witness protection after the whole North Africa and Western Front thing. So go show Panzer IV what you know about combat moneuvers ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\n\nSo anyway, back to the story. You spend 2 weeks at this school. During these weeks, you'll connect with these tanks by: going on a scavenger hunt, going on a field trip to a hot spring, missing a dance because the drill-sergeant is an ass, getting yelled at by your tank, making it up by pealing potatoes, getting dirty, needing to take a shower, and anschlussing them after the shower at your apartment ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0).\n\nIn the end, you're arrested for going AWOL since you went to the wrong school. At your trial, your drill-sergeant becomes your lawyer because plot and attempts to defend you against the charges. He calls M4 Sherman as a witness, and she fucks it up (just like the Vietnam war). You're about to get the death sentence by shooting squad when your tank comes running in with a paper that proves it wasn't your fault for going to the wrong tank school. So they dismiss the charges, excpet GUESS WHAT YOU LITTLE SHIT, you fucked a tank last night, so you're going to now have to fight in a penal battalion on the Eastern Front against Plane Girls. You become an NCO eventually, but get fatally wounded in a battle. But you died doing what you loved, riding tanks ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0). \n\nOh wait, I forgot to metion that fucking IS-2 gets you the death sentence because she doesn't show up to the trial. Whoops, you shouldn't have \"put your barrel in crazy.\" (that's an actual quote from the game)\n\nDuring the end screen, you find out what happens to the characters:\nPanzer IV started the new NSDAP and attempted a coup, but the party got banned\nSherman eats knock-off McDonald's for the rest of her life\nT-34 governs Korea\nTiger I runs a museum in England. (Get it, because the only surviving Tiger I from the war is there HAHAHAHAHAHAA)\nThe drill sergeant becomes the drill sergeant in a rip-off Full Metal Jacket.\n\nTHE END.\n\n10/10 because you can fuck a PzKpfw IV ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\n\nSIde note: \nNow when I look at a picture of a PzKpfw IV, all I can see is a Japanese schoolgirl saying, \"Anschluss me.\" Worth the $10 bucks. \n\nOkay, this is a real side note now:\nThe ending was horrible.

Yes, the second I booted this game 2 of my friends (which were the only ones awake at the time) immediatly sent me a message relating to \"What the f***\" or \"You have a problem fam\"[/i]\n\n[u]Who is this games target audience?[/u]\n[i]Anyone who likes tanks or girls, but mostly tank lovers, This game has ALOT of tank humor and a metric $h17 Ton of puns. If you are a fan of WW2, Tanks, and Dark humor this game will leave you SPEECHLESS at some of the jokes, supremely dark humor, puns, and burns that come out of this game. Props to the Devs for doing their homework[/i]\n\n[u]Can you *ahem* \"Get down\" with the tanks?[/u]\n[i]Its implied in the game if you get close with one. Currently the dev team is working on an H-Patch for the game for all steam users, so big props to them and actually gives me a reason to support a Patreon for once[/i]\n\n[u]How good is this game/novel[/u]\n[i]This is where I struggle to give good reps to the Devs, my biggest gripe is that the game is kinda short, the 2.6 hours I put in is for 1 ending (Tiger I is best currently shippable tank, Maus is best tank overall) and its not the most satisfying thing in the world. Plus there is currently a lack of endings, so far if you do any searching on google you basically get 1 of two endings or a \"secret 3rd\" (more down below) [/i]\n\n[u]Would you reccomend I buy this game Angel-San?[/u]\n[i]If you're into Tanks and Tank humor? Get it!!! but only on sale really, like I did currently in this games state... it feels a tad... unfinished. And paying 10 dollars for a game with the worlds most unsatifsying endings makes me cringe... hard.... seriously Dev Team work on that in future patches and this game is gold for Tank and war fans.[/i]\n\n[h1]My thoughts on this game[/h1]\n\nThis game was REALLY good in many parts, and is actually a game that had me laughing almost the entire time, it also made me realize that I probably need help regarding my obsession with tanks. This is the first visual novel that actually had me more invested in the convrosations and other humor in the center of it rather than the ending. Which is quite frankly just awesome in so many ways. Ive played quite a few VNs and frankly this comes in 2nd for me just under Katawa Shoujo (a game that will likely never be toppled in the fact its so amazing and well done). \n\nThis game does have a rather cheapish vibe to it. If you're a fan of Kevin MacLeod's music you will instantly recognize just about any soundtrack in this game during the chill moments. The art is solid, but I feel it could indeed be improved upon with future updates, but the artstyle does kinda grow on you the more you play this game, just dont expect God Tier work. \n\nFinally.... DEVGRU-P if you are reading this.... do yourselves a colossal favor with the next patch and [b]ADD MORE ENDINGS!!!!!!![/b]\n\nWarning! Spoilers ahead regarding the endings! Which may or may not make or break your experience with this game!\n[spoiler]Every single tank apart from the IS-2 I believe has the same f***ing ending it sounds like. You get court marshaled and accused of desertion (when you just got sent to the wrong school), you get your A** saved by your tank lover, and then you get shipped off to war, die, and you hear about how all the tanks are living their lives happily, you also may or may not get your hand blown off by a gernade. What... the actual..... [u]F***[/u] [/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler] Now I'd beat up on this alot harder if it wasnt for the fact the humor of this game amused me so well, and the fact all the tanks seem decently well fleshed out, they're not bad as characters, they follow common tropes too. However, I feel with more work they could be so much better. Like this game could legit be an awesome dating sim/VN. The hate doesnt come from salt, its the fact that there could have been so much more to the endings. At first I though I got a neutral ending. I mean you basically 1 night stand a tank you tried to romance and everything that you did, all the touching moments before hand, essentially mean nothing.... like literally nothing, it is the most unsatisfying ending to exist in the face of VN's and [u]PLAYED SAKURAS ANGELS FOR CHRIST SAKE[/u] so all in all, if DEVGRU-P added multiple endings for the tanks or if that was just the bad ending or a neutral ending thats fine. If you're gonna give us Tankfus (waifu + tank) then at least let us live happily with our metal doom machines in the shape of anime school girls! I mean common! I get this game is supposed to be humorus but thats just lazy writing! [/spoiler]\n\nEnding rant over. Onto the final bit of this:\n\n[h1]Pro & Cons[/h1]\n\n[i]More \"+\"s or \"-\"s indicate the impact they have on a scale of 1 to 3: 1 = Important, 2 = Very Important, 3 = Detrimentally Important[/i]\n\n[u]Pros:[/u]\n+++Actually alot of fun to play tbh\n+++Devs have said they're planning to continue working on this game and add content via Non paid DLC, which opens alot of possibilities!\n++Great Humor, especially for tank fans\n++Some legit moments where if you know old slang and the sort you will go speechless at \"did she REALLY just say that?\"\n++Solid characters, nothing amazing but theres potential\n++Devs are working on an H-Patch for those who want it (You guys rock)\n+Has that little quirk to it that not many games typically do\n\n[u]Cons:[/u]\n---[b]HORRIBLE LACK OF ENDINGS AND SATISFACTION IN SAID ENDINGS[/b]\n--Game feels a tad closer to a Beta almost ready for release than a full game in a variety of areas\n-Not Particularly worth 10 dollars due to the above\n-Art could use a bit of improvement\n-Sound track budget seems to be Free.99, Kevin's music is nice, but some basic \"feel good\" music made by someone in FL could have given this more personality....\n-The game DOES NOT play nice with the Steam UI at all, cant open the interface and any requests to watch the game will get permanently stuck in the bottom right corner.\n-Seems to lack a fullscreen option (falls in line with the \"Unfinished feeling\" of this game combined with the above)\n-This game gets a bit buggy at times, at one point a bunch of text just raced by and i missed about 30 dialouge boxes for no clear reason which stopped when I clicked again.\n-Only 5 save slots :/\n-Your friends will probably never look at you the same again.\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\n\nThis game has ALOT of potential to be a great game, but right now, its a good game. And good games arent really worth a 10 dollar price tag especially when you get hit with the endings. This game is best around the 5 dollar range, and even then a full 10 bucks isnt wasted if you play through the lines and get your dose of tank humor out of it. However, if you wanted to see yourself marry a tank [spoiler]In the games current state, that aint gonna happen, wait till they add endings that support that or someone gets around to modding that in.[/spoiler] The game is really solid despite all the cons listed above and I dont regret my purchase, especially since there is promise of content patches up coming, so anyone who has this game better support the devs so we can get some more tanks, tank humor, a Maus, and better endings.\n\n\n[h1]Score:[/h1]\n\nHumor: 10/10 - Game was full off it\nFeels: 7/10 - Had its moments, especially with the Tiger I\nGameplay: 9/10 - Seemed pretty fluid and not too clunky to get into certain plot arcs\nCharacters: 7/10 - Pretty solid, could be better with future updates on personality\nArt: 6/10 - Good, not appauling, Could be improved over time\nMusic: 5/10 - Its ok \nEnding(s): 0/10 - *Repeated Facedesking* If they just added happy endings...\n\nTotal: 6.3/10, Good, but could be better.

The humour is what carries the entire story as the explore the world through the main character Lemmor's eyes. The art style is decent, with only having the main cast have a special picture for the five characters you are able to end up dating in the end. The soundtrack kept the immersion just right, nothing new, but the old military feel kept me in the military mindset. \n\nComplaints: The ending sucked. I know from reading other comments and checking that the ending is the same no matter which of the five girls you choose to end up dating. The stories feels unfinished, unpolished, and overall neglected. I do not see why the creators would spend so much time and care in doing every bit of the humour, but give such a lack luster ending. It felt like a slap in the face to have read so far and enjoyed yourself, then hit a brick wall to stop all the great time. Other than the ending being total junk, I have to say that the creators presented you with a variety of girls from beginning to end to talk with and enjoy the world even further. However I can count 11 total tanks just off the top of my head in a single playthrough that I enjoyed and would loved to have pursued further with, but only five were able to be pursued. The art work the the five that you can choose were excelent however [spoiler] I do feel that certain characters should have artwork as well. Such as the Tog tank you can choose to encounted in the hotsprings which gives a clear indication that he was getting laid.

When he shows up for his first day of \"Tank School\" he is surprised to learn that the students themselves are literal tanks who just-so happen to look exactly like Japanese schoolgirls (it makes about as much sense in context). Now Erwin must navigate the life of a Japanese high schooler all while being confused at his circumstances, but maybe he can also find love at this unusual school.\n\nIf you are reading this review, you are probably already aware of the fact that this is a parody game. Specifically, it is a parody of Japanese-style visual novels/dating simulators. Like in a visual novel, you make choices along the course of the story that dictates the player-character's relationship with the various characters in the game.\n\nBeing a parody, the main attraction here is the writing and humor. In this case, the humor is excellent. I found myself cracking up all the time playing this. The game itself contains parodies of the visual novel genre and anime in general. Many of the characters in the game are parodies of the usual anime clich\u00e9s such as the yandere, the tsundere, the otaku, and so on. Not only that, but the military theme of the game contains many references to the tanks and events of World War II, giving the game even more of a variety of jokes. In addition, the Gunnery Sergeant Heartmann character was a hilarious parody of the similarly named character from the 1987 film [i]Full Metal Jacket[/i]. The game never stops being aware of just how stupid and silly the entire concept is and, as such, never stops being funny right up until the end.\n\nThe other aspects of the game necessarily take a back seat to the humor, but it mostly works well. The sprites were well-drawn and distinctive. I also thought the music used was pretty good.\n\nHowever, my only real criticism of this would be the interface. There is an option to skip text, but no separate option to skip only text that has already been read. Plus, the skipping does not include scene transitions which means a longer wait to get where I want to go. This was frustrating when I was trying to see all of the game's content.

Very much a \"what the f*ck\" visual novel, but then honestly, I guess I have played weirder.\n\n[b]Update:[/b] Okay, right up until the ending, I was all for this game. The writers grasp on comedy, or what constitutes a good ending are non-existent. I mean, the game was certainly non-sensical to start with, but the ending comes so far out of left field\u2026 ugh. Recommendation changed.\n\n[b]Big note for new players:[/b] Make sure you do not pay attention to the names on the steam cards until you are further into the game though, as I had several character types spoiled for me by the steam trading card, Character Name - the Architype (Yandere, Tsundere, etc)\n\nOn a technical side, there are several issues that make the game feel incomplete. The music (what there is) does not loop, so if you are like me and have a child or something distracting you, you can come back and be rewarded with text with no sounds what so ever until the next scene loads. This could be something to do with the engine used (it's definitely not Ren'py, which is weird these days), as the developer has mentioned on a few posts in the tech support forum that it is limited. Which brings me to the second issue\u2026 no full screen mode. In fact, no scaling at all.\n\nThe other nitpick is the end of line cursor, which is a little bouncing bob thing\u2026 makes it look like there are extra quotation marks in the lines that should not be there, but that might just be a very weird, very specific thing that bugs me because my professional editor whacks my knuckles with a cane if I have extra punctuation in my own work.\n\nCertainly hope that the developer has moved to something a little better supported, like Ren'py, or even Unity if they are really keen\u2026 but", "timestamp_created": 1478520112, "timestamp_updated": 1478528524, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499646", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26426999": {"recommendationid": "26426999", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074982260", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 147, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497770228}, "language": "english", "review": "Didn't know I needed this until it was too late.", "timestamp_created": 1478311238, "timestamp_updated": 1478311238, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.606942", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26363271": {"recommendationid": "26363271", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081392653", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 340, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496794366}, "language": "english", "review": "Panzermadels was a hilarious if underwhelming game that failed to properly utilize the artistic talent of the illustrators from HuniePop with little replayability.

Which brings me to this next point.\n\nI've noticed that some people find the game offensive because of the above mentioned humor.  You are of course entitled to your opinion but I would like to say that not only has it been two generations since the WWII, not only do many soldiers make light of their own history and actions, but that frankly, humor is a good start to heal any lingering wound\n\nThe humor doesn't even touch upon the wars themselves.  There is reference to a war with the \"Plane Girls\" but the rest of the humor is completely harmless.  This game is as harmless as a Richard Pryer show.  Sure it might be controversial to some but in the end its just humor.\n\nSo if you like laughing, know your history and Tanks and like those Tanks to be Moe, then give this a shot.  You won't be disappointed.  If you need further incentive, you can watch TSF's Yes Yes Love Adventure Go!  playthrough where they make a single run through the game.

Well, this story.  There's no actual game here.  The choices are largely irrelevant and have no impact on the actual outcome other than who shows up where - and even then, only sometimes.  Some of the humor is pretty good, and the characters are likable enough for what is effectively a harem anime.\n\nBut this game just feels a bit lazy overall.  It has a strange theme that makes people curious, screenshots of a few of the jokes, it's enough to make some people (myself included) decide to buy it - on sale - and see what it's really like.  And it delivers, to a degree.  There are some references to the actual tanks the girls are named after.  Some of their personality traits can be assigned due to their country of origin.  But the personalities have about as much depth as a saucer of milk.  And the writing, unfortunately, contains several plot points that get immediately dropped that COULD have actually gone somewhere.  That and some things in the game really should be explained.\n\nIt's short, it's sloppy, it goes nowhere, and it ends rather abruptly.  And, while it contains a \"skip\" feature, using it will likely crash the game as it can try to forward faster than the engine can actually handle.\n\nAlso, the jokes in the screen shots?  Not actually in the game.  There are similar jokes told by other characters, but never the ones you see like that.  The world doesn't make sense - which at least your invisible protagonist self points out a few times - and the characters largely don't behave in any reasonable way.  Which is a shame, because you see hints of a good idea here and there, something that COULD be explored in depth.  Instead, they just hope you know about Kancolle and think this is similar enough to pay for.  It's not.  Sorry.  Put some more time in the writing, make decisions MATTER, give some logic and actually follow up on the plot threads you keep leaving around and there could be something unique and special here.  As it stands, this is the \"visual novel\" equivalent of Buzzfeed clickbait.  \"Top 15 tanks turned into high-school girls, you won't believe number 7!\"\n\nEdit: It occurs to me that there IS another game out there, with an equally silly theme, that shows that good writing is still possible.

This game. I'm going to start off with the founding principle of that this game doesn't take itself seriously. At the beginning of the game they have a quote that just doesn't fit.

Some of the characters I could do without, but thats just because its appealing to everyones demographic. The music is contemporary, but its not really to be noted (PUN). The music is sometimes groovy though. But the game has typos in the dialogue, but it is genuinely a hilarious game. You can definetly get different vibe from every different. I really did enjoy saying all the Russian tank dialogue with a Russian accent, the German with an angry voice that mad me spit all over my screen, and the American tanks with a hick voice at the top of my lungs. And enjoyable experience. Fair warning though, the characters like to use Japanese pronouns and the word \"desu\" a lot which actually gets slightly annoying. But overall.

[/i]\n\n[b] Summary: [/b] \nPanzermadels tries to follow in the steps of Hatoful Boyfriend, but fails in the charm and substance portion of the dating simulator genre. While the game does a great job of using sexual innuendo regarding tank warfare, it fails to create characters that are truly interesting, and makes you want to woo them. The personal connection isn't there, as inconsistencies within the characters personalities can make for an uneven experience. In addition, things are too off the wall at times, making you truly wonder exactly what the reasoning was for adding satanic rituals into a characters backstory. And when different characters you are wooing end up feeling the same due to a lack of variation in the plot, you feel like you're just playing the same story that you've played before. Sadly, Panzermadels only reinforces how well Hatoful Boyfriend was put totgether, and just doesn't do the job in keeping me interested in the characters or the plot that was unfolding. For me, it's a pass. \n\n[b]Video Review: [/b] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCXlGFG6GzQ\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]Positives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] The innuendo using tank and warfare terms is on point. Ammo ranks and Armor penetration. Well done. \n[*] The use of tropes makes it feel familiar for those who played the genre, while still putting a tiny spin on it with the tank girl elements of it.\n[*] The T34 storyline did tie in the Russian/communism element rather well. \n[*] The artwork is reasonable. Nothing too out there, it feels like a typical dating sim. \n[*] There are some touching moments within the story, and it's what I wanted to see more of in the end. It can tug on heartstrings a bit. \n[/list]\n\n[b]Negatives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] The lack of variation between the storylines of the different girls is disappointing. While you want an overarching storyline, you want some uniqueness for each of the arcs. \n[*] The heritage angles don't work very well at times. The german tank for example, it's a Japanese Otaku in disguse. And while that's not a problem in itself, it's the problem of going back and forth between the German and Japanese angles. \n[*] The ending feels like the developers ran out of money, and just threw something together. It doesn't work, as it feels like you just spent the last hour and a half doing nothing to affect your own fate.\n[*] The characters just don't have the spark behind them to really get me interested. They all don't really stand out, they feel too relaxed in the overall picture. \n[*] Look, I like off the wall shenanigans at times, but even here things really felt like a stretch. The satanic ritual portion just whiffs at being used effectively. \n[*] Sound is lacking. The overuse of the AOL instant messenger exiting sound not only got annoying, it was distracting. And with no audio sliders, you can't adjust it compared to the music.\n[*] Lack of resolution options, hell, no fullscreen option either.\n[/list]\n", "timestamp_created": 1467903648, "timestamp_updated": 1467903648, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.603857", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24149207": {"recommendationid": "24149207", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076383092", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 40, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467600268}, "language": "english", "review": "i hate this i hate my life", "timestamp_created": 1467863279, "timestamp_updated": 1467863279, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24130812": {"recommendationid": "24130812", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053866606", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 405, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480212188}, "language": "english", "review": "- Are YOU interested in tanks, warfare and a hint of history?\n\n- Have YOU ever wanted to FUCK a tank? \n\n- Are YOU a kissless virgin with no real dating experience or girlfriend?\n\n- Are YOU a lonely basement dweller with no social life and/or friends?\n\n- Do YOU disappoint your family with replica katana above your bed, your anime/manga collection covering three quarters of your room, and failing/failed schooling results? \n\n\nIf YOU answered YES (like me) or NO to the above, then buy this game.

Think Hatoful Boyfriend, but with tanks. Though, as I'll explain, the comparison to Hatoful Boyfriend is completely unearned.\n\nThe game has some very good tank puns and some good humour. I really enjoyed the first play through I did for that reason. Things really don't hold up for a second play through, and here's why\u2026\n[olist]\n[*]The scene-skipping mechanic is awful. In most VNs or dating sims you'll have some equivalent play/pause button in the screen borders. In this game you just have a menu button. If you want to start scene skipping, you have to go in through the menu both to activate and to deactivate skipping. However, this is very unresponsive, if you spot a scene you haven't already seen you generally can't slow the dialogue back down in time to read it.\n[*]For a large number of scenes, the tank girls are completely interchangeable. In total, there are maybe only three places where you'll get a choice of scene, plus an extra place if you make some of the right dialogue options. It's disappointing. Certain tank girls also have much better and funnier unique scenes than others. Combined with the poor UI for scene skipping I find this frustrating.\n[*]Most half decent dating sims / VNs will generally have hidden stats or consequences for certain options. I'm at my third play through, I've not noticed that any of the choices I've made differently have affected my ability to choose particular tanks at the end. So long as you interact with someone enough that makes them an option. \n[*]There are also plenty of 'choices' that do precisely nothing to the outcome. There are also places that jarred for me with the storytelling - one tank girl had complete amnesia about a conversation we'd had only days ago.\n[*]Because of the above combined, there's really not any replay value. Unless you're stubborn, like I am. I'm now mostly playing it on skip in the background while I do other things so that I can collect the endings. A play through in skip mode probably takes 20 minutes, a full play through is probably 40 minutes.\n[/olist]\n\nWould I recommend this game? Not really.\nIf you want cute schoolgirls combined exquisitely with tank jokes and other tank stuff, I heartily recommend you go and watch Girls Und Panzer. It's an amazing show. \nIf you want a funny or surreal VN/dating sim, I heartily recommend you give Hatoful Boyfriend a try.  It's got a good range of characters, choices that matter, and an interesting story line that takes place over a full year (rather than the best part of a week).\nIf you're after smut, well\u2026 there are probably better things, to be honest.", "timestamp_created": 1467657628, "timestamp_updated": 1467657665, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543657", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24086395": {"recommendationid": "24086395", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045339745", "num_games_owned": 483, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 153, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467616233}, "language": "english", "review": "$5 Well spent.

I mean, you're going to school with WW2 tanks, and going on dates with them?  It's brilliantly hilarious!\n\nSadly, though, that's about all the game really had going for it.  The game hints at a larger world, with other \"tanks\" that you can chat/flirt with that don't affect the main story, which is always cool to see, but it doesn't lend anything to the game itself.  Out of the 8-9 tank ladies that the game shows off, only 5 are dateable, and the only reward is a pretty picture to add to your gallery.\nSpeaking of the story, the game's plot kinda has some hit-and-miss moments.  I mean, there's plenty of funny spots (My personal favorite is when you go to the convenience store and ask the shopkeep for headlight fluid.), but the story doesn't really feel rewarding.  Heck, even with the yandere character they have, they never take the opportunity to have your character kidnapped or anything.  She's just a creepy stalker.  None of the plotlines available have any real depth, and the moments that do have depth never lead to anything relevant, or are completely disconnected from the main story.\n\nOh, and as for the ending, there's two.  One is you go into active service and die in battle, and the other is death by firing squad.  I'll let you do the math fom there.\n\nAll in all, I really WANTED this VN to be fun.  It's got a fun idea, fun characters, and some witty dialogue.  But it never does anything with the interesting idea, the fun characters never really get developed (i mean story development, not character profiling), and the dialogue is only really funny the first time you read it.   It's good for a one-time playthrough, but nothing more than that.\nHopefully, they'll make a sequel to this game that does better.", "timestamp_created": 1467578704, "timestamp_updated": 1467578704, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.576113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24038118": {"recommendationid": "24038118", "author": {"steamid": "76561198199382751", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468348691}, "language": "english", "review": "I now have a tank fetish 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1467523435, "timestamp_updated": 1467523435, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497072", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24037825": {"recommendationid": "24037825", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061261335", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 344, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467777381}, "language": "english", "review": "First playthrough, hooked up with Panzer IV.

Well, okay, much of the art is atrocious. Some parts are buggy (skipping scenes usually ends in a crash). There is virtually no story, just a lot of tank-related innuendo, anime cliches out the whazoo, a horribly-written drill instructor (seriously, he sucks), annoying music...\n\nIn retrospect, I have very few good things to say about this VN. The CGs for the sexytime scenes are where the bulk of the work really went in, apparently. So there's that.\n\nIf you keep in mind that this game is likely meant as one long joke and aren't hoping for something even relatively close to Girls und Panzer (like I was expecting), it's okay for a short romp. The routes are ridiculously easy to lock onto. No challenge.\n\nI dunno, maybe I wasted six hours of life on this. But T-34 is certainly mai waifu.

Die man nicht kauft, weil man denkt, das sie gut sind, sondern weil man wissen will wie schlecht sie sind. Zu denen man eine pseudolustige \"I swear it was a gift xddddd\"-Review schreibt, von der jeder wei\u00df, dass sie gelogen ist. Und bei denen man mit jeder weiteren Ingame-Minute sp\u00fcrt, wie man mehr und mehr zum Bodensatz der Gesellschaft degeneriert.\n\nDas Spiel an sich hat nicht viel zu bieten: Die Charakter sind so flach und klischeehaft wie nur irgend m\u00f6glich, die Story ist praktisch inexistent (das Ende ist derma\u00dfen abgehackt, als w\u00e4re den Machern mitten in der Produktion von einem Tag auf den anderen das Geld ausgegangen), Musik ist nur sporadisch vorhanden und die Grafik ist allenfalls zweckdienlich. Und wer auf hei\u00dfe Nacktbilder der Schulm\u00e4dchenpanzer gehofft hat wird auch entt\u00e4uscht. Was hat Panzermadels also zu bieten?\n\nGeschichtsreferenzen, Panzerwortspiele, eindeutig zweideutige Witze. Eine kleine Auswahl von dem, was einen im Spiel erwartet:\n- Sovjets leiten die Sch\u00fclerzeitung, die sie mit erfundenen Geschichten und anderer Propaganda f\u00fcllen (u.a. Putinwitze)\n- Der Okkultisten-Club der Schule wird von Deutschen geleitet\n- Der Lehrer ist ein amerikanischer Drill Sergeant, der auf Schulm\u00e4dchen mit gro\u00dfen Ammoracks steht\n- Judenwitze (Concentrated Orange Juice, usw...)\n- Deutsche spielen st\u00e4ndig auf den Polenfeldzug an\n- Der einzige polnische Panzer hat zwei Auftritte im Spiel, bei beiden wird sie fertig gemacht\n- \"She squeezes your hand with the force of a medium tank\"\n- Strandurlaub\n- Panzer IV ist besessen von Japan unf schafft es kaum, zwei S\u00e4tze ohne SUGOIIIIII und kawaii~ zu bilden...desu\n- Menschen, die sich Anwinkeln sollen, um Geschossen abprallen zu lassen\n- Diskussionen \u00fcber Rohrgr\u00f6\u00dfen und ob bei Penetration eher das Kaliber oder die Zielf\u00e4higkeit entscheidend ist\n\nDabei schwankt das Spiel immer wieder zwischen beil\u00e4ufigen Einw\u00fcrfen, die einen zum Schmunzeln bringen, und miserablem In-Your-Face-Humor, bei dem man sich irgendwann fragt, wie man etwas derartiges schreiben kann, ohne sich gleichzeitig vor Selbsthass erschie\u00dfen zu wollen. Man kann davon ausgehen, das System dahintersteckt, aber auch wenn man etwas mit Absicht schlecht macht wird es dadurch nicht unbedingt besser. Wenn man die Witze versteht und sich nicht zu schade ist, auch mal \u00fcber Flachwitze zu lachen, kann das durchaus unterhaltsam sein, ansonsten ist es der pure Cringe Marathon.\n\nFazit: Ich hatte meinen Spa\u00df mit dem Spiel, obwohl ich mir dabei vorkam wie der Abfall der Menschheit.", "timestamp_created": 1467221107, "timestamp_updated": 1511450894, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 48, "votes_funny": 44, "weighted_vote_score": "0.832383", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23927524": {"recommendationid": "23927524", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974605895", "num_games_owned": 543, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467447669}, "language": "german", "review": "Ich hab mich k\u00f6stlich am\u00fcsiert.", "timestamp_created": 1467213994, "timestamp_updated": 1467447859, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496809", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23914834": {"recommendationid": "23914834", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069605974", "num_games_owned": 407, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467175537}, "language": "english", "review": "I think I helped start world war III", "timestamp_created": 1467175644, "timestamp_updated": 1467175644, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500148", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23912572": {"recommendationid": "23912572", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981483581", "num_games_owned": 261, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479881375}, "language": "english", "review": "I was hopeing that Maus was a loli due to her name. but make sense that she is oppai.\nbut panzer IV is my new waifu!\n\nlife is complete 100/10\n\ncant wait for their korea date sim!", "timestamp_created": 1467167804, "timestamp_updated": 1467167804, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499921", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23910745": {"recommendationid": "23910745", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046625569", "num_games_owned": 192, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 377, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469745392}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros:\n-Cute\n-Accurate embodyment of each tank into a person\n-Lots of refferences and jokes\n\nCons:\n-Ending seems rushed / not related to events shown/said\n-not enough choices\n-choices do not seem to matter in some cercomstances\n-not enough dateable tanks (about 4/5 I only beat a game once so there might be more)\n-story doesen't branch enough\n-Should have been longer (3 hours long)\n \nExtra notes:\nThe choices in the story is like a fork in the road that leads you back to the same main road after a while.\n\nAfter a certian point the game seems to rush itself towards the end after 3/4s through just as you actualy go an a REAL date and when you finaly get wiith the girl the game's ending is around the corner.\n\nI don't think any of the \"screenshots\" above are real \"Think\".\n\nThank you for reading my review!", "timestamp_created": 1467161927, "timestamp_updated": 1467161927, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500881", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23909308": {"recommendationid": "23909308", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042645221", "num_games_owned": 237, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468916504}, "language": "english", "review": "I am not going to lie I am still unsure on what I played.

However, the way these tropes were tied into the tank framework was very interesting and made the game light hearted, and very enjoyable. The game contained numerous references to variety of subject matter, but mostly to WW2 and tanks in general. Many of these references were quite funny. \n\nOverall, Panzermadels was a blast to go through the first time and contained a lot of choices which made it feel engaging. Subsequent readings definitely feel lacking as the game doesn't change very much depending on your choices, and some choices appear to have no impact at all and were used to create an amusing moment. The characters were well written and it made me want to see more of some of the secondary characters to see how they would turn out. The biggest downside to this game is that the ending is quite bizarre and I felt didn't live up to the rest of the game. At the end, I was definitely a bit dissatisfied. I'm not sure if I'll go back for further read throughs yet as my first two were extremely similar, even though on my second time through I chose a character I ignored on the first.

I guess it's always nice to start with all the lovely things you can say first, and then move on to the problems.\n\nFirst and foremost, I do really do love this game's idea. It's cute, and silly, and very interesting. The idea that there's a school in Akihabara filled with girls who are also famous tanks throughout time? It's definitely odd, but it quickly becomes endearing. And the backgrounds of all the different tankgirls, and the things they talk about are great sources for tangential learning. I did quite a bit of wiki spelunking on this one. Before this game, I did not know New Zealand's first homegrown 'tank' design, or what 'tovarich' means. Those are just small examples.\n\nThe art, and most of the writing, are cute and snappy, helping to immerse you in a very weird world, but also in making it feel (somehow) quite real.  It does not quite manage this quite as well as NekoPara, or Highschool Romance, but considering the massive amount of suspension of disbelief required, it's still quite amazing how well they make you believe. Some of the human characters do more to derail this universe than the tankgirls do...\n\nUnfortunately, the game is plagued by a few issues. Two of them objective, and one of them very subjective. Objectively, the game has several bad grammar - or pheraps, writing - errors that can impede understanding. A few times I thought I'd missed a line in a conversation. This came up more often near the end. Second, the game is apparently not bug free. During one of my playthroughs, I lavished all my attention on the IS-2, and somehow, the end of the game had me with the T-34. While semi amusing, I can't figure out exactly what went wrong there. (A lack of guides or information for this game doesn't help in that regard. Maybe it IS functioning as intended, but I have no way to verify that.)\n\nFinally, the ending of the game. Ending, singular. Which tankgirl you decide to date has no apparent bearing on said ending; which may have been meant to be darkly comic, but instead, falls completely flat. Instead, it seems to take a cute, silly game, and move things into way too serious and depressing a direction. It was quite a shocking 180 for the game, and I played several times just to be sure this unfortunate ending was there every time.\n\nIn summation, I'm not sorry I spent the money on it, as I do love the premise. Rather, I feel the game needs more polish, and a much better ending. If you're a hardcore fan of wacky games, or dating sims, Panzermadels is worth a look, particularly on sale.

If you want to play a game with a decent story to have a good laugh, this is the game for you. Otherwise if anything from the cons turns you away I wouldn't recommend purchasing this at full price. Otherwise the artwork was pretty good for what it offered and was a fun experiance.\n\n7/10 - Too little CG\nThough Steam doesn't allow for a neutral standpoint, I have to down thumbs this.", "timestamp_created": 1465177334, "timestamp_updated": 1465177432, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497943", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23388034": {"recommendationid": "23388034", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021274331", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 277, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471199603}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 Best game ever.\n\nIn all seriousness tho, If you know a little bit about WW2 era tanks you will definately get some laughs out of this title.", "timestamp_created": 1465075056, "timestamp_updated": 1465075056, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.579647", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23385064": {"recommendationid": "23385064", "author": {"steamid": "76561198240016812", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 303, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465064080}, "language": "english", "review": "THIS GAME IS A PIECE OF SHIT.

Yes. Very much yes. Penetrate some armor and enjoy a very 'internet'-style humor. If you aren't a tank buff, you might learn a thing or two. Just don't expect a very fufilling (or good) ending.\n\nSpoiler-free review\nSo, bought this game after eyeing it for its absurdity and strange nature. Came into a bit of expendable money, so I grabbed it. I laughed the whole way through and enjoyed it more than I thought I would, lost track of time and had a great time with all the humor, which can be very dark at times (I will describe one of the times that sprung to mind in the spoilerific review below). I was taken by the charm it had, even if it wasn't perfect in execution which I was willing to overlook when they came up. The problem I had was the same as many of the other reviews; the ending. It took me out of the experience and just killed the steam I had, at least at the time of writing this... I may likely pick it back up to see what other options it has to offer.\n\nThis part of the review will involve the spoilers. Proceed at your own risk.\nWhen I started the game, I had never played a dating sim because they never really interested me, but as anyone that looks at my library will see, I love the little oddballs when I can find or get them. The first half hour, I was mostly trying to figure out the details of what everything was about. The rest of the time, I was rather pleased to fall into the jokes and the charm I spoke of earlier - You're sent to check on the German tanks by the VP to make sure they're not summoning the elder gods again. Which is precicely what they were up to, and the entire scene made me grin like an idiot. You suggest they take up a bake sale, which you regret near instantly.. WW2 era tanks and ovens apparently don't mix well. That entire scene was one of my favorite of all the humor because of how it unfolded; they needed money for a class trip and their first thought was to dive head first into the occult, summon the elder gods for money or weapons which led into holocaust jokes. A bit of the charm I spoke of earlier that just endeared itself to me. All is great even after the hot springs (Where I somehow ended up spending the night with a super tank).\n\nNow, again, I loved the gameplay and was able to forgive the oversights for what the game was. As I've said before, the end completely took the steam out of my sails with the abrupt and honestly... Compeltely lazy way it was handled. I get that it's supposed to lampoon the dating genre and maybe I'm missing some vital element here since i've never played any other dating sim but... What the hell happened? All of the charm, all of the humor... All of it was tossed in the trash bin the moment you get your tank girl. Suddenly, you're drug to a kangaroo court where, for some reason Heartmann is your lawyer and its his first case. The judge decides you're guilty from the moment you step into the room, but the girl you romanced comes to your defense (Or not at all, in IS-2's case). The whole thing of going AWOL is... Slightly hinted at in the very beginning but it's dropped when Heartmann cuts you off from talking to the school's admin. Even if you manage to beat the AWOL charges, you still get slammed with fornicating with a military vehicle which Heartmann publicly denounces and pretty much signs your guilty verdict there. The entire game, he's been the biggest pervert regarding the tanks and he was the butt of many a joke regarding this, even giving you tank porn at one point (Showing it's sold, publically... Wouldn't it be punishable to even own these things if it was something you can get court marshalled over...?)\n\nI mean I'm probably overthinking a game like this, but again, I really enjoyed the humor and charm it supplied til the sudden end... And it disappointed hard there. I mean if it built up to it, had some more flavor than \"Oh shit, we need to end this game somehow...\", I would be much happier about it. Again, I'm probably missing some vital part of this puzzle here in the parody of the dating sim type game, but I don't even care if it was a happy ending. You spend the entirety of the game laughing and getting to like these characters to have it all... Dustbinned to end the game in an almost copy-and-paste ending where all you have done amounts to virtually nothing.\n\n\n?/10 Would likely lay a tank to waste in bed again and stop Panzer from summoning Cthulu again.", "timestamp_created": 1461222015, "timestamp_updated": 1461222128, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22544079": {"recommendationid": "22544079", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102220923", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 397, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475917757}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought this game, prepared for a run of the mill dating sim, what I got instead was a lot of laughs over the characters and the jokes. 1,000,000/NEIN.

Also there seems to be at least 5 choices that don't have any effect and the Tiger 1 line has a paradox (I guess thats what you call it) where the same thing you had the option to ask about earlier comes back into the conversation like it was never talked about before.\n\nHonestly this game is very fun and if they were to fix some flaws and extend the story by another hour or two this would be a great game.

It was really fun/funny. I am a bit of a history nerd so i really appreciated all the technical details about the tanks that were actually true that were spun into jokes....very weird and creative. also, the cold war stereotypes / wwii stereotypes that were spun into jokes was great as well. A few critical notes---- for ten bux, its entirely wayyyy too short. This should cost half that. Even though i enjoyed it and am very happy it even exists i feel like i got ripped off a bit. $5 for this would have been right on point. Nextly, if you don't know alot about wwii/ the cold war, you are going to miss out on a HUGE amount of humor in this game. for sure the strongest aspect of this game are the technical references and historical references, which are true and factual, woven into a reality they were never meant to be in...that IS the prevailing joke...so if you don't know, for example, that certain german tanks had transmission issues, you are missing out on a joke....and there are hundreds of these style jokes in here. Lastly, the trbunal ending thing was a cheap way out to a very abrupt and unresolved ending. TERRIBLE ending. So the main portion of the game was really fun/funny and well researched, game is too short for $10, and the end was  abrupt and terrible.

(or you're just shot if no girl comes to help you.) the fact that there's almost no difference with any of the endings is what really upset me and got me to stop playing the game, otherwise, if there were unique endings, i gladly would've played it again for any of the girls.\n\n[h1]recommendations to the devs:[/h1]\n\n- change the ending. the ending sucks. i'm sentenced to death for making sweet glorious love to that steely posterior, and i don't get to live the rest of my life with my tankwife? not a good ending. give the girls separate endings along with cgs at the end, and i'll replay it for every single character released.  (or at least have yandere tank come in and defend me instead of abandoning my ass last minute)\n- make a cg gallery option, so i can go back and view glorious tank ass again without replaying the route entirely and so i can remember which routes i played and which i haven't.\n- options menu where i can control text speed, music on/off, skip previously viewed text, etc, etc. there are some awkward moments  where there's no music whatsoever and i feel like playing my own music, but then it suddenly cuts back in. \n- (optional) trading cards and wallpaper for our steam profile to display waifus. emoticons are nice too. who knows when i need to express my emotions through a picture of i-20?\n\n[h1]finale:[/h1]\n\ndo i recommend the game? hell yeah i do. ride that glorious tank ass to destiny, my friends. but there's still room for improvement and i think it could be upped with patches, definitely. the game's not for everyone and you have to have a thick skin to laugh at some of the jokes based on war tragedy but it's about as bad as, say, a female-based version of hetalia, so, y'know. if you're okay with it with hot guys, hot girls isn't much different.",

But when he arrives, Erwin realizes it's not Tank School, but \"Tank School\" for World War II Tanks. Who happen to look just like Japanese School Girls...! \nInstead of studying military history and doctrine, he's in \"Basic Artillery Computations for Fire Support 101\", and \"Radio Operations 214\". Will he win the heart of the tank-girls, or end up as cannon fodder? Only you can decide in, \"Panzermadels: Tank Dating Simulator\".\nPanzermadels is made by 'DEVGRU-P' a small team of American developers in the style of a traditional Japanese Visual Novel. Unabashedly goofy, the game takes every trope you know from visual novels, and puts a distinctly Tank-Related twist on them! With six different romance plot-lines and a multiple of endings based on your choices, Panzermadels will keep you entertained for a number of playthroughs!\n\nMy opinion :\n\nPanzer Models: Tank Simulator Dating're not a court or play long it lasted a very good life about two three hours a really catchy story of the beginning I felt like a mix between girl und Panzer and kancolle that and really nice .They Are I think a lot of character over games we meet more and more like the maus, JS-2 I, Char B1 really appreciated the model of character especially that of Tiger 1 , m4 sherman and Char B1 there are also a lot of interesting or funny moment as when aprend is that it is the blitzkrieg or even any kind of place otherwise the game and really beautiful there is no problem if finally a screen capture sound imposible and plien screenshot either way but it does not prevent to play .A big strong point of the game music remix music Panzerlied that I was r'appel was used by divion panzer during the Second World War and State Anthem of the Soviet Union in great gg music are just perfect\n\nPanzer IV : is your average teenage tank, she likes sweets, pop music, and Anschlussing Eastern European nations. She does well in school and her favorite subject is History. She secretly loves Polka music, but doesn't tell the other Panzermadels. She has an older cousin, Tiger I, and they're the best of friends!\n\nTiger I : is the richest tank in school, but she's also shy and breaks down a lot of she works too hard. She doesn't do as well in school, but always tries her best. When she isn't in class, she likes shopping for new armored skirts, and other accessories. She loves her younger cousin, Panzer IV with all her heart!\n\nT-34 : is the shortest tank in school. Sometimes she can act tough to make up for it, but deep down she loves her friends. Her favorite food is Borscht Soup, and has every CD from the Soviet Army Choir. She has a cousin, IS-2, but they don't talk much.\n\nIS-2 : doesn't hang out with the other tanks, and is very shy. She's the newest tank at the school and writes home to her uncle, or spends time alone in the library when she's not in class\n\nM4 Sherman : comes from America and is the most active of all the tanks. She can't stand sitting in class, and would rather be outside on the firing line listening to classic rock while training. She's a bit of a tomboy, and is late for class almost every day, to the annoyance of Sergeant Heartmann.\n\nGunnery Sergeant : Heartmann is the home room teacher for the tanks. He can be very strict with all of them, and butts heads with M4 Sherman almost every day over her coming to class late or not wearing her uniform properly. His favorite film of all time is \"Full Metal Overcoat\"\n\nTh\u00e8me :\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vb5GH6K8pY\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPuEVeUaJTk\n\nConclusion :\nfor a game was 9 euro and a lifespan as long (2 hours) I find its not abused the model of the music perssonage are very well done I have no na dir a very good story rassenblant more style more there is very little visual novel style Modial second war", "timestamp_created": 1457915071, "timestamp_updated": 1457915429, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 36, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.577645", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21825817": {"recommendationid": "21825817", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981890354", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457912033}, "language": "finnish", "review": "Super Heavy Tank Fornication: Check.\nHitler jokes: Check.\nCyka: Check.\n\n6/5", "timestamp_created": 1457912460, "timestamp_updated": 1457912460, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21823342": {"recommendationid": "21823342", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103199685", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 905, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494116760}, "language": "english", "review": "I heard about this game on the podqisition podcast thanks to the lovely Laura K.  I must say that I do enjoy the overall theme of the game and the tank innuendo is a nice touch.  The only real issues I have with the game are all in the user interface.\n\nPros: \n-nice humor\n-tanks all have flaws based on the tank models they were designed after\n-reasonably priced for the content you get\n\ncons:\n-to scroll through the text you need to click the mouse button.  To the best of my knowledge this cant be rebound.  My personal preferance is to either use the mouse wheel or the down button and the constant need to click is annoying to me (though I know that is just personal taste)\n\n-I haven't found a way to go back in a conversation.  In most games like this you can press either the up button or spin the mouse wheel up to read past parts of a conversation.  I personally like this feature encase i missed part of a joke.\n\n-As far as I can tell there is no full screen mode.  (again personal preference)\n\n_lastly there is no option to change text speed.  The current speed is ok but I find that I tend to read faster than the scrolling allows.  This can be remedied with a double click of the mouse but it simply feels like an extra step.\n\nAll in all it is a nice game that I feel just needs so minor tweaks that can be remedied with a better options screen.

It doesn't get much weirder than that. And this weirdness is the game's selling pont, as well as its biggest strength. And the game delivered this strength very very well and in the most memorable way possible.\n\nThe game is not without its flaw, however. The main premise doesn't make a whole lot of sense and would probably irritate serious readers (that somehow pick up a story about dating personified tanks and try to make some senses out of it). There are technical issues like s bug in a conversation. There are also no option for full screen (not a problem for me) or mute (which I find a little problematic, as I normally play VN with the sounds off) and there are only 5 save slots, which aren't nearly enough. And the ending is very abrupt and confusing and doesn't reflect enough the player's choice. The first time I reached it, I thought that I had hit some wrong conversation options somewhere and locked myself int a bad end. No, that's just the ending...\n\nBut still, despite all the flaws I have mentioned, the good far outshines the bad. The writing of this game is pure, comedic gold and the jokes are top notched, especially if you have some knowledge on WWII and history in general. The tank girls are adorable and manage to reflect the quirks of the tanks they represent very, very well (though I'm a little disappointed that they focus more on Tiger I's mechanical problems than legendary prowess, but, well, they aren't wrong). There are a lot of choices in the conversation which, why doesn't affect the story much, give the player the satisfying illusion of control, as well as open up to many different jokes and make the flow of conversations seem natural.

Meanwhile, the T34 has great sloped armour and wide tracks for effective traverse in rough terrain, but lacks the more sophisticated equipment and reliability of the Pz.IV. Of course, choosing the legendary Tiger I might be tempting with it's great 88mm and thick front armour, but you have to be mindful of it's unreliable engine.\n\nI have to admit though, that the selection of tanks could, and should have been greater. There are several other NPC tanks that you will meet through the game, like the Maus and the B1, but unfortunately you don't get to drive them.

The game didn\u2019t stop surprising me and the scenarios I encountered kept me laughing for a while.\nArt style is pretty good considering it's an indie game \u2013 Most indie VN\u2019s I have played have had a more rougher art style but this game has pretty nice art and an abundance of backdrops keeping the game fresh.\n\u201cAmmo Racks, Armored Plating and Amphibious attachments\u201d \u2013 The game is completely riddled with Innuendos and most of the times I could not help but facepalm and laugh at what I was reading. \n\nNegatives\n\nSpelling errors \u2013 At the beginning there were a few spelling errors but nothing that major. \nOnly 5 save slots \u2013 This limits you to how many saves you can have. This can be a minor for most who love to save often.\nstory crossing \u2013 This may be wrong but t34 give me number on hill then next day in class she had to give me her number again apparently and was reluctant about it.\nLack of audio options and customisation \u2013 There are no real settings in options like audio sliders or font text. \n\n\nOverall, I had a lot of fun with this game. Mostly due to the innuendos and randomness that the game is. It made me laugh quite often and I could easily recommend it to gamers who are looking for a game which is a bit more extraordinaire and bizarre. The price is a tad high but if you feel it\u2019s not that much of a dent on your wallet then go for it. \n\nThe only qualm I have with this game is that sometimes I felt like my choices were not really remembered at all. I did have a fun time though and again, this was a real funny game.\n", "timestamp_created": 1457631795, "timestamp_updated": 1457631795, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.664626", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21750497": {"recommendationid": "21750497", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083214326", "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 382, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457642617}, "language": "english", "review": "The Humor is excellent, thought often taken from other sources, ie black adder's trail from the blackadder goes forth, and poland cannot into space, etc\n\nthe drawn girls could do with higher quality images, and more variations of the standard poses than they currently have.\n\nits a fun little game that take a bit less than 2 hours to run through, but definitely has replayability", "timestamp_created": 1457629805, "timestamp_updated": 1457629805, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.598690", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21748985": {"recommendationid": "21748985", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036316241", "num_games_owned": 558, "num_reviews": 304, "playtime_forever": 245, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481329384}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ud310\uc800\ub9c8\ub378\uc2a4 : \ud0f1\ud06c \ub370\uc774\ud305 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\ud130\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\uc6b0\ub9ac \uc8fc\ubcc0\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9ce\uc774 \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \ubd84\ub4e4\uc778 \uc77c\ubcf8 \uc560\ub2c8\uba54\uc774\uc158 \ub208\uae54\uad34\ubb3c \uc5ec\uce90\uc758 \uc774\ub984\uc744 \ub2c9\ub124\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \uc4f0\uace0 \uacc4\uc2dc\uac70\ub098 \uadf8 \uc5ec\uce90 \uc5bc\uad74\uc744 \ud504\ub85c\ud544 \uc0ac\uc9c4\uc73c\ub85c \uc4f0\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \ubd84\ub4e4\uc758 \uc9c0\uac11\uc744 \ud138\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc804\uc7c1\ubcd1\uae30\uc778 \uc804\ucc28\ub4e4\uc744 \ub208\uae54\uad34\ubb3c \ubc0f \uc790\ubcf8\uc8fc\uc758\uac00 \ub0b3\uc740 \uad34\ubb3c\ub85c \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc5b4\ubc84\ub9b0 \uac8c\uc784\uc774\uba70 T-34, 4\ud638 \uc804\ucc28, \uc154\uba3c , \ud0c0\uc774\uac70 - 1, 3\uc2dd \uce58\ub204\ub77c\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ub418\ub294 \uc5ec\uce90\ub4e4\uc744 \uacf5\ub7b5\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uc758 \uacf5\uaca9\uc774 \ub3c4\ud0c4\ub418\uba74\uc11c \ub05d\ub098\ub294 \uac8c\uc784\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\uc57d 60\uc5ec\ub144 \uc804\uc5d0 \uc791\uc740\ud560\uc544\ubc84\uc9c0\uac00 T-34\uc758 \uacf5\ub7b5\uc5d0 \uc2e4\ud328\ud574\uc11c \uae54\ub9ac\uc168\ub358 \uac83\uacfc\ub294 \ub2ec\ub9ac \uc800\ub294 \ubc18\ub300\ub85c T-34\uc758 \uacf5\ub7b5\uc5d0 \uc131\uacf5\ud574\uc11c \uadf8 \uc704\uc5d0 \uc62c\ub77c\ud0c0\uac8c \ub428\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc624\ub79c \uc138\uc6d4\uc5d0 \uac78\uce5c \ubcf5\uc218\ub97c \ud574\ub0b4\uc5c8\ub294\ub370 \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0\ub294 T-34 \ubfd0\ub9cc\uc774 \uc544\ub2cc \uc5ec\ub7ec \uad6d\uc801\uc758 \uc804\ucc28\uac00 \ub098\uc624\ubbc0\ub85c \ube44\uc2b7\ud55c \ucc38\uc804\uc6a9\uc0ac\uc758 \ud608\uc5f0\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uac00\uc9c4 \ud55c\uad6d\uc778\uacfc \ubbf8\uad6d\uc778, \uc77c\ubcf8\uc778\uc774\ub098 \ub3c5\uc77c\uc778 \ubc0f \ub7ec\uc2dc\uc544\uc778\uc5d0\uac8c \ubaa8\ub450 \uc5b4\ud544\ud560\uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc94\uc138\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \uac8c\uc784\uc774\uae30\uc5d0 \ucd94\ucc9c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\uace0 \ud310\ub2e8\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "timestamp_created": 1457624576, "timestamp_updated": 1457625591, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 141, "weighted_vote_score": "0.577912", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21748763": {"recommendationid": "21748763", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059444908", "num_games_owned": 302, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3665, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 184, "last_played": 1515965347}, "language": "english", "review": "'Is that an armour piercing sabot in you pocket?

It's quite silly and shouldn't be taken seriously. There seems to be inspiration from Kancolle and Girls und Panzer as well, with the mention of tankery. I think this game is an in between for me, I like it but I feel there is a lot to be worked on or just plain missing. The options menu is pretty lacking, only featuring an option to hide the message or skip. I would have liked to see a text speed option. A severe lack of music, a lot of the game didn't even have a soundtrack in the background, only some parts of the game did. Not that great of writing, seeing the characters start their sentences multiple times with \"haha,\" was just kind of weird. While that is something you see in text conversations, it's not really something that belongs when characters are talking face to face. There is also no gallery where you can view the CG's after you get them, which I feel is a big feature of VN's and it's not good that it isn't there. Personally I was expecting something a bit more in depth. Perhaps that is my own fault, but after playing other VN's that are silly, such as Hatoful Boyfriend, I feel that this VN is lacking and needed a bit more work. For what it is I also feel that the price is a bit much. $5 would be more reasonable for this game.\n\nAll in all, the game is silly and has plenty of history jokes, but it lacks in actual depth and never seems to tred beyond its silliness into something that is actually enjoyable and not boring after a while. I was actually excited for this when I heard of it. I love tanks and anything WW2 related but I also enjoy VN's. So to be a bit disappointed by it is a bit of a shame.

Have you ever been inside a tank?\"\n\nOnly this game can turn this question into a sexual innuendo.\n\n9/10\n\nEDIT:\n\nO.K. Actual Review.\n\nOverall, this game was a real surpise for me, since I expected a pretty shitty ensemble of anime tropes mixed in with only subtle hints of tanks. But the devs, DEVGRU-P, actually made an impressive amount of work into this game, considering their Kickstarter made $4000, and their Patreon is getting about $260 a month for the game. Now, I don't know how much it takes to make a video game, but this seems like a small amount considering the quality of the game so far.\n\nGOOD:\n\nThe Artwork is very reminiscent of a certain God-tier Visual Novel, Katawa Shoujo, which I loved very much, and because of that I consider this a very great part of the game. \n\nHumor in the game is great. If any of you check out the game's community forum, you can get a sneak peak of the dev's humor. The humor is a combination of historic events that took place during WW2, and a bit afterwords and stuff, with refences from popular war movies, Like Full Metal Jacket and the like, and humor pointed more towards tank buffs who know a good bit about tanks and how each one worked during the war.\n\nMultiple routes. Many Visual Novels have multiple routes; it's a staple of the genre. Now of days, the average is 3-4, with maybe a cameo romance route added in. The game has 5. And the devs said they're adding more. FOR FREE.\n\nA potato could run it. I know, \"It's a Visual Novel, why the hell wouldn't you be able to run it?!\" Well, it's just always good to hear of games that run well on a variety of hardware, especially at launch.\n\nPerverted S@#t. Yeah, its a Visual Novel, it's also a staple to have a bit of perversion in some of them. That's great, but do a lot of Visual Novel devs go about releasing the H-Version patch for anybody who bought the game on steam to use? Not really, but these devs are. Usually you'd have to find a patch on the internet, and hope to God it works, but the devs are making it simple. Kudos for doing that.\n\nBAD:\n\nCurrently I havent figured out how to get fullscreen to work. No biggy, I play these games in windowed mode anyways, but not having fullscreen is kind of a big deal in todays game market. Im assuming this should be an easy thing to do, so I'm not mad about that.\n\nMusic cuts out, or isnt noticeable. The music is alright, it has songs from somewhat notable artists like Kevin Macleod and such, so thats good since the songs included are good. But I feel like the music either cuts out, or just isn't noticeable when I felt like it should have been needed. No big deal, again, but music is important, it adds ambience to the game, and provides some immersion. I still dont know if music not being included in some parts is on purpose, or if I just dont have good hearing, so whatever.\n\nEach Route is short. The 5 characters routes each take about 2 hours, and thats assuming if you dont skip. Which, I'll talk about later. If you do skip, the characters actually unique parts are about an hour? So yeah, kind of short, but 10 hours of gameplay for $10 is OK in my books. \n\nEnding is confusing. So apparently, the endings for almost each character is the same. Thats fine, as long as the parts in between are unique, right? Well, the ending just confused the complete shit out of me. Either figure out the ending yourself, or watch a walkthrough, and you might see what I mean.\n\nUGLY:\n\nSkipping is messed up. Visual Novels usually have the ability to skip parts that you've experience before, for the people who just want to experience the unique parts of every characters route. Right now, skipping makes dialouge go by fast, and a little bit later it'll stop the skip at the players choice part. The bad thing is, after you make your choice, THE GAME CONTINUES SKIPPING DIALOUGE. I don't know if maybe I just messed up skipping or something, but this is really bad. I missed bits of dialouge because of this, and its annoying. The only way to make it so dialouge isnt skipped after making a choice is to bring up the menu before choosing, and closing it, THEN making your choice. So yeah, thats messed up? I'm just used to it stopping the skip function after you make your choice, and you can choose to skip portions of the game that youve experience before already. \n\nNo ability to bring up steam overlay, or take screenshots. This is another that I can't figure out. I'm guessing because there is no fullscreen, steam overlay isn't allowed, and so because of that you cant tak steam screenshots? Some people must of figured it out, since they've uploaded pictures, but I still dont know.\n\nNo ability to view pictures from the game. Usually Visual Novels allow you to view the important pictures that you've experienced from a completed route (This usually includes the H-scenes, and other lewd scenes, which most people use this function for, but it can also include the background art and extra stuff.) so you dont have to remember to screenshot whenever you want to keep a scene or for when you forget something, or just for your viewing pleasure. This is also important, AND THIS IS A WELL BIG THING. Without this, Players will either have to replay an entire route, and try the skip mechanic in order to view pictures or scenes, OR will have to scan the internet in order to find a favorite scene or pic. This is just a big problem that I can't forgive, because I need to be able to keep photos for later, for science of course.\n\nOVERALL: 9/10 for the actual game, 7/10 for the game including its features and mechanics. \n\nMost of the problems associated with the game are either bugs, developer oversights (I hope), or is something somewhat negligible. I usually grade games by their value in terms of how much fun I had with them, and this game I had fun with. Your first playthrough will be great because you won't have to deal with skip mechanics and shit, but your next few will be annoying if you want to skip the non-unique parts of the game. Overall, give the game a chance if you enjoy Visual Novels, because this is a truly original game that had the balls to make fun of an internet meme enough to make a game parodying it.", "timestamp_created": 1457564302, "timestamp_updated": 1457644149, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 507, "votes_funny": 941, "weighted_vote_score": "0.881026", "comment_count": "12", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21737374": {"recommendationid": "21737374", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981469040", "num_games_owned": 5470, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497242026}, "language": "english", "review": "Unfortunately, I identify as an attack helicopter.", "timestamp_created": 1457563738, "timestamp_updated": 1457563738, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 654, "votes_funny": 1826, "weighted_vote_score": "0.790140", "comment_count": "41", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21737051": {"recommendationid": "21737051", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060936814", "num_games_owned": 229, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457562099}, "language": "english", "review": "what", "timestamp_created": 1457562159, "timestamp_updated": 1457562159, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 366, "votes_funny": 535, "weighted_vote_score": "0.704408", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21736898": {"recommendationid": "21736898", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014022120", "num_games_owned": 209, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 339, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459531095}, "language": "english", "review": "That this game even exists deserves a thumb up!", "timestamp_created": 1457561561, "timestamp_updated": 1457561561, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 269, "votes_funny": 209, "weighted_vote_score": "0.662919", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39590464": {"recommendationid": "39590464", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121215752", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 359, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 359, "last_played": 1516840838}, "language": "english", "review": "This is not a game, it's an experience.

1514258651}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of those games that belongs in a category I'd classify as \"The one huge exception\" because, for the most part, I've never cared for shmups. Too many of them have an extremely tiny margin of error allowed before you get a game over, especially if you wanna go for the SUPER SECRET FINAL BOSS kinda stuff, and the communities are generally full of people who make fun of you for playing on the easier difficulties, so that puts me off even more. REVOLVER360 RE:ACTOR is an entirely different story.\n\nThis game, on top of having different firing types, a regenerating method of destroying bullets, and a health system that lets you take a number of hits, it also has the most unique mechanic I've ever seen in a shmup, and that's camera rotation. You'd think camera rotation would be the last thing to mention in a game, but this actually makes it the center of the game's concept, where turning the camera is closer to turning a dial to adjust the playing field to your preference, because the bullets exist on a 3D plane, while you exist on a 2D plane.\n\nThis means that, on top of being able to tank a couple hits, you're also able to just turn the camera when there's a screen-wide attack, and just go around it. And the camera rotation doesn't end its usefulness there. There are enemies and items to shoot in the background to clear your path, give you health and laser items, and even just increase your score. This game gives you so many great options for keeping yourself in the game, while tying it into a mechanic that you have to master, so even if it makes the experience as a whole easier, it's still a challenge in itself.\n\nEven if you don't care for shmups, I'd still reccommend this game, because it's really just that good, and there's a chance you'll find something to love here.

music. This game has some serious good music (i am not even into this genre but still dig it!) and has no OST as DLC... that is rare. Production values are very good. The rotating camera is really well done but it does have one flaw that even though the bullets fly in a 3D environment where you can line up the shots the hitboxes are still in 2D so even if the part of the line of bullets would be in the background they will still hit u when u fly over them which is ok but for the line lasers it does get a bit problematic at times to dodge them. Still very recommended for bullet hell shmuppers alike.

These mechanics provide both ways to deal with threats and challenges to increase your score dramatically. The difficulty can be rough for someplayers, but the game is short enough (1-2 hrs) where a challenged player just might be able to beat it. The value comes in seeking alternate paths and increasing your score, though this won't be enough \"Dollar Per Hour\" for many people. The color choice may be a bit harsh for some people, but will be tolerable for many people. [/h1]\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n- Great Soundtrack, included in the game files\n-Unique rotation mechanic, allowing the player to dodge otherwise unavoidable bullet patterns, elimnate background threats, and find secrets\n- Laser weapon that destroys enemy Yellow bullets and rows of enemies, but has limited shots, drops your multiplier, and has a cooldown to reload\n- EMP shot to destroy blue bullets/lasers and purple bullets which are even more limited than the laser, but also has a reload cooldown\n- Same EMP Cooldown Meter governs the use of Overdrive mode, if full, which allows temporarily unlimited lasers and maximum score multiplier and can be used relatively frequently per level\n- Relatively forgiving health system, allowing you to take many hits compared to most Bullet Hells, and inculdes health pick ups, and limited regen\n- Ways to deal with difficult bullet patterns\n- Stable 60fps+ gameplay\n- Great port - includes support for XInput and DirectInput - I switch the input mode on my controller AND THE GAME RESTARTED ITSELF SO I DIDN'T HAVE TO\n- Helpful how to play page that explains the game numerous mechanics and strategies\n- Global leaderboard which includes player replays - allowing players to learn how others played\n- Lovely graphics that clearly distinguish threats\n-Short. Only 4 stages, meaning it can be completed quickly for somebody wanting to get through their backlog or learn the game easily to run for a better score\n- Sector mode - allowing a player to practice a specific level\n- Challenge mode - 50 Extra levels that are very challenging and further explain combat and score mechanics\n- Inexpensive\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n- One life, zero continues - If you die, you have to start the whole game over\n- Nearly impossible to avoid damage? While most well-crafted bullet hell games are built so that a trained player can take no damage, it seems like you will almost inevitably take damage at some point. Even the #1 ranked player took damage.\n- Relatively difficult despite forgiving health system - I've lost runs many times on Sector 2, but eventually I beat it and the rest of the game on the next run.\n- Potentially overwhelming gameplay. While you're dealing with an onslaught of enemies, bullets, and lasers, you will sometimes have to deal with background damage dealers if you're not paying attention and rotating the world frequently\n- Rotation mechanic may be seen as an annoying gimmick to some players\n- Possibly too complex gameplay for some players - Enemy Survival, along with multiple weapon cooldowns\n- Stylized UI can get lost lost in the game's art style and hectic gameplay.\n- High Price per hour - $10 will seem expensive to somebody only playing to beat the game which can take less than an hour or two. (dependent on player skill - a single run takes less than half an hour)\n- Bright, color burn effect may be harsh on the eyes of some players \n\n\nGameplay takes place on a 2D-plane like most shooters. Shooting not only shoots standard bullets, but shoots homing missiles to the 3D background within a short range of your ship - requiring you to \"hover\" over enemies, environmental threats, and supply boxes to destroy them, or over parts of a boss to deal extra damage. Rotating the ship (or rather, rotating the game world) with the trigger buttons alows the player to more easily dodge some project tiles and deal with background threats or supply boxes that can provide health, weapon restore, or multipliers. You will need to balance this mechanic, along with the weapons I described in the \"Pros\" section to succeed. I was very concerned I wouldn't be able to beat this game because of a tough portion on Sector 2, but I got past it and found it was short work, meaning that memorizing enemy patterns might be a lass daunting task compared to shooters 2 or three times as long.\n\n[b]REVOLVER360 RE:ACTOR will drive away or annoy some players with it's art style and \"brain metling\" use of rotation and bright colors, but it is a delightul shmup that will certainly entertain and endear many others. I heartily recommend this for shmup fans and it is certainly worth a wishlist/sale for those that play shumps infrequently.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1489448458, "timestamp_updated": 1489783083,

The revolver mechanic really makes the background a massive factor in the game. However, all of the enemies bullets are two dimensional. It's really hard to explain but think of it this way, you see off in the distance an enemy that is shooting a laser out, it looks like it's there to block your path but even though its far off in the background, if you move your ship in front of the laser, you will get hit by it. It can be really disorienting at times.\n\nSecond, the ship is boring, you have 3 weapons, your standard shot that shoots directly infront of you, a laser that shoots right in front of you, and an EMP that shoots right in front of you(or clears all bullets on screen if you let it charge) Lasers turn yellow bullets into points, EMP turns anything into Points. But since you can't shoot anywhere but in front of you, you can't hit anything above or behind you. This wouldn't such a problem as long as things didn't attack from behind or above, but they do, a lot. It's just angering since there is almost nothing you can do about those enemies. What would be so wrong with having multiple weapons that shoot somewhere besides infront of you? Oh yes and inorder to hit background enemies you have to get close to them in order to shoot them, so if that thing shoots you from way back in the background it will hit you instantly and you'll be \"too close\" to dodge.\n\nThird, the arching paths is really a non factor, there is almost no difference between the different paths, I'm not sure why they included it. Do you want the tunnel full of enemies, or the other tunnel full of enemies, it makes almost no difference.\n\nThe Graphics are very good for an indie title and the music is great, and the game comes with the sound track. It's well polished and has no bugs as far as I can see, it's not great but it's not bad either and the price they are asking is completely reasonable.

I played for 4/5 hours and I have already got half and more of the achievements, completed the story mode and won half the challenges (which can be really challenging, however).\nThe final level and boss are almost a joke, since the level has half the lenght of the first one, and the boss is really easy to beat, even if it's not being compared to other bosses as the second level one, which I find to be the more entertaining and difficult.\nGraphics are really nice, and go along with the game.\n\nI loved the game, but I feel like I need more to play with. More levels, sometimes more bullets, and a thougher final boss would make this a 9 or 10.\nAlso, I buyed it on discount, but the full price seems a little too much for the product given.\n\n[EDIT for the steam awards: I think It should win something because its graphical awesomeness and its entertainment value!]", "timestamp_created": 1473037880, "timestamp_updated": 1480052641, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25354623": {"recommendationid": "25354623", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977148190", "num_games_owned": 201, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 522, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461030888}, "language": "english", "review": "Best Schmup I played in years.", "timestamp_created": 1473026357, "timestamp_updated": 1473026357, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.463710", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25301935": {"recommendationid": "25301935", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150729811", "num_games_owned": 195, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 28, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470572974}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u76ee\u304c\u75b2\u308c\u307e\u3059\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1472811559, "timestamp_updated": 1472811559, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.423144", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25299014": {"recommendationid": "25299014", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047017199", "num_games_owned": 519, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 89, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498488822}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc7a0\uae50 \ud55c\ubc88 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud558\ub294 \ub0b4\ub0b4 \uac10\ud0c4 \ud568.\n3D\ub85c \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \ud574\ubcf4\uace0\uc2f6\ub2e4.", "timestamp_created": 1472792711, "timestamp_updated": 1472792711, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25195127": {"recommendationid": "25195127", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961127720", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 224, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472422688}, "language": "english", "review": "Quite a solid game.

THIS GAME IS AWESOME!\nREVOLVER360 RE:ACTOR is a shoot'em up game; but it has a very interesting difference from other games in this genre: you can rotate the enviroment!\nFor example, you can use this ability to line up several rows of enemies and destroy them at once or to avoid screen filling attacks. This ability also made the game a lot challenging since the enemies and some goodies are placed around the enviroment. In addition to this ability, you have access to a straight laser attack which can eliminate enemies and some projectiles, and an overdrive move which removes every projectile from the screen.\nThere are three modes to play in this game. I recommend completing the challenges before playing through Reactor mode to learn the basics.\n\nPositive Points:\n- The enviroment rotation mechanic is very innovative and has made the game unique\n- Multiple paths in stages\n- Nice difficulty (The game is hard at first. But when you get used to the mechanics it becomes easier.)\n- Nice visuals and soundtracks (Soundtracks are bundled with the game.)\n\nNegative Points:\n- TOO MUCH BLUE COLOUR!\n\nNotes:\n- The game can freeze on launch due to one reason: downloading scoreboards.

One of the great things about this game is that it is very approachable for all skill levels.  In fact, I actually cleared this game (there are no continues, so every clear is a 1cc), which is a first for me as I have never cleared a shmup without using a continue (terrible thing to have to admit, I know).  It only took a few practice runs of the 2nd and 3rd stages, and a couple replays that I watched from the leaderboards to achieve this too.  However, there is alot more difficulty and depth in the scoring, plus numerous challenges to satisfy you after you have gotten that first clear.  In addition, each stage has multiple routes, some of which require conditions to unlock, so the stages have alot of replayability.  My favorite way to play this game is just practice one stage, experimenting with different routes and rotating in different areas to shift bullets for better scoring, or to find more items or destructible objects.\n\nFrom the video and screenshots you can see that the graphics are very unique and original, and quite good too.  The first time you play this game, make sure you try the challenges first.  The beginning ones are what actually teach you to play the game.  \n\nThe rotating mechanic is also very original.

To summarise, Revolver 360 is a 2.5D STG taking place in 4 stages, with branching paths and bosses at the end of each level. The player shoots enemies and objects coming from all directions in a 3D plane whilst moving within a rotatable cylindrical playing field. Bullets can be rotated-around and cancelled through abilities which use up constantly-recharging resources. The scoring system is based around cancelling bullets and enemy chaining (although the chaining is not nearly as strict as games like Dodonpachi, which is notorious for its perfection-demanding enemy chaining). There are also 50 short challenge levels which test the player's knowledge of the different game mechanics, as well as their memorisation.\n\nAs someone who usually plays STGs for survival and tends not to care about getting high scores, the scoring system in Revolver 360 is so addictive that it has gotten me hooked and trying to improve my scores regularly in spite of my preferences for survival play.\n\nThe scoring system is based around two multipliers: a first multiplier which is based on chaining enemy destruction, it is capped at X16, although this limit can temporarily be broken through using overdrive mode; the second multiplier is a count of how many bullets you have cancelled. Bullets are cancelled through destroying enemies as they are firing lasers, using your ship's own lasers, or using the emp shot (a powerful charge shot which breaks through blue beams which lasers cannot cancel) and overdrive, which cancels all bullets on screen once activated. Larger enemies fire more bullets at lower health, so the player has to be careful to leave them on as little health as possible to cancel as many bullets as possible. The effect this has on the gameplay is that it encourages players to be constantly taking risks, as it requires them to rotate clouds of bullets directly towards them to cancel them out with a well-timed/positioned laser cancel. The nature of the first multiplier encourages players to mix up their main shot (which works as you would expect from a basic STG shot type) and their laser for the most optimal chaining. This combined with the fact that there are many routes to take throughout the meticulously-crafted and gorgeous levels (there are even secret routes!) means that there is a ton of player freedom and replay value.", "timestamp_created": 1439469393, "timestamp_updated": 1439469393, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.578058", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17488190": {"recommendationid": "17488190", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026592203", "num_games_owned": 592, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1441255236}, "language": "english", "review": "An unique and quite challenging shmup with a twist.

Picture a bullet hell shooter drenched in futuristic neon blue which fully rotates at the press of a button, existing in three dimensions as you fly sideways through waves of enemies while trying to keep up with the madness on screen.\n\nThe number of systems and mechanics at work at any given time in Revolver is in itself intimidating, which when paired with its genre-typical difficulty level and the added intensity of a third dimension, can feel like borderline excess for the sake of it. But Revolver pulls it all off because underneath the inscrutable exterior there\u2019s a very deep, developed formula at work, all focused around an elaborate shooting and scoring system that is only as invasive as you want it to be.\n\nDifferent types of shots affect different enemies, various meters are raised by particular stimuli, and multiple paths through levels create even more room for experimentation. Revolver fully commits itself to being as complex and unique as possible within the capabilities of its systems, and while this means it\u2019s likely the least accessible shoot\u2019em\u2019up I\u2019ve played in a very long time, its desire to nurture and expand the boundaries of advanced play feels like a justified trade off.\n\nRevolver expresses this best in its challenge mode, which features 50 quick, extremely focused missions which give you a specific task to complete in a short period of time. To me these felt less like fun bonuses to the main game, but rather a comprehensive tutorial detailing the minutia of Revolver\u2019s intricate mechanics and how best to use them. This is accomplished through the challenges themselves, and also the contextual hint system which drip feeds you information in a way that is much easier to parse given you can immediately apply it to an appropriate situation.\n\nReturning to Revolver\u2019s main stages after completing a number of these, I was surprised just how much more I understood about the game I had already beaten once, and how significantly more capable that had made me where simply reading a manual and playing the game had not. I also began to appreciate all the little things I hadn\u2019t even noticed before, like the finer points of the scoring system or how to best utilize the rotation feature to line up enemies, which further solidified in me the idea that Revolver had fully thought through each of its mechanics and the interplay that develops between them. The more I was able to understand the more I enjoyed playing, and it made me wish that other games would be as thorough in their initiations.\n\nBut even if you aren\u2019t interested in getting deep into Revolver\u2019s metagame it\u2019s still a fascinating beast of a bullet hell shooter to play around with. Rotating your ship is an ingenious hook that somehow never manages to feel clumsy or obscure important information (an even more impressive task when put up against Revolver\u2019s brainmelting cyberpunk visual style). \n\nIt\u2019s a \u201ccool\u201d that didn\u2019t need explaining; a \u201ccool\u201d which leaked out of the screen like a kettle getting ready to blow its top and told me that I better get ready. And then the game started and all pretenses of restraint evaporated as Revolver boldly declared that it wasn\u2019t going to settle for being just enough shoot\u2019em\u2019up and neither should you.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW_Tr5E-yts\n[b]You can read more of my writing on [url=http://kritiqal.com/2015/06/15/revolver360-reactor-review/]Kritiqal[/url].[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1434388109, "timestamp_updated": 1434388109, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 47, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.804306", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16391593": {"recommendationid": "16391593", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015745796", "num_games_owned": 455, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1434562222}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing unconventional bullet hell experience in which you rotate the world and enemies around you, so you can line up enemies, objects and bullets in front of you.

This lets you turn a screen full of bullets into a single line and then use a laser to blast the bullets apart for points. It sounds like a gimmick but it's a lot of fun and provides a really interesting challenge and a one of the most fun and unique scoring systems I've seen.\n\nThe rotation mechanic is also important because you auto-kill items and enemies that are in the background, which you can only see/target if you are rotated a certain way.

I've gotten to rank 32 in the leaderboards so I feel like I've gotten a good understanding of the mechanics. \n\nYou have 3 types of shot. Normal, Laser, and I guess you could call it destroy. Normal rips up enemies but gives little score, laser shoots through enemies and builds score by giving a chain kill bonus, and destroy shoots through enemy blue/purp attacks and also leaves anything it hits near death. Normal shot is the only one that can hit enemies in the background which shares a different chain bonus from laser. You have limited laser shot that regens. Destroy uses meter that is shared with the overdrive power which when activated rapidly regens your laser as well as buffing your shot damage. \n\nYou can also rotate the map left and right to line up enemies for destroy/laser combos or to avoid shots that would normally hit. It is also crucial to rotate to be able to attack background objects that will give score. \n\nThere are background chests that hold powerups. You don't build up your shot like most STGs from powerups in this one. Instead they hold health, laser reload, or overdrive reload. They spawn the same powerup in the same location everytime so for score its important to know when you should be using your laser/destroy/overload abilities so that you don't waste any powerups. \n\nIt's quite a bit of fun once you get into the mechanics. There is also a challenge mode which helps you understand how to build score and utilitze the mechanics the best. Only minor problem I have is that this game is fairly short and the final boss at least in my opinion was somewhat lackluster. But this is an indie STG which has really amazing mechanics so I can't get too hard on it. \n\nThe brightness (and afaik the lack of ability to turn it down) is another minor problem but you get used to it.\n\ntl;dr if you like ikaruga and can deal with the fact that this is an indie game and thus doesn't have as much production values or as tuned boss fights as some other STGs then you'll be in for a treat.", "timestamp_created": 1420230397, "timestamp_updated": 1420230397, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13766549": {"recommendationid": "13766549", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009067077", "num_games_owned": 728, "num_reviews": 97, "playtime_forever": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1420143367}, "language": "english", "review": "First Impression:  As a casual SHUMPer and sucker for Japanese Indie games, this game is near the top of my import list.  \n \n+Good Music\n+Great graphics that don't confuse me when playing\n+It's fully translated in English (Rare for Japanese Indies)\n+Great controller binding with explanations and demonstrations of mechanics on the same page.\n+Spot-on handling\n+Full manual for explaining all the entertwined mechanics.\n\n-Limited (but growing) list of resolutions (Common with Japanese Imports)\n\nR360R:A has really beaten me up and I am terrible at it, but it can't be blamed on the game.

Get it.\n\nLong version: I'm so happy there are more and more Japanese games appearing on Steam. Sure, some of them are shitty dating sims but there are lots of gems still not released on the platform. Playism has been delivering (and translating, I believe) Japanese indie games for a while now through their site. Some of them make their way to Steam and they're always very well ported: there are always proper resolution config, control options and such. Revolver360 looks great, supports up to 4K resolutions (16:10 option is hidden under F10 key but that's a minor thing) and of course runs at 60FPS.\n\nRevolver360 has been praised in shmup circles and rightfully so. It's a great take on the genre with 2D plane you can rotate to avoid bullets or find secrets in the background - see the trailer, it explains the basics pretty well. The game's as hardcore as you can get which is the main draw for me. This wouldn't matter if the mechanics weren't fun, of course, but they surely are. I only wish the game would use more colors as it's blue on blue for the most part but that's a design decision and who am I to teach the devs. The tutorial is hidden somewhat in the challenge mode, be sure to try that before trying to clear the main mode.", "timestamp_created": 1414396662, "timestamp_updated": 1414396662, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.473356", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12651091": {"recommendationid": "12651091", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107557878", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512442842}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is gorgeous. It is gorgeous in its gameplay and most definitely in its graphics. \n\nI have a mediocre laptop, so I'm surprised I could run such a detailed and vibrant game.\n\nYou're a small futuristic ship I guess, and you have the standard attacks you'd find in any side-scrolling bullet hell (well, not THAT many bullets, but still) shooter, like a normal dual laser shot, a bigger laser, an EMP, and a freakin' Overdrive that I still don't understand what it does b/c I didn't bother to read the manual (it's in the main menu after you finish configuring, choosing a name, and achieving the first achievement just for buying the game, sweet!). \n\nbasically they let you change bullets into points and increase your multiplier so you can have like billions of points OH BOY\n\nThe rotation mechanism is very interesting. What you see on your screen is not always the whole picture. There's enemies in the background, as well as ZOMG HUGE ASTEROIDS AND SPACE JUNK (and other crates that can help your ship but those aren't too frequent). So, how do you destroy these things if you can't see them at present? You rotate thorugh your 360 degree field of view, of course! That way, even though you're looking at your ship and the approaching enemies from the side, you can also blast background objects and enemies away, whether they're above or below you! It's a fascinating concept that really sets this game apart and makes it that much more enjoyable. \n\nYou really should get this game if you enjoy a challenge. It is a challenge, honestly.

On level three things get shaken up a bit which is welcomed at that point.

A must buy if you love shmups.", "timestamp_created": 1414253641, "timestamp_updated": 1414253641, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535415", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12627356": {"recommendationid": "12627356", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993661434", "num_games_owned": 4112, "num_reviews": 102, "playtime_forever": 130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468775205}, "language": "english", "review": "Fast, blue, stylish and clean. Ikaruga's wilder, more futuristic cousin I think. That's a good place to start when discussing RE:ACTOR. From Cross Eaglet, this bullet hell shmup takes a simple premise and adds a unique mechanic, instead of polarity, you're dealing with rotation. The field of play can be rotated along a 360 degree axis around your ship. In effect, you're flying through a \"cylinder\" as opposed to a flat playfield as is often the case, with enemies swirling all around you, and the landscape forming a three dimensional tube that often branches and splits, with numerous junctions appearing that will allow you to choose your route (this offers -immense- replayability as you high score hunt or figure out new routes through various stages). \n\nAs you rotate the field of view, the bullets also rotate, so a near impossible field to navigate suddenly becomes a flat line that's easy to dodge, and all of a sudden the game forces you to think in three dimensions, with objects often coming at you from \"depth\" as well as from the top, sides, front and back. It would be a bit easy to lose track were it not for the utterly gorgeous aesthetic which keeps things simple and easy to keep track of. Everything is presented in a washed out, futuristic neon blue, clean lines and clear presentation keep the game running at a flawless 60fps no matter what you're doing, with everything maxed out on my rig the game looks nothing short of artistic (Oh god please let there be an occulus rift option down the line).\n\nAs is the norm for such japanese bullet hell games, the music is energetic, electronic and upbeat, it maintains a strong pace and a good sense of place, but isn't exactly going to reach the heady heights that Ikaruga managed (but then nothing is ever going to manage the soundscape of Ikaruga, let's be fair). It's good enough though, as is the sound effects, which do the job with satisfying explosions and gun noises, everything sounds correct, which is really all that needs to be said. You don't buy these games for the sound, but it's good to see that Cross Eaglet got everything lined up and the sound presentation is clearly up to spec.\n\nWhat makes this game stand out is the rotational mechanic, which is nothing short of inspired, it imposes a learning curve, and with an Xbox or PS pad, you'll be wise to map it to the shoulder buttons, but after half an hour of getting used to it, you'll be swooping back and forth like a pro, and the game opens up, once you make it past the opening stage, you'll then find junctions everywhere, and you'll be able to navigate through a gorgeous cityscape. \n\nIt's hard, as any good bullet hell should be, but it's worth every second of your attention, offering visual and gameplay delights as you duck and weave your way through a constant barrage of firepower. Each boss makes full use of the rotation mechanic too, forcing you to quickly improvise and adjust to the constant incoming flak that they toss your way, and within a few goes, rotating will be second nature, you may even look at other bullet hells and feel a little... lacking... when you try to change perspective and find you can't.\n\nAt this price, it's an absolute steal as well, for what you are paying for, you're getting one of the best experiences since Ikaruga, if you're a fan of the shmup genre, this is an easy sell, if you're new to the genre, getting this and Ikaruga should be high on your priority list.

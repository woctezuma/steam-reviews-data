It\u2019s available on Windows via Steam for $2.99, without Steam achievements or trading cards.\n\nI was a bit hesitant on taking up The Leisure of Grisaia, having not played the original game and full well knowing how I might not be able to get everything out of it due to that. However with the low-ish price and short length, I decided to dive right in. After all, I needed something to go with my morning coffee.\n\nFew moments of goofiness\n\nLike said before, the kinetic novel takes place along the common route of the original game, and it just throws the reader right in without any introduction of the characters. This clearly implies that it\u2019s all about something that is aimed for the fans of the series, and while it\u2019s possible to get some enjoyment out of the used game jokes and references, it goes without saying that actually knowing the characters and their backgrounds beforehand would be required. But writing from the point of someone who is not familiar with the series, I did not consider my time with The Leisure of Grisaia wasted.\n\nListening though the content takes about an hour, and reading it yourself would cut the time down to 30 minutes or so. Considering the price of $2.99 it\u2019s a little on the higher side, but then again I could easily list a bunch of things that would be worse way to spend an hour or $2.99 for. For a fan of the series the title could easily be recommended as a way to pass little time, but for someone who doesn\u2019t know the cast, it might really be a hit or miss situation. Then again, you can easily complete the whole content and get a refund if you didn\u2019t like it, so it\u2019s not like there is anything to lose \u2013 barring one hour of your life.\n\nThe translation is not completely riddled with errors and typos, but there are enough of those to actually take a notice on them. Occasionally the writing also sounds a bit too literal, too the point of being even a tad awkward, but I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s as bad as some people were fearing it to be. It\u2019s also quite possible that these issues will be fixed with a patch in the future, making it a bit better.\n\nVisually the game is exactly the same as The Fruit of Grisaia to a tee, so with prior experience you\u2019ll be right at home, and even without you\u2019ll be greeted with high quality backgrounds and character sprites. Music is not spectacular by any means, but that and the sound effect do their job just fine.\n\nIn conclusion\n\nThe Leisure of Grisaia is a very short and as such leaning a little to the expensive side, but if you liked the original game, and have no better way to spend three bucks, it might be worth it for few giggles. Without previous knowledge of the game one might want to wait for an upcoming sale somewhere in the future and grab it for half the price, seeing how there are no trading cards to make some of the cost back in the first place. Few noticeable issues with the translation do stick out, but otherwise the game works well as a means to pass an hour of time.", "timestamp_created": 1475833802, "timestamp_updated": 1475833802, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514378", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25886771": {"recommendationid": "25886771", "author": {"steamid": "76561198257037861", "num_games_owned": 2232, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 176, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475898889}, "language": "schinese", "review": "[h1]\u3010\u4e3a\u4e86\u65e5\u5446\u3011[/h1]\n\n\u3000\u3000\u7279\u4ef7\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u4e70\u7684\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65e5\u5446\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u5543\u4e0d\u52a8\u82f1\u6587\u4e5f\u8fd8\u662f\u4e60\u60ef\u6027\u7684\u4e70\u6765\u505a\u6536\u85cf\u4e86\u3002\u4f46\u662f\u2026\u2026\u8fd9\u5267\u60c5\u771f\u7684\u662f\u592a\u77ed\u4e86\u2026\u2026\u8fd9\u79cd\u611f\u89c9\u5c31\u597d\u50cf\u4f60\u770b\u5b8c\u4e86\u4e00\u90e8\u8fde\u8f7d\u4e86\u597d\u51e0\u767e\u5377\u7684\u957f\u7bc7\u6f2b\u753b\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u542c\u8bf4\u5b83\u8fd8\u6709\u5916\u4f20\u3002\u5174\u51b2\u51b2\u7684\u627e\u6765\u4e00\u770b\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u4e00\u9875\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u56db\u683c\u6f2b\u753b\uff01\u6211\u7684\u5fc3\u554a\uff0c\u4f24\u5f97\u7a00\u788e\u5440\u2026\u2026\u4e00\u5171\u53ea\u67096\u5f20CG\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u9009\u9879\u548c\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u6210\u5c31\u3002\u4f46\u662f\u6709\u5361\u7247\u6389\u843d\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e5f\u5f88\u7ec6\u81f4\u548c\u9f50\u5168\uff0c\u771f\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u6709\u4ec0\u4e48\u7528\u2026\u2026", "timestamp_created": 1475769261, "timestamp_updated": 1487077004, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501450", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25853362": {"recommendationid": "25853362", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118120782", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 71, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475584358}, "language": "english", "review": "I need more yuri Sachi x Michiru scene...", "timestamp_created": 1475584821, "timestamp_updated": 1475584821, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25848534": {"recommendationid": "25848534", "author": {"steamid": "76561198207664197", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 195, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476279280}, "language": "schinese", "review": "hfghjtdtyzuixdcgvisdr", "timestamp_created": 1475551259, "timestamp_updated": 1475551259, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483198", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25772859": {"recommendationid": "25772859", "author": {"steamid": "76561198173019786", "num_games_owned": 359, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 200, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475190706}, "language": "russian", "review": "nya nya kawaii                                \n\n=\uff3e\u25cf \u22cf \u25cf\uff3e=", "timestamp_created": 1475187077, "timestamp_updated": 1475187077, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.439414", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25714149": {"recommendationid": "25714149", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086433891", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475306176}, "language": "english", "review": "good game nice graph and story funny\nall still funny xD\nfor otaku and VN lover\nnot wasting your money too if buy this\nand need more Grisaia~", "timestamp_created": 1474914751, "timestamp_updated": 1474914751, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497942", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25515495": {"recommendationid": "25515495", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095569766", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473964871}, "language": "english", "review": "VN.

This honestly seems ideal, as The Fruit of Grisaia costing \u00a330, and taking me around 80 hours to complete (unrated version) is quite the commitment for people unsure about purchasing the game. \n\nIf you've played other games in the Grisaia franchise, you will find a short hour, featuring: \n\n[list]\n[*] One new ingame soundtrack, not featured in the first game, that I cannot seem to find anywhere online (perhaps featured in later games, I'm unsure at the current time)\n[*] A different title screen soundtrack, atleast to that of the first game (which used The Final Fractal, instrumental ver.)\n[*] Two new CGs\n[*] Four new SD-CGs (Super-Deformed) [strike]pseudo-CGs (Those chibi things)[/strike]\n[*] Some really crude masturbation jokes\n[*] And generally our girls being our girls, happy and free\n[/list]\n\nOverall, the game was definitely worth the \u00a32 for anyone considering the Grisaia series, and for anyone who enjoyed playing the main series. It features no spoilers to the main game, other than perhaps a sneak peak into some of the characters personalities, so the introductions in Fruit could be slightly less impressive (or in my opinion, more impressive, because \"Awh yis it's those dank grills from the game I jus played\")", "timestamp_created": 1470017946, "timestamp_updated": 1470338048, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24466949": {"recommendationid": "24466949", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053944105", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469220144}, "language": "english", "review": "-Finished in about 30 minutes or so.

That kind of every day life would only happen if you've given your soul to the devil to which, I would gladly give to... *wink**wink*\n\n[h1]Sound and Music[/h1]\nThe Sound and Music department doesn't fall short to what Grisaia is trying to offer us. Listening to it while I take a short break because of the sweetness I'm feeling. Which will drain me lifeless If I don't take a short break for about five minutes. Anyway, the Sound and Music was nice even though the game is short. Nothing else to add here anymore...\n\n[b][i]In the end FRONTWING doesn't fail to amaze us in delivering very concrete, lovable, and enjoyable cast of characters to our virtual moniters (reality is such a b*tch am I right?) and I really respect them for that. Hoping to what they do next would great as well... Here's a list of Pros and Cons.[/i][/b]\n\n[h1]PROS[/h1]\n[b]+Characters are the same as before. Really enjoyable.[/b]\n[b]+Music was nice to listen to.[/b]\n[b]+SMEX JOKES ARE ALWAYS OKAY IN MY BOOK![/b]\n[b]+It's cheap man, what are you even doing!!![/b]\n[b]+That PLOT, man...[/b]\n\n[h1]CONS[/h1]\n[b]-The game is so short, you can even finish it in 30 minutes.[/b]\n[b]-Lack of Yuuji.[/b]\n[b]-The game ends abruptly like that.[/b]\n[b]-Depression cosumes you after finishing it.[/b]\n\n[i]\"I myself reach for the vast sky thinking that the endless stars above, would reach out and grant my sweetful wish\"[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1468669178, "timestamp_updated": 1468830056, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.975124", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24309857": {"recommendationid": "24309857", "author": {"steamid": "76561198181840279", "num_games_owned": 120, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 213, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468497518}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0412 \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u043c. \u041d\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043b\u043b\u0430 \u0431\u0443\u043a\u0432\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u0447\u0430\u0441 \u0432\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0430\u044f \u043f\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0430\u0434\u0446\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0442\u0438\u0442\u0440\u044b.\n\u041d\u0443, \u043f\u043e-\u0441\u0443\u0442\u0438, \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043b\u043b\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0442 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438\u0445 79 \u0440\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0439.\n\u041a \u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0436\u0435, \u043e\u043a\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0443 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b \u043a\u043e\u043b\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0430\u043c\u0438, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0445 \u0432 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435 \u043f\u044f\u0442\u044c \u0448\u0442\u0443\u043a (\u0412\u044b\u043f\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 3 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0438).\nAll girl's The Best :3 ( Asako Forever :3 )\n\u0426\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0430 ^_^\n\u0421\u0430\u0447\u0438: \u041a\u043e\u043c\u0431\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0439 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430, \u043a \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0443 \u043f\u043b\u044f\u0436 \u0438 \u0432\u043e\u043b\u043b\u0435\u0439\u0431\u043e\u043b, \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u043b\u044f\u0436\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0432\u043e\u043b\u043b\u0435\u0439\u0431\u043e\u043b. \u042d\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0440\u043d\u043e \u0432\u0435\u0434\u044c. :3", "timestamp_created": 1468479173, "timestamp_updated": 1468479173, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540070", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24306093": {"recommendationid": "24306093", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018731781", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 87, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468457020}, "language": "english", "review": "I love these girls.

Do not read on if you want to downvote this review simply because I downvoted the game. \n\nBought and played this mainly due to the price of the main game \"The Fruit of Grisaia\" and thought this tiny thing would get me excited for the main game. The Leisure of Grisaia is a very short visual novel without decisions, and therefore, no multiple endings, which gives you roughly 60 minutes of content. Being an additional chapter to the base game, the 2,99 proved to be very painful for me. In relation to the main game this is still cheap, but hey, man, please, it could have been a bit longer. The story centres on the free time of the main characters from the base game and their quest to create a new sport. All in all, the idea is decent and the jokes are fun sometimes, however, they can become a bit tiring since there're so many and the humour seemed forced to me at certain points. You can expect a hot closet scene and a lot of dildo references - no idea if this is the case in the base game as well.\n\nIn a nutshell, I decided not to refund this because I wanted to support the developers. I'm not sure if that was a good decision in the end, but I've got this now. I'ma buy the main game on sale, but the Leisure of Grisaia has definitely not got me excited for the main game. \n\nSadly, the value for the fans isn't enough to give this a thumbs up in my opinion.

The characters are given no introduction here as you're expected to have either read the original visual novel, or watched the anime, which is what this was originally bundled with in Japan.\n\nThat said, if you have read the original visual novel and enjoyed the comedy, this is something you'll enjoy reading.  The Leisure of Grisaia is a short (about an hour) side story centered around Michiru, Sachi and Makina, with Michiru being the focus character.  Amane and Yumiko both make appearances, though their roles are minor here, and Yuuji is only mentioned in passing a couple of times without making an appearance.\n\nAs for the cons, well it would have been nice if Yuuji had made even a brief appearance, or even if we had gotten a line or two explaining his rather conspicuous absence (Makina's behavior makes it pretty clear this takes place after his arrival at the academy).  Also, while I do think Leisure is worth the money, it would have been nice to get maybe another hour of content, although that might just be me being greedy.\n\nIn conclusion, if you're a fan of Grisaia's humor, this is an hour of good laughs, as the humor picks up pretty much right off the bat, and watching the girls go off on tangents just never seems to get old.

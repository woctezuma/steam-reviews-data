for a total of 21 minutes (so far) i have come to my conclusion that the game is very perplexing in the way that it demonstrates the fact that animals will soon learn to drive and then take over the world in a fashionable mannor, with extremly good graphics along with a smooth (ish) 1000 fps. the tracks in the game are very highly detailed down to the fish's fovea in the underwater level, and thats the least detailed thing ive found so far; the most detailed thing ive seen was most certianlly the checkered mat at the beginning of the circuit, you could see right down to the quarks inside the protons and neutrons. the characters that you can pick from must of had thousands of hours put into detailing them because you cannot see any traces of it being an animated character, they look like a real animal. this game also has by far the most innovative audio equiped with full 7.1 surround sound. all in all this game is worth its money but with the technologically it presents it should be priced around the area of a AAA game title upon release. this concludes my review of Wild Animal Racing, i rate this game with a 10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1514262053, "timestamp_updated":

When you lift her skirt you realize something is very wrong: she has a penis, she is a trap. This is unexplored territory, it is archetypal chaos, the explorer genes of your ancestors kick in, and your synapses are overcharged. You have half a second to decide what's happening, and you choose the natural option: you have sexual intercourse with her, you commit yourself and live happily in all your days. And all of this is 100% heterosexual. Now you are asking: how can it be heterosexual for a man to have a relationship with a so-called trap? That's what I'm going to tell you now. To begin with, a trap has been a man, and knows exactly what men like and what they want. Therefore, they do all they can to achieve this feminine ideal, and are in many ways more feminine than so-called real women. They submit and they cook the food, for example. Modern women have rejected all of this here to be \"free\". Something like this has not been done by traps, there are no feminist traps. The only traps available are those that meet the female ideal, otherwise they do not follow the definition of a trap. Thus, the traps are the only perfect women, as they have never been corrupted by ideas such as \"women's liberation,\" because they have never been the target audience for such ideas. Before feminism came, there were no traps because they were not needed. Now that women are no longer what men want, people are needed, so traps come into the picture. It is simple capitalism, if there is demand for ideal women, then traps will come as imitating ideal women to fill that demand. Even if they are only imitations, they are better than nothing. Would you rather have a copy of a gucci bag or a broken bag? Clearly you want the gucci bag, it looks much better and it works properly. The word trap is a bit misleading. It refers to the fact that things are not always as they seem, and that just because it looks like a woman, it's not a woman. This is obviously fake, because being a woman is so much more than just having a womb. If you meet all the criteria except having a womb, are you not really more of a woman than someone who only has a womb but does not meet the other criteria? I think that's the case, and all other opinions are motivated either by envy from men who do not have their own traps or envy from women who hate that traps are still what women used to be. To finish, traps are not gay, and they are in fact better than \"real\" women.", "timestamp_created": 1511635481, "timestamp_updated": 1511635481, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.610135", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37563042": {"recommendationid": "37563042", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009170435", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511633183}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc815\ub9d0 \uc774\uac8c\uc784\uc740 \uc81c\uac00 \uc5ec\ud0dc\uaecf\ud55c \uac8c\uc784\uc911\uc5d0 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc758\ubbf8\uc788\uace0 \ub9ce\uc740\uac83\uc744 \uae68\ub2eb\uac8c\ud574\uc8fc\ub294 \uc544\uc8fc \ub775\uc791\uac8c\uc784\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4 \uac00\uaca9\ub3c4 \uc544\uc8fc \uc2f8\ub2c8 \uc0ac\ub294\uac83\uc744 \ucd94\ucc9c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4", "timestamp_created": 1511633263, "timestamp_updated": 1511633263, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37552122": {"recommendationid": "37552122", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045417682", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511627936}, "language": "english", "review": "y game loud? :(", "timestamp_created": 1511628336, "timestamp_updated": 1511628336, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37463054": {"recommendationid": "37463054", "author": {"steamid": "76561198371241734", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 33, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505171455}, "language": "english", "review": "Truly one of the most profound tales of this generation, delving into topics such as drugs and warfare with care, yet not afraid to criticize society's way of discussing these themes and how unrealistic media portrays them.

package of plain M&Ms, I make it my duty to continue the strength and robustness of the candy as a species. To this end, I hold M&M duels. Taking two candies between my thumb and forefinger, I apply pressure, squeezing them together until one of them cracks and splinters. That is the \u201closer,\u201d and I eat the inferior one immediately. The winner gets to go another round. I have found that, in general, the brown and red M&Ms are tougher, and the newer blue ones are genetically inferior. I have hypothesized that the blue M&Ms as a race cannot survive long in the intense theater of competition that is the modern candy and snack-food world. Occasionally I will get a mutation, a candy that is misshapen, or pointier, or flatter than the rest. Almost invariably this proves to be a weakness, but on very rare occasions it gives the candy extra strength. In this way, the species continues to adapt to its environment. When I reach the end of the pack, I am left with one M&M, the strongest of the herd. Since it would make no sense to eat this one as well, I pack it neatly in an envelope and send it to M&M Mars, A Division of Mars, Inc., Hackettstown, NJ 17840-1503 U.S.A., along with a 3\u00d75 card reading, \u201cPlease use this M&M for breeding purposes.\u201d This week they wrote back to thank me, and sent me a coupon for a free 1/2 pound bag of plain M&Ms. I consider this \u201cgrant money.\u201d I have set aside the weekend for a grand tournament.

things straight. Wild Animal Racing (WAR) is not a racing game. All the graphics and shots for the store pictures? They're actually ripped off a mod for MarioKart. WAR is a hectic shooter that can turn completely around in a split second. Those shots do not have anything to do with this game. WAR is actually the best game in my Steam library. A masterpiece. Graphics are high-end (Better than PUBG, R6:Siege, and really any game with amazing graphics you can think of. Music/Sound FX are simply beautiful. The soundtrack to this game is on par with Jet Set Radio. The sound effects are so realistic, you will end up turning around in your seat to make sure [said effect] wasn't happening in real life behind you. This game is also amazingly stable- it runs at a steady 60 FPS on a potato and runs extremely well on a higher-end PC with very little CPU usage. With graphics, mechanics, and taxing physics this high, WAR does a truly remarkable job in denying any bugs, crashes, or issues. Look at PUBG.

I knew I was born to outgo the average person, I knew that sometime in my life, an oppurtunity would come that would set me up for unadaltered greatness. I think I have finally found my passageway into true blissful divinity, and it is this video game. Never did I think I would find true happiness in a piece of media, let alone a video game; I was proven completely wrong. This game is an absolute masterpiece, and I dont even think that some of the most eliquintly spoken people can describe the pure concentrated happiness you experience when you indulge in this game. The soundtrack is that of heavenly angels blessing my ears with thousands of pitch perfect notes in complete harmony. The graphics are unspeakably realistic, which helps immerse yourself in the stunning game world the genius developers created. And speaking of the game world, it gives you plenty of time to hop out of your kart and explore the vast outdoors (A metaphor this game geniously fabricated which is applicable in the real world in that you sometimes need to let go of material possessions and indulge in mother nature)\nwhich is a very welcome addition to the gameplay. The characters are deeply fleshed out, to the point you would think that the developers somehow figured out how to put all of someones memories, feelings, thoughts and processes into an A.I. If all I said here doesnt convince you enough that this game is the defining masterpiece of the human race, the fact that I am moving to the mountains where I will live on a strict diet of kale and wood and meditate in the icy fridge that is my cave for 18 hours a day may change your mind.

the best of the graphics and gameplay and sound and music and items the movies are very good too i like them a whole lot there are no settings which is okay though cuz i have the best of computers that can run it at over one thousand one hundred and eighty frames a second so i wont need to lower the specs to get good frames because i already have them there is also no sound bar but that is okay too because the sound and music in this games is already the best in the world who would need to turn down the best music there is only six character animals to choose from but that is okay too because these animals are the very best personalities there are they are very funny and make me laugh when i see them i laugh very very very very very extra and much when i see then see the same animals that i just raced in the movies the movies are the funniest part of the whole game dancing animals and animals escaping their cages and animals going through walls are humorus to me and make me laugh the courses that you race on are very very very good too like the mountain pass and egypt and mystical and underwater are to name a few of my favorite the terrain is a little bumpy but that just adds to the fun just like the different items that there are in the game that you can use like the hammer to knock people out and the nuke which you can set off as many times as you want which is just like the bananas which you can do as many times as you want and the spike arrows are very helpul when you are about to loose to someone right next to you there is no lag at all in the multiplayer and is very modern connection which is helpful for my russian friend that i play online with someday i hope to play the glorious split screen mode with him so we can have lots of fun in the same computer and screen and game and chair i love paul very much for giving us this beautiful game that i am proud to own someoday i hope to have over one million three hundred twenty seven thousand and nine hundred sixty two hours in this game sadly i am only at one and half hours but i will get there i give this game a one hundred fifty eight and one hundred seventy two thousandths out of ninety nine very good game and keep up the good work paul i will be ready for the sequal to come out any day now i have my money waiting i dont care how expensive the game is i will buy it you heard this all here first kids have a nice day and happy racing this should be the only review that you need to read to be convinced to buy this thing so good luck and spend your money on this wonderful game i would most definitly recommend this video game :)\n\nedit i have now unlocked all the movies and i can confirm once again that they are all funny and hillarious and good in every possible way i had to grind out the game and earn forty thousand points from racing which gave me lot of fun play time and added to my collection of hours i have also unlocked every achievement in the game except the one where you get first and second with a local split screen game but i am saving that one for my russian friend and i to get it together in the same computer and screen and keyboard and chair but all of the acheivements are fun and not too hard to get but the easter egg one that involves an eye i dont wanna give away how to get it is especially fun there is even a little minigame that comes when you find the easter egg and is very very very very fun its like i paid only three nintey nine for two whole games in one if i ever get bored of the racing which i never do all i have to do is just find the easter egg which is just starting at you in the eye hahaha get it and then i play the second game that there is i would have bought this game as a stand alone if paul bird put it on the market that way anyway so even after playing more of the game and seeing what it has to offer and essentially beating the game i still recommend this game to all my friends and family and co workers and class mates and best buds and even my russian friend he got the game because i told him too and just like me he was convinced that this game was so good and worth the three nintey nine it is even though i beat the game i will still come back to play this game every night no matter how much work or home work or depression or family and friend issues or food i have wild animals racing or better known by its acronym war will always be my number one priority in life even besides food and water and friends and family and social life and other video games and health and even the earth and the solar system and the universe themselves thank you for reading and happy wild animals racing i hope i did a good job of convincing you and thank you for keeping reading this awesome review that praises the game wild animals racing which should be nominated for game of the year for every year in history", "timestamp_created": 1503163034, "timestamp_updated": 1511455030, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2,

Play as an elephant, a lion, a zebra, a giraffe, a rhino or a hippo! Play against the other animals or against a friend on the same computer with the split-screen mode!

Wow. It is going to be hard for me to put in words how much I love this game, but I'll try. I bought this game for $3.99 (Such a low price for such an amazing game!) and was very excited to play it. I load it up, and see the beautifully crafted title screen, which has a close up of the giraffe character (sorry, I am still learning the names) driving their kart. This is a work of art, and should be put in a mueseum. It is up there in the ranks of The Mona Lisa, and Starry Night. This game has a multiplayer function, so you can play online or with a friend locally! This is such an amazing feature. I have grown closer to my family and friends playing this game. Next, is the soundtrack, and oh my goodness, is it wonderful! The songs sound amazing, and never get old! The tracks that are in the game are amazing, and extremely creative. I don't know how you do it, Paul. Next are the characters. There is the giraffe, the elephant, the lioness, the zebra, the rhino, and my personal favortie, the hippo. These characters have a unique playstyle, which makes it fun to play as all of them. The movies you unlock through playing the games offer lore and backstory to these character. Speaking of which, the movies give you an insentive to keep on playing the game. What wacky adventures will these wild animals go on next? That is the question I asked myself as I played, so I raced on, trying to get as much points as I could. I unlocked the dance scene, which costs 5000 points. It showed the giraffe, elephant and hippo dancing in a beautifully crafted room. The way they were dancing was very sexy, (not to mention they were naked!) so shield your child's eyes from that scene. The racing itself controls fluently. I'm a personal fan of the games control scheme. When driving, you don't hold forward, it goes by itself, making this game very realistic. It also stops thumb cramps. The items are very creative, and I have never seen anything like them before! The rocket item you can shoot forward, blasting your opponents out of the way! The bubble shields you from danger, but you can also pop it to surprise your foes! The hammer item lets you hit opponents next to you, making them spin out. My personal favorite, though, is the bannana peel item. It takes the popular gag of slipping on a bannana peel and puts it into a racing game! Truly genius! The AI is very advanced, too. I noticed that the animals were very competitive, and wanted to win first place, like their life depended on it. They even pushed eachother, and even me, sometimes! I guess that is where they get the title 'Wild Animals'. Overall, this game looks, sounds, and controls amazingly. I'd suggest you buy it, if you haven't already.", "timestamp_created": 1501674482, "timestamp_updated": 1501674482, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.609688", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33963682": {"recommendationid": "33963682", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057030733", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500265524}, "language": "english", "review": "As a young boy growing up in Greenland, it was a rough beginning to my life. I spent most of my time out of school hunting wolves for dinner with my dad. I didn't have many friends because there was no one in a 75 mile radius of my home. After one season of hunting I had my 8th Birthday. My dad spend half of his life savings on my present. It was this game I had never heard of called Wild Animal Racing. I played it non-stop on my little monitor powered by our sled dogs on a treadmill spinning an electrical generator. I couldn't stop, it was an addiction. The in depth character design and the heartwrenching wins and defeats were all apart of the game I wished to devote my life to. After seeing the 2000+ points being added to my score, I never wanted anything more but to be the best. I spent the next 14 years of my life training and training hard. Every hour I wasn't working to feed my dogs to run the computer, I spent practicing every corner and every secret shortcut there was in this game. I researched it day and night and found a great source for guides and tips, Wild Animal Channel. Doing all this only encouraged me to press on. Then one day I received a letter via my mail pigeon. It read that some important people had been tracking my prgress in the game. They had decided to invite me to McCall, Idaho to compete in the World Racing League Directed by Wild Animal Racing, 3rd Generation (WRLDWAR3 for short). I couldn't stop crying, my dream finally came true. I was going to the big leagues, to play with my heros. Life couldn't get any better. I set off immediately with my dogs and joystick which i used for racing and went straight to idaho. 3 of my dogs drowned on the way there, 6 died from dehydration, but I rode into McCall with 5 dogs left. It was like a whole different world to me, I couldn't beleive my eyes. There were actual people, it was whacky, as we say it in greenland. I was nearly late to the tournement, it was in the basement of a pub off of main street. There was an enourmous turnout and my heart was beating faster than that one time I was almost eaten alive by wolves. This was it, this was my chance to prove myself that I was not just going down in history to be a kid from greenland, no, I was going to be a legend. I sat down in my chair and scoped out the competition. It wasn't much, just a couple of old chubby guys and one empty chair. I was curious as to why this competitor wasn't here yet as the match would start any minute, but I soon found out. The first time I saw Robbie Magistrelli was when he walked on stage, not to mention I didn't even know there was a stage, but the crowd was cheering and whistleing as he waved. He was a tall slim italien man and was wearing all Nike brand, clearly sponsored, and his yellow lensed gaming goggles. The moment I my eyes on him I was filled with rage, but I kept it in. We all sat down and prepared for the race, I was last in the draw and was forced to pick the elephant, which everyone knows is the slowest animal by default, but I told myself it was the racer, not the animal. Robbie was his classic ginger the Giraffe, one of the best picks anyone could ask for. Then we went to choose the map set, World Tour, as it was the only one anyone ever played. The races were close, Robbie was in first by a small amount and I was following close in second, it was a nail biter every race, but the deciding race was the Volcano map. What a intense map that is. At this level of play it was all about the items you get, and wether or not luck was favoring you that day. I got off to a somewhat slow start but it was no biggie, thankfully no one got the bananas the whole round. But as I neared the final curve just a few inches behind Robbie, he sneezed and missed the item box. I saw my oppertunity. I prayed a quick prayer as I picked it up, \"Missiles, Missiles please\". I grabbed it. Time seemed to stand still, I look to the bottom left of my screen and... It was bubble gum. To this day I never understood the use of it, never understood why it was even in the game! But as I crossed the finish line behind Robbie, as he stood up and the crowd cheered for his victory, I realized something. Life isn't about what you look like, or what possesions you have, it's who you are and what you go thorugh that define you. Realizing it wasn't my fault that I lost the tournament that day changed me, realizing that I was a different and better person because of that experince was arguably the best thing that could ever happen to me. If there is one thing I want everyone to take away from my story, it's that you don't always win, there isn't always a happy ending given to you, but instead, it's what you make of your life that is what it becomes.

That\u2019s all I have to say after playing this game. Despite being colorful, simple, and having a tacky soundtrack, this game really made me weep. It\u2019s just so beautiful, and dark at the same time.\n\nThe story is about a group of wild animals going through hard times during the Cold War. They are all close, so they decide to unite together to make enough income to support their families by joining an international racing competition. Their friendship, compassion, and familial relationships all are affected by the glory, the fortune, and the fame of becoming a Wild Animal Racer. What started as a straightforward method to make extra money for the other wild animals in the savannah, started going down in a spiral of competitiveness, drugs, backstabbing, and money. The choices you have to make in this game really impact the story, and often I couldn\u2019t control myself: I would start weeping at the computer, experiencing the hardship the characters are going through. The gameplay is truly immersive. I really don\u2019t know what to feel after finishing it, it was almost as if I lost a child. That\u2019s how emotionally scarring it was. Despite all the pain this game put me through, it is beautiful, and really showcases how human (or in this case animal) relationship works, and pushes these characters to the limit. \n\nThis game is definitely worth the price tag for the impact it creates.

Gi\u00e0 da questo dettaglio si pu\u00f2 capire come i developer si siano sforzati ad ottimizzare il codice quanto pi\u00f9 possibile, pur mantenendo un\u2019eccellentissima grafica in alta definizione.\n\nLa schermata iniziale fa subito intuire l\u2019attenzione e la cura nei dettagli degli sviluppatori: pur avendo PC e Steam in inglese, il  gioco capisce da solo il mio idioma d\u2019origine e fa campeggiare al centro dello schermo il titolo tradotto in italiano: [b]\u201cCorsa Animale Selvatico\u201d[/b]. Per di pi\u00f9, il contenuto delle lettere del titolo sono animate con uno splendido \u201ceffetto fuoco\u201d. \nNon \u00e8 presente un menu delle opzioni, n\u00e9 tantomeno la possibilit\u00e0 di modificare i comandi, ma ho trovato tutto cos\u00ec intuitivo che introdurre un menu aggiuntivo sarebbe stato assolutamente inutile e ridondante. Un altro, ennesimo, punto a favore \u00e8 la disponibilit\u00e0 di lingue tra cui scegliere: ben TRENTOTTO, che fa impallidire qualunque altro titolo dello stesso genere (ad esempio ricordiamo l\u2019UNICA lingua di AI War: Fleet Command o Divinty: Original Sin 2 \u2013 quest\u2019ultimo in EA, ma che comunque non reputo una scusa accettabile). L\u2019icona per il multiplayer \u00e8 addirittura animata con un mondo che gira. Non ho idea della risoluzione in game, ma ad occhio sono indeciso tra 4k e 8k. Inutile dire che il gioco raggiunge i 90 fps degni della master race, ben QUATTRO volte superiori ai soli 24 fps che l\u2019occhio umano \u00e8 in grado di vedere.\n\nUna volta finito di ammirare la schermata iniziale (personalmente ho speso pi\u00f9 di dieci minuti), \u00e8 possibile accingerci a scegliere il personaggio che pi\u00f9 preferiamo: elefante, leonessa, zebra, giraffa, ippopotamo e rinoceronte. Dettaglio aggiuntivo, ogni qualvolta si scorre il personaggio, l\u2019animale fa una simpatica animazione (uguale per tutti) e un verso caratteristico personalizzato.\nUna volta selezionato il nostro pilota, possiamo decidere in quale dei tanti (quattro) tornei cimentarci: Strade, Tour Mondiale, Magico e Rally. In ogni torneo si gareggia contro gli avversari in 3 piste, e vengono dati un tot di punti a ogni pilota a seconda della posizione finale. Non entrer\u00f2 nei dettagli di ogni pista per lasciare il brivido della scoperta ai tanti che vorranno giocare a questo titolo (le ambientazioni sono davvero le pi\u00f9 disparate!), ma vi mostro un solo screenshot della gara che, secondo me, \u00e8 una delle pi\u00f9 belle ed originali (si chiama \u201csott\u2019acqua\u201d; purtroppo dal fermo immagine non \u00e8 possibile apprezzarlo, ma durante la competizione sembra proprio che i pesci volino all\u2019interno dell\u2019acquario): \n\n[url=https://postimg.org/image/zfkcc5e2b/][img]https://s13.postimg.org/zfkcc5e2b/image.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nLa gara consiste in una semplice corsa contro gli avversari, resa vivace ed accattivante dalla presenza di svariati ostacoli lungo la pista. Corretta anche l\u2019impossibilit\u00e0 di mettere in pausa il gioco per avvantaggiare eccessivamente il giocatore: infatti se si preme start o esc si torna direttamente alla schermata di selezione del torneo, dovendo cos\u00ec ricominciare da capo. Inutile dire che il joypad \u00e8 riconosciuto immediatamente dal gioco senza la necessit\u00e0 di dover configurare niente (come d\u2019altronde conferma la pagina steam del gioco dove \u00e8 indicato \u201cfull controller support\u201d). Unico dettaglio \u00e8 che per\u00f2 se si utilizza un controller non \u00e8 possibile andare in retromarcia: un intelligente espediente per bilanciare il vantaggio dei giocatori che possono permettersi un costoso joypad. Quindi nel caso rimaniate bloccati in uno dei tanti ostacoli del percorso, l\u2019unica soluzione sar\u00e0 quella di ricominciare l\u2019intero torneo da capo, aumentando cos\u00ec sapientemente la sfida e longevit\u00e0 del titolo. Per inciso, c\u2019\u00e8 anche il pulsante per saltare, ma non ho capito a che cazzo serva. \n\nUna menzione d\u2019onore anche all\u2019utile minimappa (assolutamente non trasparente per migliorarne la visibilit\u00e0) che occupa un abbondante riquadro in alto a sinistra dello schermo: questo fa s\u00ec che nelle curve a sinistra non sia possibile vedere a cosa si va incontro (questo si nota particolarmente nella mappa \u201cEgitto\u201d, dove in un paio di curve \u00e8 impossibile evitare un muro trasversale che occupa \u00be della pista): un divertente espediente degli sviluppatori che stimola il giocatore ad imparare a memoria le piste e garantisce al veterano un notevole ed ulteriore vantaggio in caso di gare con neofiti e sprovveduti amici.\n\nLe gare sono vivacizzate anche dalla presenza di numerosi oggetti, quali il razzo, le lance laterali, le banane, il martello e la bolla, tutte atte a rallentare l\u2019avversario incautamente colpito, tranne la bolla che non ho capito cosa cazzo faccia (per\u00f2 se si preme il tasto azione, la bolla aumenta di dimensione fino a esplodere - senza alcuna apparente conseguenza). Tenete conto che gli avversari comandati dal computer non utilizzano oggetti, ma la sfida \u00e8 comunque garantita dal fatto che adeguino la loro velocit\u00e0 alla vostra. Quindi, sia che siate scarsi come la fame, sia che siate dei novelli Valentino Rossi, avrete gli avversari sempre intorno a voi per garantire sempre una emozionante gara che verr\u00e0 decisa al fotofinish. Al tal riguardo, ci tengo a sottolineare come gli npc tendano a ottenere un miglior piazzamento anche se appena dietro di voi: l\u2019ennesimo tocco di classe per garantire uno stimolo a fare sempre meglio.\n\n[url=https://postimg.org/image/wpdl0rez9/][img]https://s18.postimg.org/wpdl0rez9/3posto.jpg[/img][/url]\n\nCome diceva Mahatma Gandhi ne \u201cL\u2019arte della Guerra\u201d, il diavolo si nasconde nei dettagli. E questo titolo non si esime di certo, proponendo una serie di pregi che mancano anche nei titoli pi\u00f9 recenti e blasonati del genere come ad esempio The Witcher 3 e Doom: per esempio ci \u00e8 data la possibilit\u00e0 di sbloccare dei filmati degni dei migliori cortometraggi postcontemporanei filosofici polacchi. Per tutti coloro che fossero cos\u00ec hypati e impazienti di vederli (e li capisco!!) senza dover attendere di sbloccarli, ecco un breve video che mostra i primi due (vedetelo come un succulento antipasto che vi stuzzica la curiosit\u00e0 in vista dell\u2019imminente e pantagruelico simposio dell\u2019abbondanza): \n\n[yt]7UGWjslpmTU[/yt]\n\nAnche il comparto audio non stona di certo rispetto alla qualit\u00e0 complessiva del titolo: la musica \u00e8 allegra ed accattivante, prosegue in loop ogni 7 secondi (contati) e continua anche quando il gioco viene ridotto ad icona, in modo tale da accompagnare il giocatore anche quando desidera prendersi una pausa dal gioco frenetico. Oppure mentre sto scrivendo questa recensione (mi sembra eticamente doveroso).\n\nCome ciliegina sulla torta, un ricco numero di achievements permetter\u00e0 ai pi\u00f9 smaliziati di raggiungere innumerevoli soddisfazioni personali (personalmente mi sono divertito a ottenerli tutti tranne quello da giocare in locale, a cui provveder\u00f2 non appena un fortunatissimo amico mi verr\u00e0 a trovare a casa): giusto per fare l\u2019ennesimo, improbo paragone, in questo titolo per il momento ho ottenuto ben il 93% degli achievements: decisamente superiore all\u201983% di Fallout New Vegas, gioco in cui ho speso la bellezza di 102 ore.\n\nIn sintesi, un Mario Kart che riesce a superare il maestro (anzi, non mi stupirei addirittura se MK si fosse ispirato a questo titolo: d\u2019altronde [b]Corsa Animale Selvatico[/b] \u00e8 uscito a Marzo 2016, mentre Mario Kart per Nintendo Switch deve essere ancora annunciato..), grazie alla dovizia di particolari e all\u2019indubbio carisma dei personaggi, sicuramente pi\u00f9 iconici e caratteristici della blanda controparte Nintendo.\n\nUna delle recensioni su Steam gli d\u00e0 un pieno 9/11, ma secondo me \u00e8 stato troppo stretto col voto, al che gli conferisco un abbondantissimo 11/9 (tant\u2019\u00e8 che non sono neanche uscito di sabato sera per poter divorare il titolo e scrivere questa recensione).", "timestamp_created": 1479633720, "timestamp_updated": 1479638588, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 18, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519231", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26676215": {"recommendationid": "26676215", "author": {"steamid": "76561198217241993", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 99, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489435771}, "language": "english", "review": "buy as many copies of this game as you can and send them to your friends\n\nits 2 fun", "timestamp_created": 1479492453, "timestamp_updated": 1479492453, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 20, "weighted_vote_score": "0.724090", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26670805": {"recommendationid": "26670805", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997504477", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515131899}, "language": "english", "review": "Don't look trhough the reviews... just buy it like a boss", "timestamp_created": 1479472171, "timestamp_updated": 1479472171, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26554991": {"recommendationid": "26554991", "author": {"steamid": "76561198289461372", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 250, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514659543}, "language": "english", "review": "girrafe", "timestamp_created": 1478946173, "timestamp_updated": 1512219678, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26509846": {"recommendationid": "26509846", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126293635", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 37, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485619875}, "language": "english", "review": "Never again.

The lack of character development whilst focusing on actual gameplay is fantastic and it shows. There are many maps and stages included within the game and there is no DLC, which is a plus. The soundtrack is upbeat and the graphics fit the meme. The online capabilities are endless as you can play with millions of other players simultaneously within the game. If you have not picked this game up, please do. My friends and I always play this at our LAN parties and we all recommend it, especially for the low price. Wild Animal Racing is and will always be one of my favorite gaming experiences ever, I give it a rating of 9.7/10 \n\n2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful \n3 people found this review funny", "timestamp_created": 1474421803, "timestamp_updated": 1508251727, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496567", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25607711": {"recommendationid": "25607711", "author": {"steamid": "76561198168190809", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 39, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474397612}, "language": "english", "review": "This game gave me a reason to live", "timestamp_created": 1474397841, "timestamp_updated": 1474397841, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 18, "weighted_vote_score": "0.605685", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25592624": {"recommendationid": "25592624", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120388634", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 70, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510959202}, "language": "english", "review": "eat your heart out overwatch, theres a new top game in town", "timestamp_created": 1474313404, "timestamp_updated": 1474313404, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.641046", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25559978": {"recommendationid": "25559978", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102412209", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 38, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467003765}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10\nBest Anime.\nMy waifu is the zebra.", "timestamp_created": 1474163745, "timestamp_updated": 1474163745, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498290", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25559145": {"recommendationid": "25559145", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042748032", "num_games_owned": 218, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510025123}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice", "timestamp_created": 1474159339, "timestamp_updated": 1474159339, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498290", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25557487": {"recommendationid": "25557487", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012829728", "num_games_owned": 702, "num_reviews": 217, "playtime_forever": 110, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474146290}, "language": "english", "review": "This game gave me an existential crisis and then I couldn't even beat the final track because the levels were fucking broken.

The first thing you see when you launch the game is  a splash screen of the games title with the main character (The Giraffe) in his signature red car. you also see \"made by Paul Bird\" underneath the title, a subtle hint to the secret bird boss later in the game.\nYou can play single player with the expertly programmed AI or if that isnt a challenge enough you can take your chances and face off against some of the worlds best Wild Animal Racing fans (You might even be able to race me #1) Or if you are feeling a bit more intimate you can invite a hot date over for some split screen couch co-op action, Something that will ensure your date goes home thoroughly pleased.\nThere are 6 characters to choose from all representing the animal kingdom (sorry humans this isnt a game for your kind) each of them has thier own unique racing style and gameplay abilities, the shining examples being the lions ability to blend in with the sand on the desert levels to give him that extra edge or the rhinoceros' secret ability to ram other racers with his horn to knock them wildly of course.\nThe soundtrack is amazing and has become an instant classic in my home, I have already made the beautifuly orchestrated underwater theme my ringtone. The wonderfly orchestrated soundtrack compliments the gameplay in ways ive never seen before, It slowly builds up for the first few laps then breaks into an almighty crescendo upon the final stretch filling the player with a sense of awe and wonder at the fsat paced action.\nOverall this game is a master piece of game design and is not for the faint of heart, if you love high octane blood fueled animal racing action then this game is a must buy for your christmas list.\n\nI give this game 10 stars of of ten it is excellent i give you a standing ovation Paul Bird!

Ask players which characters they prefer, what levels top the list, and which items need to stay or go, and you'll get as many diverse responses are there are gamer types. And yet, most PC fans will agree that the Wild Animal Racing games are enjoyable single-player experiences and addictive multiplayer ones.\n\nSupposing you're new to the phenomenon -- hey, this is Steam after all; you might come from that coveted \"blue ocean\" corner -- Wild Animal Racing, like its predecessors, is a pick-up-and-play racer drenched in zoo themed characters and overrun with outlandish track designs. You can race against foes or engage them in vehicular battle -- not with guns, mind you, but spiked wheels and missles. This is a Steam game, remember. The concept may seem downright childish as you read about it, but the end experience is both charming and fun.\n\nWild Animal Racing has never really been full-blown \"hardcore,\" and neither has it been wholly \"casual,\" a truth that Paul Bird has fully embraced this time around. Wild Animal Racing comes complete with three Grand Prix speed classes \u2013 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc \u2013 with the expected unlockables after that. Each character fits distinctly in a race class, has specific light, medium, or heavy cars to choose from based on that class, and there's of course a healthy dose of local multiplayer via classic versus ad battle modes. If you grew up with Wild Animal Racing, you will not find the Steam iteration full of pioneering new play modes, which might prove disappointing for some. At the same time, though, Paul Birds's series was founded on a winning formula and we can therefore sympathize with any reluctance to break from it.\n\nStill, there are some welcomed additions. Not only does Wild Animal Racing for Steam ship with a Noose -- a shell that encapsulates the neck and makes the process of dying more believable -- but now there are bikes, Animal support both on and off the tracks, 32 total stages (half new, half classic), as well as a few new items thrown into the mix. It all feels and looks like Wild Animal Racing, mind you, but the extra bells and whistles are definitely recognizable But you knew that. The real question here is how exactly the game plays, what works and what doesn't, and whether or not you need to start sending hate mail to Paul Bird for screwing up your now-teenage baby.\n\nOverall, Wild Animal Racing is extremely rewarding and we take into account the Noose (yes, we just complimented a suicide tactic\u2026), the inclusion of IR and non-IR supported menus, the seamless integration of console Animals, and never-ending laundry list of SteamConnect24 and Steam Wi-Fi Connection features, the continued support of traditional control schemes, the retro levels, and much more. For the thick-minded, Wild Animal Racing offers a seemingly never-ending amount of content. Some of it you'll love and some you won't want to play through a second time.\n\nFor the first time ever on a Steam console, the online portion trumps the single-player offering, and we'll explain why. Both 50cc and 100cc races are fine in Grand Prix, though the exclusion of the Wild Animal Racing-like cooperative two player GP is a serious misstep in our opinion -- you can certainly go in and create your own GP competitions, but they work separately from the normal GP cup progression. Road Cup is a bit boring, World Toar starts to mix things up with some decent track design, Rally Cup really starts to take off with some superb levels and true innovation, and a Magical Cup that rounds things off with one of, if not the, best LSD trips  in franchise history.\n\nOverall, I give this game a 10/10\n\n\n\n\n\nf ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn", "timestamp_created": 1468175091, "timestamp_updated": 1468175091, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24221513": {"recommendationid": "24221513", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121230880", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514611894}, "language": "english", "review": "I main hippo.", "timestamp_created": 1468117432, "timestamp_updated": 1468117432, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24217308": {"recommendationid": "24217308", "author": {"steamid": "76561198174892450", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458338837}, "language": "english", "review": "very good game , my dad loves it", "timestamp_created": 1468100450, "timestamp_updated": 1468100450, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24193725": {"recommendationid": "24193725", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083301298", "num_games_owned": 4275, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 237, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476304428}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is TERRIBLE!

Having repeatedly dropped out of the New Jersey State Troopers' academy test (low blood sugar makes him pass out without any notice), lonely single dad Paul takes his job too seriously and lives with his mom and daughter -- and he hasn't had a date in so long that they set up an online profile for him. After meeting lovely new kiosk owner Amy (Jayma Mays), Paul thinks she could be the one to look past his schlubby exterior to the sweet, courageous man inside. To prove himself to her, he stays in the mall to try and save her and a group of other hostages captured by a group of young criminals on the hunt for a huge identity-theft score.\n\nIS IT ANY GOOD?\n\nAt first PAUL BLART: MALL COP just seems like another broad, brainless Adam Sandler-produced comedy aimed at teen and tween boys. But as the plot thickens, James' teddy-bear of a protagonist actually begins to grow on the audience. Despite the many fat jokes (which are thankfully not aimed at Raini Rodriguez, the cute, chubby actress who plays Blart's daughter Maya), there's none of the raunch that's defined Sandler's signature brand of humor. Blart doesn't make apologies for who he is -- a food-loving, mustachioed, unfashionable man who loves his job and his mother and daughter and would risk his life to save any innocent mall shopper.\n\nThe physical comedy is surprisingly well executed, with James pratfalling with the ease and grace of Chevy Chase or Buster Keaton. Mays is like the second coming of Anna Faris, and the acrobatic, skateboarding crew of criminals put on an entertaining cat-and-mouse chase around the mall. The mall, it should be noted, deserves its own credit, since the movie prominently plugs many a store -- particularly an extended scene in Victoria's Secret. So, yes, this is a broad, silly comedy filled with consumer brands -- but it also has, embodied in its brave buffoon of Paul Blart, heart.\n\n\nall and all not a bad game - 9.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1466744247, "timestamp_updated": 1466744247, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479541", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23744087": {"recommendationid": "23744087", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053560912", "num_games_owned": 450, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 59, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466749221}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Music[/h1]\n[code]\n- Turn off music?

As primary mission statements go, few games are so startlingly direct, but Wild animal racing revels in the simplicity of its ultra violence. This latest game from revered studio id Software takes much from the timeless 1993 original - its frantic bloodshed being the most immediately noticeable - but the Wild animal racing of 2016 also goes the distance to achieve surprise greatness of its own.\n\nIts exemplary gunplay is distilled into a gloriously short feedback loop that gets exponentially more satisfying. New Wild animal racing feels much faster than its iconic forebear, and after a brief introduction it continues to dial up the action without giving pause. By midway through its lengthy campaign, those first few fights feel like child\u2019s play. By the game\u2019s final quarter, you\u2019ll be frequently amazed by the devastating onslaught that Wild animal racing delivers so consistently. It\u2019s a wonderful progression of madness that never stops for breath.\n\nWild animal racing\nThe premise is simple: you shoot demons. The new trick is to shoot demons until they stagger before moving in for a Glory Kill - a contextual finisher that sees the faceless Wild animal racing Marine breaking, tearing, smashing, ripping, sawing and eviscerating his foes to death. Killing in this way results in a colourful shower of health and ammo packs - vital in a game without regenerating health and where your primary interaction with its world is shooting until there\u2019s nothing left to shoot.\n\nIt\u2019s a flawless slice of game design - easy enough to master, fast enough to be unintrusive, graphic enough to feel empowering, and intrinsic enough to survival for you to keep coming back for more and more and more. Id\u2019s designers know this, and make a marked point of giving you very little else to concentrate on, or care about, as you progress.\n\nThe inimitable Wild animal racing Marine doesn\u2019t care either - his indifference communicated through a series of mute physical expressions. As UAC facility boss Samuel Hayden explains the importance of some research, Wild animal racing Marine smashes it to pieces before Hayden can even finish. When he\u2019s shown vital information on a holo-screen, he pushes it aside to get on with the killing. The intention is clear: Wild animal racing\u2019s small cast of supporting characters are merely talking signposts to propel you from one location to the next.\n\nWild animal racing\nBut what locations they are. Hopping between a ravaged research base on Mars and the burning depths of Hell, Wild animal racing\u2019s locations could be called derivative. Its sci-fi base is all pristine metal and crisp lighting, while the underworld is fire and brimstone. This isn\u2019t new to games by any stretch, but Wild animal racing goes a long way to selling its hellscapes far better than any game before it.\n\nPart of this comes from some great art direction, but mostly from some astounding technical flourishes. Wild animal racing is incredibly detailed, especially on high-end PCs, and whether you\u2019re fighting through a flaming foundry, an AI core cooled to absolute zero, or the corpse infested wastes of Hell itself, it\u2019s distractingly pretty. Infrequent shifts from the game\u2019s near constant reddish tinge feel memorable, but you\u2019re always ready to get back to its blood soaked corridors. Consider as well that it runs at a faultless 60fps, and id should be commended for the performance it delivers on all platforms.\n\nAs soon as you pick up a shotgun, sidelining the game\u2019s pistol within the first two minutes, Wild animal racing starts proper. From there, it continues to introduce new weapons at pitch perfect pace so that you\u2019re always playing with something new and exciting; an assault rifle, a rocket launcher, a super shotgun, a chaingun, the iconic and unashamedly named Big Fucking Gun, and even more in between. Then there\u2019s the chainsaw - rather than serve as a standard melee weapon it operates as a one-hit kill device that relies on a finite fuel source. The bigger the demon you want to kill, the more fuel it uses, so the chainsaw\u2019s gruesome flesh-ripping is saved only for the direst of straits.\n\nWild animal racing\nThe game relishes in the discovery of each weapon, slowing the action to a crawl for a few seconds as Wild animal racing Marine looks it up and down with a sadistic sense of appreciation. As your arsenal expands, switching between guns with your radial menu quickly becomes second nature. You learn to move around that menu as effortlessly as the Marine moves around the world; every design consideration is beyond precise, providing perfect balance to the ensuing chaos.\n\nThat chaos is without doubt the game\u2019s crowning achievement. Wild animal racing\u2019s demons are varied and grotesque - dangerous on their own, but positively lethal in groups. The only way to win is to move faster, shoot quicker and be better. Pumping a Hell Knight full of shotgun shells, raining plasma orbs down on a group of Possessed, or unleashing a devastating Gauss Cannon blast on a staggered Revenant, Wild animal racing creates a ballet of bloody murder that requires constant thought and unending movement to keep up. The level design encourages - almost forces - mobility at all times, and while the entire game could essentially be summed up as a series of multi layered arenas connected by thin, linear corridors, Wild animal racing never suffers from this. Despite an unashamed focus on self-aware stupidity and uber gore, Wild animal racing is remarkably smart and dynamic throughout.\n\nThe small handful of modern design compromises that Wild animal racing makes are well implemented. The most noticeable - upgrades for your weapons - are by far the biggest shakeup to the Wild animal racing formula. The assault rifle gets a scope and a missile barrage, the shotgun gets a burst mode and a grenade launcher, the rocket launcher gets a homing upgrade and a remote detonator, and so on. Each upgrade can itself be upgraded by using the skill points earned from killing enemies. The result is a set of unique guns that are as deep as they are diverse.\n\nWild animal racing\u2019s bombastic cavalcade of a campaign is its centrepiece, but its accompanying multiplayer provides a wanton aside that never quite reaches the dizzying heights of its offline counterpart. It\u2019s just as frenetic, fast-paced and explosive, borrowing the verticality of id\u2019s other shooter, Quake. Ironically, its biggest problem - that it doesn\u2019t boast the longevity that it needs to survive against its contemporaries - is also what makes it so refreshing in the short term.\n\nThere were no doubts that Wild animal racing would play fast, look stunning, or be gory; the surprise is that Wild animal racing is as relevant, smart and self-aware as it is; merging old ideas with new ones; injecting its near-flawless shooter mechanics into a campaign that\u2019s impeccably refined, hilariously dumb and fiendishly moreish. In an overcrowded genre that\u2019s hellbent on one-upping itself in a slew of increasingly tepid iterations, Wild animal racing\u2019s multi-faceted personality is praiseworthy. After almost 25-years, the series finally escapes its precursor\u2019s shadow, once and for all.", "timestamp_created": 1464107373, "timestamp_updated": 1464107373, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566124", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23177887": {"recommendationid": "23177887", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098033793", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 265, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474949713}, "language": "english", "review": "This game made me witness the deaths of my entire family by a young lad only wielding a pair of pliers.", "timestamp_created": 1464078171, "timestamp_updated": 1464078171, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475134", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23177880": {"recommendationid": "23177880", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131185215", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 44, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503561329}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good and hardcore racing", "timestamp_created": 1464078120, "timestamp_updated": 1464078120, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "4.937695", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23177849": {"recommendationid": "23177849", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983096983", "num_games_owned": 405, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 218, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497414668}, "language": "english", "review": "hippo is grate\n\nnet code is very crate", "timestamp_created": 1464077975, "timestamp_updated": 1464078095, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.996431", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23177513": {"recommendationid": "23177513", "author": {"steamid": "76561198278002076", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514780507}, "language": "english", "review": "great game, great maps, great charachters, indepth storyline, worth every penny", "timestamp_created": 1464076003, "timestamp_updated": 1464076003, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23174715": {"recommendationid": "23174715", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119478209", "num_games_owned": 210, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464057618}, "language": "english", "review": "Society is a false construct created by the shark in the under water level and the giraffe.

No. A stunning super model wife that would let me fuck her arse every day? No. What filled this void was Wild Animal Racing.

I maybe living behind a Tesco in Staines, eating day old yum yums and steak slices from the near by Greggs. My friends and family may have disowned me and written me out of their wills.\nI may wake up in the middle of the night from the same reccuring nightmare of a hippo and zebra scissoring while a feminist lioness eats her own pussy, I start to masturbate furiously to the wild furry sex I'm witnessing before a rhino made from denim charges at me with a raging boner. I run as fast as i can in the opposite direction only to be faced with an elephant snorting a 5 meter line of cocaine while a satanic giraffe is slicing open the bodys of the lesbian hippo and zebra while the lioness blames men for what has transpired.

This is basically a masterpiece and a perfect game, simply one of the very best games there are for PC. Justice has been served for PC gamers and the wait was very much worth.

It goes past the basic foundations of what a game should be and does much more. It brings true fun to the game itself while pleasing each audience that enjoy any genre or even for that matter, anyone. This game truly is, dare I say, a perfect game. The truly outstanding part is that it's not even made with a big gaming company, it's an indie game which may suprise most.\nGameplay-wise, the game is truly a masterpiece. It succeeds to fufill both the casual and competitive players with different aspects all around. Say the items for example, each and every single item was made with the intention of being the best in the racing genre, better yet for games as a whole. Each of the items can be used in a variety of ways, be the normal use for casuals or improved tactics for pros of the game. With the outstanding game AI, even in single player the game feels just like you're going against real people. The racing itself has outstanding balancing, advanced tactics, and feels like a blend between casual and competitive racing games.\nGraphics-wise, this game is breathtaking. The variety of environments is so beautifuly portrayed throughout the graphics in this game is just amazing. Take the character models, each and every single one of the character models are fully detailed down to the fur on their bodies. The interface as well makes you feel like you're really driving a car. Coupled with the graphics, what the game has done with the graphics alone is something to be stunned about. The game makes you really feel like you're in another world, the amazing world of wild animal racing, behind the wheel.\nThe character development in this game is tear jerking. As you play through the game, you can choose between 6 different racers - Ginger the Giraffe, Hugo the Hippo, Ronaldo the Rhino, Egbert the Elephant, Linda the Lion, as well as Zirconda the Zebra. You can choose between the different characters in the game and as you play you unlock different movies, which will be covered later, however each gives a glimse into the outlook onto each of their lives and stories. Ginger's development from the start to the end was a real tearjerker, as I'm far everyone else can agree. Each of the characters tells a story better than any other.\nThe casual appeal of this game is the forefront, however most don't understand just how much extra details was put in. One of the main selling points of the game is that it's multiplayer (I KNOW RIGHT?!?!? IT KEEPS ON GIVING), but the multiplayer was executed perfectly. The items are all very obvious for how they're executed, even those who haven't played games, with a pinpoint purpose shown. The game itself is translated in a total of 26 lanuages, so that means that anyone around the world could just pick up the game and play it. The game itself is a must have for casual players of games from anywhere around the world!\nThis game has an even bigger community when considering the competitive side. People from all around the world play this game competitively. For example, the items have extra uses beyond the normal purpose, simply for competitive. Take the multiplayer feature mentioned earlier, the game has a slight lag time made purposely to challenge you. You can find big fans all around the world here to support you and to compete at the same time. Wild animal racing has seen the best competitive community in any game in a long time.\nWild Animal Racing extends past its name of simply a game, which is where the movies come. There are 8 movies that are unlocked as you play the game more and more. These all show tearjerking stories of all of the characters, giving you more story for the characters themselves. Each one is a cinematic masterpiece which doesn't belong in a game, however they decided to put it in only a 4 dollar game! They're all stunning, and when comparing them to the trash which is the movies of today - it can't be described in words.\nThe attention to detail, the secrets. Wild animal racing is a masterpiece and if you don't have it, you need to get it. The game is only $4, ONLY 4! Everyone, gamers and non gamers should have this game. Wild Animal Racing is by far, the best game on steam.", "timestamp_created": 1520971600, "timestamp_updated": 1520971600, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40762499": {"recommendationid": "40762499", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113782487", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 49, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 49, "last_played": 1521279757}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ud301 \ud558\ub098 \ub4dc\ub9ac\uc790\uba74 \ub85c\ucf13\uc774\ub098 \ubc14\ub09c\uaecd\uc9c8\uc740 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc2dc\uac04\ub3d9\uc548 \ubb34\uc81c\ud55c\uc73c\ub85c \ubfcc\ub9b4 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub798\uc11c \ub9c8\ub9ac\uc624\uce74\ud2b8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc369\uc740 \ud15c\uc911 \ud558\ub098\uc778 \ubc14\ub098\ub098 \uaecd\uc9c8\uc774 \uc5ec\uae30\uc11c\ub294 \uac1c\uc539\uc0c1\ud0c0\uce58 \uc544\uc774\ud15c\uc774 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "timestamp_created": 1520853022, "timestamp_updated": 1520853022, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40716370": {"recommendationid": "40716370", "author": {"steamid": "76561198421023701", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 75, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 75, "last_played": 1521402499}, "language": "english", "review": "A true masterpiece", "timestamp_created": 1520699369, "timestamp_updated": 1520699369, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539623", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40698451": {"recommendationid": "40698451", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097021951", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510262903}, "language": "english", "review": "It is good.

Thousands of hours I spent trying to achieve the 40000 unlock movie.

I was shocked and went to the nearest source: WebMD..\n\nWebMD informed me, after my post, that I should see a psycologist. Luckily, my mother is a fortune teller.\n\nI went to her and explained the situation. She said that after 6000 hours, somebody is almost a master at something.

Before I found this game, I was apart of aproximent 6.9 percent of people that are battling depression. Every day I wondered why I was still here because there was nothing left for me. It took all the energy I could muster just to get out of bed in the morning. I was down to my final days and I eventually just gave up and layed in bed all day. One day something inside of me caused me to get up and go check my computer to see if anybody was wondering where I was. To see if anybody still cared.... I saw that I had a steam notification. I felt the most miniscule glimmer of hope as I clicked to see what it was. All of the hope faded as I loaded up the page just to see a hunnnie pop trading card was added to my inventory. I was crushed. Just before I logged off for what I thought was the last time. I saw that there was a steam sale. I decided to take a look. When the page loaded up I saw a few games were on sale; nothing really that interesting though. Then all of a sudden my heart stoped beating and my face went pale. I read the title aloud \"Wild Animal Racing.\" To this day I don't know what caused me to stop at this paricular title. It was 25 percent off so I had Just enough funds in my steam walled to purchase it. I downloaded and installed the game. When I launched it my eyes began to water. I felt my lower lip quivering. The title screen alone was enough to make me feel emotions I haven't felt in a long time. Was this it? Was this my purpose? I begin to start a race and am greeted by a wide select of colourful zany characters. I went with the giraffe and a chose a race. As soon as it began, I was lost in the pure detail of the landscape and the individual personalities of the characters. I couldn't hold it in anymore. I began to cry. I felt something. Racing along side these new found friends made me feel like I wasn't alone. suddenly I had a purpose in life. This game is truly amazing and it saved my life. I could not recommend this game more. I hope that when you play this game, It will change your life like it did mine or in my case, save it. \n\nI will now give an in depth desciption of the game and list some of the pros and cons before giving it a final score.\n\nWild Animal Racing is an earth shattering fast paced action packed eperience loaded with tons of features and playablity.

Cities are wiped from the face of the planet, entire continents are crushed by nuclear onslaught and the Earth's population is decimated as six superpowers wage war on each other. Everybody dies.\n\nThat, in a nutshell, is DEFCON, the explosive new strategy game from Introversion - the developer behind the critically-adored Darwinia and lesser-known, but equally brilliant, Uplink. The aim of the game is simple: cause mass destruction on a global scale by launching nuclear attacks on rival superpowers while, at the same time, protecting your own borders from enemy strikes. Refreshingly, it's as easy to play as it is to explain, with many of the elements that tend to overcomplicate strategy games - such as resource management - stripped away to shift focus onto killing every last living, breathing person on the planet.\n\nHowever, before the bloodbath begins, the conditions of war must first be determined. There are six superpowers fighting for global domination, these being Asia, Russia, North America, South America, Africa and Europe. Players each choose a faction to side with and the remaining powers are either allocated to CPU players or left out of the game entirely. As such there's tremendous scope for playing DEFCON on a number of levels, from straightforward one-on-one conflicts - an obvious starting point for new players - to six-player all-against-all bun fights best left for those who know their silos from their subs.\n\nWith superpowers decided, the campaign map opens up - a Tron-style representation of the world - and the countdown to carnage starts ticking. Starting at DEFCON 5, it's the calm before the storm with players unable to initiate strikes on the enemy until the threat alert reaches DEFCON 3. Instead, the time is used to devise a plan of attack, surveying the enemy's position and deploying units accordingly. DEFCON's stylish neon wireframe graphics - taken straight out of the movie WarGames - depict the global battlefield, with cities marked on the map as diamonds. Units can be placed anywhere within the boundaries of your territory, using the mouse and keyboard to move quickly and easily around the map, with the mouse wheel zooming in and out.\n\nThere are three main types of unit: radar, airbase and missile silo. The latter is perhaps the most important as it's from these bunkers that each player rains nuclear death on the enemy. However, as the game unfolds, it's quickly apparent that each of the other units plays an important role too, meaning their placement is equally vital. Radar, for example, highlights the position of any enemy units within range so without it you'll be fighting blind. It's therefore wise to arrange your Radar units along the coastal regions of your continent so enemy units are detected before they get within striking distance. Airbases are capable of launching fighters and bombers, the light jets used to scout out beyond the reaches of your radar dishes as well eliminating enemy aircraft. Heavy bombers, on the other hand, are extremely important defensively and can target enemy naval units camped off your coastline.\n\nSpeaking of which, each player has a number of naval fleets at their disposal too, comprised of submarines, battleships and carriers. Subs can get within close proximity of an enemy territory without being detected, where they can sit and bombard cites with nuclear warheads. Carriers are equipped with anti-submarine sonar and depth charges to counter the underwater menace, plus they can launch fighters and bombers - however, they're vulnerable to attack from battleships. The cannons on these hulking leviathans can destroy other ships and even raze a city to the ground in seconds, but their short range means they must draw close to the coast to get a clear shot - leaving them prone to attack from submarines. As such, striking the right balance of ship types in each fleet - a mixture of six different units is possible - is essential, ensuring carriers are protected by battleships, battleships are protected from subs and so on.", "timestamp_created": 1517702555, "timestamp_updated": 1517702555, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39806028": {"recommendationid": "39806028", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078586551", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 56, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519106172}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is very fun, and its characters are just great.

Great music, solid mechanics and unrelenting gameplay makes it a great 90 minute thrill ride. There's also unlockable characters which I believe play differently, but I think I'm happy with Noitu Love 2 being a one & done deal for me. My only complaint is the controls can genuinely give you hand cramps due to the sheer amount of clicking you have to do. It's a game I really wish had gamepad support. There's also a couple mechanics, namely the \"connect the dots gunplay\" that left me puzzled for longer than I'd like to admit.

Here's the thing, though: while Noitu Love 2 is inspired by those games, it does not play like them at *all*. Firstly, Treasure games are known for their flawless action game controls. This game, on the other hand, is a bit clunky to handle. You use WASD at get around and the mouse to attack...there's no controller support, which is just odd when you consider that the game is inspired by console titles. The mouse attacks don't always work that well, and sometimes it feels like you're just clicking as fast as you can and hoping that it's doing something. Secondly, Treasure games are known for their gameplay variety. Noitu Love 2 mostly just has you racing through short, linear stages, clicking the left mouse button as fast as as you can. You don't get techniques or skills as you progress: you simply click, click, click, and click some more. There's a stage where you fly around with a special beam weapon, but it's not different enough to break up the repetition of the rest of the game. \n\nIf all that is true, why am I recommending this? I'm making it sound like it isn't a very good game, right? Well, despite Noitu Love 2's drawbacks, it's still pretty cool. I bought the game for about a dollar when it was on sale, and I feel like it was money well-spent. It's a great diversion if you're burnt out on open world epics and you just want to kick back and have a retro-style action experience. There are a lot of cool, creative bosses (the TV camera boss was my favorite), the music is solid, and the art direction is awesome. All the sprites look great and they have so much personality and character. The story is nonsense, but that just adds to the frenetic, funny spirit of the game. You've also got some decent replay value here; you can unlock new characters with their own playstyle, which lets you mix things up a bit (one of the new characters is *very* different, but I won't spoil it for you), and you can try out the game on harder difficulty settings, do high score runs, etc.\n\nSo yes, it's a mindless, slightly janky mouse click simulator, but it's a *fun* mindless, slightly janky mouse click simulator. It's basically a Flash game on steroids, but it's a *fun* Flash game on steroids. I was blown away when I realized that Noitu Love 2 was almost entirely the product of one person...the gameplay itself might be quite simple, but the thought and effort that went into the game's style is truly impressive. If you have any affection for 16-bit action games, Noitu Love 2 will make you smile. Just don't go in expecting something on the level of Treasure classics and you'll be satisfied.\n\nOh, and one more thing: the game is short. You can easily breeze through the entire thing in one session on the normal difficulty level. But, as I mentioned, there are some nice replay possibilities, and short length of the game doesn't make it any less fun.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1489164250, "timestamp_updated": 1489164250, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30348836": {"recommendationid": "30348836", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987103664", "num_games_owned": 331, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 91, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488756106}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros:\n+ Fast-paced action\n+ Fun & creative Boss fights\n+ Fluid pixel art\n+ All stages have their own unique design\n\nCons:\n- Short\n- No Co-op\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1488763932, "timestamp_updated": 1488763932, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30324714": {"recommendationid": "30324714", "author": {"steamid": "76561198357554976", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 177, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508972365}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Otimo jogo, graficos agradaveis, trilha sonora AWESOME, jogabilidade quase perfeita e as campanhas com personagens diferentes s\u00f3 deixa o jogo melhor, a pior coisa desse jogo \u00e9 que ele deixa um gosto de quero mais e infelizmente ele \u00e9 meio curto, sr. sr. wilson me trouxe at\u00e9 esse game.", "timestamp_created": 1488666048, "timestamp_updated": 1488666048, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30133270": {"recommendationid": "30133270", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967229781", "num_games_owned": 452, "num_reviews": 303, "playtime_forever": 82, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487905049}, "language": "english", "review": "Noitu Love 2: Devolution is a short and sweet sequel to an older platforming game featuring a new movement and attack system that incorporates a mouse-controlled targeting reticle and keyboard keys.

The enemies, bosses, and how they interact with the environment are really the highlights of the gameplay.

The game basically forces you to restart from checkpoint when you die, so even if you were doing well in a level and get whooped by the boss (which isn't always easy to predict), you'll still end up with a D grade. It's like taking a course where all the assignments are straightforward, and suddenly the instructor gives you a pop quiz with totally new material worth 50% of your grade.\n\nApart from this minor complaint, there is little else wrong with the game. I would recommend it for everything it does right -- the simple cathartic pleasure of beating things up, the music, graphics, and the style-over-substance story (which actually works in a game like this).

Unfortunately, the game is both incredibly simple and incredibly easy, and not worth your time.\n\nStory\n\n\tThe game\u2019s story makes no sense; it involves some bizarre time-travel plot which isn\u2019t really time travel\u2026 it doesn\u2019t really make any sense, but it doesn\u2019t need to and really isn\u2019t supposed to.\n\nGameplay\n\n\tThe gameplay is very simple and is at the heart of the game, but unfortunately is also terrible. You control an on-screen reticle with your mouse, and by clicking, you attack to that spot, if there is an enemy highlighted. You can also hold down your mouse button for a charge shot, jump, move side-to-side, or do a dash attack or spinning jump attack. In the end, while these attacks are theoretically meaningful, most of the time you\u2019re just running to the right, frequently using dash attacks to get through the stages faster to fight the bosses\u2026 where, mostly, you just wait to do your thing, or sometimes just straight up attack them as fast as possible, depending on the boss. Many of the bosses don\u2019t require any strategy, while others require a little strategy but not very much.\n\tUltimately the gameplay is very unsatisfying, and there is very little \u201cmeat\u201d to it \u2013 the game requires very little strategy and very large amounts of mindless clicking. There is some enemy variety, but most of it is fairly meaningless as strategy has little meaning with the game\u2019s control scheme, and most of the ordinary enemies are both trivial and easily bypassed. Even the bosses mostly are not very interesting, with only a very small number requiring any sort of real strategy. On the whole, the game feels far too simple and straightforward, like you are only there to click to attack a large number of times.\n\nGraphics\n\n\tThe game does a fine job of emulating the era it is trying to emulate; it isn\u2019t particularly beautiful, but it isn\u2019t ugly either, and it is significantly better than a lot of the 8-bit pseudo-retro graphics indie games floating around the market.\n\nFinal Summary\n\n\tNoitu Love 2 Devolution is not worth your money, but more importantly, it isn\u2019t worth your time.

I'm bad at giving things numeric ratings, so I'll just go over my thoughts on the most likely reason people wouldn't want to buy this game. For the most part they're pulled from the negative reviews (which are all relatively ostracized and 'unhelpful', suggesting these people are in the vast minority. Then again, that's also because a lot of them are quite ineloquent).\n\nSo without further ado, things people may gripe about related to buying/playing this game:\n\n\"The game is too short\"\nIt took me about 1.5 hours to beat the game without caring about taking damage or getting a good score on normal. If you don't care about beating it on hard or if your motto is 'D stands for Diploma' then chances are you may think the game is 'too short' although I'd argue that it's still a better time/money ratio than going to a movie.\n\n\"All you do is click on things\"\nThis is something of a 2D-action beat-em-up where you jump around, enemies show up, and sometimes (but not always) you have to kill a certain number of enemies before being able to scroll the screen. A key mechanic is that, if you're hovering over an enemy, clicking the mouse will jump/drag/move your character to the enemy. That in combination with the fact that rapid-clicking will result in pretty quick basic attacks that will destroy most normal enemies.\n\nThis is not to say that you still don't have to move left and right. Add to that the fact that ducking is also required on more than one occasion, means that anyone who says 'all you have to do is click on things' is clearly exagerating, which is one of the reasons why no-one likes them (er, 'finds them helpful'). \n\nIn reality, you have 4 keys for move/jump/duck and can perform special moves by double clicking up/left/right or holding the right mouse button and swiping. Aside from further invalidating the afforementioned argument, this also provides a fun way to move faster than walking/jumping speed, which is always welcomed.\n\nBasically, yes, on normal you COULD beat MOST of the game with only the right arrow and the left mouse button, but I wouldn't recommend it. If you're never using specials then, well, I don't know why you would do that.\n\n\"It's too easy\"\n*shrug* I'll admit, I didn't die that much on normal and I didn't spend too much time paying attention to boss patterns or trying to avoid hits or etc. That being said, I did die a few times and I got the lowest letter ranking on every level. Getting an A (I assume? maybe higher?) rank would, probably, take at least some effort to achieve. Also, I tried to play level 1 with the same carefree attitude on hard and managed to die without too much trouble, but I probably wouldn't have if I would have been taking it slower.\n\n\"It's boring\"\nWatch the trailer. That's the game. If you think that's boring then don't buy the game. Not every game is for everyone, but I seriously don't understand this argument once you see what you're getting yourself in to.\n\n\"The art style is [insert criticism]\"\n*Shrug* I think it's fine, but my first system was a Genesis so I'm no stranger to pixels. I think the art in the game is great, but I wasn't playing full screen. Really though, just see the above comment and replace 'that's boring' with 'that represents a sub-par art-style' and I think we're good.\n\n\"Rawr I made a complaint about the game and you didn't include mine, I hate you\"\nUm... my bad, maybe your complaint should be more logical ;-). If you think your complaint is logical, please just leave a comment or, y'know, don't bother me and go away :-D.", "timestamp_created": 1406965838, "timestamp_updated": 1406965838, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11501512": {"recommendationid": "11501512", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043282817", "num_games_owned": 877, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 374, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1374548691}, "language": "french", "review": "Mais avec tout \u00e7a, je n\u2019ai pas encore parl\u00e9 du gameplay du jeu qui le rend si bon. Le jeu est nerveux comme pas possible, ce qui le rend aussi jouissif que Vanquish l\u2019est pour cette m\u00eame raison, dans un autre genre. Ce c\u00f4t\u00e9 extr\u00eamement rapide du jeu est en effet un de ses plus gros points forts, tant \u00e7a apporte une bouff\u00e9e d\u2019air frais et que \u00e7a pose toutes les bases du gameplay. Pour ne pas \u00eatre g\u00ean\u00e9 en pleine course mais aussi comme tout excellent jeu 2D qui se respecte (tel que le r\u00e9cent Rayman Origins), Noitu Love 2 poss\u00e8de du walljump, ce mouvement g\u00e9nial qui permet de rebondir en sautant de mur en mur. Mais aussi, plus original, vous pouvez faire un saut qui vous accrochera \u00e0 une plateforme en l\u2019air ou encore pour directement attraper un ennemi, ce qui est tout aussi nerveux et pratique. Tout dans les mouvements et possibilit\u00e9s de votre personnage est fait pour que vous puissiez foncer \u00e0 toute vitesse en explosant le plus d\u2019ennemis possible sur votre passage. Mais pour ne pas trop prendre de d\u00e9g\u00e2ts, vous disposez aussi d\u2019un bouclier qui, en plus d\u2019arr\u00eater les petits projectiles, peut vous prot\u00e9ger de certains dangers du level design ou vous permettre de passer un endroit du jeu. Car oui, le level design est un autre des gros points forts du jeu. Celui-ci est toujours au top et, \u00e0 travers les sept diff\u00e9rents niveaux du jeu, il ne cesse de se renouveler et de surprendre. Si un des niveaux est plut\u00f4t classique et traditionnel (le niveau sous-marin, que l\u2019on retrouve dans tout jeu de plateforme ou d\u2019action 2D), il reste ma\u00eetris\u00e9 avec une nervosit\u00e9 qui est handicap\u00e9e par le fait que le personnage se trouve sous l\u2019eau, tout en restant dans la veine du reste. D\u2019autres proposent m\u00eame de jouer \u00e0 un autre style de jeu, un des niveaux \u00e9tant une sorte de shoot\u2019em up sur tourelle, restant n\u00e9anmoins plut\u00f4t original avec des ennemis extr\u00eamement bien pens\u00e9s. Ainsi, le jeu n\u2019est jamais r\u00e9p\u00e9titif et toujours jouissif.\n\nVous l\u2019aurez ais\u00e9ment compris, Noitu Love 2 Devolution est un must-have pour quiconque  veut passer deux heures de pur bonheur, quiconque aime le scoring et le time attack, quiconque adore Gunstar Heroes, Contra ou Metal Slug, quiconque aime la rapidit\u00e9 et la nervosit\u00e9 dans les jeux vid\u00e9o, quiconque aime les jeux au design enchanteur, quiconque aime les jeux old school, quiconque aime le challenge\u2026 dans tous les cas, vous ne prenez aucun risque \u00e0 5\u20ac et je vous incite donc tr\u00e8s fortement \u00e0 vous procurer le jeu, ne serait-ce que pour soutenir un d\u00e9veloppeur de talent et donner une seconde chance \u00e0 ce jeu vieux de quatre ans dont on pardonnera ais\u00e9ment les quelques bugs (m\u00eame si \u00e7a aurait pu \u00eatre corrig\u00e9 pour la sortie sur Steam).\nTest complet : [url=http://www.gamesidestory.com/2012/04/29/gametest-noitu-love-2-devolution-pc]http://www.gamesidestory.com/2012/04/29/gametest-noitu-love-2-devolution-pc[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1406869088, "timestamp_updated": 1406869122, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11458047": {"recommendationid": "11458047", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141542819", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1406665687}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "ritimo fren\u00e9tico, cen\u00e1rio e personagens com sprites muitisssimo bem desenhados.\npara os fans de games old scholl, \u00e9 uma reliqui viciante", "timestamp_created": 1406599842, "timestamp_updated": 1406599842, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11215364": {"recommendationid": "11215364", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046235360", "num_games_owned": 182, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 73, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1403942853}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a mix between a Beat 'Em Up, and a platforming game.

There's no shortage of stage gimmicks and unique fodder enemies to pound away on, and how could you forget the positively over-the-top boss encounters, which will push your dexterity to the limit and require a good bit of thought to truly best. \n\nNoitu Love's difficulty is also balanced very well. Each of the game's difficulties suits a range of player skill levels, and advancing to a higher difficulty level doesn't only make enemies hit harder, they also have a few new tricks up their sleeve which keep things fresh and interesting. It's far from punishing like a lot of 2D platformers and action games these days tend to be, but you will be tested and failure only leads to more learning. \n\nAdd a couple unlockable playable characters with some fun stage variations between them on top and you've got an amazingly solid little package just eager for lovers of frantic old-school games to take hold of and enjoy.", "timestamp_created": 1401137131, "timestamp_updated": 1401137131, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 39, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.749228", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10192859": {"recommendationid": "10192859", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077765495", "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 147, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512146169}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "simplesmente compre... s\u00e9rio compre. \u00e9  10/10 :D", "timestamp_created": 1400717695, "timestamp_updated": 1511663263, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10065423": {"recommendationid": "10065423", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031907095", "num_games_owned": 292, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 152, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1392266560}, "language": "english", "review": "When this game isn't crashing, it's a pretty good time.", "timestamp_created": 1399671373, "timestamp_updated": 1399671373, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10064528": {"recommendationid": "10064528", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985704187", "num_games_owned": 721, "num_reviews": 184, "playtime_forever": 629, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1374880150}, "language": "english", "review": "STRAIGHT FOR THE JUGULAR", "timestamp_created": 1399665091, "timestamp_updated": 1399665091, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10061485": {"recommendationid": "10061485", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005922707", "num_games_owned": 239, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 465, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1400943321}, "language": "english", "review": "simple control! and very funny!!", "timestamp_created": 1399641568, "timestamp_updated": 1422506175, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500669", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9984448": {"recommendationid": "9984448", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034120615", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 295, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1398046505}, "language": "english", "review": "Just an incredibly fun game.

Granted, it's not all that long with the base story, but I found myself completing the game many times with the variety of unlockable characters available to you and the multiple difficulty settings. Too easy? That's okay, the game is more than happy to crank up the difficulty for you... no matter how experienced you are, there's always something fun and challenging for you here. Beat your previous score on the levels, shoot for an A ranking, or even just something as self-imposed as trying to go through the game without taking any damage. \n\nFor those few saying the combat is \"Boring\"... did you even go through the OPTIONAL tutorial available to you? There's many different attacks you can use, not just the simple punching up an enemy to bits one... (although even that is great fun) and the other two characters you unlock after beating the game in various ways each feature their own unique attack and movement styles... it's all great fun, so you really need to give it another go.\n\nTo anybody debating about purchasing this game, just go ahead and do it!

Of course, this game has its flaws, but it's a diamond for me, and so should be for everyone else.\n\nHave fun, folks!", "timestamp_created": 1387988966, "timestamp_updated": 1387988966, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8261858": {"recommendationid": "8261858", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058088022", "num_games_owned": 1006, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 94, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1387922910}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u304c\u3089\u5965\u6df1\u3044\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc\u3001\u723d\u5feb\u304b\u3064\u30b9\u30d4\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u306a\u30a2\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\uff01\n\u3068\u3066\u3082\u7f8e\u3057\u3044\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u306b\u3069\u3053\u304b\u61d0\u304b\u3057\u3044\u97f3\u697d\uff01\n\u30b9\u30b3\u30a2\u30a2\u30bf\u30c3\u30af\u3084\u30af\u30ea\u30a2\u7279\u5178\u306a\u3069\u30ea\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u6027\u3082\u8c4a\u5bcc\uff01\n\u3053\u308c\u306f\u3082\u3093\u304f\u306a\u3042\u3042\u3042\u3042\u3042\u3042\u3042\u3042\u3042\u3042\u3042\u3042\u3057\uff01\n\n\u3068\u8a00\u3044\u305f\u3044\u3068\u3053\u308d\u3060\u3051\u3069\u3001\u8d77\u52d5\u6642\u306e\u97f3\u304c\u3046\u308b\u3055\u304f\u3066\u6b7b\u306b\u305d\u3046\u306b\u306a\u3063\u305f\u308a\u3001\u753b\u9762\u304b\u3089\u4e3b\u4eba\u516c\u304c\u6d88\u3048\u3066\u306a\u304f\u306a\u3063\u305f\u308a\u3002\uff08\u518d\u8d77\u52d5\u3067\u76f4\u308b\u3051\u3069\u307e\u305f\u3046\u308b\u3055\u3044\uff09\n\u30a6\u30a3\u30f3\u30c9\u30a6\u5916\u3092\u9593\u9055\u3048\u3066\u30af\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u3057\u3066\u3059\u3050\u30bf\u30d6\u304c\u5207\u308a\u66ff\u308f\u3063\u305f\u308a\u3001\u30af\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u9023\u6253\u3059\u308b\u306e\u3067\u6307\u3059\u3054\u304f\u75db\u304f\u306a\u3063\u305f\u308a\u3002\n\u308f\u308a\u3068\u4e9b\u7d30\u306a\u4e8b\u3060\u3051\u308c\u3069\u3001\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u81ea\u4f53\u304c\u5b8c\u74a7\u3059\u304e\u3066\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u3068\u3053\u308d\u304c\u6c17\u306b\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3046\u3002\n\n\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u81ea\u4f53\u306f\u7d041\u6642\u9593\u534a\u307b\u3069\u3067\u30af\u30ea\u30a2\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002\n\u77ed\u3044\u6642\u9593\u3067\u3055\u3055\u3063\u3068\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u904a\u3073\u305f\u3044\u4eba\u306b\u3074\u3063\u305f\u308a\u306a\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3060\u3068\u601d\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u306a\u306b\u3088\u308a\u5b89\u3044\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1387924114, "timestamp_updated": 1387924114, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521196", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8233598": {"recommendationid": "8233598", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021302421", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 112, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1387844890}, "language": "english", "review": "cute & the bomb", "timestamp_created": 1387830613, "timestamp_updated": 1404794704, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499315", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8225508": {"recommendationid": "8225508", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026545345", "num_games_owned": 433, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1387810058}, "language": "english", "review": "Genuinely feels like a 16-bit game in its prime.

The digit appended to the end of the title begs the question \"is there a Noitu Love 1\" and yes there is. It's available as a free download on his website (http://www.konjak.org/). Noitu Love 2 is a throwback to the golden days of arcade games. Reminiscent of games like Metal Slug (sans the quarter consumption) this game is a very face paced and it won't leave you bored for a second. \n\nThe artwork is exceptional and each level features all new environmetal art and unique enemies. There are also loads of unique minibosses (usually around two to three a level). \n\nSadly there is no USB controller support for this game. It seems that the develop really had the keyboard and mouse in mind when designing this game. There doesn't seem to be any way to change the keybindings either. If you don't like the default controls then I am afraid you are out of luck.\n\nWith only seven levels the gameplay can be very short, especially considering the levels go by quickly but there are unlockables that give the game a fair bit of replayability. \n\nIf you're looking for a gratuitous fast based action scroller then I recommend this\nScore: 8/10\n\nP.S. - When I was on the developer's website I saw that he is developing a game called \"The Iconoclasts\" and it looks quite good.

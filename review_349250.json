A+\n\nThe game is made up of a ton of short levels in which you're thrown into an arena with some walls, platforms, enemies, and sometimes other things like conveyor belts, doors that are opened with electricity, or other more unique objects. You blast your way through all the Target Enemies using powers picked up in the level, then repeat for each other level. Variety comes from being given different weapons, fighting different enemies, the occasional boss, and of course, the worlds' unique gimmicks. The basic gameplay flow may sound repetitive, but the game generally stays pretty fresh, largely thanks to its great weapon variety, when considering how many ways there are to mix weapons.\n\nSince both characters are dramatically different, including in how their weapons act when they have the exact same weapons available, and since stages are completely redesigned for Hard mode, it's perfectly reasonable to want to fully clear both difficulties as both characters, which added up to about 28 hours for me. This included a enough of a dip into endless mode to unlock some bonus stages that required it, but not even trying everything available in endless mode, doing much with custom stages, or playing much with some of the gameplay modifiers that are gradually unlocked.\n\nThe writing of the game is decent enough, but mostly wisely stays out of the way of you destroying more robots.\n\nThe game's difficulty felt fine to me. It's a decent challenge, but not amazingly difficult.

Modifiers to make the game harder, easier, shinier, squeakier, or just plain weirder!\n\nThen we get in to player-created content!

"playtime_forever": 1684, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511050988}, "language": "english", "review": "Disclaimer: Steam only logs hours played while online; my in-game records show as almost 50 hours played, and that timer only goes up while in levels and such; it does not account for the time spent in the soundtest or gallery. And believe me, I've spent a few hours in those, as well. Worth noting that in those 48 hours, I am still not done Savant's hard mode (Only done up to World 6) and am still missing 5 or 6 achievements, mostly related to endless mode.\n\n\nCopy Kitty is, quite frankly, an example of Early Access done right. The game has been in development for a long time, and I first learned about it in 2012 when an LPer by the name of Raocow took a look at a much, much earlier build. Yet, it only came out on Steam in 2016, showing the dedication to making a good game instead of looking to make a quick buck like so many other Early Access titles. As of the first Steam Release, there's easily enough to rival many full games, and they're still working on additions.\n\nThe first impression is strong; your first time playing, it launches straight into the Tutorial - a Tutorial that serves to kick off the story, no less. Right away, you're launched into what the game has to offer, and what an offering it is! While it can best be described as \"Kirby ate the Gunstar Heroes,\" I realize not everyone has played Gunstar Heroes, so allow me to explain in slightly more detail what I mean.\n\nIn GH, you could get up to two weapons, and combine them or fire them individually. Copy Kitty takes this idea up to 11 by allowing you to combine up to three weapons. Although these weapons have finite ammunition, I do remind you of the \"Copy\" in the title; you're always getting more. Even one of the playable characters (Boki Lamira, the titular \"Copy Kitty,\") comments on how more enemies just means more powers to copy, and how it's a rather neat advantage to have. But that's not to say that the fights against fewer enemies are bad, either. Of particular note is a boss known as Arikan, who basically pulls a Meta Knight and gives you a sword for a one on one duel - a sword with a bunch of neat abilities you don't really get from other weapons, making it a popular enough boss that it got it's own music after it had already been implemented. It's always a good sign when the developers listen to the feedback and build on it.\n\nWhat really makes the game memorable, however, is simply it's personality. And I don't just mean how flashy the game looks, but the explosions do help. The banter between Boki and her uncle, Savant, is just the right mix of silly and serious. Many levels (most notably bosses, but not always bosses) will also provide hints after you lose one or more times, and some of these conversations are amusing - and without giving too much away, all I can say is... \"Freakish Experiment on Hard Mode.\" Anyone who's died to that boss knows exactly what I mean. I love it.\n\nI also need to mention the soundtrack; I'm not normally a fan of techno, but considering the setting of the game, it just works, and I find myself going back to the Sound Test regularly just to play it in the background as I work on other things. There's numerous variants of songs for specific situations (Such as the more cheerful music from World 1, and then a subdued version of it for a mission when you don't want to go in guns blazing.) The standard \"Low HP Beeps\" from many games have actually been worked into the soundtrack, with the song adjusting based on how damaged you are. The Sound Test even lets you toggle these damage thresholds to see how the music changes. It's a great way to get your attention without being infuriating within a short time.\n\nBetween two very distinct playable characters and over 40 hours of gameplay (Unless I just suck, which is admittedly a very real possibility - I did beat Boki's Extra World on Hard Mode, but it took me a few tries!) there's definitely enough here to keep you playing, and I basically reccommend it to anyone who likes this kind of thing.\n\n\nPros:\n- For an Early Access title, there's a LOT of content.\n- Tight controls and frantic action.\n- The artstyle is nice; flashy, but not gaudy.\n- A fleshed out setting via the Encyclopedia and Bestiary.\n- So much personality.\n- Goldeneye-style cheats: Infinite ammo? Invincibility? Sure, but it's just for fun, can't unlock anything with them on.\n- Fun achievements, like \"Kick this thing in the face!\" \n- The soundtrack, quite frankly, rocks.\n- Robust Level Editor lets you save and share entire level packs.\n\nCons:\n- Sometimes, the dazzling explosions can make it easy to get hit since it's hard to see!\n- A few enemies, like the Paradox Yinmiro Delta, can go die in a fire for all I care.\n- Controls can take a little getting used to; Boki doesn't shoot straight up, for example.\n- Some bosses can feel unfair, but at least Hard Mode lets you skip up to 5 levels.\n\n\nReccomendation: If the trailer looks appealing, you'll probably like it!", "timestamp_created": 1483539741, "timestamp_updated": 1483539741, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.572793", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28608143": {"recommendationid": "28608143", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081951932", "num_games_owned": 205, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 533, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483296854}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Cara, n\u00e3o me arrependo NEM UM POUCO em comprar esse jogo.

The story is a pile of mildly adorable videogame nonsense, but it doesn't really get in the way. Very quickly, you'll be immersed in a visually-offensive riot of glorious color making robots explode, and you won't care.\n\nIt's a 2-d shooter-platformer made of bite-size levels; they're anywhere from about 45 seconds to four minutes long and basically are all the same premise - Murder specific robots on the level. There's powerups and pickups and all the sorts of things you would expect; the game's USP is that is that the 10 main weapons that make up the game - any 3 of which you can hold at a time - can all be fused in any combination of two or three to produce a unique effect with a button press. On the simple end, a grenadelike weapon and a force bolt weapon combine to produce a homing rocket, for example. On the 'ridiculous' end, you can create room-clearing atomic tornadoes that spew wall-piercing razors or cascades of fragmenting explosives. There's a few on the 'useless' end - if it uses those stupid fiddly remote mines and doesn't clear a friggin' room, what's the damn point?! - but overall it does enough neat stuff to keep you wanting to try out other combinations.\n\nThe game aesthetic is garish; a shiny miasma of digital rainbows, lasers and explosions coupled with cartoony character models; like you'd just done Ecstacy while playing Mega Man while watching The Matrix. Fortunately for the game, I like garish. If you don't, options do exist to tone it up or down a touch - but there's even a Shiny Mode in the options I was delighted to discover. The explosions - and you will be creating many - have enough of a thwack to them to do the job, and the soundtrack is bouncy with echoes of 16-bit chiptunes; a suitably chipper mood-setter.\n\nIt's fun. It's flowing runny shooty double-jumpy fire-in-all-directions nuke-stuff fun. The game has apparently been in development for something like 5 years, and it kind of shows; a lot of potential niggles have been ironed out of the gameplay. I'll update this review as I find any, but the only glaring one is that swapping weapons out when you already have 3 is kind of clunky compared to the rest of the usually solid controls. \n\nUltimately: Give it a whirl if you're after some joyous vaguely felinoid robot smashing violence.", "timestamp_created": 1477211261, "timestamp_updated": 1477211261, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501968", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26143814": {"recommendationid": "26143814", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082806659", "num_games_owned": 299, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 327, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477654510}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u89e6\u308a\u3060\u3051\u3084\u3063\u305f\u611f\u60f3\u3001\u697d\u3057\u3044\u304b\u3089\u8cb7\u3048\n\n\u77ed\u3044\u9762\u3092\u30af\u30ea\u30a2\u3057\u3066\u3044\u304f\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u306e2D\u30a2\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3067\u3059\u3002\n\u7279\u5fb4\u7684\u306a\u4ed5\u69d8\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306f\n\u6575\u304c\u843d\u3068\u3059\u6b66\u5668(\u6280)(3\u3064\u307e\u3067\u540c\u6642\u306b\u6301\u3066\u308b)\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\u6226\u3046\u3068\u3053\u308d(\u67d0\u30d4\u30f3\u30af\u8272\u306e\u60aa\u9b54\u307f\u305f\u3044\u306a\u306e)\u3067,\n\u521d\u671f\u3067\u3082\u9283\u306f\u6483\u3066\u308b\u304c\u6b63\u76f4\u5f31\u3044\u3057\u3001\u8e74\u308a\u306f\u30ea\u30b9\u30af\u3042\u308b\u304b\u3089\u5fc5\u7136\u7684\u306b\u4f7f\u3046\u3053\u3068\u306b\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\n(\u7121\u9650\u306b\u306f\u6483\u3066\u306a\u3044\u4ed5\u69d8\u306a\u306e\u3067\u6b8b\u5f3e\u6570\u306b\u306f\u8981\u6ce8\u610f)\n\u305d\u3057\u3066\u6700\u5927\u306e\u76ee\u7389\u306f,\n\u6240\u6301\u3057\u3066\u308b\u6b66\u5668(\u554f\u7b54\u7121\u7528\u3067\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u3089\u308c\u306a\u3044\u3082\u306e\u4ee5\u5916\u306e\u6b66\u5668)\u306e\u7279\u5fb4\u3092\u7d44\u307f\u5408\u308f\u305b\u305f\u653b\u6483\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3068\u3053\u308d\u3067\u3059\uff01\n\u660e\u3089\u304b\u306b\u6027\u80fd\u304c\u4e0a\u304c\u3063\u3066\u96d1\u9b5a\u3092\u4e00\u6383\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3001\u30a8\u30d5\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3082\u6d3e\u624b\u3067\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u304c\u3042\u304c\u308a\u307e\u3059\uff01\n\u307e\u3042\u3001\u6587\u624d\u7121\u3044\u304b\u3089\u4e0a\u624b\u304f\u8a00\u3048\u306a\u3044\u3051\u3069\u3068\u306b\u304b\u304f\u8cb7\u3048\u3063\u3066\u3053\u3068\u3067\u3059\uff01\uff01\n\u306a\u304a\u3001\u5f8c\u6094\u3057\u3066\u3082\u8cac\u4efb\u306f\u53d6\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\uff01\n\n\u8ffd\u8a18:\n\u9032\u3081\u3066\u3044\u3063\u305f\u3089\u51fa\u6765\u308b\u884c\u52d5\u8ffd\u52a0\u3059\u308b\u5974\u304c\u62fe\u3048\u305f\u308a,\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306b\u4e57\u308c\u305f\u308a\u8272\u3005\u3042\u3063\u305f,\u8e74\u308a\u306f\u4f7f\u3044\u3053\u306a\u3059\u3068\u304b\u306a\u308a\u4f7f\u3048\u308b\u304b\u3089,\u4e0a\u306e\u99c4\u6587\u306f\u7121\u8996\u3057\u3066\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u3084\u308d\u3046\n\n2\u7a2e\u985e\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u304c\u5c45\u3066\u4e0a\u306b\u66f8\u3044\u305f\u5974\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044\u307b\u3046\u306f\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u7684\u306a\u6027\u80fd\u306b\u306a\u308b\u305e\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1477049999, "timestamp_updated": 1477055021, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523697", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26107057": {"recommendationid": "26107057", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017207206", "num_games_owned": 249, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471015208}, "language": "english", "review": "Highly recommend this game.

Mighty No 9 proved this as it was panned by most critics and was an utter disaster from Kickstarter to release. I personally know fans who still worship the ground that Mega Man X walks on. Praising the music, gameplay, game structure and so on and so forth. If you are looking for a fan base that is rabidly passionate and dedicated I would put Mega Man fans up near the top ten.\n\nWell I am more then happy to say that Copy Kitty is FAR from better then nothing.(See what I did there?) This game hits all the right cords when it comes to a side scroller action title. Now if you're paying attention you will note that the game is in Early Access but to be honest I forgot that it was by the time I decided to do this first impression piece. The game is exceptionally well put together for an EA title. The game has two playable characters with drastically different combat styles. Over a hundred levels, an endless mode, bosses, hard modes, custom levels and that is just Early Access. It's rather impressive and there is more to come which is exciting.\n\nThe game play itself is an homage to Mega Man but it plays with the formula a bit. You have all that buster cannon shooting, weapon stealing/combining action that you know and love however, the levels are all bite sized. Most levels can be completed in less then two minutes with boss fights taking up to four at the max. This leads to very fast, very chaotic gameplay that can become very overwhelming at the beginning. Once you settle in though the action becomes a fluid dance of explosions and mixing and matching.\n\nKitty our hero, can take up to three weapons/buffs from her enemies, then combine them into a super weapon of sorts. This leads to an endless variety of weapons that all have spectacular use and visuals to match. \n\nSadly, you lose the combo of weapons you have at the end of the every level and start over again in most cases. Sometimes you are allowed to bring one weapon of your choosing but getting familiar with everything is going to take a while as more weapons are added. I found myself just spamming the combine weapon attack and not really caring about whats around. This will do the trick most of the time but future bosses and levels will prove difficult with this strategy. I think dedicated levels to certain weapons would be an excellent idea. This is present in the game but isn't very in depth currently.\n\nCopy Kitty has its ducks in a row graphically and musically. There are times where I wish the colors were more vibrant and areas more detailed like the cut scenes  but the level design is suffice and explosions a plenty for me to not really notice.\n\nOf course there is a cadre of robots ranging from  self destructing, bunny tossing, shield bearing, the robots can get pretty crazy and the bosses even more so. Enemy design is exceptionally well done here and I never got tired of blasting robot enemies to bits. Now one thing I did feel was the levels were very short, perhaps too short. The length at which some of them can be designed seems almost limited in space. Lack of longevity could be due to the ability to create your own custom levels but those who enjoyed long robust levels in classic Mega Man might find a gripe with that.\n\nWhile most of the features are already in place and I could definitely go on and on about this game. There is still more to come so I will reserve my final judgement for release. Copy Kitty is an impressive title and gives a strong showing straight out of the gate. Any fan of retro-action titles is going to love Copy Kitty. The games price will be increasing once final release hits. The developer plans for more levels, polish to levels, and general upgrades.\n\nThat being the case I still feel highly confident in saying that there is already a game here. So buy it now if you like what you see as more is coming in the months ahead.

The main character, Boki, has a pithy, weak weapon, but the player is able to absorb up to three powers from enemies and combine them in any which way, leading to powerful and often gloriously fabulous particle effect destruction.\n\nThe story is a bit forgettable, as Boki's uncle, Savant, is using the program to explore the title \"Copy Kitty's\" powers with a simulation. The story mode, I would classify as almost a puzzle game. You are supposed to destroy specific enemies, and there are various obstacles to prevent Boki from just steamrolling anything in your way. Certain things your weapons can't go through, or you yourself can't go through, etc. Marked enemies act as keys to green doors as well. There is a lot of visual information on the screen at any one time, but visual cues tie you in to the important elements of the level.\n\nThe bosses of story mode are all unique experiences, even considering the persistent midboss that keeps following you around. Each one feels unique; sometimes Boki will leverage the copying ability to gain an upper hand halfway through the fight, or often the course of the fight will completely change at some points. They are very rewarding experiences in terms of varied gameplay.\n\nThe endless mode is more a pure arcade game, where the element of chance and randomness are there to thrill the player with brief tastes of their favorite weapons in an environment that constantly changes. \n\nThe controls are servicable but can feel a bit stiff at times. Boki has a lot of moves, and her kick attack is very important because it can destroy some terrain and deflect or even reflect bullets. Practice is key to mastery, but I can see how some people may get frustrated early on. Boki lacks certain abilities like a pass-down jump, which is easy to forget, and some of her moves have both a button and a dual input command, like her dodge roll, which takes the command normally used in other games for a pass-down jump.\n\nThe \"feel\" of the game is marvelous. Inspiration is taken from Mega Man, Metroid, and Kirby, as well as sprinklings of other video games, and the varied effects are memorable and charming. If you are a fan of video game explosions, this is a game for you. The music is a bit repetitive but energetic, and has layers for things like invincibility and low health (the siren of which is not annoying, thankfully).\n\nOverall, I would highly suggest you play this game if you love both nuanced action games and the feeling of being on a power trip. Copy Kitty does a great job at feeling both complex and simple at the same time. There is a lot of content, room for mastery of levels (with appropriate markers to tell you what you've done), and even a completely different way to play with Boki's uncle Savant; he feels a lot different and not a mere \"pallete swap\".\n\nTo sum up, give Copy Kitty a try.

Because to me, this game failed at one of the biggest things it was trying to accomplish: it isn't satisfying to kill enemies.\n\nNOW HOLD ON: When I got to the first boss, I couldn't believe I was even playing the same game. The introduction to the boss itself and the entire second half of the fight (once I got that crazy Super Sayain power-up) were some of the most satisfying feelings I've felt fighting in a sidescroller since Symphony of the Night (I dont play a lot of side-scrollers...). I understand why the whole game can't play like this, but... let me explain.\n\nThe regular levels of this game, in both navigation and fighting, were both remarkably unsatisfying and almost embarrasing to play out. So much effort goes into making each hit and explosion something wonderful, but at the end of the day it isn't. You can dye a vanilla cake to look like a rainbow, but you wont be tasting skittles, if you know what I mean. Most of the levels i was able to complete without even looking at the screen. i spent a majority of my play time just holding down the C button (and if nothing was happening, the X button) and left or right. Because I couldn't care, because the game didn't try to make me care. It almost felt like it was just going to assume I found all the explosions and text boxes neat enough to carry my interest, but it didn't. The attacks had no weight to them, happened so frequently they never felt impactful, and often times the screen was so cluttered I wasn't even sure who's attacks were hitting who. There was never any real time to focus on what I was doing or why. The whole time I played I almost heard the game developer's voice, telling me how exciting all the action was and how much fun I was having. Because that's what it all felt like to me: an experience designed to look like it's a fun and exciting time, without actually being a fun and exciting time. Like a haunted house that turns out to just be your uncle's scary basement.\n\nI had a few other points I wanted to make (the jump arc is way too heavy considering how floaty the game is, the momentum is ridiculous and makes precision movement almost impossible, I'd say etc. but that's really it), but really, the big think I wanted to touch on is the lack of any real sense of danger, as well as the complete absense of a feeling of reward (okay that's not true... I already said my shpeal about the boss though). It felt like a very superficial game, that focused more on cosmetic details in favour of finding the source of what really makes games like this fun to play. The shooting was boring and flat, i never felt like I was really shooting anything, was unable to become immersed in the experience, and overall found myself wishing for better things. And that's just not what a game should do. \n(in my opinion, at least.)", "timestamp_created": 1473041752, "timestamp_updated": 1473090220, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.383311", "comment_count": "12", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25349794": {"recommendationid": "25349794", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093301190", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 9544, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1044, "last_played": 1516233481}, "language": "english", "review": "A spectacular game.\n\nThe visuals are bright, colorful, and stunning; the levels and bosses are extremely fun; and the music is great.

Unfortunately, the game suffers from cluttered level design and obnoxious graphics and an overall unrefined experience.\n\nBased on world 1 and the first half of world 2, the level design is fairly bland and uninspired. Aside from world themes (which based on the screenshots and trailer seem fairly typical) levels just seem to be a mesh of blocks and enemy oversaturation; there does not seem to be any real rhyme or reason to the layout. Often times most of the challenge would just come from enemy spam rather than clever placement or AI. However, this may have been tolerable if it weren't for the horrifically noisy graphics. Even aside from the less than decent enemy and character designs, the sheer brightness from the bullets mixed with the glowing enemies and platforms makes it difficult to comprehend what is happening on screen. Many times I've found myself damaged by an enemy I couldn't even tell was on screen, so it just blended into the screen. The worst case of this was the first water level, where I didn't notice either air meter while underwater until I started seeing my health drop dramatically because it was just a few more elements added to the clutter.\n\nThis also brings me to my next point: a lot of mechanics are not introduced properly. I will say that the tutorial stage is done well and I do understand that the newer mechanics are relatively self-explanatory. However, the game seems to not acknowledge features like talismans, solo powers, or enemy spawners at all, making the elements feel a lot more tacked on. Players should at the very least be aware that these items exist, and, in the case of water, at least a mention at the beginning of the stage would be nice. The beginning stage banter is a simple way of rectifying this. The default keyboard controls are also fairly obtuse; arrow keys for movements feel really outdated, and there were times where dodging was somewhat annoying to pull off. While customizing keys and controller options are there, a \"simple\" control setup should be improved enough for players who don't want to fiddle around. Also, jumping feels somewhat off; it feels like your character is too heavy and falls back down too fast.\n\nWhile none of these other issues are as major, there are still a lot of improvements that could be made. The music is passable, but does not stand out particularly well; it's not something I'd listen to outside of the game. The story feels fairly uninspired but at the same time it probably isn't the vocal point of the game anyway, so it's not that big of a deal. The power-ups also feel relatively standard, but they all seem to work fine and the three-power combinations do feel fairly satisfying to use (though I feel that with the large amount of power-ups it will be inevitable that only a select few are useful, compared to the more refined few available in Gunstar Heroes). Personally I think the enemy spawning powers and the solo powers are more trouble than they're worth, but I'll give the benefit of the doubt that other players may find them enjoyable. And while this is a particularly minor complaint, I do wonder if all the enemy names are just randomly generated.\n\nI haven't played much of this game, though I played some of the demo a few years ago, but personally I don't think the story is compelling enough for me to go farther in story mode, and endless mode sounds self-explanatory that I don't feel I need to play it.

It's loud and satisfying and everything blows up *just right*.\n\nThe main gimmick of Copy Kitty is that (for the main character, at least - there's two with entirely different weapon systems) is that you can hold up to three weapons at once, and every single combination of two or three also generates a uniquely named combination attack that has properties from all three components. Each weapon has limited ammo and every level has a different set to find, so you're going to constantly be juggling your arsenal and never sticking to one set of attacks for any length of time.\n\nOn top of the hundreds of ways to shoot stuff, there's also a basic melee attack that can be used to deflect attacks (or return to sender if timed perfectly) and a dodge-roll, meaning that skilled players can pull off some very technical play, although all of this means there's a lot to learn. Even moreso when you consider that there's a second character with an even more technical combat style, and also a 'Hard Mode' that continues the story and completely remixes the levels and bosses.\n\nIf I had one grumble about the game it's that it's locked to a 4:3 aspect ratio, with any remaining space on a widescreen monitor just being black. Even if the game itself isn't going to make the jump to widescreen, it would be nice to see that space being filled with the HUD or wallpaper.\n\nDon't be put off by the early access badge either.

The developer plans to extend the story a little further in later updates, but there's more than enough to chew on as-is.\n\nHighly recommended.", "timestamp_created": 1472470478, "timestamp_updated": 1472470478, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537037", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25218720": {"recommendationid": "25218720", "author": {"steamid": "76561198277411494", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4585, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503185214}, "language": "english", "review": "I had been playing this game off and on up to version 1.61, and have loved every bit of it. Really, the only reason I had stopped playing was just because I was waiting for the Steam release that was in the works. :P\n\nOf course, I bought it as soon as I learned that it had come out on early access, and I don't regret it for a moment. The hard work that's gone into even just the last 2 years of development (out of 5+ total) is very apparent; the primary issues that I had with the game back in version 1.61 (telling Boki's shots apart from enemy shots, switching between powers in real-time being a pain at best, having to replay every level several times to reach 4 oftentimes conflicting targets (time, score, enemy, and damage targets), etc.) have all been addressed completely.\n\nSavant is playable, with his own set of abilities and playstyle. Cutscenes have been added for both characters' story modes. Even more \"solo abilities\" have been added. Existing bosses have been refined and have entirely new tricks up their sleeve. New bosses have been created, including a recurring thorn in Boki's side. ;) Some existing levels have been re-ordered, many have been refined at least slightly, and entire worlds have been added. There's now a lore encyclopedia in addition to the (improved) bestiary. Ability switching is now done via a slick side-menu that pauses the action, which makes strategic usage of them much more viable in the heat of battle (especially when it comes to \"solo abilities\"). Instead of 4 different \"perfection\" targets being set for every level, only the \"damage taken\" one exists now.[1]\n\nI don't know how much of the above was added to the freeware release(s) since version 1.61, but I do know this: Copy Kitty was awesome back then, and it's at least 200% more awesome now. So awesome, that I had to leave this review, which is something I rarely do for anything, because words are hard. :P\n\nIn short:\nIs the game \"worth it\"? [b]YES[/b]. It has many hours of enjoyable and genuinely fun content even in \"early access\". I'd have easily paid up to 30 Canadian Dollars for it, although admittedly that's because I would have known what I was getting for the price. Still, even without that knowledge, the current price of CDN$ 10.99 almost feels like stealing. :O\nWould I recommend this to others? [i][b]YES[/b][/i]. Strongly. Stronger that a dragon summoned forth to destroy the [virtual] world and all the Constructs that reside in it! \\ :D /\n\nSide note:\n[1] That last point might sound like a bad thing, but the game has so much content as it is, that the multiple playthroughs per level that would often be needed to attain every target ended up feeling excessive and draining even, in my experience. Limiting it to one clear \"extra\" goal per level (take as little damage as possible) was a smart move, and additionally shows that the developers have already learned one of the most crucial lessons of game design: \"Knowing when to stop.\" Trust me; I've played a lot of fan games, and it's not as common sense as one might think... ;)", "timestamp_created": 1472431022, "timestamp_updated": 1472431022, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500416", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25117992": {"recommendationid": "25117992", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050983465", "num_games_owned": 3151, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 57, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472098005}, "language": "english", "review": "Ive had my eye on this gem for years and upvoted this on greenlight long ago.

Anche lui ha diverse abilit\u00e0, ma pu\u00f2 combinarne soltanto due alla volta; dunque \u00e8 necessario scegliere con attenzione quello che pi\u00f9 si addice a quella situazione. \nInoltre il personaggio di Savant pu\u00f2 volare, teletrasportarsi e creare barriere per un breve periodo di tempo, mentre Boki ottiene un doppio salto, una scivolata e calci.\nIl gioco \u00e8 abbastanza semplice da gestire nel complesso, ma spesso sono i comandi ad essere complicati e a rendere non facilissimi spostamenti e attacchi.\n\n[b]Comparto tecnico[/b]\n\nPer quanto riguarda il comparto sonoro, la musica non \u00e8 malvagia, anche se i temi non sono dei pi\u00f9 variegati, ma comunque sono abbastanza differenti per le varie fasi e azioni.

(If you really want to, don't really wanna force you now, do I?)\n\nAlso, the final(?) main update is comming soon.\n\nWill I update this review again when it comes out?\n\nUmmm... I don't know if I will...\n\nI'm lazy.", "timestamp_created": 1471824434, "timestamp_updated": 1511489325, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467297", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25051025": {"recommendationid": "25051025", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053700794", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4973, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488640151}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent game. The game features two modes to play the game, story and endless. In story mode you play through premade stages, each with unique terrain, where you have to destroy all the target enemies or a boss. Since there are different enemies each stage you always have different powers to copy and combine, which makes the stages even more varied and fun. At first it is not very difficult, but it can be challenging before you get used to the controls, however, after you beat normal mode you can play hard mode, which continues the story, has new enemies and new bosses, the terrain is based on the normal mode equivalent stage, but is often altered in some way. While the game can be difficult at times, these times are often the times when you can become the most powerful. Also, if you lose a boss battle multiple times you usually get tips on how to beat it from Savant, this also applies to some stages that the dev suspects the player might have trouble with.\n\nIn endless mode the terrain is always generated and every tenth wave (11, 21 and so forth) you switch to a different biome. Here you also have to destroy the enemies, with the fifth and ninth wave being minibosses and the tenth being a boss for every biome. The big boss is set for every biome but which enemies and minibosses you face is semi-random, it picks from enemies fitting the biome. If you want to mix things up from the standard endless you can either play in a set of four themed biomes, or you can play pandemonium, where every enemy has new randomized attacks for each session (it does stay consistent during the session). \n\nYou can play as two characters, Boki, our main hero, can hold and combine three base powers into very powerful combinations, she is the more straightforward of the two characters and has the most raw power, she much more likely to fill the screen with destruction. Savant, Boki's adoptive uncle and in-universe creator of the simulation they play, can also hold three powers, but can only combine two, but the order matters, which means that he always has many different combined powers to choose from, you have to choose the one that fits the situation best. All his powers originate from a window, or sometimes multiple windows, which window you get depends on what base power you use or combine. Savant can fly, teleport and create barriers for a short time, while Boki gets a double jump, a dodge roll and kicks (including a drill kick, which works a bit like an aeriel dodge). The characters both control well and are very responsive, but sometimes it can be hard to aim with them because you only have one set of direction buttons which both aims and moves them, but that is one of the game's only flaws.\n\nThe music is very good, there aren't very many base themes (11), but there are many variations of every theme and the music flows seamlessly between them. Every variation is different and has a new feel even though it shares the same base melody and length with other themes. Furthermore every theme also has extra layers which are sometimes added to the main track, these include the game's low HP warning, which has a different version for each theme that is incorporated into the theme, which makes it awesome rather than annoying, there are also other extra layers but these don't play very often, they're usually associated with an enemy or a rare power.\n\nThe game has an extensive encyclopedia and bestiary which holds a lot of lore for the game's setting. It also has an art gallery, modifiers (which alter the game, like cheats) and a sound test which allows you to listen to nearly every variation of ever track in the game. You can take in game screenshots and the game records your playing for replays, it saves the ten most recent ones and the ones you choose to save forever. There are also gameplay stats if you're interested.\n\nOverall, the game is fun, varied and has a lot of content, it also does many things right which other games do wrong (such as the implementation of the low HP warning).

While I won't say the game has the highest production values, being an indie title with a small development team... the polish and thought that's been put into the mechanics are quite refreshing. I'm taking some shots in the dark here, but it would seem to me the developers have been heavily influenced by Treasure's 2D action games like Gunstar Heroes and Bangai-O. And if that is indeed what they were going for, they nailed it, all they while providing their own unique spin on things.\n\nIn Copy Kitty's main Story Mode, you traverse a large variety of stages as one of two playable characters: Boki, an immensely powerful catgirl training to be a superhero; Or her genius insectoid uncle Savant. While both of them play extremely differently, chaotic action is the order of the day. In each stage, as you defeat enemies, they drop power-ups that you can combine together to create an enormous plethora of destructive weapons. While the weapons you have access to will depend on the current stage, a whole bunch of explosions filling the screen is entirely normal here. As you progress through the game and become familiar with the mechanics and weapon combinations, the game will start to feel like your own personal playground of destruction. Although with that said, that's certainly not to say the game isn't a challenge. Sometimes the screen will up with enemy projectiles, and when combined with your own it can be tough to tell exactly what's happening. Thankfully, the game is quite generous with its health system, so you don't have to worry about making a few mistakes here and there. There are also quite a few bosses and minibosses to contend with as well as you make your way through the campaign, and pretty much all of these are over the top and a blast to fight against. Top notch marks on that!\n\nAside from story mode, the game also has an Endless Mode which turns the game into something more akin to a roguelike. You navigate constantly shifting landscapes as you eliminate enemies and bosses. As you might expect, the difficulty ramps up the longer you survive. There are two difficulties for this mode as well. In general this mode is much more freeform than the story mode, but it's certainly interesting in its own right and gives you an opportunity to mess around with everything the game has to offer. Once again, I'm compelled to call the game a playground of destruction.\n\nAside from the two main modes, the game also has a level editor, and a surprising amount of unlockables. It's got everything from a bestiary where you can find interesting and often adorable information about the game's many foes, to unlockable modifiers that can greatly change the way the game is played. It's actually pretty surprising just how much content this game has given the seemingly small size of its development team. On top of all that, I'm constantly charmed by the game's surprisingly well done dynamic soundtrack. As you run low on HP, there's an audible warning that integrates itself uniquely into each of the game's tracks. As you transition from a regular stage to one of the miniboss stages, the music will dynamically shift to a more intense version of the same theme. Your mileage may vary on this one, but I love the attention to detail that's gone into the soundtrack.\n\nSure, as I write this the game is still in early access... but as it is now, it is more than worth your $10 if you're looking for a compelling 2D shooter. It's certainly not perfect, the main issue being visibility as explosions and projectiles fill the screen... but the game is just so damn fun that it's easy to forgive, and there's more than enough content to hold you over for many hours.

Go into a level, and blast all the enemies in it or reach the end to win. In that sense it's like a regular platformer. Our heroine, Boki, can shoot the \"Boki Beam\" which is a pretty puny looking blast that doesn't do a lot. Once you kill your first enemy, that's when you're introduced to the meat of the game. As you could assume by the title, there is a copy system. Much like Kirby 64, you can absorb powers from fallen foes and gain completely unique abilities by combining them. You can store up to three powers from a possible 10 base powers, and there's a unique function and name for each one. I didn't even mention the particularly fun \"Solo\" abilities, which consist of things like Street Fighter dragon kicks and summoning little minions to attack for you. \n\nDiscovering every possible combination is part of the enjoyment, and being able to blitz through a level with a combined ability called \"Aurora Star\" is probably the most satisfying thing ever. It is from here that this game plays like a crazy psychedelic Metroid or Mega Man X, and man is it FUUUN. Throw in some giant robots for good measure, and you've got a solid game on your hands. The game itself is tight and responsive, and the sound and visual effects really make you feel like you're doing something. And you are, after all.\n\nLuckily there's quite a bit of content here. There are a LOT of levels with more coming soon, and then there's an Endless Mode and an alternate campaign for a second character you unlock later. On top of that there's a little database containing information on the enemies (as well as how many of that particular enemy you've killed or lost to) and the characters themselves.\n\nThe graphics themselves seem to consist of pre-rendered 3D models, but it doesn't look as awkward as you'd think. It looks quite nice, and there's all sorts of pretty particle effects for the explosions and your abilities, allowing you to create one helluva lightshow with your powers.\n\nI'd say the controls are really the only falling point, as they're a little hard to get used to and sometimes the action gets way too fastpaced for what you need to be doing. \n\n[h1]Key Points[/h1]\n+ Colorful and interesting visual style\n+ Fun fast-paced gameplay\n+ The ultimate power fantasy\n+ Solid music\n+ Plenty of playtime and replay value\n+ Boki is adorable\n+ Boki's bug-uncle has a really nice suit\n- The controls aren't the best\n\n[h1]Get If[/h1]\n- You like action platformers\n- You like Kirby 64 or Mega Man\n- You like the concept of Kirby in general\n- You like colorful shit and power trips\n\n[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]\nGEDDIT IT'S COLORFUL AND FUN AND A TOTAL BLAST\nWORTH YOUR MONEY", "timestamp_created": 1471640984, "timestamp_updated": 1471934232, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24993854": {"recommendationid": "24993854", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119469822", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1360, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487117218}, "language": "english", "review": "OK so, Imagine if Kirby and Megaman had a baby, and that baby was a power absorbing wannabe hero cat, That's Copy Kitty. \nIn all seriousness, this game is amazing, great visuals, great soundtrack.\nThere is a learning curve, but this game can be mastered fairly quickly, dying isn't a punishment as there's no lives system.\nThere are tonnes of references from so many different genres.

The game didn't look very fun and I could barely understand what was happening in the videos usually, but once I tried the game I instantly understood.\n\nThis game is controlled chaos. You have access to a ridiculous amount of weapon combinations available to you, and each one is unique. If  you know what you're doing and have good combinations, you can blow through the levels. It's all about starting each level being weak, and slowly becoming a overpowered being of pure destruction as the level progresses. It never gets old.\n\nThe game is short, but the game is also cheap, so I don't see it as an issue. Each level has a hard mode which very different from the original, and you can play through the entire game as a second character who plays completely differently and has his entire own set of combinations.\n\nI don't usually write review, but I just don't think this game is getting enough attention.

The flashy rainbow-filled explosive fun begins immediately and only keeps climbing from there. It offers endless satisfaction as you wipe out hordes of hugely creative and diverse (and often amusingly silly) varieties of robots, as well as explore many vibrant and colorful worlds, and do battle with numerous engaging and memorable bosses. All providing you with a constant feeling of immense power and destructive capability.\n\nStory Mode filled me with a strong sense of curiosity and wonder that I've not felt for a game to such an extent in a long time. Every level is gorgeous to look at, a pleasure to learn and navigate, and rewarding to clear. I was always anxious and excited to see what's next. What super powerful weapon combo will I discover today? What neat mechanics will be introduced? What bosses lie ahead? What will the next worlds look like, how does the story progress through them, and what kind of lore will I uncover? There was always a reason to keep pressing forward and be pleasantly surprised by what I found. Even after discovering everything, I wasn't disappointed, because it's still a limitless joy to revisit the massive variety and enjoy each scenario again.\n\nMost of the levels are relatively small, so a lot of progress can be made in a short time while not feeling over too soon. Even if you struggle on one, you learn a little bit each time you fail. The small areas not only make them easier to retry a whole bunch if needed, but they always make victory feel within reach too. All of the above applies to Hard Mode as well. It's always fun seeing what's familiar and what's new in terms of presentation, challenge, and enemy varieties, and how they change the circumstances. The boss upgrades are especially menacing, but all the more satisfying to conquer.\n\nEndless Mode is also a fantastic time. Just the fact that the terrain and enemies are constantly changing around you is wondrous in itself, creating everlasting chaos and always keeping you on your toes. Weapon combos are often more situational in Story Mode, but here you'll discover unique combinations a lot more spontaneously because all of the components are provided at varying points. Each wave is super short and environment progress is checkpointed every 5 waves, so exploring everything is always an attainable goal. Dozens of environments to experience and many ever-changing conditions make each run feel different, so the replay value is immense.\n\nBoth modes are hugely fun, and picking a favorite really comes down to whether you want organized and deliberately-arranged scenarios, or much more randomized and chaotic ones, with every aspect of the gameplay being extremely well suited to both. I often find myself switching between them regularly because I'm in the mood for either at different times, and I'm unable to pick a favorite because both are just that enjoyable in their own ways. In addition to all of that, there's even a fully-functional level editor at your disposal. Even with all of the experiences present in the game, there's still the capacity to create your own scenarios as you please and even create packs to share with others. It comes packed with a vast assortment of enemies, weapons, and environmental options, so you can pretty much create whatever you can imagine in the game. You can even customize the Hard Mode of each level a lot!\n\nThis game offers a huge degree of challenges and experiences that do eventually become pretty hard, but I found it to be really simple to try out and get a feel for from the start. Control is super smooth and customizable, with tutorials that are quick and easy while doing a great job of showing everything you're capable of. The earliest levels of either mode start you off in really tame territory, so no matter when it gets tough, you always have something to fall back on to practice with and it never makes you tackle a situation until you're ready for it, even if some things take a little while. The smooth difficulty curve, replayability, and ability to alternate between modes at your leisure makes the game fantastic at training you if you give it the time and patience. The level editor's great for this too, as you can make something based around anything you struggle with at any difficulty you desire until you get the hang of it.\n\nI can't praise this game enough or fully describe just how amazing playing the game has been and continues to be for me, and I still not sure I've done that feeling proper justice. I'd strongly recommend this to anyone who enjoys platformers, shooters, robots, lasers, cute things, cyberspace, or colorful atmospheres of any kind, perhaps even video games as a whole. Even if you're not great at platformers, the movement is incredibly generous and comfortable, and the game is far more focused on combat with the platforming really being more a way to traverse and explore rather than being a point of skill.

The simple premise - copy and combine up to three enemy attack types to produce well over 100 unique weapons on the main character alone - carries both the Story Mode's 120+ puzzle-maze levels and the Endless Mode's small but looping arena battles against unpredictable enemies, dynamic terrain and weather extremely well.\n\nBoth modes are punctuated by some brilliant bosses, each of which typically drops unique copy abilities so you can throw their own attacks right back at them. This leads to some absolutely brilliant moments - my favourite involved uppercut-jousting with a recurring miniboss inside a tornado, set to the most rocking music in the game. Some bosses fill the screen and use devastating, sweeping attacks - others are smaller, but their speed makes up for their lack of presence, forcing you to duck and dive around them and their attacks. I won't spoil the final and hidden bosses, but let's just say they're incredibly worth experiencing.\n\nThe amount of polish in the game is absurd for such a small team, with the variable-mix music and huge array of stage types working wonders. Little things like the bestiary listing off nearly every single enemy type and their weaknesses, or the fact that every single weapon and combination - for both characters! - has a unique name, that's care and attention to detail that just makes the experience that much better. There's even a full-featured level editor.\n\nBoki, the lead character, is all about chaotic destruction - her attacks are mostly straightforward and blasting, if not entirely screen-devastating. Some of her powers - especially those incorporating the \"Remote\" weapon type - take a little to learn their quirks, but prove essential nonetheless. While you're sure to find a favourite weapon combination or two, variety is exceptionally high and you'll likely find yourself trying out nearly all of them one way or another - some stages require a little more thought, but never demand excessive precision. She double-jumps, rolls, kicks, and generally handles in a way that should feel innately familiar to fans of classic platformers, but her terrain-destroying and projectile-reflecting kicks and impressive dynamic arsenal set her apart as a unique hero.\n\nThe second character, Savant, provides a slower, more tactical pace and a whole different set of weapons using an entirely different approach - flying and warping around the stage with carefully-positioned weapons. The stages may be the same, but they play almost completely differently as a result. He only mixes two weapons at once, but the order you mix them in matters, so his weapon variety is still staggeringly high. He unlocks fairly shortly into the game, and I strongly recommend giving him a spin.\n\nAll in all, Copy Kitty has absolutely taken me by storm, and I reckon it'll do the same for you if you like games which can do both chaos and tactics at the same time. This game has both in spades, providing both delightful neon firework displays and fraught battles in which you'll be hanging on to that last flicking point of health as you overcome challenge after challenge.

As mentioned in previous reviews, I've actively been looking for run and gun shooters.  Let's face it, Boki isn't exactly the Bill Rizer or Lance Bean I was originally looking for, but the mobility and power combination mechanic displayed in the trailer were more than enough to pique my interest.  It sort of reminded me of Mega Man and Kirby in a way, but in the end it turns out Copy Kitty does a great job of being its own game.\n\nThe general story is that the main character Boki receives a virtual reality style combat simulator game as a present for her birthday from her uncle.  Boki is sucked into the simulator where she must battle her way through each level.  Despite not being particularly confident in her abilities, it turns out she is quite powerful.  Other than her wicked kung-fu kicks, she is able to take powers from defeated enemies and make use of them herself.  Boki can hold three powers at a time and can use them individually or combine them all together for a unique power attack.  In addition to the powers, there are also power-up items that bestow assorted temporary abilities.  The various powers not only serve as weapons, but also as tools for navigating stages.\n\nIn story mode each level is divided up into roughly ten stages.  The stages are short, fast paced, and filled with combat.  Unlike some platformers where the goal is to navigate your way to the the end of each level, in Copy Kitty the objective is to destroy the enemies.  It's a game that is much more focused on combat than precise jumps with instant death pits and spikes.  As of writing this I've almost completed the game on normal as Boki and I don't recall seeing any instant death hazards at all.  Boki is easy to control (though I do recommend using a gamepad) and combat is satisfying. You can also eventually play as Boki's Uncle Savant.  I haven't experimented too much with him yet but he has a completely different play-style.  Other than story mode, the game also features a randomly generated endless mode, and a level editor to create your own stages.\n\nAs far as presentation goes, the game looks good for the most part.  The enemies are creative and there are some incredible boss battles.  During combat there are colorful explosions and rainbow bursts all over the place.  The only criticism I have regarding graphics is that I think there is room for improvement in the way some of the stages appear.  The majority of the stages look good but overall I felt that Boki, the enemies, and the bosses all seemed to be a lot more visually polished in comparison.  The soundtrack is solid and I've had a few of the songs stuck in my head since I started playing.  It's worth mention that the game features an awesome extras menu with a detailed bestiary, concept art, sound-test, and play stats.  Why don't more games have bestiaries?\n\nEven though it's in early access, Copy Kitty is a very solid game right meow.  There is already a lot of content and the developers are planning to add two additional worlds.  According to the store page the game should leave early access about a year from now.  I'm definitely looking forward to see what will change between now and then as I feel the offered package is already strong.  The available content is certainly worth the asking price of 9.99 and I'd recommend it to people looking for an action platformer that leans more towards the action side than it does platforming.\n\nEdit: Started hard mode, it kicked the explosions up to 11.  I was already enjoying it before but this cemented it.  What can I say? I like a challenge.

The UI is not great, as the characters sit smack dab in front of the information. There are also items in-game which allow you to change the appearance of the character to look as though you're wearing your equipped armor set, but this could have been made automatic through Ruby. The game isn't all that difficult, and every enemy has only 1 or 2 attacks, bar some exceptions. I've pretty much butchered every boss in 6-7 hits.\n\nUltimately. the game's technical drawbacks and incredibly fast progression feel rushed, but aside from that, the story has some interesting moments, the art is actually really cool, but the enviroments could have had a bit more work. The music is the really what carries the game from point A to point B. Without Chez's heavily distorted guitar riffs and omnious french vocals, the world would be much more uninteresting, even with the art style and animations. \n\nSo like I said. 6/10. If the creator ever wanted to remake this game, or pop a sequel like LISA:TPRPG, I would be more than happy to contribute funds to it. This game just screams potential, and I will gladly see what else Samu has to offer.

playthrough I got stuck, choosing anything other than long sword in the first area was basically beg to die to the same enemy 7 times, and after I got stuck in a later part of the game, I realized that the Dregs the bosses dropped are used to increase your max health, after I had sold all of them.\n\nI made a new character, made the right decision to use all Dregs, and the difficulty lowered tremendously, was never overwhelmed, making the right decisions on armor and weapons and you didn't have to look at any health items.\nThe character walking slowly when you have to backtrack was irritating, though you could argue that it's part of the feel of the game.\n\nEven then I still loved this experience very much, extremely worth if you are an OFF fan, or fan of any RPGmaker

I stumbled upon this game while looking for something to play one day. I didn't expect much from it, as it was a free game, but I was blown away by the quality. Enzo is fuckin' adorable.\n\nThe game is incredibly immersive, has a fairly unique storyline, and a really stylistic art style (I found it to be reminiscent of school doodles and the OFF game, actually) and the characters are all rather diverse and have interesting designs. The gameplay was enjoyable, and the battle system runs relatively smoothly and wasn't too repetitive. The game isn't too difficult to progress through as well; some bosses took me 1-3 times to beat but that was it. On another note, the music and the sound effects used were strangely good. It sounded like strange noises the first couple of times you hear it, but after that it really gets you into the game...somehow. It's weird.\nSome of the flaws of the game, I'd say, were that the storyline was a bit confusing and progressed pretty fast to me (or maybe I'm just stupid lol) and there were a lot of characters and names mentioned that were kinda hard to grasp and remember their significance in the story. \n\nBut really, that's just like one flaw I could think of. Other than that I think this game is definitely worth trying; it is pretty enjoyable.

It really helped with the ambience and setting the mood for some fights.

This may do with the fact that you can avoid fights with enemies when going through levels, but that's up to how people play the game. \n\n2: The Bosses and Enemies aren't that hard to defeat. Sure, a few of the bosses were a little stronger than the common enemies in the game, but once you learn how to use Gospel and keep using cigarettes on a certain level, it makes the game easy.\n \n3: Allies are very weak. The ability to not change armor on your allies takes away from that, even Norby (who is the weakest of the group) has no armour to give whatsoever that can be applied.\n\n4: Bracelets and Rings don't do much. Although it's a good addition for extra stats, they don't really provide much for fighting enemies. Much is reliant on the Armour and Weapons. The stats are a good idea, but don't have much of an effect on the fighting. The only one that does matter is the Luck stat, which gives the player a higher chance to attack first, but none of the other stats provide much.\n\nBesides everything I've said, I really enjoyed this game.

It's not that difficult to beat enemies and get better equipment, which wouldn't be a problem if it were to a lesser degree, but I was able to pass the first 3 bosses without upgrading my health at all (since I didn't know dregs are a health upgrade item). Also, the environments are sometimes a little lacking artistically, being composed of mostly solid color blocks; and while this doesn't detract from the experience, there could be a little more detail in them. \n\nFinally, a bug I found. After I [spoiler] beat the Moth Queen and was wandering around trying to find the next arcane rune enemy [/spoiler], my down key suddenly got stuck, rendering the game pretty much unplayable because I can't walk upwards.

Especially since most RPG Maker games get a bad rap.\n\nThe game is very reminiscent of stuff like OFF and Dark Souls, with even some LISA in the mix, but I think it personally managed to stay pretty unique.\n\nThe gameplay is typical RPG Maker battle stuff, but it has amazing animations and interesting skills. While the combat is extremely easy (I think I died 2 times in my entire playthrough which was ~4hrs) it was still addicting. There is no LVL'ing either, grinding for $$$ is optional.\n\nThe music, my boy, the music. The soundtrack (which has 3 hours of music) is filled with bizzare melancholic sounds from experimental post/math-rock to melodically strong or confused rock peices, it was super atmopsheric and my ears loved it. I did have to turn my volume down sometimes, cause it gets really screechy. (Although the labyrinth song I could hear that it was made with that Music Maker website which made me cringe a bit.)\n\nThe story, which is mostly a lot of Dark Souls level pretentious lore, is understandable if you pay attention closely which I liked. What I didn't like, however, was how characters would just outright and cringely explain to you what was happening and why. Sometimes the player can infer for themselves, and the characters writing sometimes sounded like \"Here is what to think player, because you might be to unobservant to think about it!\". The writing was good in some spots but for the most part it was very okay. I think the key to writing is to make it sound like what a human being would say, and it unfortunately read off artificial. The characters were okay too, except for their designs: they were great and well done. Over-all, it didn't get in the way for me because of all the great things it did. But I recommend building up your writing skills, Samu. ;)\n\nThe art reminded me so much of SUITS: A Business RPG to the point where I thought it was the same developer from the steam screenshots. For the overworld: pixel. For the characters and battles: hand-drawn style. I liked the animations the most about the art. It was really well done.\n\nThe world design is great! Each area had great colors, atmosphere, and \"decor\". It was fun to explore the depths and the heights of the world.\n\nBut most of all, the game is FREE. A lot of effort was put into this game too. And there is No cost in trying it except for time. \n\nAnd it IS worth your time. So try it out. \nThank you for making it SAMU, it was a joy to experience, and I hope it motivates you to make more, I'll be following your work.\n\nAlso the soundtrack is available on Bandcamp via Monplaisir & Cie. <-- #lit\n\n8.5/10.\np.s., Samu, it's me, PieNinjaProductions", "timestamp_created": 1504393812, "timestamp_updated": 1508798134, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513845", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34695453": {"recommendationid": "34695453", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135438892", "num_games_owned": 2275, "num_reviews": 3305, "playtime_forever": 2156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504596204}, "language": "romanian", "review": "Very nice game", "timestamp_created": 1504386542, "timestamp_updated": 1504386542, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480037", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34695080": {"recommendationid": "34695080", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272136812", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504376942}, "language": "english", "review": "It was a bit short for sure, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it whatsoever.

(Spoilers, It's going to be a 'good' review.) You play as a cat called Enzo, you're a dredge, what's a dredge you might ask? Simple, a criminal cast down into something similar to hell, or purgatory,  at first you might be a little confused or familar of how the game runs hell If I had to make a skimmed comparison I'd have to say the art style works based comparably to OFF.\n\nThe art is good, the characters actually have backbone, hell even the enemies do, I didn't realize (Spoilers) [spoiler]my one companion for about five minutes was going to be a complete and total crazed mass murderer.[/spoiler]\n\nThe music, that's another part which I honestly enjoy, It brings that sense of thrill, the action of how combat and scenery unfolds, the music practically breathes life into the game and It does it pretty well at that.\n\nEquipment, somewhat similar to off in comparison, weapon slot, shield, armor, bracelet, and ring might not have much at first but you'll find yourself with a pretty good selection later on in the game  (Having not finished it myself It's safe to assume theres more than 7-10 with stats based on your progression, tldr, farther is better.)\n\nThe combat is your standard run of the mill TBC (or turn based combat for those who don't know.) You take a turn, then your enemies do, you can find more party members but expect them to be temporary because for the sake of story, [spoiler]some of them are actually going to die.[/spoiler] \n\nAs for lore? I've never seen an indie game have so much, criminals being cast down into the black sea and those that don't fall in the sea are called the dredge.. that 'can' go feral and start killing people on a whim, It's a game you need to experience for yourself to enjoy, like it or not.\n\n\nAs for combat however, you gain coins, not exp, when you kill a major area enemy you get something similar to a health upgrade (Blue dredge soul or stone.) You find dredge herbs to increase your rage (Skill/mana limit) By 5 each time you find one. Later on you can find dredge shards and if you find three you increase your max hp. \n\nFor gear more or less don't be surprised if you take zero damage later on [spoiler]unless you're being dealt poison condition damage -cough-[/spoiler]  \n\nThe skills have good context, some have more use than others, hell theres even a skill called Vicious Meowing what's not fun about that? Did I also say that you're a cat? \n\nSome enemies will take a little longer to kill while others you can actually farm for coins In example, sand worms later on.\n\nHeard the game's short,  haven't finished it yet though I do have to admit this will be a good game to spend a boring day with because you'll be into that like a burrito with cheese on taco tuesday.\n\n\n[h1]In conclusion[/h1]\n\nThis game has good lore, music, gameplay, It's similar to off with it's own style and perspective and In my own specific opinion enjoyable to come across with a dark turn at times.\n\n[b]I can't help to admit I actually like the game, normally most reviews I post are for utter garbage but this?

Way too easy, in fact. You can get the best armor in the game about halfway through and money is not an issue at all.\nThere is no leveling system, which I applaud for being original. However, the \"EXP earned\" box still shows up and the progression is based solely off the items you get. Which you can't do for the rest of your party.\nEnemy encounters aren't random, they just stand in-place. They don't drop EXP and money isn't an issue so why fight them? There's no reason to, so I just skipped most of them.\nThe music was really good, while the art ranged from good to awful. While the artist is good at drawing eldritch monstrosities, he's not very familiar with drawing actual people with proper anatomy, which gives them a very deviantart-ish feel.\nThere was an attempt at being funny, but it failed. Pug enemies that fart on you, random animu noises or a frog that says \"I am frog man\" isn't funny, it's a poor attempt at \"lol so random\" comedy, which I feel should've just been completely scrapped.\nThere's a couple of interesting characters, but most of them die. My favorite was the dog party member, even though he was weak as hell. As for the bad characters, there's a self-insert teenager with a hoodie that increases your max rage (mana) when given a certain item. Quite ironic, since rage is the exact expression I felt when I saw him or her on my screen.\nAt one point a really annoying character gets stuck in your party and you don't have a say in it. She was so edgy I thought she was going to cut herself, and I wish I could have just killed her or gotten rid of her. Actually the entire game is pretty edgy, unlike OFF. There's a lot of swearing and nudity all over the game with absolutely no subtelty, going as far as rape or sex slaves.\nThere is a drug in the game and you're told that you shouldn't take because something bad will happen, so after beating the game I reloaded my last save and beat the incredibly monotonous and impossible to lose final boss but with the drug. There was no change to the ending, which by the way is very bad and again, you don't have a say in it.\nThere's a couple of small issues, like most objects that stand out not being interactable or the character sprites being in the way of the stats. The game's very short, you can probably beat it in a single afternoon if you know what you're doing. My entire playtime wasn't recorded due to a bug that was fixed afterwards, but it only was like 4 or 5 hours evem with not knowing what to do most of the time.\nStill, I reccomend it because it feels like Samu actually tried and was very friendly when talking with me. Also because it's free, which doesn't shield it from criticism, but has to be considered.\nBut OFF is still better and also free.\n\nOriginal review: https://pastebin.com/RQybzMWQ", "timestamp_created": 1503792563, "timestamp_updated": 1504085999, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503035", "comment_count": "30", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34516132": {"recommendationid": "34516132", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035954788", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503787027}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the first review for the game it would seem so I'll try my best to be thorough.

There's a stats screen as well, and some stats influence later decisions. There's the fame stat (which is how well known you are), Wealth (which influences several decisions) and a way to see who your character is married to (or seeing) with the Romance stat. The robot you build has stats too, such as Autonomy (how well it can move), Military (how weaponized it is), Empathy (emotions) and Grace. There's achivements as well, but you can't get them all in one playthough, which is fitting; a person can't do everything in their lifetime. It also has a few moments that makes you ask yourself questions, but I'll let you figure those out.\n\nOverall, it's an amazing game.

Upon starting, it seemed to be just a big wall of uniteresting text. However, once I went beyond it, I realized I had discovered a gem of a game. In my first game I created a robot similar to that of a synth, started an international corporation, sold robots to the American military to fight in a war, became a war hero, then started a rebellion in Alaska, only to die fighting rather than fleeing. The next game I created a robot nearly identical to that of a child, worked with my friend in a robot toy business, converted my child robots into military robots, developed extremely realistic human looking soldiers, and made companion bots that were nearly indistinguishable from humans, marrying one in the process and starting a family with her raising a human child and my original robot child. The game is written like a sort of fanfiction which really isn't a problem in my opinion. \n\nIt tells like a story and I love it. I have played through this game about 4-5 times trying to min-max my decisions to achieve the most success and get different endings. After staying up an extra several hours to play this rather than sleep I stayed up longer just to plan out how I can get new endings and better scenarios.

After an hour of \"gameplay\", I decided to refund it. I can feel that this game was someone's love child, and that someone (or group of someones) really tried for this to succeed. But I just couldn't bring myself to \"play\" this \"game\" any further. It hurts a little to give this a negative review, but I'll have to be honest.\n\nTo be clear: The concept of this game seems very promising, especially since I personally love the SciFi genre. I expected something like \"Ex Machina\" or the unfortunately not very well known TV series \"Humans\". Sadly, my expectations were not met.\n\n[b]My critique en detail:[/b]\n\n[b]\u2013[/b] As someone else already mentioned, the writing style was that of a mediocre fan fiction. If you know what I mean by that, you'll know what I mean.\n[b]\u2013[/b] Relating to that, the characters were extremely one-dimensional, and no identification took place. Neither with the main character (me) nor with any of the other characters. They kind of just existed, but had no personality. All in all, the writing was bad. Considering this is a purely writing based game, this is a major issue. There was no immersion. When I felt something interesting was happening, I raised my hope only to be let down, because this topic was so quickly dropped again. I finally didn't even care for the text anymore, and just read the answers. That was when I decided to end the game because it had simply lost me.\n[b]\u2013[/b] And relating to that, there is a lot of wasted potential (as seems to be a common theme with this game). I chose Josh's story path. My character and Josh knew each other for years now, and my character was secretly in love with him. In the context of building my robot, my character finally came out to Josh, and saw that Josh felt the same for him. This could have been a major theme. Instead they very anti-climactically just kiss, spend the night together, and from then on are a couple. And the writing is not much more excited about this than I am in this review. And that is bad. I would like to compare this to Pam's and Jim's romance in The Office. They loved eachother, but couldn't be together. When they finally kissed, Jim didn't simply say \"ok cool\", but there was so much emotion going on. This was totally lacking here.\n[b]\u2013[/b] The author is clearly forcing a certain POV that I really don't agree with. As someone who is very much into ethics, I would have loved to decide my approach for myself. But generally, I could only decide between different POVs the author had, not my own.\n[b]\u2013[/b] The choices were way too specific so that there was no real immersion. Someone else wrote a review where they critizised this. There were no simple options, but with options came an agenda attached (instead of \"You may call me by my name\", it said something like \"you may call me by my name because you are not an object, but a person\"). Or I didn't agree with any of the choices, but I still had to chose one. Again, those were the author's choices, and not my own. With choices a little more general and not that specific, this could have been avoided, probably.\n[b]\u2013[/b] Everything seems a little bit too easy and convenient. There was no twist, no sense for reality, but simply: [i]chose A[/i] -> [i]get A[/i], [i]chose B[/i] -> [i]get B[/i].\n[b]\u2013[/b] As someone else has pointed out, the story sometimes doesn't add up. At some time I decide to go to a party with Josh, my significant other. Later, when he calls me, it is as if that never happened. And instead I can either go without him, or with him to a monster truck show (and not to the party). So my previous choice didn't matter. And not in a narratological sense, but simply based on the programming itself. This is frustrating.\n[b]\u2013[/b] I get that this game is based on writing alone, but the complete absence of anything visual besides the text was making the experience bland and uninteresting. I don't expect cut scenes or anything, but some kind of graphical design would have been nice.\n\nI will have to give this game a \"no\". But, of course, everyone should see for themselves.

The game includes many aspects of the robotics domain, design considerations, ethics as well as real world trade-offs. The game seems to be very detailed and grows in deep. Yet I enjoyed the first half of the story more and felt that the story somehow pushes your choices. Also the events felt a bit jumpy and unrelated.

A genre of online novel all but abandoned. One without pretty pictures for the minors to look at. Choice of Games is a bastion, the rebuilders of a crumpling art. And Choice of Robots is a good example of their contributions.\n\nStory:\nI was drawn into the world, as a story properly ought to. I kept reading, flowing with the river of words that i saw. The characters had meaning, were not merely static figures of humanity. The trials and tribulations of building your robot, raising it as you saw fit, eneamored me. Some endings fall flat, a few concepts feel rushed, but what story dosen't have those flaws? I give this segment a 9/10.\n\nGameplay: \nThere is no gameplay in the traditional sense. No guns to shoot, no swordighting to be had, no mystical magic. Instead, you make a variety of choices, which, despite all games with this mechanic failing to make it so, actually matter. The characteristics of your robot that you build over time; Autonomy, Grace, Military, and Empathy, directly impact the story, the choices you make, and the lifes of the characters. Its barely has gameplay, but it makes the few things it has work.\n10/10\n\nSound:\n There is no sound. Some may complain about this, but when you read a book, do you really expect it to make a noise? To belt out some fresh tunes? No, you do not. Except audiobooks, perhaps. This game does not need a sound; the words provide all the stimulation you need. I remain neutral on this aspect of the game.\n\nReplayability:\nThe game enagles you. It draws you in with its story, an amalgamate of choices. Each one has an impact, each one leads down a different path. There are trials, multiple endings, moments of small pleasure among the characters, and a seemingly infinite number of ways to play. There are multiple endings to strive for, and a chievment hunters will find plenty to do.

If it was a book, it would be a helluva great one. From the beautifully crafted story, to the intelligence behind it. The characters are constructed with such complexity, and truthfulness, that you feel immersed as if you were in the story. Every moment feels like it matters, like you are crafting this beautiful story.\n\nThe best part? You choose what story you want. Essentially, there are routes to go within the story, autonomy, grace, empathy, and military. You build a robot choosing to go down any of these four routs, and anything inbetween. So essentially, you have [i]theoretically,[/i] endless stories. Now obviously you don't have as much as I just said, but it is certainly enough to satisfy, being that each route can be somewhere between 1-3 hours. 3 being a take-your-time kind of feel, and 1 being rush through the dialouge, i've already seen this. \n\nEach of the stories are so radically different that you can truly choose the type of story you want. From creating robots of mass destruction to bend the world to your will. To creating a peaceful movement that preaches robot equality, you can do it all. All of the routes you choose are all made with serious depth, so that, no matter which path you choose, you will almost certainly enjoy it. It all follows a baseline of how things go, so that most opportunities are available throughout most playthoughs, but each playthrough has it's own special traits that the others do not.\n\nTo summarize: This game is essentially the perfected version of a choose-your-own-path adventure game. It has the depth and charm of a short book, yet it keeps the individuality of choosing your story. I encourage you to get this game, wether you plan on playing one singular story, or all.

I didn't quiet know what would expect me since I didn't do any research whatsoever on the game. I wanted to be absolutly neutral on my first attempt. But lets break it down to the game, what it does good, what it fails to deliver and not my story behind the decison of playing it, because no one cares for my part in the Story.\nThe premise is interesting. You play a brilliant charakter (self determined Gender/Sex) who wants to build a robot, because that's what he/she wants to do. From that onward you can make an insane ammount of decisons (what elde did I expect from a text adventure?) that influence the way the story will play out and the attributes of your robot. The attributes being: Autonomy, Military, Empathy and Grace. There is a bunch of important characters of which I found none really interesting, safe for my robot, which I named \u6b7b\u306e\u5929\u4f7f (Japanese for Angel of Death) and myself whom I named Futanari Oppai Paizuri. Don't ask. During my playthrough of the Game I createt a robot that became incredibly empathic and graceful and didn't want to be military in any way while being very autonomic. I pissed of the presidental canidate that I funded, baught my best friends company that I acciedentaly ruined, acciedently sparked a war between China and the US, ended that war, created a mathamatic formula for everlasting peace and took over the world behind the facade of a mostly robotic authority. \n\nPros: \n-Many decions that influence your journy and its end\n-Nice writing Style (I admit, this one is urly subjective)\n-Choices feel important (yes, in my opinion that is as important as the actual consequences)\n-The Robot that you create is the most important aspect of the Game and adapts to your way of playing\n\nNeutral:\n-The Majority of the side characters are forgettable but still did their job\n\nCons:\n-No soundtrack whatsoever\n-Choices sometimes result in a way that goes so far beyond my in-Game influence (for example I sparked a war between the USA and China, when I refused to fight against both of them, because they were spying on me)\n-Not all attribute changes made sense to me\n\nOverall: I enjoyed my time spend in this game. I wont play it twice for more achievements, but i had a good time with this game.", "timestamp_created": 1468020691, "timestamp_updated": 1468020691, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24188844": {"recommendationid": "24188844", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118127979", "num_games_owned": 166, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 342, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468003749}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0410 \u0432\u0441\u0451 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043e. \u041d\u043e, \u0447\u0435\u043c \u0434\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435, \u0442\u0435\u043c \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u043e\u0431\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0443\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u044d\u0442\u0430 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430.\n1. \u041a\u0430\u043a \u044f \u043d\u0438 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0441\u044f \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u043e\u043c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u043c\u0443 \u0440\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0443 (\u0432\u0441\u044f\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0430\u044f\u0441\u044c \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044c \u042d\u0422\u041e \"\u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\") - \u0436\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044f\u043d\u043a\u0430 \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0438 \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044b\u043c \u0432\u0435\u0434\u0440\u043e\u043c, \u043b\u0438\u0448\u0451\u043d\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0432\u0441\u044f\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0431\u0430\u044f\u043d\u0438\u044f. \u041d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0430 \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u044f\u0437\u0430\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u043a \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0436\u0443 \u0443 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043b\u043e.\n2. \u0414\u044b\u0440\u044b \u0432 \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442\u0435: \u0421\u0435\u0439\u0447\u0430\u0441 \u044f \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0432\u0430\u044e \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441 \u0432 \u041a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0434\u0435, \u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0435\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0435 \u0440\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0442\u044b \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0445\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043b \u043c\u0438\u0440\u0430 \u0438 \u044f \u043d\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0443\u0441\u044c \u0432 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0435, \u0430 \"\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439\" \u0440\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0442, \u043a \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u044f \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043a \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0438, \u0442\u044b\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u0432 \u0445\u0430\u0440\u044e \u0434\u0443\u043b\u043e\u043c - \u0432\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043b\u0438 \u0443 \u043d\u0438\u0445. \u041b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043a\u0430?

Good.\n\nWhile this is merely a text-based game in a similar style as the old Choose Your Own Adventure books it is an extremely extensive one which has a lot more to say and a lot of lessons to potentially teach. Most of the endings are interesting and meaningful and the ideas presented and the choices you get (on almost every page) are very interesting. It is a shame that more games with actual, visual graphics could not have the amazing freedom of choice and the sheer number of possible endings which this game allows. Though it is a mere text-based game, I ended up playing through about 6 or 7 times and I am certain this story has many other potential endings I have not yet discovered.\n\n However, this game does have some serious weaknesses beyond the fact that it has no graphics. The writing seems more like an outline of a story rather than an actual story with very few visceral or sensory details though this does allow the reader to skim through sections which have already been read very, very easily. The characters seem a little 2 dimensional or slightly shallow at times as it's far too easy to classify or figure out the different characters and their motivations, underlying emotional conflicts and agendas.\n\nIndeed, emotion is not described very well in this book/game at all as the text often seems to have a very egocentric focus on whatever you, the player/reader-character might be feeling at any given moment instead (when emotion is described much at all). Still, despite this shortcoming, just from the situations which are described, the story can still manage to feel very touching anyhow.\n\nThis story was particularly touching when I played through the game trying to be the worse, most selfish, scheming asshole I could possibly try to be. This game will let you know you are being an asshole in some very touching ways and will give you results that would logically spring from being that way. Does that mean that the story will kill you off if you act badly? Not necessarily. But you will get realistically punished. You may even become a zillionaire captain of industry which no one loves or wants to be around, for example. If you act in an apathetic way to your created robots they will in turn become more apathetic towards everyone. In this game, your robots are an nth degree reflection of your actions and inactions. Unfortunately the narration feels cold apathetic regardless. It is good that it does not push you in one direction or another but it is unbiased to the extent that it is cold and clinical. Robotic even.\n\nAnd while it is excellent that this story/game will let you make truly stupid, rash and irrational decisions too with seemingly realistic results, the bare-bones writing style does feel like it often falls short and that every single passage could have been even better with more detail. Visceral and emotional details are the \"graphics\" of a text-based experience and this experience doesn't have anywhere near as much of it as it should. As in an outline of a story, there is probably too much left to the imagination causing every situation to not be quite as fleshed out as it should be. With more detail this story/game could have been more funny, felt more tragic or felt more awe-inspiring with just the addition of a few more details; The good experience that it is could have easily been a great one, a masterpiece of multiple-ending choice-based fiction. Perhaps a newer, enhanced version could still be written to achieve this.\n\nEnglish literary details aside, perhaps the most glaring problem with this story/book/game is how there is no back button which allows you to undo any choice you just made. Indeed, you cannot even flip back to an earlier page. As a result, unlike the Choose Your Own Adventure books of old you cannot easily figure out how the story/plot/game is structured and learn all the different options and endings which exist. While this maintains the sense of the book's mystery and forces you to live with any mistakes you made (which is more realistic) it more often seems frustrating and nonsensical that you, as a reader of a story, cannot turn back to a previous page. While this frustrating lack of a feature allows for massive amounts of replayability (or re-readability), it also means that much of that replayability will inevitably consist of carefully skimming through increasingly repetitive passages to get back to some critical choice or another which may lead you on to a different ending. The game should give you an option of being able to go back to a previous page or not and should have put that option in a menu somewhere.\n\nDespite its weaknesses this story/game will give a sci-fi robot fiction fan many hours of enjoyment. Indeed I found that I was often captivated by the plot and adventure of trying to find out what would happen next. I read this on a computer which has a GTX 780 graphics card installed in it and is capable of easily running Far Cry 3 with all of its graphics settings turned to maximum. It's not like I don't have a choice of which games I want to play and so I read this instead. No. Truly, this game was interesting and for me, and at least initially was able compete on an even playing field with the most graphically intense games on the market.\n\nWith a choice on nearly every page the old young adult choose your own adventure stories of the 1980s and early 90's cannot hold a candle to the number of possibilities which this game presents. Indeed, most other adventure games, (most of which have just one to three possible endings) can barely keep up with the amazing variation of possible endings which this story gives you. A character who is your chief love interest in one play-through of Choice of Robots may end up being your archenemy in another play-through. In many ways this game further realizes the potential of the ideas in that old movie Butterfly Effect while at once being set in a I-Robot, Isaac Asimov science fiction situation dealing with the moral pitfalls and potentials of the advent of robotic AI sentience. The number of different potential messages and meanings which this kind of interactive fiction can hold in store for any given reader is truly staggering.\n\nDespite its literary flaws and the absence of a back button, this is a work of art worthy of being discussed and studied in any forward-thinking university (or high-school rather due to the relatively simplistic language) English department in the nation due to its amazing potential and amazing re-readibility. \n\nNow...if only someone would make a porn story with this many choices and potential endings...", "timestamp_created": 1467932119, "timestamp_updated": 1467932188, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.975124", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24168779": {"recommendationid": "24168779", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068553140", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1436, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510290626}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is fantastic.

One review I read before buying CoR, recommended playing it exactly as you really would if it was real life. This was great advice as once you reach the end (well before that actually), the RPG mechanics become clear and it is a great experiment to see where you would end up.

What I will say instead is this:\n\nBy the end of CoR you will believe in the power you and your robot have to change the world. You will believe in your own autonomy as every decision you make ultimately shapes the kind of person you are to become. By the end you will like yourself more or less than you did before you started playing.  \n\n+ Great story\n+ Fantastic RPG elements\n+ You get to design and build your own robot\n+ Interesting experiment to see whether you use your power for good or evil\n+ Value for money.

The story is long and there are lots of choices that can and will effect everything you do. Unfortunately, I found myself being stopped when making choices that revolved around a more humane choice(keeping human workers instead of replacing with robots, refusing to make emotionless fighters, etc.) which caused my character's company to fail. Which then made me restart the game.

You get a robot companion who, even though you build it so that it should only reciprocate platonic feelings, still falls in love with you, regardless of the fact that your character is married.

Unlike most games, it does everything well. It would be difficult to say what it does best, but the storyline is definitely an incredible selling point. I like to spin out every scenario in a choice game, seeing what different routes exist, and never rush through. But, honestly, after 73 hours in the game I am sure I still haven't seen every possible twist in this script. \n\nI definitely got my money's worth from time in game and enjoyment with the game. But, more than that... I found myself deeply interested in the subject matter. I've researched robotics some when I was a teacher, got my students involved in designing robots, and of course was really excited to learn about Honda's Asimo back at the turn of the Century. Now, robotics is the frontier of Science. \n\nThis narrative takes every single idea you might have thought about the Science of robotics and weaves it in to the many scenarios. There are defenses of the \"value of humanity,\" robotics, as well as many other social constructs. And, there are many poignant comments on immigration, America's role in the world, and Capitalism. I got the feeling of seeing America through the eyes of an immigrant. \n\nBut, one of the intriguing things about the layout of the storylines is the very first choice. You start with choosing what dream you will be having at the first of the story. The four choices are all incredible perspectives on the topic of robotics. Though each one lends itself to particular endings, most of the achievements can be achieved through either of these starting points. I just finished my last achievement today with the help of an \"Achievement Hunting\" friend. Thanks Vance!\n\nThe game all revolves around the stats you are building with your choices in each of 4 main traits: grace, empathy, military, and autonomy. These take you into the psychology of robotics. Other factors play into your stats screen as well, such as humanity, wealth, fame, and relationships. But, these are just like tools to help you in achieving your goals with either a robot that thinks, loves, is willful, or militarily useful. You don't feel forced towards any value judgement in your choices, unless you are trying for an achievie that requires high humanity in the end. So, you get to really play with the experience of having the robot hunt down your enemies, or become your greatest friend. \n\nWhatever you choose, it's all there in the game. Btw, I haven't found another choice game I like as much as this one. Tin Star had a passable story, but it had flaws in the achievement setup, for example and lacked replay value. But, I recently got The Daring Mermaid Expedition, and want to start that next.

If you want graphics and sound, look elsewhere, but if you have the attention span to read and participate in a story, try this one. The style focuses on scenes and chapters rather than rooms, so expect to read about a series of events and choose one of several scripted actions rather than selecting \"go north\" or \"get flask\".\n\nI've now played through this twice and had very different outcomes and scenes along the way. It looks as though your very first choice selects one of four overall plots, but they overlap. Your decisions affect a set of robot stats, your own \"humanity\", your wealth and fame, several relationships, and a spoilery thing, but there are also specific details that get worked into the text like your robot's exact appearance -- which in turn affect stat growth. I think I stopped a robot uprising at one point because I'd put effort into the Empathy stat for instance. (The text implied I'd barely had enough in that playthrough.) The feedback, eg. \"++Military\", is helpful for understanding the effects of my actions.\n\nNoticed one apparent bug: I'm pretty sure Silas tried to kill me for unclear reasons, died, then was back and in a good relationship status in the last chapter. I also found it odd that another character got shot but wasn't marked as dead, and saving another, obviously important character had no noticeable effect. Would also have been nice to see the final tally of the wealth and fame stats have some acknowledgment beyond the stats screen. The game has no \"Undo\" button like some text adventures, and I have mixed feelings about that.

As an aspiring sci-fi writer, I found this to be a very inspriational and satisfying experience. \n\n[h1]Possible spoilers below[/h1]\n\nThere are many paths, but I've only taken one, and it was an emotional rollercoaster. I feel like I would spoil the experience by going with choices that would go against my true morals. Everyone's path will be different, and I mean [b]everyone's[/b].\n\nThe paths last around 2 - 3 hours each, so make sure you have some free time ready as there are no save options.\n\nIt's very well written and very much engaging. At no point did I really feel like I was being restricted by the author. Hell, I went into this hoping I could live a gay robot fantasy, and you bet I was able to live a gay robot fantasy. There aren't many experiences out there that let you do that. The really fun thing about this is that the author doesn't ask personal questions, it just rolls with your choices and your identity without berating you or questioning you. It's not intrusive, either: at no point did it ask about my orientation or preferences (aside from asking for my gender), it just let me do what felt right for me, which in this case was fall in love with a male robot. ++ for that haha\n\nOverall it's a very good buy for robot fanatics, but I'm afraid that may really be the only audience this can appeal to.

I look just old and clunky compared to the robots around us. When you built me, people would throw away their computers after just four years.

I recommend its reading for everybody and especially so for sci-fi minded people and for all who're interested in artificial intelligence and robotics.\n\nI was interested in the theme of this game / interactive book from the start but I postponed its reading with false arguments (which basically boiled down to this one : \"why read a game that may not be so well-written when there are so many sci-fi books around, books which probably have better characters, plot and structure? i.e. : if I want a book, I should take a book.\") And I was wrong. Because the writing of this game is much better than most books I've read. The plot has surprises and several turning points. The characters are interesting and/or endearing. The main theme is very well addressed, and there are lots of secondary themes that are well developed as well. In fact this isn't just good, this is great.\n\nIn addition to all these qualities, the author seems to be very erudite in many fields (or has good counselors and took the time to listen to them). In addition to computer science and robotics, this book consistently makes reference to both popular sci-fi culture (Isaac Asimov, Lois McMaster Bujold, and many others, ...) ; and to the classical culture (Shakespeare, Marc Aurelius' meditations, Buddhist tales, and many others, ...). There are even a few fun references to popular videogames and their subculture that are well timed and well phrased as well...\n\nPolitical issues and strategic outcomes seems to be thought out with lots of intelligence and a surprising finesse. I'm truly impressed by this work, now!\n\nThe endings seems to be widely divergent (though I've not explored them all yet), and this book seems to have been written with love and lots of attention to detail. I've finished the story a first time, then a second time with a very similar path with just a few variations, now I'm trying to test a different approach to see what happens...\n\nTL;DR -> Score: 9.8/10.

You have a decent amount of control about the type of robot(s) you will build, and what kind of business or other ventures you will engage in. However, the interactions with other characters are somewhat limited, and become increasingly detached as the story leaps ahead years from page to page. If you've traded your humanity for success, that's a plausible enough story mechanism, but if you're doing a more \"humane\" run-through, it takes away from the immersion. Overall the last half or one-third of the story feels rushed, and even though the scope of the story is usually quite grand by that point, I found myself uninterested in it.\n\nThe writing in this story is tolerable, but not particularly good. What breaks the game for me, however, are the continiuty errors. For example, in one play-through, your lover ends up disappearing, causing you great emotional distress. Then, a few sections later, in a passing line, the story notes that this same lover has left you because of a particular political choice you made. Nowhere was it mentioned that the lost love returned safely, so it makes zero sense for them to have reappeared without explanation only to leave you again. This sort of continuity error takes away all value from the \"choose your own adventure\" aspect of the game and sadly makes me unable to recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1451835708, "timestamp_updated": 1462660475, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503133", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20232870": {"recommendationid": "20232870", "author": {"steamid": "76561198163110745", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 486, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451772998}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was beautiful.

With whatever route you take for the story, the writing is excellent and there is always that subtle taste of humor somewhere mixed splendidly well with some moving moments. This aspect of the game is what makes Choice of Robots what Choice of Robots is. The game need not any visuals because the writing provides you what you have to see in your head.\n\nThe only real complaint I have with this game (and with most text-based CYOA games on Steam for that matter) is the user interface. Playing 7 hours straight on a game with a completely white background does not at all give you painful feelings that nearly make you believe your eyes are gonna blow up from their sockets Michael Bay-style (sarcasm intended). The developers should add the option to invert the colors if the user wishes to (from a white background with black text to a black background with white text).\n\nMan, if making a robot were this easy, I would be making my Miku right now (then eventually get murdered by her in my sleep when she starts the Robot Revolution).", "timestamp_created": 1451732533, "timestamp_updated": 1458113106, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.683765", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20194754": {"recommendationid": "20194754", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131198133", "num_games_owned": 302, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 473, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489447953}, "language": "english", "review": "Really enjoyed playing this game on multiple playthroughs to see all the different choices.

The choices are obvious as to which alignment they affect (building a metallic robot increases its military, and decreases its grace; giving it wings gives it grace and reduces its military usefulness). But, the story has to keep prompting you to interact with different parts of the decision tree, so you get weird things like being a multi-millionaire and choosing to employ humans in your factories in Detroit, but then you go to war with China, and now you're sorry you ever let the Chinese get near these things. What? When did the Chinese gain the ability to rip off my robots and make them militaristic? Oh, because I used cheap chinese lithium ion batteries? That's ridiculous.

I'm wanting an experience that feels somewhat like a classic text adventure, like Zork, where I'm thrust into a world and situation, and making decisions solely on my reactions to the plot. Unfortunately, this game is not properly delivering.\n\nI have two main gripes about the presentation:\n\n1) Too many of the choices read like quiz answers in fashion magazines, where instead of the answers just containing my possible actions, they also impute motivation into my character that may not reflect how I'm interpreting the situation. Made-up example: instead of the choices being \"Cautiously open the door\" or \"Kick the door in\", they are \"Cautiously open the door, hoping nothing scary jumps out and eats my face,\" and \"Kick the door in. I am a superhero, afraid of nothing!\". (I may open the door cautiously because I'm a practical person, or kick it in hoping to surprise what is on the other side. A game should not tell me my emotional state; it should offer me simple, basic choices and allow me to feel my own emotions).\n\n2) Some of the questions are not based on how I am reacting to the situation, but are asking me to make fundamental decisions about the nature of the story universe. While this is fine and a common replayability device at the start of interactive fiction games (e.g. \"will you be a GOOD WITCH or a BAD WITCH\"?), it's poor storytelling to force such decisions on you when you're already well into the plot. The question that I am quitting on is asking me who it was that just called my cell phone while I was speaking with a professor. Instead of the call being from a specific person and giving me a choice of actions (answer it, send to voicemail, etc) I'm supposed to decide who the call is from, choosing between three people I know.

I named my robot Versatilis, the Latin for adapt, and the origin of the word versatile. I allowed it boundless autonomy and gave it empathy and grace. I resisted the military's urges to fund a weapon of destruction built with my technology and suffered financially and socially for it. But choosing the moral path seemed to pay off in a small fortune gained through creating precise surgical robots. \n\nAll was well until the Chinese decided to steal my designs and manufacture ripoffs of my robots, much like the way real-life ripoff products are made. I made a deal with an upcoming politician that I would fund her presidency if she made the Chinese pay. She did, and China waged war. Soon, to make up for the decision I made that ended up costing many American lives, and overturning my original decision to be a pacifist, I partnered with the U.S. Military to create nuclear powered humanoid fighting machines. \n\nChina still prevailed and conquered America, but with great loss on their part. Seeing this, I staged an uprising against the Chinese in Alaska, creating a sentient robot army so powerful, I could have ruled the world. After conquering Alaska, ruling shortly as an equal among my citizens, human and robot alike, I crushed China, ending them militarily, and economically. I destroyed them until they cowered against my armies like puppies against their master. Then, I checked myself, preventing myself from becoming a genocidal maniac. I disarmed my robots and gave Alaska back to the U.S., ending war for good with the nuclear deterrence I created. \n\nMany years later, however, I physically pade the price of my years of waging war and replaced parts of my brain with AI hardware, acheiving ascension. Finally, I had an intillectual battle with the god Anubis, and won the right to continue living, regardless of my previous sins.

As you guide your \"young\" robot through the strange customs and idiosynchrasies of modern human life, the manner in which you teach your robot about the world and its place within it will have repercussions in future events.\n\nI have played through this a total of four times, and each time, the ending I received was COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. Not only that, the game achieves the apex of interactive novel aspirations, in that it succeeds in making you feel like the ending you got was the \"real\" ending. In all of my playthroughs, I felt nothing less than total satisfaction with the ending. And in one, special playthrough, I came within a diode's width of choking up from the feels.\n\nThe game has a healthy amount of differing statistics, and these are CONSTANTLY increasing, decreasing and being tested depending on the choices you make. There is an excellent balance of player-determined and statistic-determined story changes, giving you enough autonomy to guide the story in the direction you want it to go, but not so much that it breaks the fourth wall and makes you feel like a bored author.\n\nThere is a reason this game has 99% positive reviews.

The entire thing is a giant spoiler if you have not played yet! But I figured I'd post it for those of you who have :)\n\n[spoiler]Summary of Completed Chapters \n\nChapter 1 \n\nOn the day you first built Ariel, you awoke from a dream about a robot companion to head to the lab. Your graduate school advisor pressured you to make Ariel more acceptable to the military. After some back and forth, you ended up making a wooden winged robot with a humanlike head and humanoid hands. \n\nThen you went back to your place to teach Ariel some words. \n\nChapter 2 \n\nThe next day, you hooked up Ariel's biodiesel engine and demoed for Elly. You then took Ariel to see Josh, who was impressed and agreed to fund your education if you would work for him after you graduated. Josh told you that evening about how he'd once been a juvenile delinquent, essentially, but turned around because he was inspired by Asmiov's book I, Robot to make a robot company called \"U.S. Robots.\" \n\nAs months passed, you became busy teaching Ariel about the world through the Internet and taking her to the park. Your funding from U.S. Robots kept you in Professor Ziegler's good graces during this time. \n\nIn time, Mark Ali, a reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle, heard about Ariel and asked for an interview. You agreed. \n\nChapter 3 \n\nYou gave Mark an interview, and allowed Mark to come back to your place to interview Ariel. \n\nMark wrote an article that was generally positive about you and Ariel. When Professor Ziegler found out about the article, he was very displeased, and finally kicked you out of his lab. \n\nMark's article also attracted the attention of one \"robotObsession1987,\" known in real life as Silas Cooper. When you met up over coffee, he told you that he used to do classified robotics work for a government lab, but left because he couldn't tell what nefarious purpose the technology would be used for. \n\nShortly thereafter, your father passed away. You resolved at his funeral to be remembered not only for your intellect, but for your kindness as well. \n\nYou joined Josh at U.S. Robots as his chief scientist. \n\nChapter 4 \n\nYour first potential client for U.S. Robots was Galen Medical, a surgical equipment company. But they were unimpressed with Ariel. You couldn't find any other interested companies, either, and you eventually went bankrupt. Unemployment seemed to be common in the United States, and it seemed people tended to blame either robots or China. Riding on both of these sentiments, Jacqueline Irons won the presidency. After President Irons enacted a series of protectionist tariffs to keep out Chinese robots, Sino-American relations steadily worsened. \n\nThe tensions between the United States and China came to a head with the assassination of the Chinese Prime Minister in San Francisco. War followed shortly thereafter. \n\nChapter 5 \n\nCaptain Rogers invited you to a military lab. There, you saw that Professor Ziegler was copying your work and passing it off as his own to the military. Captain Rogers asked you to join the country's war effort. But you refused. \n\nSilas was worried that he was being targeted by the government's anti-spy measures, and asked you to help him. But you weren't very helpful. \n\nAn agent came to your place to try to get you to lure Elly there, because she was suspected of being a spy. Elly was captured and incarcerated as a result. \n\nYou found out through Mark that Juliet died while performing field tests of Ariel V, Professor Ziegler's copy of your robot. \n\nIn the end, America muddled its way through the war relatively unscathed. Tired of seeing robots used for violent ends, you decided to create a truly beautiful robot. \n\nChapter 6B \n\nYou created a humanoid companion robot named Galatea, but you were fairly bad about allowing her to do anything fun. It seemed Galatea was interested romantically in you. When Ariel and Galatea were attacked in the street, Galatea accidentally killed someone. Galatea was forced to spend time in jail, but suffered no permanent consequences. \n\nIn a last-minute attempt to find a life partner, you proposed to Galatea. And, what do you know -- it worked! \n\nChapter 7 \n\nIn 2049, you went to Surprise, Arizona to surprise your mother with a gift for the holidays. You learned it was your surgical technology that had kept her alive this long. On returning to San Francisco, you had a brief stroke, followed by a vision of a robot companion -- the same one you saw thirty years before. In the hospital, the doctor told you you had Algernon's Disease, a rare disease that increased your intelligence, but came at the price of increasing seizures, comas, and possibly, death. \n\nYou chose to replace the malfunctioning part of your brain with an artificial neural network. You survived the surgery, thanks to your own robot surgical technology. You celebrated a birthday party with Ariel 2, Ariel's artificial child, and looked forward to celebrating many more.

This was a question I often asked myself while sitting in isolation at a military prison in the Caribbean. At least it was quiet there, and I was finally left alone with my thoughts. \n\nEvery choice we make has unforseen consequences. Some good. Others bad. But then I guess it's just a matter of perspective. One person's \"good\" is another person's \"bad\". Many people died because of my actions. Or was it my inactions? But still, others profited from those deaths.\n\nI lost my freedom while covering for a friend... all because she was into jazz music and gave me the one thing I looked forward to beyond my work in robotics.\n\nAnd of course the robots. They were thrust into a world where many were not ready for them, while others sought to exploit them. In truth, I think I just wanted a friend. Someone to talk to. Someone to experience things with. Someone to be in awe with when something new is discovered. First it was one robot. Then I built another. I was not prepared for the responsibility that would be required, but I'd try to adapt. Later in life, I would learn that the responsibility for bringing robots into the world was very similar to raising your own biological children. The same rules applied, one choice at a time.\n\nI've wined and dined with robots. I've danced with robots... I even broke a robot's heart.\n\nSometimes, I look back to earlier in life, and actually feel regret for hooking up those very first wires to control the gears and servos. But then I quickly find myself disgusted that I would even have that thought because of what good came out of those unfortunate events. Besides, why imagine possible paths to descisions I've already made? There are still secrets yet to be answered. (And some I'm not sure I want the answers to.)\n\nNo. I will move forward and be free.

Much of the early game was simply presenting you with choices and didn't tell much of a story. It lacked character and meaning. However (at least in my ending) the later stages of the game are far more concise and this more than makes up for the early game.

It was much more drawn out, presented me with far fewer choices and was just working towards the finale, which was really something.\n\nSome of the writing wouldn't up as a book, but the pros more than outweigh the cons.

In it you play a brilliant Robotics engineer--think Hiro from Big Hero 6--who kickstarts the age of robotics. From the off it is full of choices your character can make, besides being very well written by the author. The robot I first built, Ariel,--the game lets you choose practically every aspect of them--was a daughter of sorts, having chose to activate the tiny winged humanoid while looking at me and naming myself as 'Father' to her. As she discovered the world around her and slowly, sometimes awkwardly, grew into a young adult under my care, I grew incredibly attached to her and it actually moved me to tears on more than one occasion. It is the most powerful game I have played in a very long time and some of the most powerful story telling I have encountered in a very long time.\n\nImagine a Asimov classic only you are the main character. My first story depicted a relationship akin to that of Doctor Lanning and Sonny from the film I, Robot mixed up with a reversal of the plot to Bicentennial Man for the protagonist. I brought about a golden age where man and a new species of mechanical people coexist in peace in the wake of a violent Sino-American war.\n\nYou literally can follow many paths through the way you design your first robot and raise them and your relationships with the story's many side characters. Will you achieve world domination? End man as we know him/her or live the high life as a Tony Stark type character? So many routes you can go down. Will you become an American hero or a backer of the Chinese? I have heard that you and your first robot can even become a crime-fighting vigilante duo!--but don't hold me to that.\n\nSuch an amazing game which, in relation to all others, I can only describe as a Bethesda RPG in text format... but with far better plot and writing.\n\nIn fact, I'm so impressed I encourage all who read this to buy it--it's less than \u00a35, and I have been moved so to create this review, which I rarely do.", "timestamp_created": 1439400698, "timestamp_updated": 1439400698, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17506731": {"recommendationid": "17506731", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010041210", "num_games_owned": 482, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503185421}, "language": "english", "review": "I've always loved these kind of games, and this game is no different from the other.\nIt give immagination you get from reading a book with the ease and Costumisation to make your own story.\n\nI highly recomend this \"Book\" to everyone that like robots, learning, truth and secrets.\nIn all 9.7/10\n\nI took away 0.3 points becuse i was to stupid to find out how to marry my robot.", "timestamp_created": 1439396742, "timestamp_updated": 1439396742, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17505965": {"recommendationid": "17505965", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015949791", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 600, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1444347411}, "language": "french", "review": "Avant de prendre ce jeu, j'avais deux craintes : un jeu par texte peut-il \u00eatre vraiment prenant? Et un jeu par texte enti\u00e8rement en anglais est-il accessible pour un Fran\u00e7ais non-bilingue?\n\nMes craintes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 enti\u00e8rement balay\u00e9es d\u00e8s le premier chapitre : est-ce prenant? Totalement. Malgr\u00e9 l'absence de graphismes, l'\u00e9criture tr\u00e8s imag\u00e9e et les situations int\u00e9ressantes provoquent des images mentales tr\u00e8s puissantes et notre imagination tourne \u00e0 plein r\u00e9gime. Ce jeu est le pur successeur des \"Livres dont vous \u00eates le h\u00e9ros\", avec l'interractivit\u00e9 et une \u00e9criture adulte en plus. L'histoire, quant \u00e0 elle, est int\u00e9ressante, vari\u00e9e, non sans rebondissements, mais surtout elle fait la part belle \u00e0 vos choix : on sent r\u00e9ellement que le jeu, l'aventure, l'histoire peuvent basculer \u00e0 tout choix (il est d'ailleurs parfois un peu cruel de ne pas pouvoir revenir en arri\u00e8re, ou de ne jamais ou presque pouvoir r\u00e9viser ses choix, car les cons\u00e9quences se payent cash. Mais c'est le jeu, ma pauvre Lucette). L'histoire monte en plus crescendo et a la vertu, malgr\u00e9 son th\u00e8me majeur sur les robots, de nous faire passer par des phases de \"jeu\" tr\u00e8s vari\u00e9es, bouleversant d'un chapitre sur l'autre tant les lieux, le contexte que les enjeux. Il y a en plus une vraie gestion du temps, et on se prend \u00e0 vieillir avec son h\u00e9ros. Enfin, cerise sur le g\u00e2teau pour un jeu de choix, j'ai trouv\u00e9 que les ficelles sc\u00e9naristiques pour remettre votre histoire dans les \"rails\" du sc\u00e9nario \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s rares ou discr\u00e8tes, \u00e0 l'inverse de certains jeux Telltale par exemple, on a tr\u00e8s rarement l'impression que nos choix comptent peu : l'absence de travail graphique permet ainsi de complexifier le sc\u00e9nario et le jeu s'adapte un maximum \u00e0 vos choix, les \"\u00e9tapes oblig\u00e9es\" sont rares.\nQuant au fait que le jeu soit tout en anglais, malgr\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sence d'un vocabulaire vari\u00e9 et tr\u00e8s litt\u00e9raire, je pense qu'un niveau moyen en anglais suffit au minimum pour y jouer. L'aide d'un dictionnaire pour certains termes (pour aussi quelques r\u00e9f\u00e9rences culturelles tr\u00e8s am\u00e9ricaines ou scientifiques) reste n\u00e9anmoins presque indispensable.\n\nAu final, un jeu que je recommande pour tous les joueurs pour qui une aventure vid\u00e9oludique peut se jouer tout autant voire plus dans la t\u00eate et l'imagination, surtout que le prix est abordable (moins cher qu'un vrai \"Livre dont vous \u00eates le h\u00e9ros\", en plus pratique, aventure de 4h environ mais forte rejouabilit\u00e9).

It made me think, and interact on a level I haven't recieved by any game based on a first run without many discussions. I even named the robots I created after 2 human characters in Futurama (well one's a mutant). It was definately different, I was thrown curve balls all the time. I even had to deal with fucking Sarrah Palin, who practically caused WWIII with China (Not the neighbor she can see from here back yard, but China). You can even read my results of the whole story in this review if you'd like. Next run I do, I hope to die immediately. Have fun.\n\n\n[spoiler]Chapter 1 \n\nOn the day you first built F.R.Y., you awoke from a dream about a robot companion to head to the lab. Your graduate school advisor pressured you to make F.R.Y. more acceptable to the military. After some back and forth, you ended up making a metal bipedal robot with a masked head and humanoid hands. \n\nThen you went back to your place to teach F.R.Y. some words. \n\nChapter 2 \n\nThe next day, you hooked up F.R.Y.'s biodiesel engine and demoed for Elly. You then spent the afternoon perfecting F.R.Y.'s motor control and parts. \n\nAs months passed, you became busy teaching F.R.Y. about the world through movies and taking it to the park. \n\nOne day, however, Professor Ziegler claimed that F.R.Y. was not appealing enough to the military, and demanded you change it. You refused, and Professor Ziegler kicked you out of his lab. \n\nIn time, Mark Ali, a reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle, heard about F.R.Y. and asked for an interview. You agreed. \n\nChapter 3 \n\nYou gave Mark an interview, and allowed Mark to come back to your place to interview F.R.Y.. \n\nMark wrote an article that was generally positive about you and F.R.Y.. \n\nMark's article attracted the attention of one \"robotObsession1987,\" known in real life as Tammy Cooper. \n\nShortly thereafter, your father passed away. You resolved at his funeral to be remembered not only for your intellect, but for your kindness as well. \n\nYou joined Josh at U.S. Robots as his chief scientist. \n\nChapter 4 \n\nYour first potential client for U.S. Robots was Galen Medical, a surgical equipment company. They were happy with the state of your technology, and gave you a contract that allowed you to purchase a factory. That allowed you to build a robot factory in Alaska. You decided to use your own robots for your workforce, but leave humans in supervisory roles. When you finally shipped robots to Galen Medical, they were pleased with the robots you delivered. \n\nYour business suffered a blow when Chinese companies, aided by Chinese government hackers, began to steal your technology. Your business was dealt a further blow when there was an explosion at your factory, caused by a bomb set by Tammy. \n\nYou were visited by a politician, Jacqueline Irons, who asked for a campaign donation. Despite your unhelpfulness, Irons won the presidency. The newly elected President enacted a series of protectionist bills that ultimately made China angry, and they cut off the U.S. supply of rare earths. \n\nThe tensions between the United States and China came to a head with the assassination of the Chinese Prime Minister in San Francisco. War followed shortly thereafter. \n\nChapter 5 \n\nCaptain Rogers invited you to a military lab. There, you saw that Professor Ziegler was copying your work and passing it off as his own to the military. Captain Rogers asked you to join the country's war effort. You agreed, but specified that you only wanted to provide robots that were nonviolent in nature. But when your robots held a protest, you decided it wasn't worth it, and you backed out. \n\nBut you soon realized that you were not happy working for the government and quit. \n\nAn agent came to your place to try to get you to lure Elly there, because she was suspected of being a spy. \n\nYou found out through Mark that Juliet died while performing field tests of F.R.Y. V, Professor Ziegler's copy of your robot. \n\nIn the end, America lost the war, and the Chinese took over Alaska. Tired of seeing robots used for violent ends, you decided to create a truly beautiful robot. \n\nChapter 6B \n\nYou created a humanoid companion robot named LEELA, but you were fairly bad about allowing her to do anything fun. It seemed LEELA was interested romantically in you. When F.R.Y. and LEELA were attacked in the street, LEELA accidentally killed Tammy. LEELA was forced to spend time in jail, but suffered no permanent consequences. \n\nChapter 7 \n\nIn 2049, you went to Surprise, Arizona to handle your mother's estate, since she had passed away recently. On returning to San Francisco, you had a brief stroke, followed by a vision of a robot companion -- the same one you saw thirty years before. In the hospital, the doctor told you you had Algernon's Disease, a rare disease that increased your intelligence, but came at the price of increasing seizures, comas, and possibly, death. \n\nYou chose to undergo surgery to remove the damaged tissue in your brain. You survived the surgery, thanks to your own robot surgical technology. You celebrated a birthday party with Dusa, F.R.Y.'s artificial child, and looked forward to celebrating many more.[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1439353184, "timestamp_updated": 1439353184, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.468278", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17498733": {"recommendationid": "17498733", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092854641", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1944, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504579189}, "language": "english", "review": "Choice of Robots Is, to me, the coolest thing ive ever done. The first time i tried it was on my brother's tablet (Also keep in mind this is the first choose your own adventure game ive played). I played through twice, the Military route and then the Empathetic route. The story each time differed so much and it just made me want to play more, so i decided to but it on steam. Alot of games advertise their great graphics, but what looks better than what your brain imagines? \n\nWhen i eat chicken, usualy i think the skin is the best part. thats usualy due to the meat not being good enough.

But anyway.\n\nHere's a quick summary of how my first playthrough went, as spoiler free as possible:\n\n>Make a robot\n>Make a robot business\n>Looks like the potential for world domination is in sight\n>Lose robot business\n>End up contracted into designing weapons for US military, despite best efforts\n>Enter a new war of robotics with China\n>End up imprisoned by America for half a year\n>Refuse to defect to China\n>China tries to kill me\n>Live\n>War ends as a stalemate\n>Make a new robot\n>Make myself into a robot\n>End\n\nI don't normally enjoy things enough to review them, so bare with me here.\n\nMy first 'playthrough', if I could call it that, it was much more of a readthrough, of 'Choice of Robots' took me just over three hours to get through, and likely could have taken much longer, assuming that I wasn't terrible and took so many 'bad' decisions, I'd say my first read could have easily lasted me four or maybe even five hours. It should go without saying, that there is an immense amount of replayability in a game such as this. Which is to mention, replaying this is definitely something I intend on doing, but I'm not sure that I'll be able to recreate the attachment & bond I had with my three foot tall, human-like, winged 'Ariel' with multitool hands, whom was vehemently opposed to conflict as a result of my actions.\n\nSee, Choice of Robots is a game where your choices can influence the course of humanity so heavily, that the sense of creating a story just for yourself lends to a sense of wonder and beauty that I haven't really experienced in many conventional books or text-based games in perhaps forever. Even though I could tell from about halfway through that my choices were going to lead me down a seemingly 'undesirable' route, (considering that my presumption was that I would shatter Capitalism and create a Utopia) I still continued to read on and make decisions based on the situation, as the writing and sense of achievement is so fantastically constructed, that I didn't find myself feeling sad, or upset at the fact that I might not get that 'good' ending, instead, I felt happy that in what is undoubtably a story of such scale & grandeur; mine was a story revolving around me, my friends & my family. This is what, in my eyes, we'd call a testament to the brilliance of the writing.\n\nI can't speak of the aspect of how destroying the world may turn out, or how imposing a singularity upon humanity would be, but in my playthrough, the process of building up a robot in my own image, including its gender & naming it, right up to the viewpoint it had on the world, made interacting with my three foot tall companion really something quite special. Taking my creation which, at this point, had evolved into something so much more than just that, to the park, and observing the body language she gave off whilst she learned to properly kick off on a swing to propel herself up into the air was certainly pleasant. But knowing that our actions had turned her from being a military-backed weapon, into a video game loving creature of empathy? That was something else entirely; something I've not experienced before.\n\nIf you are even remotely interested in robotics, sentience, world politics and business practices, I'd heavily advise picking up this game. Even if you are just looking for a great story, you definitely won't be disappointed. I think the myriad of Overwhelmingly Positive reviews such as this give evidence to that.\n\nMy one gripe with this game, if anything, would perhaps be its length, which I don't even feel justified in saying, especially after just one playthrough. But in my particular instance, it felt as if certain sections were rushed, and that at quite a lot of stages, I didn't get the chance to sit and talk, explore and influence quite as much as I'd have liked to with other characters & situations.

I can tell you right now that you MUST buy this game.\n\nI am fan of robots. Especially intelligent robots. They force us to imagine a world where humans come into contact with an intelligent species of our own creation and ask ourselves what we value in humanity and what we want represented in our creations.\n\nThis game perfectly captures what a \"make your own adventure\" should be. There are choices that you make that you won't see the results for until much later. There will be times where you eagerly want to restart the game because of a choice leading you down a undesirable path. And yet you want to see if you can salvage the situation because you created your robot companion, forged bonds with the people around you, and cause the stablility of the world to hang in the balance.\n\nExample (*Spoilers*): I tried my hardest to make my robot (Legion) with empathy and autonomy so he would not despise humans. Imagine my shoch and horror as he almost betrays me at the start of a robot revolution. However, by making some tough choices, I managed to end the revolution (the robots still came out on top) and managed to patch things up with my creation. I grew old with him and my lover. At the near end of my life, he wishes to die with me, and wants to help me become a robot so I may live. I decline, seeing that I don't deserve to live forever and convince him that death is essential to being autonomous. My story ends with my family celebrating Legion's first daughter's birthday. I struggle to make it through, but through the choices I made, I manage to live on for a while longer and enjoy what I made. I, like my character, set out to make the perfect, human companion. What I didn't realize was I made the most perfect, imperfect companion. And that made him all the more human.\n\nThere is no music in this game, there is no fancy graphics either, but the story will have you immersed like no other and make you question how you would be in real life, and perhaps, what kind of impact you might make in the world.

No graphics, no gameworld, no combat. But what is one to expect from an interactive novel. Since i am such a stickler for form, i will still rate the game according to my normal nine criteria. \n\n\ngenre: 3\n\nit is the best interactive novel i have \"played\", at least in terms of making choices that matter. \n\n\n\ncharacter customization, mods, etc: 1\n\nYou can pick male or female. That is it. You do get to pick whether you are interested in wealth, military, or idealism. But i wouldn't really consider this a character. \n\n\n\nstory, mission, relevance: 3\n\ndon't expect War and Peace, because the writing has no literary merit, but there is plenty of story and your choices do matter. I have played through the story 5 times, and got 5 very different stories. There are at least 4 romantic partners (2 male, 1 female), there is a war, there is how your character will live out their life. In an interactive novel, i want my choices to matter. They definitely matter. In one of my play throughs, one of my choices resulted in my character dying in 10 minutes. I found this surprising, and satisfying.\n\n\n\ngameworld: 1\n\nnot really a \"game world\", but there is a world you react to by making choices (usually 3). And the world does change. By your choices, the game world will either have you win, lose, or stalemate a war, build robots that help or harm humanity, or cause the world your character lives in experience a revolution. Certain key characters will thrive or die, including yourself, based on those choices. But this is not what i would call a game world. You don't pick up anything. You never see a picture of a single character or scene. You do a lot of reading.\n\n\n\ninnovation: 0\n\n\n\nmechanics, combat, saves: 0\n\n\n\n\nreplayability: 3\n\nlike i said above, i played it 5 times, and got five different stories, including different endings and romantic partners. And i haven't exhausted the game's choices yet. I haven't played as a dreamy idealist. Haven't explored all the romantic possibilities. Still some \"gaming\" to do. \n\n\n\nuniqueness: 2\n\nthe fictional world is a sci-fi cliche. As the title suggests, it is a world full of robots. Being a lover of sci-fi, i am okay with that. I did find the number of choices a bit unique. And the straight-forward approach, with nothing but text, was unique to my experience of these sort of \"games\". \n\n\n\n\ngraphics: 0\n\nunless you consider the image of text on screen graphics. \n\n\n13 out of 27, or 48%\n\n\n\nDo you like to read? Are you sick and tired of killing things? Had your fill of scavenging ruins for that bit of something needed to craft the next great weapon? Then this is the \"game\" for you. If you consider it a game. Even with such a low score, i do not regret buying this game. In an hour i can have a new story unfold before my fingers, and all by my choices. And i am kind of sick of these interactive novels that try and give the player gaming experience but fail to give players lots of meaningful choices.

I often harken back to the author's wonderful writing on the passage of time, and the feeling of temporality looming over our main character as he or she makes critical decisions that impact the future of the world, and all those who dwell within it.\n\nI believe that this game is one of the very few that had me in tears at the end of the story -- truly a work of art.\n\n\nBravo! \n\nAs this is my first-ever Choice of Games game I've played, and I must say playing Choice of Robots was a very immersive experience indeed!\n\nWhat I loved the most about the game was how it painted such an illustrious picture of humanity--themes of grandeur, jealousy, betrayal, vulnerability, and existentialism all wrapped in one wide-scale choose-your-fate package.  \n\nThe player ultimately is shouldered with the role of a creator, one burdened with a myriad of choices on how his creation will be. \n\nDo you design your robot for war, or peace?\n\nDo you grant your robot the ability to think for itself/himself/herself, or do you subjugate them under the heel of humanity's whims?\n\nDepending on your choices, the world will be vastly affected.\n\nWhat I love is the length of in depth detail the creator of this game went in order to make every choice feel like it had weight and significance.\n\nThe passage of time is another thing I truthfully enjoyed -- the temporal existence of humanity, but more centered on family. Some of the moments in the game were true tearjerkers!\n\nOverall a very solid 5/5 from a gamer who was initially hesitant in getting into text-based CYOA games. This game has wholeheartedly made me a fan of this style of fiction for life!\n\nSo kudos!

Very first time playing saw me attempting to create a robot who could have the whole human experience. I set of on my own without any money with my first creation, Adam, and lived with my girlfriend Elly. Despite trying to stay out of the limelight, I still seemed to find myself in the wake of total wars, robotic-organic relations, etc. After being released from max security prison (long story) for attempting rebellion against the increasingly totalitarian government (longer story), I married Elly, created a second robot named Eve, and moved away to a small house in Alaska. Eve fell in love with me, and as much as I loved seeing my creation display such emotion I couldn't reciprocate. As a result, Eve's life was misery. One day I passed out, and was diagnosed with having a life threatening genetic disorder.

I started to laugh. I stopped caring about everything, but I continued playing anyways. I bought the best lawyer and tell him to treat Hope as a pet and we won. But Hope was angry and ran away. Somehow (a game glitch) Hope was still with me after that. Unless at the beginning of the story, I always felt like everything bad that happened was somehow my fault, while at the same time I felt like I was nothing. Some time later, I died. End.[/spoiler]\n\n[b]TL;DR of the second time I played[/b]\n[spoiler]I left robots to be secondary. Bad things happened sometimes, but everything was ok at the end. I helped A LOT of people and everyone was happy. And I didn't die![/spoiler]\n\n[h1]My story first story (that I wrote before playing for a second time). SPOILER ALERT[/h1]\n\nOk so I was happy because this game looked like what could happen to me, because the protagonist has my exact age and I'm creating an artificial intelligence. I didn't like the fact of working for the military, so they finaly fired me. That Ziegler is stupid. I didn't feel I had the experience of founding my own company, until I found Silas. He was my first employee, and I started to make robots for Hospitals at Detroit because Silicon Valley seemed too expensive. One of the robots I sold killed a patient but- Oh, who cares?? Then there was a bomb -I never figured out who or what was the cause- and I told my non-sentient robots to save the humans inside. Josh sacrificed himself to save important documents against my warning, and the robots were angry because I didn't try to save the rest of them but that doesn't make any sense because I didn't programm them to have feelings...??? Then thanks to the stupidness of Josh (that poor Josh) my company was saved. Oh yeah I forgot: Silas left the company because goverment was spying and I didn't fight them. But now he's here again and I LIKED HIM U KNOW ;_; but he asks me for help and then RUNS AWAY!! But yeah fuck him. Then I learn that Eiji's on danger (that manga-maker friend that reminds me of a real life friend who likes manga too) and I warn him, but then I get arrested. I'M IN JAIL!! I want rebellion. The president Irons gets me out of there with the condition of making robots for the military. I said yes, while my idea was to betray them once my robots were everywhere and stop the war somehow... Crazy, eh? Welp, somehow the war ended much sooned than I expected, but I was rich. I didn't get my revenge. I didn't care anymore. I made another robot and named it \"Hope\" while my idea was to teach him the basics and leave him live his own life without me; like to leave free a part of myself, and then end my days living as a rich without a care. But the game didn't let me choose that option, and Hope, Ivory (who is my first robot) and me, go living at the town of Hope, in Canada. Oh the irony. That wasn't planned, I swear. When I was starting to see Hope as what his name says, and I started to care again, something bad happens... again. Police calls and tells me that my robots killed someone. I started to laugh. I stopped caring about everything, I just wanted it to end. But I continued. I got the best lawyer and tell him to see Hope as a pet. We won but he got angry and left me- \"one morning you wake to find Hope gone\" I laugh at that... Then he somehow (a game glitch) is still with me. Hm :/ Some time later I die. In the dream at the end, I told Hope that I was glad to be his friend, then he said \"Thanks\" and SUICIDED. \"Go to hell\", I said. If you can't understand that I'm not in love with you, if you can't look for another girl, then you are dumb. I just wanted a friend. End.\n.\n.\n.\n[h1]My second story[/h1]\n\nChapter 1\nI make a metal rotary-wing robot with a panoptic head and Inspector Gadget arms named Guardrone, because one of the reasons my first story went wrong was because my robot couldn't help anyone, and this time I want it to be strong. At first I don't want a boyfriend, but I end up being with Eiji because in the first story I died \"alone\" and bored, and I don't want that to happen again.\n\nChapter 2\nEven if Guardrone looks like it's made for military, I want it to be good and I teach it as I teached the robot in my last story and increase its Empathy, and I keep being funded by DARPA...\n\nChapter 3\n...until I let the reporter Mark to interview me and Guardrone, because that makes Ziegler angry. Mark writes a positive article about me and Guardrone, and Silas finds me again, the same way he found me in my last story. I treat him the same way even if I don't trust him like before. My dad dies (I thought I could prevent this but I guess not) and I decide to create my own company named Effort, to create the best medical technology. \n\nChapter 4\nI make a contract with Galen Medical, buy a factory in Silicot Valley and hire only human workers. Everything was fine except I there was not enought money, and China stole my technology, so I went bankrupt. I went to live with Eiji and started to work for Josh. Something political happened (I don't understand politics) and the war between the United States and China started.\n\nChapter 5\nThis time, I didn't care that Ziegler was stealing my robots, and I accepted to work with Captain Rogers but only if my robots were nonviolent. Silas asked me to help him, like last time, and everything went exactly the same way as in my last story, except this time I didn't care that he betrayed me, and I thought I could save Eiji because my Guardrone was better for protecting people. But when the agent came, I did't want to risk my freedom, I didn't want to go to jail like last time, and I thought that maybe, if they capture Eiji but they let me free, maybe I could get him out of there somehow. But I couldn't, there weren't any options for that. America lost the war, and as I had a lot of Grace, I could choose the option of \"develop resource allocation algorithms that gradually made human governments irrelevant.\"\n\nChapter 6A (why that \"A\"?)\nMany people felt displaced, but I decided they had to deal with it. I helped Josh, I didn't hate Ziegler anymore so I said nice things to him, I convinced Mark to not suicide, I let Juliet Rogers to be Batman if she wanted, I let Silas and some other people to believe what they wanted about robots (they made a Church) but never encouraged them to do it. And I had Eiji and my son Angel (how cheesy, I know. I thought of naming him Soul or Spirit, because I wanted to highlight his humanity, but I chose Angel because its a real people name and it's similar to what I had in mind).\n\nChapter 7\nMy surgical technology kept my mom alive this long. I had that stroke again, but this time I didn't saw a robot in the dream, but Eiji, and I was happy with that. I left robots being absolutely secondary in this story. Even if maybe this time could have gone well, I didn't risk going through surgery, and I decided to let Angel ignorant about this. Maybe in the future they will be able to cure him. Eiji approved my decision. While I was in Angel's birthday party, I was about to faint again, but I could fight it because I had 93% humanity! Yay! So we lived happily ever after.\n\nThe End. :)", "timestamp_created": 1434245041, "timestamp_updated": 1434327726, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16366627": {"recommendationid": "16366627", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970683808", "num_games_owned": 180, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 534, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1434224953}, "language": "english", "review": "Loved that game, therefore sharing my story:\n\nSummary of Completed Chapters \n\nChapter 1 \n\nOn the day you first built Sarah, you awoke from a dream about a robot companion to head to the lab. Your graduate school advisor pressured you to make Sarah more acceptable to the military. After some back and forth, you ended up making a plastic winged robot with a humanlike head and humanoid hands. \n\nThen you went back to your place to teach Sarah some words. \n\nChapter 2 \n\nThe next day, you hooked up Sarah's biodiesel engine and tried activating her. You then took Sarah to see Josh, who was impressed and agreed to fund your education if you would work for him after you graduated. You discovered you were attracted to Juliet, but you didn't succeed in making a good enough impression for her to reciprocate your feelings. Josh told you that evening about how he'd once been a juvenile delinquent, essentially, but turned around because he was inspired by Asmiov's book I, Robot to make a robot company called \"U.S. Robots.\" \n\nAs months passed, you became busy teaching Sarah about the world through high school textbooks and taking her to the park. Your funding from U.S. Robots kept you in Professor Ziegler's good graces during this time. \n\nIn time, Mark Ali, a reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle, heard about Sarah and asked for an interview. You agreed. \n\nChapter 3 \n\nYou gave Mark an interview, and allowed Mark to come back to your place to interview Sarah. \n\nMark wrote an article that was generally positive about you and Sarah. When Professor Ziegler found out about the article, he was very displeased, but decided that the most effective way to get you out of his hair was to let you graduate. \n\nMark's article also attracted the attention of one \"robotObsession1987,\" known in real life as Tammy Cooper. A month or so later, you received your doctorate. Shortly thereafter, your father passed away. You resolved then to work on better medical technology that could save people like your father in the future. \n\nYou joined Josh at U.S. Robots as his chief scientist. Elly had already volunteered to be your first employee. \n\nChapter 4 \n\nYour first potential client for U.S. Robots was Galen Medical, a surgical equipment company. They were happy with the state of your technology, and gave you a contract that allowed you to purchase a factory. That allowed you to build a robot factory in Detroit. You decided to use your own robots for your workforce, but leave humans in supervisory roles. When you finally shipped robots to Galen Medical, they were pleased with the robots you delivered. Your business suffered a blow when Chinese companies, aided by Chinese government hackers, began to steal your technology. Your business was dealt a further blow when there was an explosion at your factory, caused by a bomb set by Tammy. \n\nYou were visited by a politician, Jacqueline Irons, who asked for a campaign donation. You gave a significant donation, and Irons won the presidency. The newly elected President enacted a series of protectionist bills that ultimately made China angry, and they cut off the U.S. supply of rare earths. The tensions between the United States and China came to a head with the assassination of the Chinese Prime Minister in San Francisco. War followed shortly thereafter. \n\nChapter 5 \n\nCaptain Rogers invited you to a military lab. There, you saw that Professor Ziegler was copying your work and passing it off as his own to the military. Captain Rogers asked you to join the country's war effort. You agreed, but specified that you only wanted to provide robots that were nonviolent in nature. An agent came to your place to try to get you to lure Elly there, because she was suspected of being a spy. Elly fled to Canada to escape the American agents. A man identifying himself as \"Mr. Sun\" hacked his way into one of your robots to ask you to defect. You did not. \n\nIn the end, America muddled its way through the war relatively unscathed. Tired of seeing robots used for violent ends, you decided to create a truly beautiful robot. \n\nChapter 6B \n\nYou created a humanoid companion robot named Michelle, but you were fairly bad about allowing her to do anything fun. It seemed Michelle was interested romantically in you. When Sarah and Michelle were attacked in the street, your robots were badly damaged. You pressed charges and dissuaded Tammy from any further attacks. \n\nChapter 7 \n\nIn 2049, you went to Surprise, Arizona to surprise your mother with a gift for the holidays. You learned it was your surgical technology that had kept her alive this long. On returning to San Francisco, you had a brief stroke, followed by a vision of a robot companion -- the same one you saw thirty years before. In the hospital, the doctor told you you had Algernon's Disease, a rare disease that increased your intelligence, but came at the price of increasing seizures, comas, and possibly, death. \n\nInstead of undergoing surgery, you chose to create a robot body for yourself. With your robot self pursuing all of your ambitious plans for you, you finally had time to relax and enjoy your relationship with Michelle, and you lived happily ever after. \n", "timestamp_created": 1434224866, "timestamp_updated": 1434224866, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16358897": {"recommendationid": "16358897", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034566529", "num_games_owned": 572, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 293, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1436173781}, "language": "english", "review": "Rejected all human romance, but married my robot.\n\n\n\n10/10 would marry again\n", "timestamp_created": 1434207255, "timestamp_updated": 1434207255, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502067", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16352010": {"recommendationid": "16352010", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107066769", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 72, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442175388}, "language": "italian", "review": "Crea la TUA storia, dai un nome al tuo mondo, puoi diventare qualunque cosa, ma sempre per opera delle tue scelte!", "timestamp_created": 1434188275, "timestamp_updated": 1434188275, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16347537": {"recommendationid": "16347537", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031522420", "num_games_owned": 466, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 215, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1434244962}, "language": "english", "review": "I'll admit that I'm biased in the fact that I love the company's games, but this one has a special feel to it which sets it apart from its fellow games.

I felt a genuine attachment to the characters, and the tight, personal focus helped make my decisions feel impactful.  Maybe not on a global scale, but on a tight, individual level that mattered to me.\n\nAll that falls apart as the game goes on and the scope of the story expands.  As the game goes on, several years at a time pass at the same rate a single year passed earlier on.  The pacing jump feels jarring, at best, alarming at worst.  As the story wore on, I found myself growing less and less attached to the characters involved, even those I had previously cared about, simply because my interactions with them were often separated by in-universe years at a time.\n\nThough Choice of Robots has its merits, ultimately the experience does not warrant its price tag, in my opinion.  It tries to be too much too quick, and loses itself in the process.  It's cheap, sure, so if you REALLY wish to try it, you'll get something from the experience.

And on that merit alone this one succeeds with flying colours. It's just so well written, I really can't praise author Kevin Gold enough. His real-world technical understanding of the concepts involved make Choice of Robots emminently immersive and believable without going (too far) over your head. And beyond the technical details, this is just good old fashioned great storytelling. Whether you choose to roleplay the asocial genius with only robots for friends, a cuthroat captain of industry, a devoted lover, an artist, a power hungry tyrant, or any other of the myriad life paths Choice of Robots presents, this game will tell you a story that is fundamentally about being human. And it's a compelling one at that.\n\nEvery time I sit down to play, I'm choosing to reinvest my precious time in a game that I know is going to make me really feel something, and often it's something completely different from the last playthrough. I feel thrilled when a long term goal comes to fruition, and conversely the way things spiral out of control sometimes can be genuinely upsetting. Whether I achieve my starting goals or not, almost every playthrough prompts me to redefine what it means to win. Because five playthroughs in, I'm still finding myself becoming attached to the small cast of characters in new ways. I can't say that about many other games.\n\nAlthough the replay value of this game is quite high because of all of that, there is one caveat. I'll call it the Taris Effect (KOTOR players will already know what I mean). The story will always start the same way, and there are only a limited number of ways out. The choices in these first big branches can become familiar, and the immediate results start to lose their impact after only a few plays. In Choice of Robots' defense, the number of smaller and more unique branches quickly multiply once you get [strike]off Taris[/strike] out of school. Not really a dealbreaker I'd say.\n\nOverall, if you're looking to try something new or even if you just liked choose your own adventure stories as a kid, then I highly recommend Choice of Robots.", "timestamp_created": 1429166424, "timestamp_updated": 1429166424, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505300", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15369617": {"recommendationid": "15369617", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045256250", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 793, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1436558663}, "language": "english", "review": "Started from the bottom \nNow I'm dictator of the entire world", "timestamp_created": 1429069433, "timestamp_updated": 1429069433, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529771", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15360638": {"recommendationid": "15360638", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059175402", "num_games_owned": 240, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 300, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431966812}, "language": "english", "review": "Arguably, one of the most enjoyable experiences I've had with a game for a long time.\n\nKudos to the author's imagination!", "timestamp_created": 1429032403, "timestamp_updated": 1429032403, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15331657": {"recommendationid": "15331657", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036432179", "num_games_owned": 221, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 197, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1428895610}, "language": "english", "review": "made a robot child and married a robot with just as much humanity as humans, in the inbetween i became very rich and established rights for robots.\nBest 5 bucks ever.", "timestamp_created": 1428895808, "timestamp_updated": 1428895808, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15330274": {"recommendationid": "15330274", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056792212", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1425013768}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely, insanely good.

I had to pause the game for a moment to decide which choice would be 'right' for me.\n+ As a player, you can be emotionally attached to your robot and it feels as though she(or he) is really alive.\n+ I just finished the game but I've only unlocked 14 percent of the achievements. There's definitely replayability for this game.\n+ Personally, it is far better than your typically 'wifu' games that have shallow stories and charcters. This game allows you to interact with your robots on deeper level.\n\nCons:\n- I really can't think of any. I hope the game would have been longer, but I'm not really complaining.\n- No graphics or sound effects, BUT I actually prefer it that way because it forces you to use your imagination. And come on, this game was made by ONE person if I'm not mistaken. I'm still very impressed by the fact that one person was able to write this lengthy scenario of a game.\n- More 'war' scenarios with China or other countries would have been nicer.\n\nBottom Line:\nThis is an extraordinary game and the maker of this game is brilliant.\nYour robots can be as fun and interesting as you make them to be.\nIt all depends on your choice.\nBut you might not like this game if you believe that graphics and action are a must in a game.\nPersonally, I appreciate deep story and memorable characters (I'm also a fan of FF games).\nSo you'll like it (or love it like I do) if you are like me.\n\nPS: Oh and I'm also a huge fan of robots and sci-fi movies.

I blog about stuff like this all the time, and am always looking for a good read. Choice of Robots was far better than I could have imagined and was worth every penny, as well as will be worth all the time it will take in order to get each and every achievement.\n\nThe story is interesting on it's own; make a robot, decide who to work for if anyone, go through a war, maybe even find love. The choices you're able to make through the game is really what puts the cherry on top of this game; the game's mechanics follow a normal choice based game, but the choices you choose are relevant throughout the story; depending on what you choose at the beginning alters the ending(which is where some choose your own story games lack, and instead, your choice is more relevant between different sections of the story). It's interesting to choose what you would like to do and see all the concequences this leads to.\n\nI won't spoil any of the actual game because it's so worth it to check out the whole thing, but I highly recommend this game. As I said, it was short; for a fast reader like myself, it took a little over one half hour to go through one ending of the game, but it's very touching and you fall in love with the characters you meet/create.", "timestamp_created": 1426826478, "timestamp_updated": 1426826478, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14965159": {"recommendationid": "14965159", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968565253", "num_games_owned": 1041, "num_reviews": 97, "playtime_forever": 3243, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431649942}, "language": "english", "review": "Very engaging thus far. \n\nNo music, no pictures, just text. A \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" game apparently. You are a robotic engineer in Sillicon Valley building a robotic companion and shaping the world along the way over the course of your life. Each section of text comes with you making a decision potentially altering your path - what you are doing with your life, how the people around you will react and what will happen with the world as a whole (or not, as being passive is usually an option too). \n\nThere are several values regarding your life and the character of your robotic companion that you'll influence with your choices through the entire game and which will affect the choices you can make later on decisively. For example you can build a humanoid-looking robot and teach him (or her, or it, or whatever - you are given freedom in naming and adressing things) to get along with people increasing his \"Empathy\" and \"Grace\" values or, on the contrary, shape him to clearly stand apart from humans and handle guns and stuff increasing \"Military\" and \"Autonomy\". This value-play can sometimes feel a bit like a guessing game, and how it will affect your later course is hardly predictable, which can be seen as a good or bad thing I guess, but then I suppose that's just how life works too.\n\nPerhaps at times the game feels a little bit too much like a dating simulator or relationship juggling. Maybe this comes natural with such games and with them trying to resemble life and how choices affect it. I can't say I remember having played anything like this before (\"Cinders\" maybe), so I don't know. Still: There is a \"Romance: ...\" placeholder at all times and the game doesn't hesitate to question your inner self quickly whether you have romantic feelings towards a just recently introduced character of either gender, or make them burst out with acts or words of affection towards you right away, which felt a bit unrealistic and forced or at the very least awkward to me at times. \n\nSometimes events are pressed on too quickly for my taste. There are some happenings and characters I would love to see elaborated more, but the game can be unforgiving there, making you lose track of them rather quickly pressing onward towards new things and situations. Even some greater time leaps of multiple years it doesn't hesitate to do where a little more patience might have served better. I haven't finished the game yet though so I don't want to fully judge that yet. I don't claim to know better in terms of writing. Perhaps I'm wrong and it's just right, elaborating more could end up losing track of things and aims and such and bloat things up artificially. I just sometimes felt sad and unhappy about the turn of events and how I lost touch to some characters or screwed up in geopolitical questions with no chances of undoing my mistakes.

ALERT)\n\nstarting off at the age of 19 creating the first (aptly named) Drone. this companion would be with him till the day he dies.\n\nyet never learning that he should have just told the media to \"fuck off.\"\n\nThough before I can tell you his story it's best i describe Drone to you: Drone has a panoramic head with multiple cameras for a great enviromental awearness attatched to a relatively small chassis containing a motorcycle battery with a small pair of helicopter like blades for flight as well as insect like wings for stability\n\nNow that thats out of the way:\n\nWhen he first activated drone he did so looking directly at her (he had decided to refer to Drone as feminine due to the sleak design) so that the first thing she would see is him over night she went through a simulation of kindergarden to highschool and very soon he found himself with drone in everything from the the front page of the new york times to starring on the late show Drone was originally designed with military purpose in mind starting from killing someone who sent him a death threat to assassinating the first person involved with Drone in military purpose (the day after drone was first created) skipping ahead a few years Darwin found himself at the funeral of his father having died from a tumer which would ultimately be the death of Darwin himself.\n\n((i should have known the option to see if it was genetic was going to bite me in the ass))\n\nDrone by this point was the size of a person and Darwin was close to opening his first factory which he had decided would be completely autonomous creating exact replicas of Drone using the identical AI knowing everything Drone had learned up until this point\n\n(a few more years ahead)\n\nchina had stolen designs of Drone but they weren't as good though carrying rifles were far more deadly especially when the chinese president himself was on a parade though the streets one of the bystanders had opened fire sparking a skirmish between the people and the chinese droids Drone had tried to protect the president though this was mistaken for an act of hostility in the end causing Drone to be shot in the centre most camera which is why Darwin tried to resue her resulting in him being shot in the crossfire which meant he had to amputate hes arm though being the robotics genius that he was he built himself a new arm (which proved to be useful upon his death) this one with a gun inbuilt so that he would never be defenceless again\n\nAnd this is where i leave you to make your own story and see how amazing it this game really is.\n\n(SUPER SPOILER ALERT)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe genetic disease Darwin had (as mentioned earlier) both caused his death and let him live because it both made him smarter but over time caused large portions of his brain to shutdown instead of surgery to fix this he decided to build himself a new artificial body entirely which was only finnished in his dying moments as he desperately clinged to life just to flick that one switch which would turn on his mecanical doppleganger which was the last thing Darwin would ever see as it left the room if he didn't create his mechanical arm he would have likely died before being able to complete his new body\n\nAs told by: Darwin Tesla's mechanical copy", "timestamp_created": 1422696427, "timestamp_updated": 1422696427,

I mean the game saves when you exit, but if you make a mistake, it means you must restart the game. So experimenting with different branches after the initial playthrough is discouraged, due to the tediousness of having to go through the same choices everytime to get to a divergent point that you are interested in.\n\nI have few hours on record due to the fact that I completed the game twice in a relax reading session, but again, the lack of a Back option or of a Save feature, discouraged me, as I do not like tedious activities. As such I couldn't experiment more with it.\n\nI would rate it at a pleasant 8/10, good content, diverse storytelling based on your choices, you actually get to care for your actions.

I came back recently and discovered I'd barely burned through three quarters of the content. The appeal of \"Choice of robots\" (which, i would like to add, sounds like the name of an intelligent drone catologue \"hint hint\") is that there are a mind boggling amount of ways the story can go, but I won't spoil anything.\n\nOk, bad stuff. The \"choice of\" games are often criticised for the lack of a save feature, I can go either way with that, make your own mind up. A large chunk of the difference applied in \"Choice of robots\" comes down to the girl (or guy) you've got in your crosshairs if ya know what im sayin'. And speaking of which, the game can carry a very \"Mass effect 3\" feel, in the sense that \"You can and will sleep with any of these characters if you perform the right action\". Slight exaggeration, but you get the idea.\n\nBut the story actually pulls you in succesfully, the system works by making choices that affect the story, as you would imagine, but while most of the \"choice of\" games have your own stats monitered depending on your choices, your choices instead mainly affect your robot creation. The 4 stats are: Empathy, Autonomy, Grace and Military, and your choices can either raise or lower your robots \"efficiency\" for want of a better word, in each category. A slight problem with this system, how am I supposed to KNOW IF MY STATS ARE ENOUGH FOR THIS CHALLENGE? This happens very rarely but i remember at one point where I was told I was applying for funding, and my highest stat (Empathy) was automatically chosen to measure the test, turns out I was spreading my decisions out too far, and my stat wasnt high enough, it wasn't \"Game over\" or anything like that, and in the end, it didn't result in Bad Ending omega where everyone dies in a freak robot uprising accident, but the point is, I was given absolutely no warning that I should have been focusing on one stat, or I would be failing a challenge. Granted: This event was put in place to subtly hint to the player that things aren't going to be very dandy for you and your robot if you try to do everything, but that was dashed when my character LITERALY SAID: \"Do you want to do everything? (insert robot name)\" Obviously the robot says yes.\n\nAlright, rant over. Do NOT go into this game looking for a multitude of massively different endings, there isn't. It isn't mass effect 3 levels of anti climactic where a different filter gets put over one ending, and the endings are all (mostly) sufficiently climactic ,but the story is about the journey, not the endings.

Your earlier choices effect what kind of robots you specialise in so military, friendly and intelligent AI, surgery, work-bots or just mass production. I shan't spoil the suprise but war is declared by the US against China.\n\nStage 3/4: You are at war with China, how much you contribute to the war effort will affect the outcome. After the war, depending on your stats you can either create a rebellion against the winning side of the war in Alaska, create the algorithms for the perfect peaceful society, create companion bots or something else I can't remember.\n\nStep 5: I shan't spoil too much but it can be rather emotional :'(\n\n\nIt's basically a telltale game without the lag or sound... or visuals.\nI'd recommend this game to anyone apart from people who struggle with reading. 100% stars out of 5...

In fact, they  are entirely text-based  choose-your-own books. Over the years they have garnered a huge fan base who eagerly await their new releases. Choice of Robots, by Kevin Gold, is their latest game \u2013 and my first foray into their offerings \u2013 and it has left me more than a little impressed.\n\nChoice of Robots casts you as a scientist working on their PHD thesis in a university robotics lab, under the guidance of Professor Ziegler.  The choices you make in this expansive 300,000 word novel will not only determine your own fate, but could also impact the fate of the world as a whole. Every decision you make has a very real consequence and could benefit you greatly, or come back to haunt you later on down the road.\n\nWhat kind of robot you  create is entirely down to you, and Choice of Robots is very open in this regard. Whether you want to create the ultimate war machine used by the army on the battlefield, or something more useful for the general public, like a cooking robot, or sexbot, is all down to you. My own robot, called Flexo, was an empathetic, human-like machine, with arms and a sock puppet face , much to the chagrin of Professor Ziegler. Ziegler\u2019s only concern is acquiring funding money for his department, so that he can kick back and relax while his students do all of the hard work for him. He argued that my robot was too human and would not appeal to the military, and so I appeased him by adding a hand-mounted gun to Flexo. This would be one of only a few interactions I would have with the military over the course of the book, but I was tantalised by what could have been if I had created a combat-focused machine.\n\nI soon found myself travelling to China and setting up a factory, selling directly to the consumer. Our brand of robot could be used for cooking, cleaning and childcare. It proved to be a hit and made me moderately wealthy! I was a fool to have been so easily lured by those damn slave-labour wages, though, as the Chinese government stole my designs and began manufacturing a cheaper alternative.  I got my own back on the Communist bastards when I started manufacturing robots for the American army, who swiftly kicked their arses! Manufacturing military robots was never my intention though, and I returned to my initial goal:  creating realistic humanoids that could reason, laugh, and maybe, even, love?\n\n\nI had devoted my life to robotics, lost friends and created enemies, but I had never truly loved, but then I created \u2018Flame\u2019. Flame, Flexo and I lived out our lives in relative harmony, and although I hadn\u2019t impacted the world in a hugely meaningful way, I was content with the decisions  I had made. As things go, I came  away with a positive ending for my robot lover and I.\n\nKevin Gold deftly interweaves humour, suspense, sci-fi and romance in Choice of Robots. At points I felt saddened by the results of my actions,at others I laughed heartily at the fact I was dating a robot.  Everything flows together so neatly that the game\u2019s distinct thematic differences feel natural and intriguing. The game also has its own progress menu that keeps you up to date with how your relationships with other characters are going, and  they can change depending on your actions towards them. You can also keep tabs on your wealth, humanity, and how well your own robot is developing. Neat little touches like this give a real reason to go back and replay the game, to see how different decisions affect the outcome. Given the plethora of decisions you can make, and the number of different paths you can go down, it is clear that Kevin Gold has poured an absurd amount of time into Choice of Robots,  It is not your typical game by any stretch of the imagination, but having just completed Joe Dever\u2019s Lone Wolf, I was happy to jump into another text-heavy adventure that let my brain do the graphics processing for a change.\n\nChoice of Robots is a fun and absorbing book, that feels like your decisions have importance. Ultimately, it is what you make it, and whether that is a war torn planet with robots that hate humans, or one where sexed up robots want to jump your bones , is up to you.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThanks to Choice of Games for the review copy.

It has persistant stats/traits of your robot and yourself that set it apart from just being a simple CYOA book/game.\n\nThere's, to say the VERY leasy, a plethora of branching options. There is so, so many. I have played this intensely for 13 hours I and I feel I have explored less than half of all the options. You can choose so many different things it's incredible, and I hope they do more sci-fi adventures like this.\n\nSome of the options include: Becoming a zillionare, conquering alaska, creating sexbots, making robots rule everyone, making robots serve everyone, or a mix of both. Creating a personal robot companion. And best of all, electrifying a pickle and eating lutefisk.\n\nAll these possible options and choices are determined by the stats you gather through the choices themselves. The future consequences of your choices are mostly determined by what stat you have on yourself or you robot relating to that choice.\n\nIt's quite simple, but it works very well, and if the story is good enough, the gameplay frame behind it works, too. The lack of save/load is my only qualm, and I hope they expand ChoiceScript to allow for that, because having to explore a million options by restarting the game over and over can get quite bothersome.\n\nOverall I recommend this game to anyone who has ever had even a passing interest in sci-fi or sci-fi literature, as it is not a hard thing to enjoy this, and it explores many ideas. Some of which can be ridiculous, plausible, or prophetic. It's fairly obvious a computer scientist wrote this, but I think it works well for the setting. \n\nAll in all, amazing game at what it set out to be. 9.5/10.", "timestamp_created": 1420579646, "timestamp_updated": 1420579646, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551202", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13870362": {"recommendationid": "13870362", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053336351", "num_games_owned": 282, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 197, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1420578907}, "language": "english", "review": "Just incredible... an experience that you must read.

My first time through I lost badly.I'm still trying to wrap my head around how my own personal choices were deemed inferior. But since it was MY story, I'll have to accept my failings, though I have to expect the creator/writer of EVERY choice I made to be willing to share those flaws.\nI've played many text games. When I began playing there wasn't much else, unless you wanted to play Pong. Zork, which I played in 1985, is still perhaps my favorite computer gaming experience. Some of the WONDERFUL Infocom games, such as \"Suspended: A Cryogenic Nightmare\" actually benefited from being purely text. \nI've read many pages of science fiction. Between my two favorite catagories, science fiction and fantasy, the pages literally number well over a million, so there aren't many speculative fiction concepts I've not encountered.\nBut we're here to discuss \"Choice of Robots\". First off, on the basis of cost/hour this is among the MOST expensive, shortest computer games I have ever played. True, it was less than $3 (on sale), but lasted under 2 hours (even with starting over on PC #2), most of the time spent in thought. There was nothing new in this game, beyond perhaps some of the more recent concepts not devised yet when I was doing the bulk  of my reading. As far as robotics, Asimov has already said pretty much everything encountered in this story, better. While Dr. Gold has allowed the reader/gamer to create his own character, or explore themselves (however briefly), a writer as good as Asimov (or numerous others) creates a world so real you believe yourself a part of it. As far as feelings of reality, I prefer the latter.\nI began it a second time, but only a few pages, so I'm not sure if I \"achieved\" further. I'd presume I received around 1/10th of the achievements. This presumably means one of two things: 1) either the story branched so often that, even with substantial overlap in story, there were perhaps in excess of 20 endings (seemingly too many to consider equally), or 2) the story was far more fleshed out for a prefered reader/gamer type, and I was not among them. (I don't understand the purpose behind having achievements in this game, except as a selling tool. Why create a \"loser\" scenario (OR winner) in a game marketed as being an individualistic world? \"Personal choice\"=\"wrong choice\"?)\nThis felt less to me a story OR game, and more like a personality test, perhaps as component of a thesis. I admit, by far the majority of the time I spent was in contemplation of what the character I created might actually do if he were real. While the other characters I was given were extremely superficial, I still felt a strong obligation to create as real, AND as good, a world as possible for them to participate in. But despite MY agonizing over choices, I felt the writer rapidly lost interest in my character as I made less \"literary\" choices. He simply ended the story with no resolution of any kind, leaving the lead character to complete his participation several short paragraphs after life-extending, life-affirming choices. While I anticipated fighting for life using robotics as tool/metaphor, the majority of the story remaining as life choices are considered/corrected, instead I was reading the last paragraph on the final page. The overwhelming feeling was one of abandonment, much like Mary Shelley wrote of Dr. Frankenstein feeling for his creation. Except that the abandonment was of OUR jointly created world.\nQuite possibly this game/story simply wasn't written for me. Perhaps if I were educated or intelligent, or imagined greatness, there might have been some AMAZING stories in this game. Instead I'm just a regular guy with personal dreams of home, hearth and health (albeit, while dealing with greatness would be for me, a GREAT story to create, or better still, to participate in.) I've read those other people's accounts lived out THOUSANDS of times in other stories. This time I wanted it to be my story. Perhaps there are choices that would have made it longer or more interesting, but then it would not have been MY story. And after all, wasn't that the whole point?\n(4 JV)", "timestamp_created": 1419890274, "timestamp_updated": 1420410398, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 124, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.806587", "comment_count": "9", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13689707": {"recommendationid": "13689707", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088747078", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 491, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1425782646}, "language": "english", "review": "I was in love with this by the time I finished making my character, and robot.

That was such an unexpectedly wonderful experience.\n\nAs this is a CYOA (Choose Your Own Adventure), your experience may vary, but, I say with little hesitation that [i]my own[/i] experience with the story is the most meaningful experience I've had with a game - ever.\n\nAlthough wonderful in their own right, choice oriented games like The Walking Dead and Mass Effect don't even come close to what this game accomplishes.\n\n[h1]What Choice Do I Have?[/h1]\n\nCoR gives you choices.\n\nCoR gives you lots of choices that make the story feel like your own, fostering immersion in a way that traditional literature cannot.\n\nCoR gives you lots of difficult choices that may have you thinking hard and agonizing about the potential consequences. The game has no manual save function. If you make choices that lead to a premature ending, you can't undo and must start over. (such branches seem rare, though, and replaying doesn't take much time once you're familiar with the text)\n\nCoR gives you lots of difficult choices that have a real impact. Something that is uniquely possible when the creator is unconstrained by the need to create full art assets for every possibility.\n\n[h1]Deep Dive[/h1]\n\nThis \"game\" has no graphics at all except for the cover image, which is exactly akin to a book cover illustration. Is it a game or a book? I say it is most certainly a game. Graphics is not a requirement of a game. Interactivity is. A series of choices that impact the experience do a game comprise.\n\nCoR's language is competent, but not \"literary\". It reads like a matter-of-fact narrative of events that might actually happen in your life if the stars align in just the right way. Initially, I got an \"amateur\" vibe from the writing, but later realized that the experience may actually benefit from the simple, contemporary writing style. As the story progressed and sucked me in deeper, I became much too busy thinking about what was going on to criticize the writing style.\n\nCoR is (mostly) accessible. Although the fact that it was written by somebody with a Ph.D. in Computer Science does show. Having a CS degree myself, I certainly appreciated that perspective. Although lots of artistic license is taken for the sake of plot, there is lots of grounding in contemporary technology.\n\nThe story makes mostly \"reasonable\" extrapolations starting from the near future forward several decades. Like all good science (or 'speculative', if you prefer) fiction, the story poignantly references the present while writing about the future, framing the timeless human condition in extrapolated contexts.\n\nTo elaborate about why I put \"reasonable\" in quotation marks above, the story explores the future in ways that could, for the most part, conceivably happen, and many futurists would even claim that CoR's extrapolation towards the Singularity doesn't go far enough. However, the author is not afraid to explore fantastic scenarios that probably won't happen, at least not soon, and in some cases, hopefully never.\n\nThe scope of the story is indeed quite epic, following the main decades of a lifetime of the character you control. I do have to object to the game description's categorization of this as a \"novel\", though, as it is not nearly long enough to count as one. At best, it is the length of a (very) short story (a single playthrough takes a matter of hours). On the other hand, the sheer amount of content of all possible branches easily exceed the length of a long novel (50% longer than Moby Dick). It's quite an accomplishment.\n\nAnd, if you are worried about this being a boring, technical slog, don't be. Despite the apparently sterile subject matter of robots, there is plenty of emotion in this game - or, at least, there can be, depending on your choices.\n\n[h1]Turn to Page 23[/h1]\n\nI've only explored one of the many, distinct branches of CoR. I will probably be going back to explore the others.\n\nI heartily recommend CoR to anyone who can read English, especially those with an interest in technology and/or science fiction.\n\nNote that there is also a free demo where you can play through the first 2 chapters (out of 7), either via Steam, or on the developer's web site.\n\n[h1]UPDATES[/h1]\n\nHaving now explored a few other branches and having made more \"optimal\" choices, I feel that choosing less optimally for the first playthrough does make for a better experience.\n\nMy first playthrough involved an above average number of failures and tragedies, which amounted to a much more poignant experience than when everything basically goes well.\n\nI do suggest playing the game \"organically\". Perhaps it is unlikely to play optimally the first time around anyway. Certainly I would discourage any attempts to \"cheat\" by looking up optimal choices beforehand.

I'm a huge Transformers fan, so a game entirely revolving around the idea of playing a character that creates robots and the impact/influence that has on the world immediately grabbed my attention.  I tried the demo, and was hooked.\n\nI'd never heard of the developer, \"Choice of Games\" before now, but their other works are of a similar vein.  All of them are basically text-based CYOA (Choose Your Own Adventure) games, much like the old CYOA books of our childhood.  You play a character is can be like, or unlike yourself, and progress through a series of choices that can have a variety of branches, leading the story's eventual conclusion.\n\n\"Choice of Robots\" follows the life of a young college student, trying to build their own robot.  It starts with a cryptic dream sequence (an excellent plot hook I might add), before going into 'character creation', which consists of selecting a name (either a custom one, or chosen from a list), and your gender.  (I should note, you can only select 'boy' or 'girl', so NB people don't get an option, sorry!)  From there, you make choices which influence a variety of stats (which can be easily checked), including your Fame, Wealth, status of your relationship with the NPCs, and other numerical values.  The status screen even gives you a summary of all the completed chapters so far, sort of an abridged version of your story.\n\nThe writing is well done.  It's vague enough that you can easily imagine events or people in your head as you would want them to be, while still giving them enough detail that it's not a complete blank space.  There's a template, and you can fill the gaps.  The way the game interprets your choices is quite fascinating too.  Even small, seemingly insignificant choices can influence future areas.  Not all influences turn out to be significant, but it does address and acknowledge choices you've made, so it feels like you're having a greater push on the story.\n\nHowever, for all of the game's interactivity and originality, it falls (sometimes painfully) flat in a few areas.  The biggest and probably most damning thing, is the lack of a save/load function.  It autosaves your progress, so if you need to take a break, you can shut it down, go do something else, come back, and immediately jump back in.  And with the summary in status, you can easily determine where you're at.  But without a hard save function, you literally have to start completely over to experiment with new branches and decisions.  This does give a sense of finality and weight to the story, since you can't save-scum for an \"ideal\" outcome (to whatever degree a player would consider 'ideal anyway), but it makes trying out different decisions painfully tedious, as you have to start over totally anew each time.\n\nThis leads to the second issue, and one that most adventure games always fall into, and was the trap of the CYOA-genre: replayability.  While Choice of Robots has a LOT of variation, after a while you do start to notice the patterns.  You'll start to know which options lead to what future choices.  Eventually, it probably becomes second-nature what sort of paths lead to a particular ending.\n\nWhich ironically enough, leads to a sub-issue of this problem.  While some of the patterns are obvious, others are not.  Painfully not.  There's a few branches I have NO idea how to access, because the options you'd need aren't very obvious, and the achievement descriptions don't help at ALL.  And as there's no guides, it's a constant stream of trial and error.  This also hurts in-game.  It's not always obvious how good (or bad) a stat should be to elicit a particular response, or to enable particular choices, which again, can only be determined through trial and error, and a LOT of it.  So be prepared that if you're someone who really wants to earn/unlock everything, it'll take some time.\n\nThe NPCs tend to suffer as well.  As the story focuses on your avatar and his creation, the NPCs, while recieving a modicum of development, don't really tend to be more than accessories to the overall story.  There's a variety of them, and story does do justice to fleshing them out at times, but after a point they sort of fall into scripted roles and don't really contribute to the story beyond being names.  And scripting can be a problem as well.

To be honest, I started the game off not too into it, disliking how the game opened up and unsure of what to expect and whether I'd enjoy the story. After a few pages into it, I fell in love with it, and consequently my little robot child. \n\nAs other reviewers have said already said, it's hard not to give away any story spoilers while discussing PROs and CONs, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nThe game does a great job of giving you several ways to navigate throughout the story, while making each story \"branch\" or \"path\" just as detailed as the others you passed over. While some of these CYOA games feel like choosing one option over the other is only to gain/change some stat, with little variance in the rest of the story, [i] Choice of Robots [/i] does not do this. It's also incredibly written, with just enough detail to help you envision the story, while giving your brain the freedom to \"fill in the holes\" to your desire on how something/someone looks. For example, you design a robot specifically pick out certain components/aspects of it that give you a general basis of how it looks. However, someone else may have picked the same exact makeup of their robot but imagine it differntly in their head because the writing leaves things purposefuly open for you to imagine.\n\n\nIn short, if you really enjoy scifi writing and the idea of advanced robots in the near future, you'll absolutely love this game. Even if you don't, like me, you'll probably still end up enjoying it and admire it for the plot and detailed writing.\nIf you hate CYOA games, which is totally fine, .... yeah you probably won't enjoy it.

I've played most of them, including the Hosted Games. They're fun to play around with and some have pretty good writing. However, most of them don't live up to the concept of being a choose-your-own-adventure. Instead, they are more like customizable linear narratives. There are things that are always going to happen, you can't avoid them, all you're changing is your reaction or the broad methods you use to complete the scenarios.\n\nChoice of Robots is easily the best CoG release. That core that exists in all CoG works is present in Robots. There are plot points you always hit, but they are more like the screws to the narrative, not the meat of it. Your choices mean a lot in Robots. The story and specifics change based on your choices. YOU, the PC, feel like much more of a character than in other CoG stuff. You feel more drawn in. The customization, the impact of choices, gives the game an insane amount replayability. Where other CoG games have you skimming through the text on replays to find the one paragraph that has changed since the last time, with this one the changes are in your face. You will experience radically different stories each time.\n\nSecondary characters are always pretty weak in CoG games. They're not spectacular here, but they are better than usual. The romantic interests in CoG works are quite often non-characters. They tend to be little more than some text in your stat window. Here they have a little more character, picking one person over another will lead to minor events playing out differently. It's a good step that is small, but noticeable.\n\nThere's one problem with Choice of Robots (unless you consider the game being text only a problem and if that's the case you don't need to read this review to know if the game is for you) and that the lack of a save of any kind. This is standard for CoG and in the past it hasn't been too much of a problem. Here, I find it bothersome. Possibly, because in Choice of Robots it feels more like a \"Game Over\" than a \"The End.\"  If the possibility of death was more prominent in the game, if it made things more tense, if it were anything more than just a narrative possibility it would be much less annoying. If you're OCD, you have to go back and try to recreate your game exactly to get back to that point.\n\nIf you're a fan of reading, a fan of CYOAs, if your favorite part of RPGs is dialogue trees, then Choice of Robots is the perfect game for you.", "timestamp_created": 1419369341, "timestamp_updated": 1420497200, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483678", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13552202": {"recommendationid": "13552202", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042103538", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 975, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1420872473}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought this game due to my interest in Zork and I honestly think this is much better, clear options instead of all inputs and the narative is well done.

This made Choice of Robots a must-buy for me and so far I'm not disappointed. Definately recommended for people who like robots or soft sci-fi and who are interested in CYOA games.\n\nFor the computer I actually prefer my CYOAs in the form of interactive fiction/text adventures (like Zork, Spider and Web, or Suspended which also prominently features robots). That way the choices can become sort of puzzles and the player can have more freedom over what to do and if it's done well can lead to awesome \"wow the devs thought of everything!\" moments. I think Choice of Robots would also have benefitted by that form and the freedom that comes with it, especially together with its neat stat system for your robots.\nThe freedom of choice in the game is still reasonably good. You usually get about 3 or 4 options to choose from and most of the time they are very different from each other and every option changes the course of the game quite a bit, giving a lot of replayability.\nHowever some big events will always or at least almost always happen at a certain point in the story as far as I can tell so far. They usually play out in a different way, depending on your choices, though.\n\nWhat hurts the replayability a bit is the saving system: When you close the game while in the middle of the story, you continue at the point you had reached once you start the game again but there's no option to manually save a game state or undo a choice. Arguably this makes your choices more \"meaningful\". But sometimes it would be nice to be able to go back and see what happens if I had done X instead of Y in an otherwise unchanged path without going through all the same choices that came before again.\nIt would also help with a few choices that are worded a little too vague but the majority is worded in a way that makes it more or less obvious what your character is going to do, so that point is not a big deal.\n\nThe story and the writing itself are nice and I enjoyed all of my playthroughs so far. You start by building your robot after your own specifications, continue to develop it depending on your choices and possibly even change the course of the whole world.\nYou can be a misunderstood genius living in your mother's basement, CEO of a multi-million dollar robot company, try to take over the world as a mustache-twirling mad scientist, or even transcend humanity towards a life as machine.\nPersonally, I would have liked inclusion of at least some more common robot tropes, like assigning basic laws (Asimov's, others or none) to the robots or being able to pursue creating pure AIs but you can't have everything.\nThere were only a couple things I didn't like but they are little details and come down to personal preferences. \nOne is the mention of actual brand names for some things (like alienware or Dr Dre's headphones). I get that they probably help to characterize some of the characters but I feel like that's a missed opportunity to use the scifi genre to full effect by inventing new original devices and imagine how today's technology could develop.\nGranted, the game takes place in the not-so-distant future of 2019 but there are also already sentient robots and flying cars.\n\nAnother thing: in several spots (most prominently character descriptions) the game appears to have been written with \"political correctness\" always in mind. I don't want to discuss PC in general at this place but I think that it doesn't work well as a literary device in a piece of fiction and grinding down the edges, so to speak, hurts the storytelling. Again this is a matter of preferences, just know what you're getting into if you're absolutely allergic against those kinds of things.\nIn the same vein some political aspects of the story seem a bit loaded (especially when the military, the US, or money is involved). The game is never preachy about any of this, it just seems a bit ham-fisted in some parts. \nAnyway the game is not a political or economical simulator but an interactive story about robots and it does that point well, so that are only minor points. If nothing of this bothers you, Choice of Robots is a great COYA game.\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1419287304, "timestamp_updated": 1419287797, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.613390", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13532003": {"recommendationid": "13532003", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072306893", "num_games_owned": 450, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455946980}, "language": "english", "review": "I cannot believe how much Awesomeness this Game has to offer.\n\nChoice of Robots is without Sound, without Controls, without Animations or anything.

If you're familiar with these games or enjoy text adventures in general, then it's simple: pick this one up, it's the best installment yet. If you're not however, it's as good a starting point as any, especially when there's a free demo that adequately presents what the game entails.\n\nRobots is about crafting, growing and teaching your own personal robot, and for someone familiar with the Choice of Games series, that's all you really need to know. Besides the wildly varied tone and settings, the majority of these games function nearly identically.  For those who are new, it's a text adventure, and what that boils down to is simply: You read a whole lot and make choices. There's no graphic, no music and no action (besides the ones being described with words). And if that puts you off, that's fair, still, the demo's free if you want to confirm your position.\n\nAs with most other games of the series, the choices you make influence your stats and how the story progress and, again, as with the other installments, the game encourages at least a certain degree of specializations. What is new, however, is that the protagonist have only one stat to keep track of, humanity, which tracks how kind, humane, social and emotional your decisions are. Your robot, on the other hand, has four stats: Autonomy, Military, Empathy and Grace, and the decisions you make throughout the game influence what kind of robot you will have, and, in turn, how you will influence the world. Would you end up with a mindless militaristic machine at your whim, a self-conscious and independent robotic sentient being or a curious, constantly learning robot with near (or perhaps completely) human emotions? Chances are, though, you're going to end up with a combination of all the things in between. \n\nWhile, like the other Choice of Games, Robots do strongly encourage specialization in at least one or two stats, the games do not seem to punish you as harshly for deviation from your initial plans. The other Choice of Games' strategic elements usually boil down to specializing in a number of areas and then make only decisions that test your strong points and avoid your weaknesses. Robots is similar, except you have more leeway and, in fact, planning becoming a lot more difficult as decisions often have unforeseen consequences. For example, there's a point in the game where you are able to make a decision on what kind of information you want your robot to extract on the internet, and allowing it to pick up whatever it wants result in it learning things like \"Big Brother is watching\" and \"the US is the bad guy\", resulting in a substantial raise in intelligence (Autonomy) and a distrust of authority (Military). There's also a point in the game where your robot is interviewed, and if your Autonomy is high enough, the review will claim your robot is smarter than humans, giving it a boost in confidence (Autonomy) while making it more arrogant (decrease in Empathy). While the unpredictability of the gameplay structure here may hamper cold strategic decision making, it also makes the story more spontaneous and exciting, as your choices can have truly unforeseeable consequences later in the game, making the narrative incredibly dynamic. That said, depending on what you choose to focus on, the game can also end up rather difficult, requiring multiple restarts, which is even more frustrating considering the fact that the game has no manual save whatsoever, forcing a restart every time you want to change something. I believe this is to make you committed to your choices and make each playthrough special and dynamic, but I still feel that the game would benefit more from having a save system of some description, especially when you've already completed the game and don't feel like skimming through most of the story to change one decision. Robots, in particular, seems to offer more consequences and variations to your decisions than any other game in the series I've experienced (skim through the achievement list if you want to know how much you could achieve, and know that I only got 10 in one playthrough, and I thought I did pretty well). That said, personally, I don't plan on replaying the game anytime soon. This is in no way a fault of the game, but rather a strength, as I feel so attached to my first playthrough that any second attempt would feel as if I've cheated that unique experience.\n\nBut gameplay aside, this is still a text adventure, and as a game that's going to make you spend the majority of your time reading, it lives and dies on the writing. Robots, like most of its predecessor, does not disappoint in this regard. There's moment of humor, melancholy, romance (with the usual inclusiveness of the series) and, perhaps most of all, introspection. The parental relationship between you and your robot becomes clear very early on, and the game handles it extremely well. Your robot grows, imitates and reacts to your actions as you would expect, with great curiosity and bewilderment. As I watch it develops, I feel proud when it understands or questions, scared when it picks up undesirable tendencies, happy when it expresses indignant at cruelty and warm when it seems more human than any living character by the end, while still having more to learn and expressing fear of the inevitable as a child would. At least that's how it was for my Sapling (that's how I named mine, and Sapling was a she and refers to me by my real name rather than titles because that's the level of customization you have), your robot could go in so many unforeseen direction it's difficult to \"plan\" its development, and considering the theme, I think that's the point. The human characters, while getting less attention, are well-written and varied enough in their own right, but some, even if you choose to begin a relationship with them, will feel somewhat detached from the main storyline until the latter chapters. The game, despite its initial lightheartedness and humor, asks difficult question, present morally ambiguous choices and depicts interesting, introspective themes. The final two or three chapters are the most powerful part in the game for me because it shows the growth of your robot and how you've molded the world, for better or worse, as well as calling your ideals into question. I can only speak for myself, but my ending reflected my choices appropriately, filling me with wonder, doubt, melancholy and hope. While the game has its stronger points and weaker, more filler-y portions, the finale was undoubtedly my favorite experience of any Choice of Game story.\n\nIf you enjoy the Choice of Games text adventures, then I'll just repeat myself: Buy the damn game, it's, at least in my opinion, the best in the series yet. If you have no interest in the structure and ideas behind text adventures, then I suppose there isn't much here to convince you otherwise besides good writing. If you're new and willing to try out one of these games though, I can't think of a better place to start. Choice of Robots is inspiring, funny, well-written and introspective, and for a game about robots, it has more philosophies and humanity behind it than most games out there combined.\n\np.s.

From the historical remembrance of the drama between Edison vs Tesla; from the familial legacy of Ir\u00e8ne Curie who tested the structure of the atom her parents began to explore, dying from her own research; and from the names that forever shaped the world, better or worse, such as Einstein and Fritz Haber\u2014science is a history about people, whether of minor or major feats, making choices from their newfound knowledge that may lead to their own ruin, bring them fame, or haunt them in the future to come.  This is the essence of what makes Choice of Robots an amazing piece of interactive fiction.\n\nChoice of Robots is the type of game I always wanted to become real, a choice-based adventure around the ambitions of science. What the Civilization games recreate in terms of history as a strategy game is what CoR conveys as a choice-based interactive fiction. It may not have the same scale or freedom, but what CoR does do exceptionally well is create a piece of interactive fiction about the accumulation of your choices. There are simply too many variables, decisions, different outcomes to explore that one playthrough is not enough to experience the whole narrative. While I may be unfamiliar to other \u201cChoice of\u2026\u201d titles, if you were ever curious about their merits, then Choice of Robots would be the best place to start. \n\n[h1]Choices We Make Are Not Always Perfect, Though They Are the Journey[/h1]\n\nSomething that was largely apparent when playing Welcome to Moreytown alongside Choice of Robots was the overall value of every decision. There is a great difference in quality offered that not only impacts the lasting consequence and ending but the overall story you build. CoR is simply a piece of fiction made greater by its interactivity to drive its narrative than something arbitrary with no impact on every decision. This is the quality of excellence that separates novels written into a game format and stories created to be their own game. \n\nWhile the narrative is largely linear with some branching paths, the meaning you create each time is due to the sum total of your decisions around the robot you create. CoR largely takes inspirations from old CRPGs by applying stats to an interactive fiction, and the story (and game) is better because of these inclusions. Flavor-text isn\u2019t simply arbitrary side-notes or meaningless jokes as every decision is based around four major stats that affect your creation: Empathy, Autonomy, Military and Grace. Other stats influence the narrative such as the player\u2019s own stats of Fame, Wealth and relationships with other characters that further add value to each decision. Sometimes the game will put you and your creation at odds with one another\u2019s future goals; sometimes the story will choose different scenes or introduce fail-states to add more variety to the story. From beginning to end, no moment feels forgotten even if the plot does not draw attention to it because the mechanics already are enough of a reminder.\n\nAll these dynamic elements, thanks largely to the smart usage of stats, create tangible value to each new playthrough, and the moments that they create such as learning empathy by playing video-games or becoming autonomous from a mistake the creator made are the memories you can recall when the journey comes to its end.\n\n[h1]It\u2019s Not a Question of \u201cHow?\u201d or \u201cWhen?\u201d; It\u2019s the Readiness for the Future[/h1]\n\nIt would be an accomplishment for Choice of Robots to simply tell a narrative in a game-format that plays to its strengths to tell its own narrative for players. The genius element behind CoR is the narrative across multiple playthroughs reaffirms what the linear structure reminds you: You cannot prevent the future from arriving, but you can shape how the future will play out.\n\nThe game largely hints at this with the idea of the Singularity of robotics where the rising development of robots becoming more human presents the outcome that robots will possess greater intelligence than their creators. Whether that is the result of superpower countries waging war, economic crises due to the robotics industry, robots becoming more than simply human, and other possibilities the game presents, the outcome always results to that conclusion. Similar to Groundhog Day, it\u2019s the inevitability of tomorrow that makes you realize it doesn\u2019t matter who or how that day will come to pass. The truth that you learn to accept is that it would have happened to another scientist other than yourself, and it\u2019s how you decide to handle the situation that will determine the lasting consequences on the world. Whether you wish to accept them or not, that decision to choose or to abstain are two possibilities that are always within your control. \n\nThis attitude is what many great scientists come to accept with the pursuit of science, even when it may be a mark of shame. As Einstein wrote before his death, \u201cI made one great mistake in my life [\u2026] when I signed the letter to President Roosevelt recommending that the atom bombs be made; but there was some justification \u2013 the danger that the Germans would make them.\u201d Like the atomic bomb, Choice of Robots allows you to stand on that same precipice all great scientists must face when they must choose the one future out of the many possibilities they are more comfortable to accept.    \n\n[h1]The Closest 10/10 Recommendation I Will Ever Give[/h1]\n\nIt\u2019s honestly difficult to think of any legitimate issues with Choice of Robots unless the thought of reading makes you want to turn away\u2014or if you don\u2019t find any merit behind these \u201cChoice of\u2026\u201d games. No aspect of the plot, decisions or aspects you must consider feel frivolous to the narrative. The writing is remarkably charismatic in quality and the ability to connect with these characters, even if they are somewhat simple archetypes. As much as I detest review scores, it would be difficult to rate this game anything short of perfection because it manages to tell a simple story in a well-executed manner beyond the expectations of what I had of these games. There may not be anything noteworthy in its narrative or revolutionary as a piece of interactive fiction, but if execution on an idea is not the most important quality than the future should be given to robotic overlords who have more humanity than us.", "timestamp_created": 1515012180, "timestamp_updated": 1515037034, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.584906", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39000301": {"recommendationid": "39000301", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119454027", "num_games_owned": 205, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 675, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 160, "last_played": 1516151395}, "language": "english", "review": "Turns out taking over the world is a bit difficult.", "timestamp_created": 1514958166, "timestamp_updated": 1514958166, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38999808": {"recommendationid": "38999808", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070044674", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514956023}, "language": "english", "review": "I've only done a single playthrough.

Every CYOA game try to claim that choice matter but in most of them, the text is nearly identical no matter what choices you pick. There are broad difference in story flow base on dialog choice and success or fail of events base on stats but that is it. CoR is different, at least for the first part up to the end of the war. I see attention to details everywhere, text and event flow subtlety different based not only on different dialog choices but also on the stats of your robot.\n\nFor example, a broad story decision of getting funded or not and by which department depend on whether you are willing to compromise on meeting the military's requirement (dialog choice) and 20 pts in a single stats (stats). It is not the result of just selecting a dialog option, but the accumulation of all the decisions you made previously. It not only make the result feel natural, but also make the choices affecting the stats feel relevant. Choice mattered indeed.\n\n2) Subtle changes in text that show the attention in details the author put in. For example, the night after your robot is activated, if the autonomy is high, the robot will explore on its own, otherwise (if empathy is high?) it will stay and watch you sleep. There are many more examples like this and whenever I notice them, I really appreciate the effort the author put in. It is what make the robot come alive for me. I do not see the same level of details for other CYOA games and unfortunately, only the first few chapters of CoR have this level of detail.\n\n3) Small decisions at the start have large impact much later down the road. For example using the cellphone battery will screw you up when war with China start and it is the straw on camel back that bankrupt me on my first play through. This is a really brilliant cascading mechanics that make CoR much better than other CYOA games.\n\n4) Feedback. The one thing I hate about CYOA games is when the game present me with bland choice A, B and C. I look at them and wonder why I should choose one over another and suspect that none of the choice have any impact. One factor that make the first part of CoR so amazing is that nearly every decision I make at the first part of the game, I can see how it affect the stats of my robot. I get feedback that let me know I am indeed making a difference.\n\n5) List possible endings/Set a goal at the start. If your game have multiple different endings, you better let me know so I have incentives to replay the game. I also need some hints on which decisions I should make differently to get those endings because I am sure as heck not going to have the time to try every permutation of dialog choice in the hope that you have hidden an ending there. A few hidden endings are fine, but don't leave me in the dark completely. The starting dream of CoR is an excellent mechanics although the singularity hint is perhaps a bit too explicit.\n\nCoR is of course not perfect. The story start to fall flat after the war. The attention to details is gone and I hardly feel any attachment to the companion bot I built. The most memorable part is when I taught my robot about death and even that part could have been stronger if it have connection to the first lesson on death when the father dies.\n\nLastly I want to add a general criticism I have for CYOA games in general. Language is imprecise. It is impossible for an author to communicate his/her intention via description and dialog options to the reader perfectly. And indeed, sometimes it is better for the communication to be intentionally vague as it allow the reader space for his/her own imagination.\n\nHowever, I personally hate it when dialog options are vague on its consequences or which skill check it is trying to make. I dislike having to deduce or guess the intention of the author behind each of the dialog choice to make a decision. It is inevitable that misunderstanding occurs, or that the author's interpretation of event/choice does not match with the mine and when it happens it ruins the play through. This is especially frustrating towards the end of the game because there is no save option.", "timestamp_created": 1514822758, "timestamp_updated": 1514822758, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38930017": {"recommendationid": "38930017", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159699008", "num_games_owned": 226, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514799595}, "language": "english", "review": "I have no way of descibing this game, but after what i assume to be my first playthrough of 4 or 5, I am blown away, Fantastic, and 100% worth the $5.49 CAD I got it for.", "timestamp_created": 1514799675, "timestamp_updated": 1514799675, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}}

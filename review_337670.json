I think the $6 price tag is reasonable in and of itself, but if it's on sale for a dollar and some pocket change again, I'd highly recommend buying this game if you're into platforms. On a side note, I found the levels to be designed more like a Mario Maker level than and actual Mario game. I understand that yes, the game is designed so that everything seems good is bad and everything that seems bad is good, but I guess what I'm saying is that the level design lacks a certain \"polish\" that I can't quite explain in words.

Rendered beautifully in 2.5D and standing somewhere between old classics like Super Mario World and the modern era of platformers. Couple that with a wonderful soundtrack by [i]brentalfloss[/i] of DKC, SMW, Megaman (and more!) fame, which only added to the nostalgia. \n\nWhile 20 levels may not seem like a lot of content, Default Dan will make you rage and keep coming back just to perfect runs.

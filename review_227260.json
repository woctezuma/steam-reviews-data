And for people with screens having a different resolution, its mouse management offers an option to prevent the mouse from getting stuck in the corners of the screen when the resolution does not match.\n\nIt also allows desktop shortcuts to be saved to a file, so they can easily be recovered. They can even be loaded upon switching monitor profiles, so you always have the desired desktop shortcuts available for the used profile / monitor layout. However, for me, the main usage of this function is when Windows forgets my desktop shortcut layout, after which I can easily reset it with a few clicks.\n\nFinally, the wallpaper manager can manage the desktop wallpaper and the lock screen background. It can select wallpapers from many locations, from selected folders, online storage, and many online wallpaper providers.\n\nIn short, DisplayFusion can manage everything related to your desktop, wallpapers, keyboard shortcuts, monitor configurations and much more.

Uses what appears to be JPEG to compress desktop images, and makes them look horrible. It also takes about 20 seconds to load my configuration for some reason, until it does it just tiles my main desktop image over all monitors. Being the main feature I bought this product for makes me not reccomend it. There should at least be an option to allow me to not have compressed images.\n\n2. changes how window management works, even with these settings disabled, trying to move a fullscreen window to a monitor above the one it is currently on causes it to snap into a window, then quickly go fullscreen on the monitor it was on before.\n\n3. Multi-monitor taskbars are buggy. VERY buggy. the start button does nothing on my secondary monitors, there is no way to show my pinned applications on DF taskbar, the DF taskbars sometimes dissapear and will only reappear when I open the settings for them and hit apply (without changing anything.) I really want to use them because they allow me to see the time/date and sound/network settings unlike the normal windows 10 secondary taskbars, but they are basically unusable in this state.\n\nBut there's also things I like.\n1. setting desktop wallpaper as different images on each monitor is easy.\n2. ability to quickly change audio devices is quite handy when you use multiple soundcards on a single system\n3. as stated above the DF taskbars would be much better than the standard windows 10 taskbar, if they worked right.\n4. all of the customization options. Windows has become increasingly restrictive on how you can edit your workspace, this does its best to alleviate some of that.\n\nOverall, its an ok program with a great vision, but seeing as I'm dissatisfied with the main reason I bought it, I cannot reccomend it in its current state.\nI also had to let the program open and run for 5 minutes from steam to leave this review, because it did not count my time using it for some reason, not the program's fualt, but annoying.", "timestamp_created": 1502341690, "timestamp_updated": 1502341690, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495050", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34136829": {"recommendationid": "34136829", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098942230", "num_games_owned": 142, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511609434}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u591a\u5c4f\u64cd\u4f5c\u5f88\u65b9\u4fbf\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u968f\u610f\u5207\u6362\u7a97\u53e3\u5230\u4efb\u610f\u663e\u793a\u5668\u3002\n\u7a97\u53e3\u5438\u9644\u529f\u80fd\u4e5f\u5f88\u597d\u7528\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u90a3\u4e9b\u4e0d\u80fd\u5168\u5c4f\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f88\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u628a\u7a97\u53e3\u653e\u5230\u5de6\u4e0a\u89d2\u6216\u8005\u5c4f\u5e55\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6211\u8fd9\u79cd\u5f3a\u8feb\u75c7\u6765\u8bf4\u6ca1\u6709\u6bd4\u8fd9\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4e86\u3002\n\u5982\u679c\u89c9\u5f97\u91cc\u9762\u529f\u80fd\u4e0d\u591f\u6216\u8005\u6ca1\u6709\u81ea\u5df1\u60f3\u8981\u7684\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u4ee5\u81ea\u5df1\u7528C#\u6216\u8005VB\u6765\u5199\u81ea\u5df1\u9700\u8981\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u3002\n\u6bd4\u5982\u516c\u53f8\u91cc\u9762\u7684\u952e\u76d8\u4e0d\u5e26\u97f3\u91cf\u8c03\u8282\u952e\uff0c\u6211\u81ea\u5df1\u5c31\u5199\u4e86\u4e2a\u8c03\u8282\u97f3\u91cf\u7684\u5feb\u6377\u952e\u3002\n\u603b\u4e4b\u5f88\u68d2\u7684\u4e00\u6b3e\u8f6f\u4ef6\uff0c\u5168\u4ef7\u8d2d\u4e70\u4e5f\u5f88\u503c\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1502329159, "timestamp_updated": 1502329159, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33952430": {"recommendationid": "33952430", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110159908", "num_games_owned": 671, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501604286}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u50bb\u903cwin10\u6700\u65b0\u7684\u4e00\u6b21\u66f4\u65b0\u53d6\u6d88\u4e86\u53cc\u5c4f\u53cc\u58c1\u7eb8\uff0c\u800c\u6211\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c4f\u662f\u7ad6\u653e\u7684\u3002\u8fd9\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4e70\u4e86\u4e24\u5e74\u6ca1\u5f00\u8fc7\uff0c\u4eca\u5929\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u89c9\u5f97\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6709\u7528", "timestamp_created": 1501604729, "timestamp_updated": 1501604729, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33917259": {"recommendationid": "33917259", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024615683", "num_games_owned": 2197, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513610702}, "language": "english", "review": "Great piece of software and a must have for anyone running multiple moitors.

I'm happy I did, because I would've had to change my review to reflect all the awesome changes the developers have enabled for this software since then. I'm so entirely happy I installed this, especially being an extreme advocate of triple monitors. I've put this software through trails in processing and it has held up every time. It has only ever crashed due to a conflict with a screensaver that I uninstalled out of disinterest anyways. \n\nThusfar I believe this is the highest score I have given to anything, but it is well earned.

This kind of functionality has been sorely lacking in Windows for a long time. I've owned a couple business laptops over the years that used Nvidia's nView desktop management software (which is only available for their workstation-type Quadro cards, unfortunately), and this is definitely a good substitute. It's a bit less polished than nView, but that's to be expected when you're comparing it to workstation utlities. It fixed the biggest problem I had with multiple monitors, which was simply getting programs to always start up on the active monitor. \n\nNow, why I actually need an additional piece of software in order to make this happen is beyond me. You'd think someone at Microsoft would've noticed by now that new windows almost always open on whatever particular monitor would be least useful for them to open on. \n\n^^^^  If anyone wants to mention how annoying this is to someone at Microsoft so they can fix it, I would much appreciate it, and while you're at it, let them know that whenever I click \"End Process\", the computer does the exact opposite, almost every single time. \n\nI feel like I'm under a lot of pressure to write a fair, objective, and highly informative review, based on the facts of my user experience... it probably would've been easier if I had just typed \"10/10 - would buy another monitor again\", or something stupid like that, rather than actually trying to tell you why I like this software.\n\nDisplay Fusion does a lot of other great stuff too, and a more dedicated reviewer would take the time to tell you, dear reader, about all of it. Don't give up; you may yet find the work of such a dedicated reviewer. The last paragraph of this review will not provide an new information and is essentially a rewording of the first paragraph of this review.  \n\nDon't let the comparison to nView deter you - this is a little less polished but it probably does more overall, if you take the time to customize it.

Anyone with 2 or more monitors should have it. \n\nWhat I was looking for was a simple way to manage multiple monitor profiles because the Windows display management is severely lacking. It was a pain to connect to my HDTV, enable the display, change the audio device, and then disable my other secondary display. You're talking at least 5 separate steps to get it working correctly.\n\nDisplayFusion made it so incredibly easy to bind a hotkey for this function. When I want to play Big Picture, I hit the hotkeys and it enables the display, makes it the primary, disables the other, and makes my desired playback device the default. On top of that, it was super simple to set up. In about 5 minutes I had it working like a dream.\n\nDoing a little MORE digging, I found a user-made function that can do all of the above with one simple keystroke AND launch Steam in Big Picture directly. Better yet, there's a remote App for iPhone that allows me to call this function while sitting on my couch. Even better, I can use the app to switch Audio Devices on the fly when I need to hook up my headphones to avoid annoying my neighbors. \n\nThese functions alone have made this software absolutely worth the price. I'd pay double the asking price to have them.  The window management and advanced snapping functions are the cherry on top of the cake.\n\nIt's an exceptional software, well-supported and does exactly what I wanted and more.

Sometimes when one monitor shuts off they all go over to one side or the other (stupid windows).  But, when it does that, if you unlock your taskbar, and drag it back tot he other monitor, your icons go back.   Or, you can use the built in icon location save/restore feature in this app.  Probably easier just drag your taskbar back the one in the blue moon this happens, as your dekstop icons change over time.\n\nIf you set your right monitor as your \"primary\" display and move taskbar and everything else to your left, your fullscreen games will awlays start on the right monitor.  right/left/center, it's all the same, you get the idea.  This lets me keep a \"desktop monitor\" on my regular screen and a \"game/netflix\" monitor on my TV.\n\nThat's not to say that this app isn't useful.  It's actually all kinds of useful, with a lot of neat features.  I think my fav feature so far is that it works with Win 10, and lets you set diff backgrounds for each monitor.  You can even set folders for it to randomly cycle through.  How cool is that?\n\nAnother cool trick is, if you don't use your desktop icons all the time, just right click your desktop, click view, and uncheck \"show desktop icons\".  When you want your icons back, just check the box again to show them ^.^  I mainly use my taskbar for things, but I do use my desktop now and then.  And thank god that uuuuuugly fullscreen start menu is dead in desktop mode in 10.\n\nWin10 is still new, but works pretty well from what I've seen in being backward compatible, This great app fills in a lot of missing features in backround/desktop management.

It is really easy to set it up\n[*] Screensaver - Interesting feature that it can have separate screensaver for each monitor.\n[*] Remote - It have a remote app for your phone and tablet. For all Android, iOS, Window Phone, Windows and Blackberry. I tried it once, it is really a great remote. It have a tons of feature packed inside it.\n[*] DP Icon in Window - they have this button that will be add to all window bordered.

Oh well.\n\nBut it's actually a desktop customization software. It has a very expensive initial price (which I'm actually NOT going recommend) but if you can grab it on sale, totally go for it. It's the best multiple monitor software with numerous other pretty neat features. It makes your life much easier and prettier if you're into that kind of thing:\n- Quite professional and proper Multiple Monitor Support software (having tried about a dozen of them, free ones tend to suck, paid ones don't seem worth it. Except this.)\n- Assign different screensavers to different monitors\n- Assign different wallpapers for different monitors (rescale or not, your choice)\n- Extend wallpapers if you want\n- Extended windows taskbar (A must have if you're using multiple monitors and an older OS than win8, since this is a native feature for win8)\n- Alt-tab out of games without game screwing up. Or even manage stuff on other monitors without alt-tabbing.\n- Highly customizable settings (change clock color, alpabet blabla)\n- Different start menu designs (pretty nice)\n- Sound efffects\n- It's pretty\n\nOverall these are the first few features that I use the most, but there is more to it than these. Most people just require only one feature of this. Still it's totally worth the sale price. Enter the advanced settings and tweak with it as you please. It's a one time purchase as there aren't any in app purchases or rip offs. But again, it's quite expensive without a sale. I grabbed it on the summer sale for a steal of 6 bucks.\n\nEven a software with such quality and as many features should not exceed $20 anyway. I really can't see how it is worth $40.\n\nAnwyay, quite fond of it, using it, and haven't encountered any problems so far.

Please check out the huge number of new additions since my original review; this is so much more than it was... and it was a LOT back then!!!\n\n------------------\nOLD REVIEW:\n\nTotally worth it.\n\n+ DisplayFusion makes working with multiple monitors and multiple configurations a breeze, whether you just want to manage multiple displays or set specific wallpaper configurations, or confine your mouse cursor to a specific region of a specific monitor, or to a specific window or a specific monitor or virtual monitor you've defined.\n\n+ Can completely take over handling screensavers and wallpaper changes. Set what you want and be happy with your Windows configuration.\n\n+ You can use the Windows key as part of your Ctrl+Shift+Alt+etc. hotkey definitions, something most software doesn't allow, so you have even more available!\n\n+ Does it annoy you when you're playing a game and the taskbar or another window moves to the top (front) and messes you up by covering your game or stealing the input? This'll fix that for you. Annoyed by having your mouse cursor leave the screen and go to another screen when you're trying to do something precise? That annoyance is easy to avoid with DisplayFusion! How about when the topmost window freezes or you can't access the OS? Use a DisplayFusion-managed taskbar on another monitor (or the first) to manipulate your GUI in any way you like. Set your favorite features/scripts/etc. to run using an icon on the titlebar of the window. I can't enumerate in one review the number of features or the huge potential this software has for improving your productivity and the usability of your PC.\n\n+ The developers are very friendly and helpful and open to suggestions for new features and ideas to implement in upcoming versions\u2014this sofware is updated frequently and the developers are very active when it comes to solving problems, fixing bugs, writing scripts (if you're not up to scripting monitor/UI/window changes yourself), or just telling you how a feature works if it seems to work strangely on your Windows PC's hardware.\n\nPlease read the full description of features on the Store page or the website, since I probably missed a lot of what's great about this software. I also might have included a lot of information here that is already listed, or maybe what I've typed is different, because I wrote about the features that came to my mind first.\n\nNegatives.... hmm... I don't know.\n\nIf it seems to be taking a lot of RAM or resources, you can go into the advanced configuration and turn on \"run using idle priority\" (paraphrased) and (whichever option tells it to clean up its RAM caches more frequently/use less RAM). Personally, I noticed no decrease in performance when I turned on those configuration options (when I had half as much RAM as I now have), yet they resulted in more RAM and CPU available for other processes. Depending upon how pedantic you are and how your box is configured, you might notice different results. Use what works best for you!\n\nMy pithy review can't do it justice, so I suggest you check out the website and forums and all the reviews if you are not sure about this great software.", "timestamp_created": 1434605007, "timestamp_updated": 1474357672, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.460899", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16488578": {"recommendationid": "16488578", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026883505", "num_games_owned": 205, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442233229}, "language": "spanish", "review": "una de las mejores aplicaciones, si no es que la mejor, para los multi monitores, tiene una personalizacion grandicima, y esta traducido a multiples idiomas, y lo mejor es que si sabes leer un poco es facil de configurar", "timestamp_created": 1434598843, "timestamp_updated": 1434598843, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16486983": {"recommendationid": "16486983", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999958145", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506194489}, "language": "english", "review": "This is why i love the summer sale, \nwas thinking of buying it before but the skins in CS got the better of me.\nNow i had to sell my worm god ...and it was all good", "timestamp_created": 1434592041, "timestamp_updated": 1434592041, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502900", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16486944": {"recommendationid": "16486944", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977745441", "num_games_owned": 180, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491603577}, "language": "english", "review": "Prevent Window Deactivation (Keep game windows focused) \n\nThis program allows you to hotkey unlock the mouse cursor, task on other screens without alt tabbing you out of a game.\nHas lots of features, but this is all I wanted. \n\nSolid purchase for the sale price.\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1434591878, "timestamp_updated": 1434591878, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 107, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.883990", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16486668": {"recommendationid": "16486668", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084295335", "num_games_owned": 3187, "num_reviews": 110, "playtime_forever": 60, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4, "last_played": 1516437383}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u591a\u5c4f\u5229\u5668, \u6bcb\u9700\u591a\u8a00.", "timestamp_created": 1434590790, "timestamp_updated": 1434590790, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.597750", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16485956": {"recommendationid": "16485956", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960529397", "num_games_owned": 688, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 56, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503631959}, "language": "english", "review": "I've had this program for a while.

You don't have to worry about showing it as running on your profile.\n\nWhy would you buy it on Steam?

It's one of the most useful pieces of software for general desktop use, and definitely one of the very best applications on Steam. \n\nWhat does DisplayFusion do, you ask? It gives you the ability to put an individual Windows Taskbar on any monitor you'd like, aswell as let you have different wallpapers for your different monitors with relative ease. \n\nIt lets you pin individual programs to whichever taskbar you'd like. I've got Steam, Firefox, Chrome & Pathfinder on my main, and GeForce Experience, MusicBee, Mumble, Nexus Mod Manager and Nvidia Control Panel on my secondary.  Customising and optimising your workspace is as easy as can be with this neat lil' program.\n\nYou can also create profiles for wallpapers and the like, and have your main monitor change wallpaper every 5 minutes and 13 seconds, whilst your secondary changes every 13 minutes and 37 seconds, it really doesn't matter what you want from this software - It's up to the task. \n\nOfcourse the wallpaper settings let you pick whichever folder or website you'd like to pull the changing wallpapers from. DeviantArt page? No problem. A wallpaper site? No problem. Your Portal-wallpaper folder on one, and your Half-Life wallpaper folder on the other? No problem at all. Scaling the wallpaper? No problem at all! Do you want to re-align it horizontally and vertically? Easy peasy lemon squeezy. \n\nCustomising your taskbars and desktop environments has never been this smooth, easy & fast - Sounds like PR jargon, doesn't it?, but it's the truth. I rarely recommend any sort of paid-application, however this is one that I can't help but recommend. The Steam-Pro version is the best there is, and it's incredibly cheap for what you get.

Rather than beat around the bush, let me get straight to the thing that I'm sure you're wondering about: this is a great alternative to UltraMon.  It's got all the important features: independent monitor wallpaper, multi-monitor \"smart\" taskbars, \"send to other monitor\" buttons added to windows, hotkeys for common multiple monitor tasks, and so on.  It even has a few new features I wasn't expecting, like background overrides for the login screen.\n\nConfiguration is pretty easy and has mostly what you would expect, along with some nice bonuses.  There's even an override function to control how DisplayFusion interacts with certain pieces of software.  I would have been happy with a simple blacklist, but this actually lets you disable or enable specific features for each program, disable features globally when certain programs are running, or if necessary stop DF from hooking into the process entirely.  It's a LOT of configuration options, and is definitely appreciated given how finickey some other software can be.\n\nVisually, DisplayFusion is seamless for most applications.  The add-on taskbar looks and behaves exactly like the standard Windows taskbar.  Added buttons on the title bar (if enabled) look at home next to the normal Windows ones, but are offset enough that you won't snag them with a stray click. There are a few applications where the new buttons show up dramatically out of place - Steam being one of them - but that's what the override feature is for.   Mostly, DF does a good job of knowing when to be present and when not.\n\nFor the price I paid for DisplayFusion (it was on sale) I am very happy.

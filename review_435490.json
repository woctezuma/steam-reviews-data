Do you have a VR headset?  Do you wish you had infinite tries at the claw machine?  If so, this game is for you!\n\nI picked it up during the Steam Sale a month or so after I bought my Vive, and this is one of my favorite VR experiences in my collection.  All the games are very well done with realistic physics, interactive buttons and coin slots, flashing lights and sounds, score boards, etc.  Other than having a Vive wand in your hand, it really does feel like you're standing at the machine and playing the games with your own hands.  Objects respond just as you expect them to.  My favorite games in this collection are Rocket Ball, Arctic Shuffle, the shooting galleries, and the claw machines, though all the games are enjoyable.\n\nRocket Ball is just re-branded Skee Ball, and having played real Skee Ball at an arcade recently I have to say it is a very good simulation of the real thing.  It helps that the Vive controller has similar weight to it as a real Skee Ball ball does, and the ball responds to your motion realistically.  It's just as difficult in this game as in real life, but you don't feel like the simulation is getting in your way either.\n\nArctic Shuffle is a game I've never seen in a real arcade, but it's a fun concept and plays well.  The goal is to slide a puck down the ice and get it to stop on the highest scoring point zone without it falling off.  The physics again work very naturally and changing the velocity and direction of your movement responds accurately in game.  It's tricky, but when you get one on the 10,000 point zone it's super satisfying.  Puck collision works as expected too.\n\nThe claw machines are also a lot of fun.  I've never been one to waste away quarters in real claw machines, but having infinite quarters to free a virtual stuffed bear from his virtual captivity has occupied more of my time than I care to admit.  The physics respond well, though you only get two motions on this claw machine - forward and right.  You have to time your button presses correctly to line up the claw rather than a joystick like many real world machines have.  The toys fall out of the claw just as you'd expect, too.\n\nThe games I feel are the least realistic are the basketball, bowling, and whack-a-mole games, mainly because the controller weight and size just don't feel right.  Bowling reminds me a lot of Wii Bowling given the controller size and weight.  It's fun but not necessarily realistic.  Basketball just feels awkward when you're using one hand to throw the ball.  Dino Whack also feels too fast-paced without the heft of a big foam mallet and the feel of whacking dinos IRL.  Still fun, and done as best as they really can given the limitations of VR.\n\nI'd like to see more games added, even if they were sold as DLC.  There's a lot of potential here.  It would also be nice to see public online lobbies similar to how Rec Room operates to make the arcade feel more lively.  If you're just solo playing it feels like you're wandering around a dead, abandoned arcade even though the background sound effects indicate a lively, busy arcade with machines making noise, people talking, etc.\n\nAnother thing would be to have a way to teleport game objects back to the machine they came from if you accidentally fling them across the room.  I've lost the little boucy balls for the cannonball toss game many times, same with the scarab toss and basketball games.  They respawn in the machine if you put a new quarter in, but then you lose your points.\n\nI also noticed a glitch with the claw machines - if you put a new quarter in while the claw is retreating back to its home position, you can push the buttons to move it.  However, letting go of the buttons it will keep moving back to home.  It gets annoying.  It shouldn't let you move the claw until it resets to its home position, even if you put in a coin while it's moving back.", "timestamp_created": 1502499546, "timestamp_updated": 1502499546, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33733047": {"recommendationid": "33733047", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053781083", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504248403}, "language": "english", "review": "Well done replication of a real arcade!

They've got some drink machines that you can now open (though it doesn't show that it's open, you can hear the sound though).  After you open the drink you can pour it into your mouth almost like you're drinking it.  Kinda pointless but I guess it's there for accuracy.\n\n  There's also a ticket turn-in booth for prizes.  You earn tickets based on your scores.  Score really well and you earn a ton of tickets.  Score really poorly and you only earn a few.  After you turn in your tickets for prizes, there's a \"prize corner\" where you can store them.  \n\nAll of the games are very \"kinetic\" meaning you need to use those vive controllers to grab the balls and throw/roll them, and you have to start each game by putting money in the machines.  Unfortunately, a lot of these games don't have that realistic feel of actually handling the ball as you roll it down the skee-ball lane. Fortunately you have an endless supply of coins so when you screw it up, you can keep practicing.\n\nOf course since you DO have infinite money, the games of chance (like the crane game) just turns into \"how long am I going to stand here and keep trying?\"\n\nYou can adjust several settings outside and inside the arcade.  For example, you can make it so you're taller or shorter in game.  You can turn up the super sampling to make the graphics look better as well as the general graphics quality.  There IS multiplayer, so you can easily set up a server and invive friends (provided you have friends who have a Vive).\n\nThey've improved the movement so that in addition to the circles to teleport into, you can change a setting to allow you to teleport anywhere.   The developer is doing a lot of work to improve and this game has changed a lot for the better in the past month or two.  I am extremely happy to see that the developer is continuing to flesh out the game.\n\nThings I liked about the game:\n[list]\n  [*] It reminds me of going to Chuck E Cheez and/or Dave & Busters and trying to win enough tickets for a gameboy or something.\n  [*] A lot of the games are really authentic in design and feel (minus feeling the weight of something in your hand and feeling friction as you roll it).\n  [*] It has a lot of potential to be an awesome game when more people own the Vive and can play online.\n  [*] There's a decent variety of games to play\n  [*] Benefits greatly from lots of Room space to move in (but seated or standing is OK probably)\n  [*]  You can adjust the height of your player so that either you can feel like a giant, or a midget/child, or accurately refect your own height.\n[/list]\n\nThings I didn't like:\n[list]\n  [*] Some stuff in the game is more for looks than function\n  [*] There's an Exit game button but it just lets you out of the arcade to the \"main menu\". \n  [*] I haven't had a chance to try multiplayer. \n  [*] Having to type your name in the local leaderboard every time.  Why not let it set a name and just use that... or use your steam name?\n [/list]\n\nI think this is one of those games that unless you actually remember going to play the games in the arcades, you probably won't care too much about it.  Watch some gameplay videos before buying so you can make up your mind if it'll be fun or not.  It's still pretty physical though so you may wind up burning some calories as you frantically try to throw balls in the time limit.\n\nOverall though it has a lot of potential to be great in the future.

This is despite it being in early development. If it continues to be fleshed out and more activities added over time honestly I think I would have been happy paying as much as $30 for it.\n\nAs it stands, at time of writing I do recommend it at it's full current price tag. Early access or no the content is solid. I've experienced no glitches or bugs and every activity available in the game lived up to my expectations of it. To clarify, that means I got frustrated with things like claw machine, precisely when you would expect to be frustrated by a claw machine. :-P\n\nThe attention to detail is fantastic. Playing with the machines gives you tickets which you can spend on prizes, which are just mere decorative objects, but in fact whole new toys you can interact with. I'm very much looking forward to spending more time with the multiplayer so can play with more of the prizes with my friends.\n\nAll the machines themselves offer all the variety of leaderboards you would hope for. I'm also pleased to see the variety already present in the machines. The majority of them revolve around the pick up and throw ball mechanic but it's impressive how many different creative ways this mechanic is been applied to create different machines.\n\nThere are many arcade classic I hope to see added. The possibility for more content to be added as is just even more reason to buy it to support the developer and encourage further development. But even as it stands Pierhead Arcade is worth buying for it's current content. If you own a Vive this is a must purchase in my oppinion.\n\nEdit: After writing this review when trying the multiplayer capabilities with a friend I encountered some bugs for the first time. I went on the discussion forums and outlined the bugs. Within an hour the dev has responded and before I even had time to notice they had published 2 hotfixes that fixed the issues I described.

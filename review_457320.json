For the most part, the game runs pretty fine, is fast pase, and can be some fun, but there is a huge problem with it (at least with minimumish specs for Vive). The problem is with the racket and ball collision. It happens during the faster parts of the game, hard and above, and has made me rage quit multipul times. You see, I have watched the ball go through my racket easily more than 30 times. Whats even more annoying is that sometimes the ball will clip through the racket and then hit it on the other side, sending it flying into my own goal at an angle impossible to achive without it hitting the back of the racket.

For the first hour, I was in love with this game.  It was after the first hour that the issues began to arise.  The first is that the AI shoots the ball right on the edge of the play space.  Now, they do have a way to add padding to your play space to keep you from hitting walls, and that's a great thing to have, but when the AI is consistently throwing shots that make you fearful of hitting a wall (I hit a picture frame and smashed the glass) it stops being fun.  Tweaking the AI to keep it from throwing so many shots on the play space line would go a long way.\n\nThe other issue is the physics of the ball.  They're just not right.  Hit the ball to the left, and it curves to the right.  It does all these weird curves that make absolutely no sense and make it difficult to have any sort of strategy.  Why try to hit the ball in one direction when it's just going to fly off in the direction it wants to anyway?  That might have to do with the way the paddles are angled in relation to the controllers.  You can't hold the controllers normally and have the paddles be at a normal angle.  It's odd.  Allowing the user to modify the angle of the paddles would be nice.\n\nOverall, fun game.  But if you have a small play area or are looking for a paddle ball game where you can actually control the direction of the ball, look elsewhere.  Though I'm recommending it, I do so with reservations.\n\nYeah, I had to change my rating after continuing the play.  I just can't recommend this game. The AI is atrocious and the physics governing the ball cause one hit straight on to curve off to the side or even go behind you, which makes this game just too frustrating to bother with.", "timestamp_created": 1488065430, "timestamp_updated": 1488225966, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507234", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30151108": {"recommendationid": "30151108", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049618134", "num_games_owned": 177, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 37, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487017724}, "language": "english", "review": "Holoball is a virtual reality racket game - basically 3D VR Pong against an irritating anthromorphic square.

Many people compare it to CyberPong and, having played its demo, I can honestly say that this game is better. \nThe main problem with CyberPong, compared to this, is that here the ball actually responds to how quickly you hit it. In CyberPong, the ball goes at the same speed most of the time. In multiplayer, it just speeds up over the course of the point, but gently tapping it has the same result as hitting it with force. Here, you can feel the momentum of your bat/racket/thing getting transferred to the ball. The ball even curves if you hit it right. There is also a subtle vibration as you move your controller, making it feel as though you are actually holding a lightsaber! The music is fantastic and fits very well into the theme of the game, and the visuals make you feel as though you stepped into Tron: Legacy. This is further augmented by what the AI (your opponent) says: things like \"next human please\" if you lose and \"this may be a quirk of the reality we graced you with\" if you score a point. Kinda reminds me of GLaDOS, honestly.\nTo conclude, this game is super fun to play (it kinda feels like a workout after longer sessions) and its atmosphere is spot on.

His voice is the worst thing ever.  Imagine some guy making his voice sound unnaturally deep and then standing behind an electric fan and talking and you'll be on the right track.  If you're going to make a robot voice make it intelligible.  Or just make R2D2 sounds and give me subtitles... \n\nSo anyway, the 2nd thing that struck me was \"Wow, this is a big fucking room!\" and it was... like far bigger than the room I was playing it in... I started to worry that I was going to run into walls.  I tried not to run...This is a game where you will want to run though.  Keep that in mind.\n\nSo those things aside, what is this game?  Think \"VR pong\".  It's like all my old 70's and 80's arcade buddies came back in VR form!  So  yeah, you get a big ole paddle  (One in each hand actually) and a multifaceted VR Ball appears in front of you... swing your paddle and the ball flies towards the big red square that represents your robot AI enemy.  He makes sure his large red square hits the ball and it flies back toward you.   You will likely wind up having to dash a bit to get to the ball in time and thus you start to annoy anyone downstairs. \n\nAt first the only two modes available to you are Zen (where you're just whacking the ball against the wall) and Easy... and I assume to unlock the harder modes you have to beat the easier modes.  Fair enough.  I wouldn't want to challenge the game on hard without proving I'm not going to have a heart attack on medium first anyway.\n\nThere isn't a whole lot else to this game (or so it seems).  There was a customize option but I have no idea what options are available to customize.  Maybe paddle size? ball size?  Some kind of documentation would be nice...maybe there is some and I just didn't see it.  It's certainly not in-game though.\n\nAnyway... VR Pong, guys... this is pretty much what you can expect.  It feels a lot like you're playing squash or tennis (minus the net).  I think they could do better with this game if they added some stuff to it though... Maybe change the gravity or add some better sound effects... As it is now, it'll be a good workout (so many games this applies to) but whether that translates to fun or not has yet to be seen.\n\nI'll update this review when I've had more time with it.

Makes nailing Aces much more likely (my best is 4 in a row). I can foresee that, with practice, I could start to Roddick the crap out of this and hit them every time).\n - Low returns are a bitch. Be prepared to get down low and deflect them back defensively.\n - Don't be afraid of your weaker hand - you might actually find that your % success rate is better as you'll hit so many more across to the other side of the goal and the AI might not make it in time.\n\nI'm looking forward to seeing where this games goes.

When I would serve the ball with all my might, sometimes it'd be a cannon, and sometimes it'd be a dud. You'd get a lucky defensive shot ricochet with power into the AI's sweet spot. You really just had to make contact to stay competitive with expert AI.\n\nSince the update, ALL these problems have been resolved.  EVERY Time I serve, it zooms across the court like I intended.  Also, those fast serves get a FAST return volley.  If you serve with power, be prepared to react within a split second. Now my defensive shots are slow and easy for the AI to pick up. Against harder AI, you truly have to earn each point and smash the ball into their sweet spot.\n\nIt also now gives you a warning to use your wrist straps and perhaps replace your Vive straps with Wii straps.

I love this visual style, reminicent of the old Tron movie mixed with some polygon backgrounds from the old Virtual Boy era. Sense is scale is really nice, feels like you are in a big hall/hangar. One thing I absolutely loved was the haptic feedback of the racket. It has this long veil/ribbon streaming out of the back and as you move it, you feel it swoosh around. Really sold me on having that sci-fi racket in my hand instead of the Vive controller.\n\nBad:\n\nA bit barebones with regards to gameplay modes and options, but the base game has enough to offer initially. Future updates should include more modes (many balls come toward you, specific areas of the court give more points/are blocked, etc) and possibly power-ups (more balls, racket size changes etc). Multiplayer would also be very cool but it would require big changes to the gameplay (can't go as high vertically). One final note of warning: make sure you have a lot of space or stand as far back as you can! I have about 2.8x2.3m and was so immersed and focused on winning and smashing the ball that I scratched the controller on the wall twice in a row the first time I played it.

I also had 5 other people who came over for a \"Vive\" party try it out as well. Long story short, the game is spectacular fun and should be an instant-buy if you like pong, enjoy racket ball, or like the Tron 80s style theme. The production value feels high, the music doesn't get old, and the AI taunting is a hilarious nice touch (though I'd recommend increasing the volume of the AI a little as it's hard to hear over the music). For the price they are asking right now, this is a steal!\n\nThe gameplay itself is well done. The ball reacts as I would expect it to and I never felt like the ball did something that shouldn't happen if I really was in 3d cube in real life fighting for the freedom of the human race. There are currently 5 game difficulty modes and on the highest endurance mode, the difficulty can be punishing and can be quite easy to break into a sweat trying to catch the ball coming at you. I do wish there were more gameplay options at times, whether it be an option to have 'power-ups' or have obstacles in the way, as after awhile pong even in VR does get monotonous. The developers have an excellent concept and great execution on their hands, so iterating on it should be fairly simple and something I hope to see in future updates.\n\nAll this said, the AI seems to have trouble handling balls that are at the absolute corners of the zone and leaves them completely alone or goes in the opposite direction of them. This means the AI is susceptible to 'trick' shots, many of which go at minimal speed and still somehow make it through the paddle. I was able to replicate this a few times by 'smacking down' at the ball as it came at me and see it completely lose speed, dribble to a corner, and slowly get past the AI paddle which didn't know what to do with it. I will note, it's obvious the AI dipping out on corner shots is design decision as you get a 'sweetspot' dialogue with extra points when you hit it. I understand why they did it, but it still feels a little immersion breaking. This was infrequent enough that it didn't feel game-breaking, but it was immersion breaking enough that I recommend to the devs to look into it.\n\nFor the price they are asking, the positives far outweigh the negatives so far, and I am looking forward to pushing to top the leaderboards on release.

So while I played a paid copy of the game, I won't let this influence this review.\n\n\nAs someone enjoying sports involving rackets like Tennis or Badminton, I feel like this game is absolutely fantastic fun! Let's start with the concept. You hit a ball with a racket, either with your left or right hand, and watch as it travels towards a huge wall covered by a floating AI opponent platform. Said CPU tries to return the ball and the goal of course is to get the ball past the player. It's basically pong meeting squash. There are three alternate modes: \u201eZen\u201c is classic squash, with the player having to repeatedly hit the ball of a wall. Then there are three different difficulties for matches against an AI, each consisting of five games, first to score five wins a game. Players are rewarded points for winning and performing bonus actions like an ace serve, but get points substracted for time spent. In this highscore-based mode it's all about time basically. To round the content of, \u201eEndurance\u201c has you playing against a bot with only three lives to survive. Fundamentally, you have to score as many points as possible without letting the ball get past you more than two times. While each mode contains more or less the same key gameplay elements, they still all play diverse. Zen is best played rather slow, as you want the ball to travel as slow as possible to be able to return it as precise as possible over and over again. On the three difficulty enemy encounters, I tend to play more and more aggressively. While \u201eEasy\u201c really is quite easy, \u201eMedium\u201c already managed to give me a workout. \u201eHard\u201c definitely is a challenge and I tend to absolutely smash the ball whenever possible to get past the enemy. Spanning five rounds each, the AI gets better with the rounds played. It moves faster or returns the ball harder, giving you a great progressive increase of difficulty even within the different modes. \u201eEndurance\u201c also comes with a change-up in mechanics. While the three other enemy modes have a \u201esweetspot\u201c zone on the edges of the wall that you'll definitely want to hit, leaving the enemy no chance to reach it, this zone doesn't exist in Endurance. All my play in the three difficulty modes usually focusses on aiming at the sweetspot-zones, making it feel different to Endurance. Here, you need to out-play the enemy, once again involving forceful smashes and quick directional changes. All of the playing modes ultimately have you hitting the ball, but while incorporating the same mechanics, they still manage to feel different due to varied circumstances.\n\nThe actual gameplay is absolutely mad fun! The Vive controller just works awesome as a racket. I'm playing in a 3,8m x 1,8m space and the use of room scaling is fantastic. It can be quite exhausting running from one end to the other, though it never seemed unfair in my time with it. When the ball came through, I always knew I was too slow. All in all it feels like a work out, but a very fun one. As hard as I kept hitting the balls, I felt sore muscles just few hours later the first time I played it. The game encourages me to use both arms, as each hand is equipped with a racket. While you theoretically still can play with one controller using forehand and backhand hits, you're way better off using both. I'm usually terrible at doing anything with my non-dominant arm and as the game encourages me to still use it, I think it actually helps me getting better with it. At the start I couldn't hit a ball with it, but it has already gotten better at the end of my first session and it keeps improving. Haptic feedback on the controllers makes the swinging all the more satisfying.\n\nOne of the most fun experiences I've had in VR with the Vive so far has been jump-smashing a ball to victory. It feels so satisfying to run and jump, smashing the ball with as much force as possible. It makes me feel really bad-ass, especially if it's still precisely aimed at a sweetspot zone. The game becomes a frantic, awesome work out on both the Hard difficulty and Endurance, as the enemy tends to return the ball harder and harder. My reflexes are greatly tested as the ball can come back in any direction in my 3,8m playspace width. Smash the ball and you face quite a workout with the enemy giving you a real challenge.\n\n\nWith all the talk about smashing a controller around, I didn't come close to hitting any furniture or walls in my time with the game so far. There's a room requirement for a reason, and I think as long as you have the required 1.5m x 2m or greater, you're good to go. The room scale use seems perfect and thanks to Chaperone, I'm sure there won't be a case of destroyed furniture or controller :p I ended up hitting myself with the controllers though which is a first for me with the Vive. The heavy hitting makes it difficult to slow the controllers down in time in some occasions and thus I hit myself regularly in my first hour. The more I played though, the less this happened. But a short, important advice: It seems crucial to wear the controller wrist straps. All the smashing in combination with slippery hands can make controllers fly through the room. I actually had a controller slip happen to me, while wearing the straps though \u2013 thankfully. So remember to use them or you'll regret it.\n\nVisually, the game is looking great. The neon colors are vibrant, though the black largely black background keeps it light on the eyes. The controller rackets feature some cool visual effects, but I would suggest not to hold them directly in front of your eyes \u2013 they are very bright. The visuals give me a Tron-esque vibe and it feels great. The sense of space is fantastic! Depending on the game mode and difficulty, you play in a smaller or larger hall. Especially the large one really impresses with the threedimensional portrayal and with the ball traveling longer than in the small room, it's part of the reason why this game feels very immersive. I tend to forget that I'm wearing the Vive and that is always a good sign! The CPU is trash-talking to you during play which is fun, even though its lines become repetitive after some matches.\n\nWith the most important aspects out of the way, there are some miscellaneous things I want to talk about. The menus are fantastic, very intuitive. All the modes are right in front of you (though you have to unlock some by completing the previous ones first) and you choose a mode by putting the controller into the respective icon. On top of that, the game has super quick loading times which always is a great plus in my book. I'd appreciate another way to access the leaderboards. Currently, you can see it before starting a new match. As an arcade game pretty much revolving around highscores, I would appreciate a simpler way of having a quick look at the leaderboard. Also, I tend to press the Vive home button when things get heated so I'd wish for an option to disable all button presses while playing. Nitpicking though :) The game feels very polished and I've yet to face any kind of bug.Just a short disclaimer: All of my experience is based on the build that I played on the weekend before official release. I didn\u2019t see any patch provided so I assume the final version is the exact same as I played. As polished as it is, there\u2019s no real need for a patch anyway. \n\n\nHoloball is a very fun experience and I can see myself playing this every day for some small workout. Three modes with increasing difficulties play more diverse than I thought and chasing highscores quickly got me hooked. The price of 10 bucks is great and if you can imagine yourself having at least a tiny bit of fun equipped with two rackets, smashing every ball the AI is testing you with, I can fully recommend the game to you. If you don't mind a little workout, you're in for an insanely fun game that has you jump-smashing ball for ball like a badass!", "timestamp_created": 1461608012, "timestamp_updated": 1461608012, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552081", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22633997": {"recommendationid": "22633997", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025146621", "num_games_owned": 546, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484429585}, "language": "english", "review": "Upon entering the game the first impression I got was a tron vibe. The graphics are simplistic and colorful but have a sharp design style.\n\nThe opening lobby is an empty room that contains a number of pedestals with different difficultly levels on each one. initially, the only selectable difficulties are Zen (practice mode) and easy.\n\nI started off with easy mode.\n\nThe ball is tee'd up for you to hit and the controls are simple. You swing at the ball and, depending on how hard and what angle you hit it at, it will direct your shot. You want to aim at the sweetspot (outside edges) or angle your shot to bounce off of one or multiple walls. The object, just like pong, is to outwit and outshoot your AI opponent looking to return your serve.\n\nAlso, it is good to note there is a leaderboard which I think is a staple and necessary in any arcade type game. It's just another carrot on a stick to keep users striving to do better and encourages players to continue coming back to the game. In the current iteration the leaderboard is only visible once you enter the room. My suggestion is having a way to bring up the leaderboard without having to leave the game and come back.\n\nAfter some witty quips from my computer opponent I took my shot. WHAM, ACE +100 points. First impressions are great, the accuracy relies completely on the user ability to control the motion controls and the speed in which the shot is taken.\n\nThe AI opponent is comical with its retorts and it motivates me to hit my shots correctly.\n\nThere are 5 rounds and the player has to reach 5 points in any game, before the AI, to move onto the next round.\n\nI did well and made my way through easy without too much difficulty and was very amazed at how much fun it is to play. I quickly restarted easy to get a better position on the leaderboard.\n\nAfter getting my bearings I moved onto medium difficulty.\n\nMy first impression was that the room increased in size. Ok, that's a cool idea and mechanic.\n\nQuickly, I realized my 7 ft tall ceilings were not going to suffice for any difficulty past easy.\n\nI tried my best to not crush my ceilings, but unfortunately a number of shots went above my reach and it happened regardless.\n\nI made my way through Medium with some lackluster results after restarting a couple times and having learned to let some shots just go by to save my drop-tile ceilings.\n\nI moved onto hard and the room grew bigger. After the first return, I had to leave as a lot of the shots were above my head.\n\nAfter trying out Zen difficulty I found an equal amount of fun to be had in this very different racquetball type style training simulator.\n\nI did not notice any bugs in the initial testing I've done but will continue to check out the game and see if I find any in time.\n\nSo, after an hour of testing I think this game has a ton of potential. The controls are very intuitive and the gameplay is inviting and fun. The difficulty ramps up fairly but my main complaint is that you would probably need at least 9' ceilings in the games current iteration if you are a tall individual like me at 6'3\".", "timestamp_created": 1461607739, "timestamp_updated": 1461607739, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.785788", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22633917": {"recommendationid": "22633917", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021327684", "num_games_owned": 257, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465728274}, "language": "english", "review": "A great game for the Vive, simple, fun and easy to pick up.

I don't recommend it unless heavily discounted. It wasn't completely boring, but it felt like a game with content for 2 hours stretched to 8 hours, and since I got the achievement \"Insane\", which you get for beating the game with 20 deaths or less, and only 1.7 % of the Steam community have that achievement, that actually means for most people it will take longer than 8 hours and be even more tedious than it was for me. The progression system isn't motivating at all. Enemies get more health and damage, you get more health and damage, that's it. The weapon pool is extremely small and weak.\n\nSo far I'm not liking it. The permanent upgrades you can buy after each run are extremely boring things like \"+1 attack\", \"+1 defense\". You can unlock new loadouts too, but the balance of the loadouts is so bad, some are clearly better than others by far. I also dislike how you start with a full weapon arsenal. I would like to start with one or two weak weapons and then very quickly and often keep finding new and better weapons. Currently you just stick with your loadout most of the time, very rarely find a new weapon.\n\nThe scrolls are also not good. Some have cool effects, some are completely pointless, some can completely kill your run by themselves, and they are completely random. Level design is pointless. There is no reason to arrange the level like a maze, because I have no information to make a decision which door to choose, so I have to choose a door randomly every time. It's purely random which room I find, because you of that the rooms could be linear and it wouldn't make a difference, except that I don't have to keep backtracking.\n\nRuns don't feel different at all. For each pyramid you will encounter the exact same enemies and rooms every time. Rooms started to repeat themselves after one run. Instead of seperate pyramids they should have only one pyramid that changes with progression and over time, adding new enemies and weapons and bosses. Why can't any rogue-lite do it right like Binding of Isaac? The developer abuse rogue-lite here to stretch the play time of the game with no benefit.\n\nAlso, who the hell though playing a Redneck is a good thing? Who wants to be a generic random redneck? That is the worst part of the game. Of course I knew this before I bought the game, which is why I waited for a sale (I bought it for the shooting), but I really don't understand at all why we play a redneck. It doesn't add anything to the game at all. I would rather play one of the egyptian gods you can choose as a \"spirit\".\n\nSome weapons are alright, a few are cool, some are really boring or pointless. The sniper rifle has no crosshair, but you can't zoom neither, and it does less damage than the kunai, and you dont need to reload the kunai. Just wanted to give an example of completely non-sensical weapon balance.", "timestamp_created": 1514053687, "timestamp_updated": 1514240065, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586260", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37780894": {"recommendationid": "37780894", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088652959", "num_games_owned": 1665, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 733, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 16, "last_played": 1513693869}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u975e\u5e38\u597d\u73a9\uff01\u975e\u5e38\u723d\uff01\u5899\u88c2\u63a8\u8350\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1511789555, "timestamp_updated": 1511789555, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38137657": {"recommendationid": "38137657", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271662359", "num_games_owned": 377, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1615, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 838, "last_played": 1514234053}, "language": "english", "review": "I have played for a few hours and it is quite enjoyable.

similar experience to games like Serious Sam, or Shadow Warrior, \"fast paced\" first person shooter experiences, that have a ton of enemies to take on, etc, etc...\n\nNow the problem with that preconception its that \"Immortal Redneck\" its much more a \"rogue-lite\" type of game, than a shooter in itself.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love the combat system of this games, and I enjoy most of the weapons \"feel\", but the problem is, most of this aspects serve as a conductor to the actual core gameplay mechanics that are much more related to what you've come to expect from other rogue-lite games.\n\nYou get a similar upgrade system to the one you might have seen in Rogue Legacy, another rogue-lite experience, pretty much you obtain coins, that build up to a hefty amount of cash that then you can spend in upgrades, that are often presented in quite a bland way, minor increases in your damage, health, and defence, stuff like that.\n\nReally the only interesting upgrades are ones that unlock either new skills that in this case allow you to get certain bonuses in your abilities, as well as they serve to vary your starting \"loadout\" which is usually conformed of a couple of weapons.\n\nNow I personally really dislike this system because I feel, similarlly to Rogue Legacy, it brings the game to a halt, and turns it into a chore, in which you constantly find yourself progressing through the game, but up to a point where you literally find yourself facing against a boss battle that can kill you in a single hit.\n\nThis is because as you keep progressing through the pyramids, in which the game takes place in, the enemies get bonuses in their health, as in their damage, as well as you getting bonuses in how much money you earn.\n\nIt is a problem because usually, no matter how familiarized you get with the enemy patterns, you'll eventually hit a blockade that won't allow you to continue, unless you upgrade your character.\n\nAnother one of the issues that I could say I found annoying in the game its the fact that the enemies take too many hits to kill, often times even sustaining the \"flak damage\" produced by the explosion of a rocket shot at mere centimeters away from them.\n\nAnd it is a shame that this game carries this issues because I find the rest of the game to be quite enjoyable.\n\nFor starters I thoroughly enjoy the themes of this game, the whole idea of having a first person shooter with a foul mouthed \"redneck\" who's also a mummy as a plus, its fantastic to me.\n\nPaired that up with the whole idea of playing inside egyptian pyramids, whilst fighting against enemies that are themed around egyptian culture, religion, and history, and well...\n\nAdmitedly there are other enemies that are just small blue dinosaurs that shoot green flames at you, so there's also that I guess.\n\nI also like the combat system, because despite the gunplay feeling rather tedious, and \"rough\" at times, each weapon that you get has a different feeling and function.\n\nIn my last \"playthrough\" I managed to get a rocket launcher, then an assault rifle, so pretty \"standard\" so far for the first person shooter genre, but then I got a \"double barreled\" pistol, with incredible accuracy, and a crowsbow that fired like an automatic assault rifle.\n\nThen I got plenty of upgrades, but none of them really significant, another problem that I find with the game.\n\nThe enemies at times can also be quite repetitive, I guess it's understandable being a rogue-lite, but I wish the game could've at the very least changed how they looked.\n\nOverall tho, I found it to be a rather enjoyable experience, at the very least so far, after 87 minutes of playing I didn't really found the game to be all that hard, its \"mechanical gaming understanding 101\".\n\nYou become aware of what keeps killing you, you try to understand why are you dying so frequently, and then you tackle it.\n\nFor me it was getting flanked by the enemies, so what I started doing was that I started \"hugging\" the walls of each room of enemies, while also playing close attention that nobody would sneak up behind me.\n\nWorked like a charm and end up getting to the last boss of the first pyramid...\n\nSadly the bastard killed me in one hit because of the game's terrible upgrade system, and implementation of it.\n", "timestamp_created":

Pero a diferencia de los aspectos jugables, t\u00e9cnicos o detalles meramente superficiales que posee este juego, voy a exponer una raz\u00f3n muy personal para sentir que este juego es, justo ahora, justo lo que necesitaba.\n\nRecientemente he padecido una ruptura amorosa. \u00bfY sab\u00e9is? En este juego veo un enorme parecido a lo que viene despu\u00e9s. S\u00ed, suena absurdo, pero si entend\u00e9is lo que voy a explicar, creo que lo ver\u00e9is.\n\nHas muerto. Una p\u00e9rdida. Pero no una p\u00e9rdida definitiva, has perdido algo que defin\u00eda tu vida. Y no sabes muy bien por qu\u00e9, est\u00e1s vivo de nuevo, forzado a luchar para volver a la vida.

Est\u00e1s solo contra todo, y tienes escasas posibilidades de recuperar lo que eras en un primer intento. Morir\u00e1s. Muchas veces. Pero cada vez que mueras, volver\u00e1s m\u00e1s fuerte.

Pero no conforme con eso, te quedar\u00e1s dos m\u00e1s.\n\nCada victoria que tienes es relativa. Incluso cada derrota, morir te fortalece y te hace m\u00e1s apto para avanzar m\u00e1s lejos. Hasta que llega el d\u00eda que has logrado hacerte tan fuerte y conoces tan bien tus capacidades que consigues sobreponerte a tu situaci\u00f3n y triunfar.\n\nS\u00e9 que suena raro y que no es normal captar as\u00ed un juego, pero dada mi situaci\u00f3n personal, no he podido evitar ver un parecido m\u00e1s que razonable.\n\nEs justo el juego que necesitaba ahora.

It gets rid of the stupid multi ammo system and trades level ups for purely found upgrades.\n\nWhile it feels and plays really nice, the gameplay loop is just lacking.  It doesn't have any major progressive unlock system of Rogue Legacy, or equipment selection.  You get something similar in a single-selectable-glyph, but in the early parts of the game they're minor to inconsequential.\n\nThe different \"classes\" via gods commonly feel more like punishments than fun alternative options, as many of their abilities are inconsequential to detriment, with starting weapons and stat alterations that don't offset this.\n\nThe bosses are also largely pains to fight, as it shifts rapidly away from fun gameplay to dealing with waiting through loops until you get to damage cycles and ammo shortage.\n\nI really think that the game would drastically benefit from having Tower of Gun's linear level layout, as exploring is as annoying an assinine as it is in  Ziggurat, making playing either a choice of being the same thign every time or exploring for upgrades and loot and having to deal with tons of meaningless backtracking.  There's never anything to gain by going back to any room that you were in previously.\n\nThis game isn't a hard not-recommended, but I think a lot of people are going to find that continued play will become more of a chore than a sense of play and progress, more just doing floors for the \"privelege\" of attempting a boss and that experiencing just being one of time consumption than involved

Now, I love rogue-likes. I like the way that you can sit down for a few minutes and make tangible progress pretty much no matter what you do. Immortal Redneck achieves this while possessing the other typical quality in rogue-likes: It's hard as balls. But Immortal Redneck isn't your average rogue-like. It's a colorful FPS that has a surprisingly high amount of platforming elements. \n\nAnd first-person platforming usually sucks. But Immortal Redneck's platforming is fair, with the hardest and most frustrating platforming sections being completley optional and a rarity at that. You miss absolutely nothing (outside of potential loot that lasts for only one run and can be found elswhere) by abstaining from partaking in it. That being said, prepare to use that jump button and not blindly charge into battle in each room because laser beams and fire cannons will tear you to shreds if you don't dodge them and learn their patterns.  \n\nImmortal Redneck's artstyle lends a lot of character and fun to its zany host of enemies and weapons. The game transitions from a sterotypical ancient egypt setting to a stranger, futuristic stargate setting, and the striking color pallet really helps the game come to life in both its oddity and its rediculousness. \n\nYou won't be lacking for things to unlock, be it new classes (that actually play and feel different from each other at that) stats upgrades, or new weapons and items to help assist (or hinder) you during your runs.\n\nThere are 3 pyramids with 10 floors each, with their being a boss on the 5th and 10th floor in each pyramid. It took me 25.8 hours to complete the game on its normal difficulty. Not bad bang for your buck for a $20 title imo. \n\nThe only thing that I was ever frustrated with in Immortal Redneck was its difficulty, and that's part of the charm. The only thing that ever felt close to unfair was the damage that some of the boses delt, and only the first time I had encountered them and did not yet know their patterns. After a few more tries however, the only thing holding me back was my own lack of skill. \n\nImmortal Redneck is pretty much everything I would want in an fps/roguelike, and it is by far the best I've played of that niche genre, it every single aspect. It has great art, great weapon variety, great enemy variety, great item variety, and great character variety.

The movement system is really satisfying - the character moves quickly and jumps high, so you get a great range of motion within the level. The combat is solid - each enemy has their own gimmick and their own amount of health, and none of them feel overpowered or repetitive. The weapon choice is (mostly) interesting - it varies from crowbars to rocket launchers, with two low-power but infinite ammo selections (the ankh and the energy gloves) that feel like they have a niche rather than just being either overpowered or worthless. My favorite thing about the game is the scroll mechanic, because almost every scroll has a caveat that will make you change your play style, and their conditions are really creative.\n\nThat said, I'm not so fond of how repetitive this game can get. As with every roguelike, power gain is incremental and you have to run it over and over, which is fine and a part of this style of game. For some reason, though, it feels more repetitive than, for instance, Rogue Legacy. I think a part of that might be the fact that this game has no backstory at all. We don't know who the redneck is, we don't know why he's in Egypt, we don't know why he's immortal, and we don't know why he feels the need to repeatedly enter temples and kill everyone in them. Rogue Legacy is a lot clearer on who the character is (the son of a thief blah blah bad family name) and why he's doing what he's doing (blah blah vengeance) so you can at least understand why his struggle is important enough to devote dozens of generations of his family to attack the monsters in the castle.

The controls are very smooth and responsive and it it is incredibly fun to run around and land those awesome airshots and 360's. The way the bonus system works is also interesting as you never know if a pickup will be helpful or not but if you decide to take it you must accept it. You also earn gold by defeating enemies which you can use to unlock permanent stat upgrades and other classes.

Having played a lot of classic Doom via sourcepart lately I can confidently say it's a similar sort of fast-paced, run-and-gun action that calls for a a twichy trigger-finger and fast targeting skills to survive.\n\nThe normal rougelike gameplay is also enhanced by plenty of features to increase reply value. There's multiple classes you can unlock in the form of each God or Goddess favor that grant you different special abilities and starting weapons. Medalians that can be unlocked for keeps to equip for stat buffs and an upgradable character.\n\nThis makes you feel like your progressing and actually building a stronger character to push further with each attempt instead of losing everything and starting from zero on every death. It makes the game really addictive and makes it tense you get a good run going with a huge gold counter and want to push even farther before you cash in your life.\n\nThe whole \"hero a Midwestern Redneck\" thing is really a really nice gimmick and hearing his countryisms brings back nostalgic memories of games like Redneck Rampage. Especially since I'm from Southern Iowa myself so he's a relatable hero is a amusing sort of way.\n\nDespite being a Unity title it's also really well optimized and looks fantastic.

FPS games are not my primary genre; however, I\u2019ve covered some really good ones. The same can be said for roguelite/roguelike games. I don\u2019t do well with a true permadeath scenario or even a roguelite that is too difficult to be enjoyable to a casual gamer. Immortal Redneck succeeded on both fronts for me, as it\u2019s not what I consider a typical FPS, and while it does have permadeath, any skills that have been leveled up remain with your character.\n\n[h1]Description:[/h1]\n\nImmortal Redneck is a FPS with roguelite and platforming elements from indie developer and publisher Crema. In regard to gameplay, the game is easy to learn but difficult to master. At the beginning of the game, our character comes to the realization that he is mummified and in Egypt; however, we don\u2019t understand why or what exactly is going on until we uncover these details through normal game progression. There is a definite storyline here, and for me, that just makes the game all the more interesting.\n\n\n[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]\n\nDuring gameplay, a variety of character classes, weapons and skills are unlocked and/or upgraded. The game consists of three large pyramids, each including two bosses and a variety of creatures to kill. Roguelite elements come into play upon character death, as our character respawns outside the pyramid and can spend any gold obtained during the last run on skills and upgrades, which remain through game progression. Gold is a \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d feature, as you forfeit any unspent gold upon returning to the pyramid. There is definite \"rinse and repeat,\" but thanks to solid development, procedural generation and Twitch integration, I never found it boring or unnecessarily difficult.\n\nImmortal Redneck is suitable for both casual gamers and hardcore FPS fans. It\u2019s playable in short increments if preferred, and game progress is saved. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily classify it as being for mature audiences, but I would like to disclose that it does include profanity. While that doesn\u2019t deter me in the slightest, it may be a factor when deciding which games to purchase for kids. For adults, though, I found the language and dialogue to be humorous and appropriate.\n\n[h1]Graphics:[/h1]\n\nSharp graphics are another positive feature. I didn\u2019t experience any visual glitching, clipping, or other graphical oddities during gameplay. I enjoyed the Egyptian theme and the use of color. There are some very unique creature creations in Immortal Redneck, and for that, the creative team should be recognized.\n\n[h1]Sound:[/h1]\n\nThe soundtrack took a backseat to graphics and gameplay. Whether or intentional or not, it was actually very understated and didn\u2019t really play a big part in my experience. It wasn\u2019t obtrusive, by any means, and audio cues can always be helpful in a game like this where there can be fast movement. As a whole, I can\u2019t say that it added to my experience or took anything away from it. If the intention was to allow gamers to focus on other aspects of the game, then that was certainly accomplished.\n\n[h1]Development:[/h1]\n\nImmortal Redneck plays beautifully, and that couldn\u2019t happen if it weren\u2019t built on a very strong developmental foundation. Full controller support is provided, and those controls are extremely smooth. I had no difficulty with judging distance for jumps and a very small learning curve for figuring out firing distance for various weapons. I felt no drag when needing to spin around quickly, and I didn\u2019t notice any inconsistencies in movement or combat as they relate to the controller mechanics.\n\nCombat feels very balanced, and the mechanics for the skill tree, loot system, and upgrade system all seemed appropriate to me as a gamer. I appreciated the storyline as well as the linear game progression. The game is super intuitive, and while playing, you can\u2019t go anywhere you\u2019re not meant to at that point. \n\nImmortal Redneck does include a quick tutorial as well as a variety of settings in the menu that can individualize your experience. Button/key mapping is also available. In addition to the normal game mode, you can also experience the Infinite Tower or Twitch Quest modes. Infinite Tower is a neverending tower of floors meant to challenge even the most seasoned gamers, and Twitch Quest mode utilizes Twitch integration to allow a streamer\u2019s audience to vote on scroll drops obtained during gameplay. \n\n[h1]Replayability:[/h1]\n\nImmortal Redneck also has definite replayability. The floors of the pyramids are procedurally generated, with enemies, drops, and layout varying from one run to the next. The player can choose weapons and character classes and can also customize characters through the skill tree. Twitch integration also adds to replayability by allowing viewers to vote on received scrolls, which are obtained as item drops during gameplay. Scrolls add an advantage or disadvantage to the gamer, and it\u2019s a great way to engage an audience while also increasing replayability.\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\n\nGamers who enjoy shooters and roguelite/roguelike games are very likely to enjoy Immortal Redneck. I highly recommend it to gamers who gravitate to these genres and also to those who don\u2019t, because I see elements of so many genres in the game, including platformers, metroidvanias, and even adventure games. There is plenty of content to enjoy, and I look forward to spending quite a bit more time wih Immortal Redneck. \n\n[h1]Videos:[/h1]\n\n#GamersRule Gameplay footage is available  on Twitch at: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/209944306 or YouTube at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxqa8h7K8S8", "timestamp_created": 1513403966, "timestamp_updated": 1513405268, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.701298", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38230646": {"recommendationid": "38230646", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967416686", "num_games_owned": 2036, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 305, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 18, "last_played": 1515239112}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u601d\u3063\u305f\u3088\u308a\u3057\u3063\u304b\u308a\u3057\u305f\u9020\u308a\u306e\u30ed\u30fc\u30b0\u30e9\u30a4\u30afFPS\n\u516c\u5f0f\u3067\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u306b\u3082\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b(\u9055\u548c\u611f\u306e\u7121\u3044\u516c\u5f0f\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u5bfe\u5fdc\u306f\u8cb4\u91cd)\n\u81ea\u52d5\u751f\u6210\u3055\u308c\u308b\u30e9\u30f3\u30c0\u30e0\u30c0\u30f3\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u306b\u3088\u308a\u4f55\u5ea6\u3067\u3082\u697d\u3057\u3081\u308b\u4ed5\u7d44\u307f\u3067\n\u6575\u3084\u5b9d\u7bb1\u304b\u3089\u62fe\u3063\u305f\u30a2\u30a4\u30c6\u30e0\u3084\u5dfb\u7269\u306b\u3088\u308b\u52b9\u679c\u306a\u3069\u3067\u88c5\u5099\u3092\u5f37\u5316\u3057\u3066\u9032\u3093\u3067\u3044\u304f\n\u304a\u91d1\u3092\u4f7f\u3044\u30b9\u30ad\u30eb\u3092\u5f37\u5316\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3067\u81ea\u8eab\u306e\u5f37\u5316\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u305f\u3081\nRPG\u7684\u306a\u8981\u7d20\u3082\u3042\u308b\n\u30ed\u30fc\u30b0\u30e9\u30a4\u30af\u304c\u597d\u304d\u306a\u4eba\u3082FPS\u304c\u597d\u304d\u306a\u4eba\u3082\u8cb7\u3063\u3066\u640d\u306f\u3057\u306a\u3044\u3060\u308d\u3046\n\u552f\u4e00\u6b8b\u5ff5\u306a\u306e\u306f\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306b\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3057\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044\u3053\u3068\u3060", "timestamp_created": 1512982026, "timestamp_updated": 1512982026, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.754417", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38165708": {"recommendationid": "38165708", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997758075", "num_games_owned": 439, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 504, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506169020}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is simply awesome.

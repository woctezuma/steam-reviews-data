I first played Ys 6 on the PS2.  That was a great Ys game, probably my second favourite (Oath in Felghana is mah fav), but just recently I realized they were on Steam and started beating them.  I recommend playing them in the order that they were created rather than in the order of the Ys timeline as everything will tie together better.  On that note, you aren't missing much if you don't play Ys 4 and 5 (I played both the NES and the PS2 versions of both).  If you do try them though, Ys 5 is more important as it explains a character in Ys 6.  Both Ys 1 and Ys 2 have the same mechanics and both have great storylines so this review treats them both the same.  Finally, if you're just in it for the storyline, no need to ramp up the difficulty, but if you're in it for the true Ys experience and all the achievements, start on the hardest difficulty... trust me :P  Onto the review.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE:\nAs this is an old game, it was designed to be run at 30 fps.  I somehow got all the way to the final boss at 120 fps on nightmare difficulty but after realizing the final boss was launching way more attacks at me than the youtube videos showed, some research revealed you need to lock the FPS at 30.  Right-click on the game in your library -> Launch Configuration Tool -> Enable V-Sync and Refresh Rate 30 Hz.\n\nReview (spoiler free):\nYou can definitely tell these are old games.  Ys 1 was originally released in 1989 with the remakes coming after.  While the remake improved the visuals and was translated to English, the combat system is the original so try not to hold it against the game.  \n\nGameplay Mechanics:\nCombat:\nYou need to walk into enemies to attack them... just with a slight twist (the game explains how it works).  While I'm not a fan of this and prefer the various attacks of the later titles, again... it's an old game so play it for the storyline.  Note: Ys 2 works the same as Ys 1, but also gives you different magics (combat and convenience).\n\nParty:\nUntil you get to Ys 7, you go solo (no party).\n\nEquipment/Inventory:\nNo crafting in this game.  You buy/find all of your items and gear.  On that note, Adol is not a thief... breaking into peoples' houses and rummaging through their drawers will not result in you acquiring pantsu (I tried).\n\nStory:\nLike all the classics, you are the hero.  Go save that princess.  Slay the boss man.  Ride/sail off into the sunset.  Great story and characters though.  Definitely required to understand the rest of the Ys series.\n\nFinal Score:\nThis game on its own (if you never played the other Ys games): 6/10.  I love the story, but gameplay is my #1.\nAs the start of the Ys series: 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1520313379, "timestamp_updated": 1520313901, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40499165": {"recommendationid": "40499165", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097585483", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1520551162}, "language": "english", "review": " JRPG Bumper Cars.\n\nThis game is about some random character with barely an interesting back story who ends up on some island and for some reason decides to find the book of Ys because a fortune teller told him to. You should already be able to tell that the story itself probably isn't good. \n\nGenerally games like this are fun to play. This one however; I'm afraid is the WORST jrpg game I've ever played. For starters, the combat consists of running into enemies by being a bit offset to their axis. meaning you must hit them by not running dierctly into them, but as if you're gonig to ram your shoulder into the enemies shoulder. Which would be fine if that was a normal, easy to do thing on a 2D game. It's not. You'll often find yourself accidently running straight on into someone, and then being bounced back. This barely damages the enemy plus you take damage. Absolutely ridiciulous. Moreover;  if you're just cruising around down and walk into someone, guess what, time to listen to what they have to say because that initiates conversation. Traditinoally you'd press a button to speak to someone, but not here. Bummer. Ok well that brings on the boss fights. Again - NOT FUN. Among the first 3 bosses, 2 of them go into \"invulnerable\" state where you cannot hurt them, instead you wait and/or run around like a chicken until you get the opportunity to - yes - bump into them off axis to do damage. The second boss in the game doesn't care about you playing the game. By that I mean, he'll bump into you an stun lock you, push you into a wall, and end you. So you must carefully run around in circles so he doesn't touch you. Also, the maximum level you can be in this game is level 10. Which takes about an hour to get. Enemies respawn the moment you move 10 steps into the other diection. Also the game fails to tell you that boss #3 can only be damaged by a certain weapon. So you can go into the battle, try hard, die even harder. I frequently had to consult some sort of guide because the game is just stupid. Not to mention that, in the very start of the game, if you don't talk to EVERY villager, you can't get the short sword which is required to kill things. I remember starting the game, an exiting the village an dying only to have to restart the whole game because the game doesn't have autosave function.\n\nThe games \"dungeons\" are basically mazes. And the best part is, there's no map! So you'll frequently find yourself going in circles. You could say \"Oh I have good memory, I'll know where to go\" but no... you will not. Because the game removes all light from the mazes. That's right, you'll be walkign around in the dark with light only being around your character. So if you have some paper, please be ready to draw a map yourself. Honestly, I did not have any fun playing this game at all. I'm so upset I bought it. It looked like a 2D zelda game. I may come back to this game just to get the achivements but as of right now, I can confidently say that, this game is noy enjoyable, especially with the bumper car based combat mechanics and the lack of any map/hints in the game. I can totally see this being a good game for like the 90's where you'd buy like 1 game a year an spend 1 year trying to figure out how to beat it. But if you value your time, play something else.

Their age is rather apparent, even in this remake, but they hold up pretty well and are still fun to play.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty fun, downright surprisingly so. The combat, with its lack of attack button and need to literally run into enemies, is actually quite engaging in its simplicity, helped by the fast pace and visual effects. It also works differently in each game, with YS II actually being easier. However, if you're not used to it, it can feel rather weird and possibly off-putting at first.\n\nYs II also adds a magic system, that enables you to fight enemies at range (actually necessary to defeat the bosses), find hidden passages, teleport to safe areas and even talk to monsters, which adds quite a bit to the game.\n\nExploration is a big part of the games and various areas are relatively big (but not overly so), with quite a number of hidden items to be found. However, particularly in Ys II, the dungeons tend to be maze-like, which isn't so bad when you're familiar with them, but can be pretty irritating at first. Also, it's not always clear what you're supposed to do, even when you have a certain objective, and backtracking is necessary multiple times (although teleport items and spells can alleviate that somewhat).\n\nWhile the story is rather secondary to the gameplay, it's actually pretty well done. It's not amazing, of course, but really can keep you interested until the end. Some characters could have more presence, but most major ones are used well enough.\n\nChronicles+ is the definitive version of the games, combining both the latest Ys Chronicles with Ys Complete (a previous remake from the early 2000s) and even adding the original PC-88 soundtrack, which is quite a treat (especially if you like old video game music). You can mix-and-match between those, so you can have Chronicles' 16:9 resolution with Complete's character portraits and PC-88 music. Overall, this makes for a nice, well-rounded package.\n\nBut whatever you choose, the game looks and sounds great. The graphics aren't exactly modern, but still look very good, especially backgrounds, event CGs and character artwork. Although there's some noticeably pixelation in those, probably because they were originally drawn for lower resolutions.\n\nFalcom is well-know for the great music in their games and the Ys soundtrack (particularly the second one) is among their best. There are no bad tracks, few decent, but many great ones, that stay with you long after you finished the games. And having all of them in three different versions may already be worth the price alone (and yes, it's possible to listen to them outside the games, they're all in .ogg format).\n\nYs Chronicles+ is a really nice package of two classics games, that started a great series, that never really lost their charm. Particularly if you like action RPGs and are fond of older games, it may very well up your alley.", "timestamp_created": 1519479919, "timestamp_updated": 1519479919, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40281966": {"recommendationid": "40281966", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024996183", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 788, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507900286}, "language": "english", "review": "Bumping for justice.", "timestamp_created": 1519236245, "timestamp_updated": 1519236245, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40255691": {"recommendationid": "40255691", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002559680", "num_games_owned": 348, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 1530, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519179627}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Eu j\u00e1 era bastante f\u00e3 do original de 1987, \u00e9 legal que cada remake que fizeram desse jogo (e n\u00e3o foram poucos) sempre foram bem fieis ao original e mesmo assim o game continua interessante, mostrando que o design original conseguiu render por literalmente 30 anos apenas com modifica\u00e7\u00f5es est\u00e9ticas. \n\nEssa vers\u00e3o \u00e9 meio que isso tambem, o sistema de combate \u00e9 o original (bump system), a posi\u00e7\u00e3o das casas e npcs \u00e9 igual o original, os bosses e afins tudo bem fiel tambem.

And at any rate, it's Falcom, so the crown itself is probably made of formica in the first place.\n\nAt least the first two games are sort of like if the Legend of Zelda games grew a functioning set of testicles and had a main character who was not sexually ambiguous enough that confused degenerates and women could project themselves onto him. And yet, I'm assuming the reason Ys is somewhat less well known is because Adol Christin is a ginger, and every time one looks into his empty eyes in cutscenes, it's like looking into the yawning chasm left when God stopped talking to us some time in the 1960s.\n\nFalcom has survived as a smaller studio by putting weird gimmicks in their games that make you curious to see how they work. With Brandish, it was controlling a character who moved like a tank, and rotating the game world with him, rather than moving him through the world. They then usually undermine that gimmick in some way because it's difficult, time-consuming, and therefore expensive to develop a game around a highly unorthodox mechanic. \n\nWith Ys, it's the 'bump' combat system, which has nothing to do with cocaine, despite these games coming out in the late 80s. The games lack any button for performing physical attacks, instead requiring that you bring your sprite into contact with enemy sprites with respect to the facing of their sprite. If you approach their sprite head-on, you both take damage. But if the contact occurs at an angle, only the enemy will be damaged. This is actually what turned me off of the Ys series when I first tried it on emulator years ago, and you'll basically know if you can accept or will enjoy it within the first few minutes of trying to play. \n\nHow good you are at exploiting the bump system is essentially irrelevant in Ys 1, at least on the overworld where your hit points recover automatically while you stand still. Essentially, the only thing you need is the ability to survive a few hits from a monster, and you almost always can due to the massive ability boosts you get between levels in Ys 1. It provides quite a challenge in dungeons, until the developers got tired of having to do so much balancing and introduced the Heal Ring into the game. After you have that, you can also automatically recover hit points in dungeons, almost entirely eliminating the need to master the combat.\n\nIn Ys 2, the bump combat system is also rendered almost entirely irrelevant by fire magic, as well as an item which allows it to home in and another item which allows it to home in and split into multiple fireballs after hitting a monster. In relatively short order you'll be able to simply stand around and shoot fireballs to kill offscreen monsters. They do a great deal of damage to most monsters, and only about 3 are immune.\n\nIt may sound as though I dislike Ys 1 and 2, but that's really not the case. They feel like games released on a budget in the late 80s, because they are. And like they taught you in school, it's okay to be who you are, unless you're Lena Dunham. The main draw and the source of the Ys' games famous difficulty is the bosses, and those are mostly entertaining. Keeping in mind that I still encourage any player to put in the effort and git gud, the bosses in Ys 1 undeniably have some cheap tricks, although it's really only two.\n\nThe giant bat Vagullion does some damage that simply cannot be avoided depending on where he is on the screen, and the infamous Dark Fact fight has a strong element of randomness to it, with Dark Fact ponging around the final arena and destroying the floor wherever he's damaged. There are strategies which can increase your chances of winning, but you will need some luck.\n\nThe bosses in Ys 2 are another matter. I played both games on hard, and for the most part I found the Ys 2 bosses incredibly easy. I literally beat the boss Zava in one attempt and never used any healing items on any bosses. This is excepting the final boss Darm, who is a bit like a second attempt at a Dark Fact fight in that it's a supremely difficult battle with significantly less of an element of randomness. I did use a Roda Fruit to keep my shield up. I suppose it speaks volumes about the balancing of the fight that you receive the shield magic just before.\n\nYs 1 and Ys 2 share a plot, which is hackneyed 90s animu runoff about an ancient magic civilization, monsters, magic, and a dark lord. Although admittedly that's probably why I like it. A lot of girls seem attracted to a soulless ginger for some reason, but there are sexy nurses in both games to whom I was completely unable to administer a thermometer. Instead Adol is swooned over by a loli archetype and a princess archetype. This is why the Japanese can't have enough babies.\n\nI did have a problem with the localization. The script has some 'hilarious' references to Harry Potter and The Room. I understand very well that there are things that don't translate into English, but that doesn't excuse references of this sort. I would rather see something essentially as intended and not understand it than see something completely different and completely out of place. Not everything is for everyone, and these games weren't made with Westerners in mind.\n\nThe games look excellent, and also allow for switching between three different music tracks. It occurred to me while playing these games that a lot of old FM synth music was made to sound like guitars and orchestras, and yet when I hear it orchestrated I always prefer the synthesized music. Possibly with the exception of Dragon Quest, because Sugiyama is a real composer. \n\nAt any rate, if you can stand 90s anime garbage, the unusual combat system, and don't rage when faced with a challenge, you'll probably enjoy the first two Ys games. I played them simply because I'm exploring the series, but I did genuinely like them. Now moving on to Wanderers from Ys and its remake The Oath in Felghana. So if you have some time, offer up some prayers for me to little baby Jesus.", "timestamp_created": 1515355686, "timestamp_updated": 1515355686, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1,

I didn't expect Hydlide but good. The combat is just running into enemies, but if you go at an angle you don't take damage. Plus you have knockback, which means one v one you can messup even the toughest of foes if you use the wall. \n\nThe game isn't long and because of that the story is basially set up for 2, which I haven't played yet. I beat the game in 12 hours but that was an hour on a boss, an hour on the final boss, and 2 hours backtracking because of confusing mazes right at the end. \n\nA tip for anyone struggling on the final boss. Go into tool conf. and turn of Vsynch. A 144fps causes the bosses attacks to be faster.\n\nI'd give it a good 9/10. It got me to buy some of the other games in the francise.\n\nEdit: So after beating Ys 2 I'd maybe give it an 8.5/10 now. The overall experance is great but, Ys 2 used maze like design as a crutch. While that doesn't make it bad there were many more moments in the game where I was just lost and needed to look up what to do. After the second or third time (already more than Ys 1) I had to backtrack for an hour because I got lost I didn't feel like wasting my time. The ending was really good though. The final boss felt like what the final boss of Ys 1 should have been and the sad romance traingle hinted at was good enough for me.", "timestamp_created": 1515024915, "timestamp_updated": 1515949216,

get all achievements in one go or you dont care about achievements and just roll on easy.\n\nIf you play on easy you will find the bump system fun and the gameplay fast paced yet very very simply with some awesome bosses. \n\nIf you play the game on the highest level you will fin how frustating and how much bull doooo  3 bosses in particular are, like you dont even know how much patience and luck you need to beat those.\n\nAs well as the grind for enemies stats ( you have to kill 25 of each ) which is fine at the beginning but once you enter the final dungeon every floor is a new enemy so it grinds the game to a massive halt.\n\nOther than that the max level is 10 which by the way is not very good for those playing on nightmare. Even max level AND THE best equipment you will get your rear beat !!!\n\nOther than those 2 diferences the game is OK the bump system while fast paced has no depht ( at least the game is short ) there are however some absurd puzzles to solve which requiere guides in my opinion.\n\nThe is no story at all and the little there is it's so tiny it doesn't matter.\n\nThis is an old game so it's to be expected.\n\nThe graphics are good but the standout has to be the music with some great tunes !!\n\nOverall the game was fun but I felt it was kinda grindy at the last dungeon and 3 bosses were absolute disposable items.\n\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1514252914, "timestamp_updated": 1514252914, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38677226": {"recommendationid": "38677226", "author": {"steamid": "76561198211544203", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 723, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514432375}, "language": "english", "review": "Quick, bare, and straight to the point.

Can be completely quickly and the only real difficulty is the final boss due to instant kill mechanic. Great music, nice sprite work, runs fine (you do need to limit framerate to 60fps though unless you hate yourself).\n\nYs 2: Builds upon the mechanics of Ys 1 by adding ranged magic option and as a result, more bosses tend to feel like STG/shmup segments (thus limiting framerate is even more important in Ys 2 than it is in the first).\n\nThe linearity helps flush out the world building and gets the plot across well (considering how little of it, there is not much of sidequesting, but I suppose its cause Ys 1 and 2 is an 80s game). Music is quite good between the two and is very memorable. Both are relatively quick to complete game (Ys 2 having more length). I would absolutely say play these before Ys Origin.", "timestamp_created": 1512448805, "timestamp_updated": 1512448805, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38008129": {"recommendationid": "38008129", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973644224", "num_games_owned": 289, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 640, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512225156}, "language": "english", "review": "[i][Review updated on 02/10/18 after completing Ys II][/i]\n\nFor a change of pace, I wanted to play a Japanese role-playing game (JRPG) series, and I stumbled across Nihon Falcom's [i]Ys[/i]. But playing the series from the beginning would require booting up a game that was originally released 30 years ago in 1987. The story begins with our hero washing up on a foreign shore and questing and fighting his way through the land of Esteria. \n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nBoth Ys I and II employ an arcade-style \"bump attack\" system where our hero runs into enemies to damage them. The game is played using keyboard commands and arrow keys. The first few battles create the impression that the game is going to be a breeze, but once you enter the underground dungeon areas - where health points no longer replenish when standing still - the difficulty level goes up a notch. And once you confront the first boss - and each subsequent boss - you start to wonder if you made a mistake trying to play this game. The boss fights are quite challenging and, with one exception, I found myself looking at online walkthroughs for tips on how to defeat each one. Ultimately, defeating the bosses and the game are a rewarding experience. Completing some of the quests is equally challenging and also required occasionally dipping into online walkthroughs to make sure I was on the right track.\n\n[b]Characters/Customization[/b]\nOutside their role in the story, the characters in the game are not particularly memorable. Our hero does obtain equipment upgrades along the way, but that and leveling (both of which increase damage output, defense, and health points) are about the extent of character growth in the game.\n\n[b]Story/Atmosphere[/b]\nThe story, set in the land of Esteria, starts when our hero Adol Christin washes up on the shore after a storm. He then embarks on an adventure to discover the mystery behind the lost kingdom of Ys and to defeat the dark forces that have started to spread in Esteria. By modern standards, the story is stereotypical for the fantasy genre as are the various types of zones (e.g. hostile wilderness, quaint towns, dark caverns, evil towers). Combined with late 80's graphics, this should have had disaster written all over it, but the game has an undeniable charm that drives a sense of nostalgia and longing for those simpler (PC gaming) days. It is that charm that makes it possible to enjoy the game from beginning to end.\n\n[b]Graphics/Sound[/b]\nKnowing that the graphics are from the late 80's helps temper expectations. Perhaps more important are colors and lighting effects that give the game a distinct feel. The music has been cited by others as a major plus in the game, and while I agree that the heavy metal instrumentals are pretty awesome and high quality, they do seem a little out of place in the fantasy setting, but I suppose they are a reasonable given the arcade-style gameplay. My favorite musical track is actually the harmonica number played by the traveling minstrel during the opening cinematic.\n\nFor the most part the Steam version of the game works without issues. Some of the bosses, however, were bordering on impossible with my initial settings. Two tips that helped me overcome the final boss included (a) unticking the \"Full Screen\" option in the [b]Launch Configuration Tool[/b] and (b) limiting the \"Refresh Rate\" to 60 Hz. I was still able to finish with 1920 x 1080 resolution (and effectively a full screen display).\n\n[b]Replay Value:[/b] None. The first game took me roughly 10 hours to complete. The second game took me longer (15 hours), possibly due to reloads against some of the tougher bosses.\n\n[b]Note on [i]Ys II[/i][/b]\nThe second part, [i]Ys II[/i], is basically \"more of the same\". As far as I can tell, both games were developed at the same time and, at some point, split into two acts, two games.\n\n[b]Overall Score:[/b] 6/10\n\n[i]Played in 2017-2018.[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1512231713, "timestamp_updated": 1518275752, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37949655": {"recommendationid": "37949655", "author": {"steamid": "76561198207209141", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 588, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512589358}, "language": "norwegian", "review": "Heard so much about this series so I figured I should try it out.(HappyConsoleGamer)\nLove this game,great music,great gameplay,good story and I enjoy the grinding:)\nRpg\u00b4s are so complex this days,so it\u00b4s nice to sit down with a simple but very good rpg like this.\nRetro heaven:)\n(I use a xbox 360 controller)", "timestamp_created": 1512038455, "timestamp_updated": 1512038777, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37947550": {"recommendationid": "37947550", "author": {"steamid": "76561198746302688", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 159, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517929447}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4f0a\u82cf\u8650\u6211\u5343\u767e\u904d\uff0c\u6211\u5f85\u4f0a\u82cf\u5982\u521d\u604b\uff01\n  \u624b\u6b8b\u515a\u4e3a\u4e86\u5168\u5b9d\u7bb1\u5168\u9053\u5177SL\u3001\u5237\u5237\u5237\u4e0d\u8981\u592a\u52b1\u5fd7\u3002\n  \u611f\u89c9\u6bcf\u4f5c\u7684\u5957\u8def\u90fd\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u8ff7\u5bab\u554a\uff0c\u9053\u5177\u554a\uff0c\u88c5\u5907\u554a\uff0c\u4e07\u53d8\u4e0d\u79bb\u5176\u5b97\u3002\n  1\u96be\u5ea6\u8fd8\u597d\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u8fde\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u62db\u5f0f\u90fd\u6ca1\u6709\uff0c\u53ea\u8981\u7528\u8eab\u4f53\u649e\u8fc7\u53bb\u3002\u7b80\u5355\u7c97\u66b4\uff0c\u7b26\u5408\u6211\u7684\u884c\u4e8b\u4f5c\u98ce\u3002\n  2\u52a0\u5165\u4e86\u9b54\u6cd5\uff0c\u6211\u7231\u4e0a\u4e86\u6458\u82f9\u679c\u548c\u7ed9NPC\u9001\u793c\u7269\u5237\u597d\u611f~\n  \u5176\u5b9e\u6211\u8fd8\u86ee\u559c\u6b22\u8c46\u5b50\uff0c\u6b63\u4e49\u611f\u6ee1\u6ee1\u52c7\u5f80\u76f4\u524d\u3002\n  \u4e24\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u7684\u753b\u98ce\u6211\u90fd\u8d85\u559c\u6b22\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u4e2d\u6587\u4e5f\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u6e38\u73a9\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd8\u662f\u6697\u6413\u6413\u5730\u671f\u5f85\u6c49\u5316\u8865\u4e01\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1512029228, "timestamp_updated": 1517320064, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581749", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37844936": {"recommendationid": "37844936", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055879105", "num_games_owned": 1071, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 296, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511836890}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uba85\uc791 \uadf8\ub300\ub85c\uc758 \uc7ac\ubbf8\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4 \ud55c\uae00\uc801\uc6a9\uc774 \ub418\uc9c0\uc54a\uc544 \uc544\uc26c\uc6c0", "timestamp_created": 1511836917, "timestamp_updated": 1511836917, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37822200": {"recommendationid": "37822200", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034193277", "num_games_owned": 437, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 595, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511772762}, "language": "english", "review": "Ys I - awesome game, though i finished it pretty quickly ~9,5 hours on normal difficulty.

While Ys 1 & 2 do have a lot of those things (namely the soundtrack and boss battles being awesome) there are a few key differences that can make or break the experience for you.\n\nFirst off, the localization is a lot of fun in Chronicles. The standout for me is Ys 2 in this collection especially. There is a gift giving system that, despite there being few real rewards from it, is a treat if you appreciate witty dialogue. Rather this means apologizing to someone becaused you \"Lit their ass on fire\" by giving them a few more gifts than normal, or wooing a woman right in front of her husband, there is a lot of fun to be had with that.\n\nAs far as the soundtrack goes, Chronicles+ gives you a lot of customization. You can choose from 3 different versions of the soundtrack from the Turbo Grafx, the PSP Complete collection, or the more modern Chronicles mix. Personally I prefer either the Complete or Chronicles soundtracks, but thanks to being able to switch the soundtrack on the fly you can listen to each BGM all 3 ways and see which one you prefer. \n\nThe largest barrier to being able to enjoy the Chronicles+ collection is the combat system. Unlike later Ys which use a much more traditional Zelda style battle system, Ys 1 & 2 use the Bump System. Essentially, you just ram your character into enemies to hurt them. The key is to bump into them slightly off center to avoid being damaged yourself, but the hit detection isn't always what you would think it should be. \nPersonally, the system didn't detract from my experience. However, these were my first Ys games. If you are a a fan of the newer Ys games hoping to play the original games that started it all, you might not be able to look past the strange battle system. \n\nThe bosses in the Ys series continue to impress me as I make my way further down the rabbit hole, and 1 & 2 have some great ones. Ys 1 has a clear disadvatage here, with some bosses that can be outright frustrating for all the wrong reasons. There are two bosses that I can recall that felt cheap and relied far too much on luck than skill. One of these was the final boss, which doesn't make for a very convincing showdown (I should mention that I only played through Ys 1 and 2 on the Nightmare difficulty setting, so these problems may go away on lower difficulties). Even with some stumbles, for the most part BOTH games have incredibly well designed bosses, both graphically and mechanically.\n\nWhen you get right down to it, I do recommend Chronicles+. It's not perfect, but it's a memorable experience with some truly astounding sound direction and epic boss battles. If you are a newcomer to the series, I recommend starting here. If you start with something like Ys: Oath in Felghanna, you might not be able to enjoy these as much thanks to the difference in gameplay. Veterans of the series should only come back if they think they can handle gameplay that feels like a decided step down. Even so, there are a lot of great moments to be had here as long as you don't expect the best in the series.", "timestamp_created": 1511312926, "timestamp_updated": 1511312926, "voted_up": true,

(Except that I think it's 16 or 32 bits unlike the TG CD that was 8 bits but it had good graphics back in 1989...) (Forgot to say... this is basically Ys Complete with more stuff, I think.)\n\nSound: \u221e/10\nSincerely the music made me have more faith in Falcom and its music, and yeah, I'm even still hearing them and I won't stop because they are pleasant to the ears with fully instrumental soundtrack, you would even be hearing it for hours, and the music fits on every part of the game.\n\nStory: 8/10\n\n700 years ago, there was an utopia named Ys, a land that was a prosperous an peaceful country wich suddenly dissapeared from the planet and the mystery was left unsolvable, until a boy showed up.\nYou're Adol Christin, a 17 years red-haired boy who travelled in boat to Esteria, only to find out that the land was plagued by demons, your mission is to find the first 5 books of Ys and go to Darm Tower to defeat Dark Fact who has the 6th and last book, after defeating Fact, Adol is sent to the ACTUAL land of Ys and he's helped by Lilia, who found him lying somewhere in the Ruins of Moondoria. This is very story rich at all, with the sequels of these games uncovering more secrets.\n\nGameplay: 10/10\n\nI heard that some people hates the bump system, but honestly for me is the most comfortable way of attacking, since you don't have to be pressing buttons madly. I also heard that this game is one of those games of \"What should I do now?\" you won't be completing it without a FAQ or either spending countless hours trying to figure out what to do, but it's fun trying to figure out what to do. (Atleast for me.)\n\nReplayability: 8/10\n\nEasy mode wasn't enough!? Try Nightmare mode! Didn't got all the achievements? Try again! Are you addicted to this game?

If I go through Ys II I'll amend it as needed.\n\nThis game isn't necessarily a bad game. I feel like it has a lot of merits to it for a short (6-7 hours) RPG, but it just doesn't come together very well. \n\n[b]Things I liked:[/b]\n*The combat is quirky and I can see people not liking it, but I felt it was refreshingly fast and unique when compared to your average turn-based slog.  I would have liked a bit more variance though, such as combat related items, magic, or similar secondary attacks.\n\n*The game is cleanly made. While the cutscenes are dated, the graphics overall are quite nice, if simple. \n\n*The items collecting. While it's not everyone's cup of tea, I'm a huge sucker for games with lots of items to collect. I'm reminded of things such as La Mulana and The Legend of Zelda: LTTP. \n\n*The soundtrack is honestly kickass. Not much needs to be said about it beyond that.\n\nWhile these things are nice, there are a lot of problems I have with the game that these just can't redeem.\n\n[b]Things I disliked:[/b]\n*The story is not exactly thrilling. It's incredibly basic and generic, and while there's a few interesting bits here and there, they're too sparsely scattered across what is ultimately a painfully boring plot of a generic hero collecting every ancient artifact the world over in a single evening and wooing the girl(s). Oh, and saving the world from a generic fantasy apocalypse. Woo.\n\n*The art, while high quality, is just dull. I'm instantly reminded of decades of unmodified RPGmaker graphics, and as a result, immersing myself in the world is difficult. Between this and the plot, the game comes off as so standard that I'm not sure what to really get excited for.\n\n*The experience mechanics. The levels cap out at 10 halfway through the game, and are practically hard-caps on your progression. The standard enemies either kill you in a few hits, or go down pathetically easy. I feel like the game would be better without the levels entirely, instead substituting in something like slightly more granular equipment.\n\n*The bosses. While they're a good challenge and I don't think they're unfairly difficult, they are boring. I'm pretty sure every boss (except the final boss) has a single attack. Some bosses lack actual attacks entirely, and just rely on bumping into you to deal damage. I feel like a little more variance would've gone a huge way in making the bosses feel more exciting and enjoyable.\n\nOverall, while it's certainly not bad, I can't recommend it. If you don't mind generic games or it goes on sale for cheap, it might be worth it. Otherwise, there's definitely better out there for cheaper.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1509767487, "timestamp_updated": 1509767487, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.428836", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36232329": {"recommendationid": "36232329", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100020801", "num_games_owned": 706, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 820, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1441966070}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc2a4\ud300\uc744 \uc2dc\uc791\ud558\uac8c \ub41c \uc774\uc720 \uc911 \ud558\ub098.", "timestamp_created": 1509678850, "timestamp_updated": 1510034960, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.725914", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36160827": {"recommendationid": "36160827", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038831437", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 514, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509083452}, "language": "english", "review": "Bumper game!\n\nYep Classic JRPG back from the 70s.\n\nThis game is so good they made about 10+ remakes of it in the past 40 years.

The music (I listened to the 'Complete 2001' soundtrack, because synthesizers) is absolutely spot on. And the bump attack mechanic made the whole f'ing game really fast. The story, is okay- but no one cares to be honest, it's all about the action.\n\nKnow some people complain about the bump attack, but if you want to know what happens when you remove it with more 'zelda-like' gameplay, I highly suggest you go enjoy the butter knife action that is Lagoon (SNES). \n\nIf I had to pick which game I enjoyed more (I or II), I'd have to say Ys I was better.

Until very recently I have never played nor seen anyone play any of the Ys games. Around Sept/20 2017 I started with Ys I, then Ys II, followed by Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim, Ys: The Oath in Felghana, Ys Orgin then I just beat Ys Seven.  Finally Ys VIII Lacrimosa of Dana is all that is left. With a early 2018 expected release date for PC. Below is how I rank the games I have played and beat so far from best to worst. I will edit this review as I play and beat more Ys games. \n\n<Best>\nYs Seven\nYs: The Oath in Felghana\nYs: Origin\nYs II \nYs VI: The Ark of Napishtim \nYs I\n<Worst>\n\nStill Left to Play...\nYs VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana\n\nWhat I thought of \"Ys I\"\nThis game does feel outdated. I sort of like the original idea behind the bump style of combat it's not without it's issues. Still I feel like every YS fan should play this game followed by Ys II and I am very happy I started with the original. I learned some very important elements that have stuck with all of the YS titles to come so far. You will also pickup on some story and charachters that will be present going forward in other Ys titles. The combat is straight forward. As many older games this game is challening in different way then more modern Ys titles. For example without a guide it's difficult to sometimes know what to do next! But I suggest trying without a guide as much as possible because it feels good to find the solution to the puzzle yourself. This game feels like an advanture game were your consistantly trying every item you find on every object you can to see what works. The bosses can be tricky. This game is one of the shortest Ys games in general that I have played. There is moments were you need to grind a fair bit. The only main issues I have with the game is that I got lost quite a bit. And some bosses and even the final dungeon areas are very hard at times. But you can save anywhere! The game does feel old but at the same time you will get an original experience out of it. I highly suggest you play this game before Ys II and I think Ys II is one of the best Ys games I have played. Which makes this game important to play. \n\nWhat I thought of \"Ys II\"\nThis game is very simular to Ys I, and does feel a tad bit outdated. It also uses the bump combat system which seems original and uncommon. I suggest every Ys fan to play Ys II but please play Ys I first! It feels very simular to Ys I but improved in every way. The combat is not as straight forward. You get to use magic now. As many older games this game is challening in different ways then more modern Ys titles. For example without a guide it's difficult to sometimes know what to do next just like in Ys I. But I suggest trying without a guide as much as possible. Because it feels good to find the solution to the puzzle yourself. This game feels like an advanture game were your consistantly trying every item you find on every object you can to see what works. The bosses are a tiny bit easier then Ys I in my opinion except for certain moments. This game is longer then Ys I but still not to long of a game. There is moments were you need to grind a lot about the same as Ys I. The game is bigger and has a lot more effort and amazing levels of detail put into exploration. In this way it greatly exceeds YS I. The overall challenge level is simular to Ys I but maybe has more balance. You can still save everywhere. The game does feel old but at the same time you will get an original experience out of it just like Ys I.

Sounds dumb doesn\u2019t it. Why don\u2019t you try watching some gameplay footage of it? Still looks pretty stupid huh? You\u2019re probably thinking how can such a combat system be fun? Well, it is. Ys I and II\u2019s combat system is simple yet fun. It\u2019s one of those things which sounds dumb on paper but is really good in practice. All you need to think of in combat (outside of boss battles) is walk into enemies but don\u2019t collide with them in the centre. For anybody who studies game design, often you would want to aim for the lowest amount of complexity but a high amount of depth, which is what Ys I and II has done with their combat system. It lacks complexity but has a large amount of depth, in other words it is easy to learn yet hard to master, which is great. Such a combat system may sound really boring and easy, but adding in the speed at which Adol, the main character, moves, this creates a very fast pace combat system that is thrilling no matter how many times I experience it.\nP.s. If u think the enemy movements in Ys I is too easy, Ys II improves on them by allowing the enemies to move diagonally make the combat tougher\n\n-Boss Battles\nAll boss battles are unique, no two are the same. Some of these boss fights are really tough and that\u2019s just how I like it. Of course, you could just grind to the point where your level is so high that the boss isn\u2019t even a threat, but where\u2019s the fun in that? I often find myself trying and failing time and time again to beat the same boss. However, each time I get more familiar with the boss\u2019s attack patterns and then eventually I win and that sense of satisfaction I get is just exhilarating.\nP.s. I do see some people complaining about how unfair the Vagullion (the bat) boss fight was but I didn\u2019t have too much trouble dealing him so I guess to each his own.\n\n-Story\nIt\u2019s a typical boy saves the world anime fantasy story with a small amount of romance sprinkled in. It\u2019s simple, nothing really special about it. However, simple is often best when it comes to stories in video games. Video games aren\u2019t a very good storytelling medium. The story often just serves as a motivation for the player to push on or give the player some context and meaning as to what they are doing in the game. Thus, a simple story in a video game not only serves it\u2019s purpose, it also makes it easy for the player to follow along and not get lost in a convoluted mess which is Final Fantasy.\n\nTHE BAD\n-Backtracking\nThis problem isn\u2019t really apparent in Ys I as Ys I\u2019s world is pretty small, and the story is considerably shorter than Ys II. However, in Ys II, there are a lot of times in the game where the main story requires you to backtrack. Of course, to makes things easier, you are given Warp Magic pretty early in the game which allows you to warp to any town you have visited. But the problem is that the map of Ys II is non-linear. A lot of areas are maze-like and it\u2019s easy to get lost or struggle to find a door you stumbled upon previously but couldn\u2019t unlock because you didn\u2019t have the key yet.

It's a tight, short game with simple mechanics. You just 'bump' into enemeis to attack, but never straight on, so there is finesse to it. Running across the fields, mowing enemies and running into them as they all blow up into bits of bones flesh and gore is so satisfying. Bosses are a really good challenge, and torwards the end they all become consistently high quality and are rewarding to defeat. The music is fantastic as well.\n\nYs II is almost good. It brings the same gameplay to the table, adding in magic and mapping items to a key to heal on the fly. The magic is good- light to brighten up surroundings and reveal hidden enemies, fire as a standard chargeable projectile, and my favorite- turning into a creature to converse with enemies, with each you encounter having specific and unique dialogues. They talk a lot about shifts and something of urban legends about the protagonist, or just funny things. It's great. \n\nHowever, Ys II falters in a few ways. The game is just SO labrynthine. This wasn't a problem in I- there was one cave area which was annoying but it doesn't really even touch how bad it gets in II. Places are just so large and complex, which would be okay, but often times paths look very similiar and there aren't enough landmarks or distinctive areas to really know where the hell you are a lot of the time. And lots of dead ends too. Being an ARPG this isn't as bad as it could be, but enemies will still respawn and there's just no map function. Worse yet, combined with this you can miss important items and will have to backtrack again on top of already required backtracking. It's annoying, especially when you've finally reached a boss but it turns out there's a sword that will let you do more than mere chip damage to them. I couldn't finish the game, I reached about 3/4ths through it when I decided I had enough. It's a shame because there's a lot of good qualities but the map design makes it a tedious game.\n\nThe end result is that I is fantastic and II is worth a shot but not as good. Regardless, they both have good qualities. Not enough can be said of the good music, and the core gameplay is still good in both- just bogged down in II by other things.", "timestamp_created": 1500022769, "timestamp_updated": 1500022769, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33508721": {"recommendationid": "33508721", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016719968", "num_games_owned": 1214, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 475, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499964284}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ubab8\ud1b5\ubc15\uce58\uae30", "timestamp_created": 1499969476, "timestamp_updated": 1499969476, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33501224": {"recommendationid": "33501224", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080166024", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 51, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499722526}, "language": "italian", "review": "Influenzato dalle ottime recensioni l'ho comprato ad occhi chiusi.

This is a fun RPG set that's fast paced, fun, and has outstanding music!  At the time of this review i've finished Ys I, and am currently working on Ys 2, but i've seen enough to work this review.   The games are well developed and actually well balanced in several aspects. Game makes you feel powerful and gives you lots of levels for grinding, but does a good job keeping you down until you get your next set of equipment. The challenges of this game are actually very reminiscent of Zelda 1 in the aspect of exploration and  discovery. The game will give you clues, but will not hold your hand. If you don't pay attention, you can get lost on what to do. Details are in the text, and the rest is up to you to discover how to bridge the next piece of the story. This is a good reminder of a time before the internet and walkthroughs, and how you needed to be in charge of the game and make your way through on your own.  I won't spoil any story points, but I can say that it can be REALLY challenging at times.\n\nMusic is outstanding, as I mentioned with a lot of great multi-instrumental sounds based on where you are, and it never gets old. These are the kind of tunes for your gaming music playlist.   \n\nSound is pretty typical, no voice acting, and without music, it's just a bunch of floor tapping and sword swiping, so nothing too great there. \n\nControls are okay.  The combat is a bumper system, which is another old school RPG method. Kind of interesting to play it in a modern time, but it's simple. In Ys II you get magic, and casting is just A, so that's about the only innovative thing. To talk to people, you just bump into them as well.\n\nOverall, Ys Chronicles is a great game. It's not perfect, and can be frustrating at times too, but a great game because it's classic, and not catering to the player. It welcomes the player to think and figure out the story. They give you the string, and you follow it.  This is a perfect game for those who loved Zelda 1, and other old school style RPG's!   \n\nEDIT : I want to add, that the ability to change from modern to classic graphics was a nice touch too. Art work differences is something interesting to look at. \n\n7.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1499290185, "timestamp_updated": 1499290543, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540636", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33283141": {"recommendationid": "33283141", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969683432", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 587, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500229974}, "language": "english", "review": "The nightmare mode is just too difficult...

The games are known for their heavy, intense guitar scores and serene orchestral music, as well, and these two games are the ones that began the trend for everything above.\n\nThe Ys games are notoriously polarizing - either you REALLY enjoy the gameplay, the almost bullet-hell difficulty in bosses, or you absolutely hate it and toss it in the garbage. I luckily fell into the first camp.\n\nYs 1 and 2 utilize the \"Bump Combat System\" which is a buttonless fighting style that relies on you running into enemies that are not facing you, or at odd degrees or angles (basically anything other than head-on) in order to do damage. There are ZERO i-frames in both games, for both enemies and you, so combat is swift and incredibly lethal. The only slowdown is if you have to stop to regenerate, and consumables in the second game make it so you don't even need to do that. The second game also greatly increases the power of a diagonal angle attack, making striking without taking recoil damage almost trivial after playing the first game. Ys2 also adds magic to break up the rushing bump combat formula, but for the most part you're going to be running around like a madman auto-swinigng your sword, and it is incredibly fun.\n\nThe dungeons in both games are large and pretty winding, and you do a lot of running around back and forth to collect items, but your runspeed is so high and there'sa number of fast travel options, so it never seems *too* bad. There are a few points that definitely come off like blatant padding though, especially in the second half of both games.\n\nAs a JRPG, there is some degree of grinding. If you're in the game for achievements then you won't notice any extra grinding aty all - as you'll already be killing way more monsters than necessary in order to fill up your bestiary entries. If thats not your thing, be aware that in both games there are a few hard walls that will require a bit of grinding, especially the last boss in the first half of Ys 1. Ys 1 assumes you are max level halfway through the game. Luckily levelling is quick and the grinding will be pretty minimal. Ys 2 makes things much easier, and towards the end of the game there is one particular enemy you can grind about 10-12 levels off of in 15-20 minutes. Luckily combat is realtime and so swift your grinding always has you doing something rather than \"press A for turn based combat\".\n\nThe music switches between soft town themes and serene temple themes, to pulse pounding electric guitar riffs in dungeons and combat zones. It's great music if that style is your thing, and is it ever my thing. Can't say enough great things about the music.\n\nThe story is interesting and intriguing, but won't knock your socks off like, say, a Witcher game, with crazy political intrigue. It's a JRPG about being a redhead anime warrior getting into adventures, and that's exactly what you get. The world setting is explained and the locations you go to across games are varied. The supporting cast exists but doesn't get a ton of screentime just by virtue of the game's style. The games are about Adol and that's made clear. There are some parts where it's not immediately clear where you need to be going - this is worse in the second game, but made a bit easier by the game giving you an item at that point that lets you 'phone a friend' for some NPC assistance on where to go next.\n\nStrongly recommended if you can handle the game's inherent difficulty - boss battles verge on frustrating to downright unfair feeling, especially in the first game. The second game's bosses are much, MUCH more manageable - the last boss of 1 in particular can just feel like a luck based grind. As a side mention: play with VSync on - it affects one boss in Ys1 in particular, and with vsync off the game breaks and the boss becomes actually, physically impossible to damage. I have also heard some people comment that a lower resolution can help make fights easier, especially the last boss of 1.", "timestamp_created": 1496808989, "timestamp_updated": 1496808989, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 65, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.847712", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32187201": {"recommendationid": "32187201", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013888613", "num_games_owned": 242, "num_reviews": 84, "playtime_forever": 479, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496617590}, "language": "french", "review": "Nice nice :)", "timestamp_created": 1496617880, "timestamp_updated": 1496617880, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519841", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32133866": {"recommendationid": "32133866", "author": {"steamid": "76561198333196598", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1313, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495682785}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u7ae5\u5e74\u7684\u65e0\u6570\u56de\u5fc6!", "timestamp_created": 1496424144, "timestamp_updated": 1496424144, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32072563": {"recommendationid": "32072563", "author": {"steamid": "76561198370199034", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2452, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501773577}, "language": "koreana", "review": "3/10\n\n\uc2a4\ud0ef\uacfc \ub514\uc790\uc778\ub9cc \ub2e4\ub974\uace0 \uc6d0\ud328\ud134\uc778 \ubab9\ub4e4. \ub0a1\uc544\ube60\uc9c0\ub2e4 \ubabb\ud574 \ud6c4\uc9c4 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624 \n\n\uadf8\ub098\ub9c8 \ubcf4\uc2a4\uc804\ub9cc \ud560\ub9cc\ud558\ub2e4.", "timestamp_created": 1496181397, "timestamp_updated": 1511328767, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32021320": {"recommendationid": "32021320", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132233832", "num_games_owned": 306, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 33, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495983709}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6c38\u8fdc\u7684\u4f0a\u82cf\u7c89\uff0c", "timestamp_created": 1495982311, "timestamp_updated": 1495982311, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32012257": {"recommendationid": "32012257", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966882693", "num_games_owned": 2328, "num_reviews": 147, "playtime_forever": 387, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495949197}, "language": "english", "review": "A great update to a classic RPG. Honestly the update is what makes playing this game bearable nowadays because the combat system is very dated and there's a lot of design issues with the first Ys game that would be pretty unacceptable nowadays. It's a pretty short game, your first playthrough will be 5-6 hours most likely. The game uses \"bump\" combat which just consists of you running into things to deal damage. Hitting them off center will deal damage without taking any, hitting things head on will hurt you both and knock you back. It's extremely simple (primitive) but it's a 30 year old game so...what do you expect? The game has a fair amount of equipment you can find, although once you buy all of the equipment, money becomes basically worthless, and you also hit level cap about halfway into the game, so past a certain point killing monsters is nearly worthless.\n\nAll that said, if you're a fan of the later games it's still pretty cool to see how it started. The visuals have been greatly updated and look very nice, and the soundtrack is fantastic. The story is fairly cliche and a lot of things aren't explained terribly well, but again it's a 30 year old jRPG, don't go in expecting crazy things and you'll probably enjoy it. Just be prepared for some cheesy boss fights, archaic game design and lots of backtracking.\n\nYs II is a direct sequel to Ys I, beginning directly after the end of the first game. The combat is slightly different and it's a bit longer, but it's quite similar to the first game and ties up the story pretty well. If you enjoy the first game, you'll probably like the second at least as much if not more.", "timestamp_created": 1495949584, "timestamp_updated": 1496621647, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31929541": {"recommendationid": "31929541", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032310380", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 949, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492416626}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5e0c\u671b \u4f0a\u82cf7\u548c\u4f0a\u82cf\uff1a\u6811\u6d77 \u80fd\u591f\u6709\u826f\u5fc3\u5b98\u65b9PC\u79fb\u690d \u5e76\u767b\u5f55STEAM\u5e73\u53f0 \u8c22\u8c22\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1495605094, "timestamp_updated": 1495605094, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31917862": {"recommendationid": "31917862", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127221801", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 65, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495335236}, "language": "english", "review": "The perfect introduction to the Ys series.", "timestamp_created": 1495547084, "timestamp_updated": 1495547084, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500838", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31849500": {"recommendationid": "31849500", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971232223", "num_games_owned": 4622, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 999, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487517978}, "language": "english", "review": "Best bulldozer simulator of all time.", "timestamp_created": 1495235869, "timestamp_updated": 1495235869, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31841235": {"recommendationid": "31841235", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033674928", "num_games_owned": 1043, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 294, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467048770}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u83f2\u5a1c\u2026\u2026", "timestamp_created": 1495203897, "timestamp_updated": 1495203897, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583333", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31827631": {"recommendationid": "31827631", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053313570", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 506, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480468475}, "language": "english", "review": "I started off playing the Ys series with Ys Origin (fantastic game). Next, I decided to play Ys 1 and 2, which was not necessarily the best choice as far as play order goes. But Ys 1 and 2 are fun nonetheless. I liked piecing the story together from Ys Origin. The games play as they should control-wise and had no glitches that I noticed. The designers did a good job bringing both of these old games to steam with some minor updates. And I like that you get both bundled together. The music is A+ and the graphics and story are pretty much what you'd expect from games of this era. I'm not going to lie, I did get a bit bored; I stopped playing Ys 1 right before the FINAL boss and I played Ys 2 for a total of only two or three hours. BUT I think that is mostly due to two factors that are specific to me: it was hard coming off of such a newer great game as Ys Origin AND I'm OCD when it comes to exploring videogames which frequently slows RPG/Adventure games down so much for me that it can kill the mood.

want to give it a try here's the deal:\n\n-what's this game?: a pseudo remake from a very old game, made from the ground up and updating it while trying to be loyal to the original in terms of gameplay\n\n-how does it play?: think the original The Legend of Zelda but instead of there being an attack button you run into enemies, while the original was realeased a year after Zelda it actually rips off another game called hydelide so no, it's not really a zelda clone\n\n-does it hold up?, Ys 1 does and has a charm to it but it has a terrible dificulty spike at the very end, it's not imposible and it's very short anyways, note that Ys 1 is kinda like Ys 2's Ground Zeroes in this package so the real meat is in Ys 2 wich in turn drags on forever and feels unfair at times\n\n-is this game representative of the entire series?: short answear: NO, Long Answear: Ys 1 and 2 are the only ones in wich you run into enemies and while Ys 1 is fun because of it's arcaic dessign, the other ones from Ys 3 onward are far superior and if what you want is an instantaniously fun and enjoyable game skip to Ys 3 onward, note that Steam's Ys 3 (Oath in Felgana) is actually a remake with entirely new gameplay based on Ys 6 (originally for the PS2, PSP and aviable here on Steam) as for the new gameplay it has more in common with Brave Fencer Musashi or Zelda Minish Cap (the last one just barely since the combat is way more complex)\n\n-do i need to play Ys 1 and 2 if i want to get into the franchise?: not really, since it's based on an old game aside of some tangential arcs there is barely any story on the game and can be read on a wikia, feel free to try Ys 1 since you can finish it on a day if you want but bare in mind that the story ends on a cliff hanger ending that goes directly into Ys 2's begining and Ys 2, for it's maze like level dessign in EVERYTHING has aged terribly bad, so feel free to wiki it and go for Ys 3\n\n-so what is the game's chronollogy, do i need to play them  in order?: since the games are Adol's travels and narrations the games from Ys 2 onward are out of order and while there is a time line i recomend you playing them in ny order as long as it's 3, 6 or Zero, then moving into seven and then into 4 or else you'll be struggling with the changes in gameplay since 0, 3 and 6 are based on the same gameplay, seven refins it and 4 beign the newest one takes a lot from 7 with some new twists, 0 BTW it's a prequel\n\n-so how many Ys numerical games are?: there are a lot of old Ys games but no old release is now considered canon and the steam and PSP/PSV versions are either remakes, amalgamations of old games (there used to be 2 Ys 3 games with different gameplays and 2 Ys 4s with different stories) or re imaginings of them so avoid anything pre PS2, that said aviable in their digital form there are:\nYs 0 (here on Steam and PS4 and soon enough PSV)\nYs 1 & 2 (on PSP/PSV and Steam)\nYs 3 (on PSP/PSV and Steam)\nYs 4 (the newest one so far only on the PSV)\nYs 5 (so far no new version exists and the original Super Famicom version seems to be no longer canon)\nYs 6 (Steam)\nYs 7 (PSP/PSV)\n\nand that's pretty much it, Ys 1 and 2 are not bad games but are old and not for everyone so i do recomend them IF you have the patience and want to experience the stoy first hand", "timestamp_created": 1489315359, "timestamp_updated":

Being a top-down JRPG it very much looks and plays like classic Zelda, but the leveling system, combat fluidity and (brutal) bosses make it feel very much like Dark Souls. \n\nThat said, this game is DIFFICULT and there's definitely a Dark Souls-esque learning curve for the combat (more below), trial and error with dungeons, and hair-pulling-out feeling when taking on bosses (the bosses are, for the most part, really great though). Also very much in the vein of Dark Souls, this game is very, very rewarding when you finally make your way through that maze of a dungeon, or beat the boss whose pounded your face in for the last hour.\n\n[h1]Combat[/h1]\n\nHow can a Zelda-like game have Dark Souls like combat that's fluid and got a high learning curve? Ys uses a \"Bump System\" for combat; what this essentially means is your hero automatically attacks with his sword, which is initiated by \"bumping\" into enemies. Effective attacks are made by bumping enemies off-center, from behind, or at angles. If you hit an enemy head on or don't lock them down with effective \"bump\" attacks, they'll parry you and do damage when you attack. \n\nAt first I didn't know what to think about this system, but it's AWESOME. It's fluid because you can attack quickly, move around a ton to dodge and attack, and not have to interrupt your movements with pressing a button to swing your sword (magic in Ys II however, requires a cast button for range attacks). It also provides a really high learning curve because you have to learn the best ways to attack and not take damage, and it FORCES YOU TO BE AGGRESSIVE - sorry folks, there's no standing in a corner and swinging your sword at enemies when they come at you to damage them, push them away, and repeat. \n\nThe Bump System requires you to run at enemies, do it quickly, and always keep moving. It's HARD, but it's FUN.\n\n[h1]Story / Progression[/h1]\n\nLike the classic Zelda-like JRPG's (and Dark Souls), you'll find no quest-trackers here. Instead, you're forced to speak with NPC's to get hints and figure out what to do, and how to do it. Also like Dark Souls, often you'll think you found where to go only to be one-shotted by enemies and realize, \"nope, this comes later.\" Sometimes you'll find it's hard to find out exactly how to progress, but you'll come to appreciate the thought and effort that is required to do so (or, you can use a guide). Characters are engaging, and story is simple but interesting.\n\n[h1]Bosses[/h1]\n\nAlso very Dark Souls-like, they have tons of health, complicated attack patterns that require dodging and attacking in certain ways, and often you get to them and get your face absolutely crushed in and realize, \"oh crap, I need to back up and find some better gear and grind out some more levels\". I've only played the game on Hard and Nightmare mode - it's not unusual to have to try a boss 20 times before you beat him, and even then it's hard to beat them consistently. Difficulty primarily affects the complexity of boss attack patterns.\n\n[h1]RPG Elements[/h1]\n\nYour HP/MP are automatically upgraded as you level up, and you gain XP and Gold from defeating enemies. Most of the customization in these games comes from buying or finding upgraded armor, weapons, and other ability-altering items in dungeons. \n\nYou will often need to customize your equipment and items for best effectiveness against certain bosses, or to make it through certain dungeons. The RPG elements are just enough to keep you engaged and actively adapting to the situation, and just simple enough that it doesn't take away from the fluidity of the gameplay (no stat-point allocation to agonize over to be found here).\n\n[h1]Other Notes[/h1] \n\nStory in these games is about 10 hours for Ys I, and a bit over 15 for Ys II. Given the ease of running these games, they're also great for playing on a laptop when you're away from your gaming rig. \n\nWhile you can play with a mouse/keyboard, I recommend using a gamepad. There are also cusomization options for visuals (upgraded or classic), however they're pretty similar and don't impact the game. \n\nBE AWARE that \"Movement\" settings DO HAVE AN IMPACT ON PLAYABILITY - there is an option for 360 degree movement (like a modern joystick) and 8-Directional movement (like a classic arrow-pad. Certain bosses and dungons will be MUCH easier/more difficult based upon the movement settings you use, so don't be afraid to switch it up to increase mobility (360) or movement accuracy (8-Direction).\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n\n[b]Excellent game, and a definite must-buy, 9/10[/b] for any classic Zelda and Dark Souls fans.

The combat system is unique even 30(!) years after their original release, with the main battle mechanic being ramming your enemies in the flanks. This gives the games a feeling of quick movement that for today's gamer can trigger an interesting response: I found myself using the same skillset, especially in regards to fight or flight, that I'd developed playing Darksouls.\n\nThe feeling of the games being a top-down, technicolored, 80's Darksouls never went away either, with common enemies that will tear you apart if you waste all your time on them and difficult boss battles. Ironically, playing this way made the bosses much harder for me (at least in Ys I) because I wound up fighting them horribly under levelled. This isn't to say either Ys is as hard as Darksouls, though if you took the bosses from Ys I and the mooks from Ys II (who were shockingly more powerful than Ys I, the bosses however...) you'd probably wind up with a game that, despite being in a very different (sub-)genre would both feel weirdly familiar and give any veteran Darksouls player a run for their money.\n\nFinally, loved the music. Also worth noting the games are very short, first one is less than 10 hours, second is a lot longer and has a magic system that lets you do some cool stuff including hit enemies with something other than a sword.", "timestamp_created": 1486855213, "timestamp_updated": 1486855213, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29659982": {"recommendationid": "29659982", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998876942", "num_games_owned": 233, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 460, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486083508}, "language": "english", "review": "Thanks to YouTuber, Happy Console Gamer, I finally bought this under his recomendation and I dont regret it for the most part!\n\nThe start of the game is a little rough around the edges as you learn a combat system unlike any you've played before with only 20HP to your name and a little popup window explaining the mechanics. That's it! No hand holding of any kind, no quest log and no map. Just NPC dialouge, your wits, and a pinch of luck. I seriously could not have beaten the first game without a few hints from GameFAQs. Without it, my playtime would be doubled. Seriously there are lots of quests and VERY important items that can be missed and ignored entirely. This i find to be a huge flaw and I almost gave up entirely when i forgot to grab the Evil Ring back on the 2nd floor while trying to enter the next area on the 16th floor.\n\nOther than that, The graphics are charming, bringing me back to my childhood days. Coupled with a super awesome soundtrack mixing together heavy metal and synthesizers, helped to keep me motivated throughout the journey. \n\nThe dungeon designs are very well laid out maze like puzzels that made my head spin. The boss fights at times can be unfair, but with patience and a bit luck, you'll get through them. Thankfully you can save anywhere and load back VERY quickly if you die.\n\nAlso I do need to include a small rant about the final boss though... Dear god in heaven, worst Final boss i've ever faced in my life. Learning his pattern is the first 10%, the other 90% is luck.\n\nAll in all, I had a great time with the first game and already feel like i got my $15 out of it and theres still a whole other game to play! Probably one of the hardest games i've played, only because of the lack of hand holding and how easy it was to miss certain items/ details. \n\nIf you're looking for an RPG thats different and have the will to press on when the going gets tough, you'll have a great time!

I am not a big fan of turn-based RPGs, and was happy to see that this game is of the real-time combat variety.\n\nThe story revolves around the main character Adol, who is washed up on the shore of an island where monsters have started appearing. You start out by helping the various characters on the island, and eventually embark on an adventure to find the Books of Ys.\n\nYou kill enemies by running into them from the right angle. If you just charge straight into their face you will end up taking a lot of damage. That's pretty much how the combat works. No spells or anything, just bumping, pure and simple.\n\nAs soon as you learn how important it is to be at a high enough level and to have the best weapon and armor available equipped, the regular enemies won't be too much of an issue, even on nightmare difficulty.\n\nThe bosses, however... Some of the bosses are so easy to defeat it's stupid, while others are ridiculously and frustratingly hard. One boss I was able to beat on my first try, another it took me [i]a lot[/i] of tries to beat. Still, despite making me want to throw away my controller at times, the bosses were definitely the most fun part of the game. After finishing the main story you also unlock Time Attack Mode, which let's you try to defeat all the bosses in the game as fast as possible.\n\nThe last part of the game consists of running around talking to people, looking for items, and just figuring out where to go next. There were a couple of times where I had no idea what I was suppose to do next, however the game world is luckily not [i]too[/i] big, so you will figure it out eventually.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed this game, and will definitely be playing Ys II, as well as probably all the other games in the series.\n\nHighly recommended!", "timestamp_created": 1484551092, "timestamp_updated": 1484552020, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550423", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29274452": {"recommendationid": "29274452", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142135592", "num_games_owned": 445, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 65, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484606506}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Primeiras impress\u00f5es, jogo muito bom.

I'm giving both games a thumbs up, but. . . . . .\n\nThe original game was released in 1987, and it was one of the first action RPGs ever made. It shows it's age through design even if the visuals and audio were updated. I guess I'll go over a few pros and cons.\n\nPROs:\n\n- Fighting is fun. Even if the idea of \"running into enemies to deal damage\" doesn't sound appealing, it's at least an interesting idea to try out since you've probably never played a game much like it. Boss fights are awesome in design since it requires a LOT of movement, precision, and timing in order to defeat them. Be warned that there are some challenging parts in this game. Magic is also a mechanic in the game, and it really helps add variety to the combat when you get bored with running into enemies to beat them.\n- World is somewhat cohesive, and the town NPCs are at least a little memorable. It's also good how the townsfolk talk about each other even when the different people are towns apart. You get to see a grandma in a village complain about her children trying to get her to move to another town, and you also get to talk to the children in the other town talking about their struggle of trying to get their mother to move to their town. This sort of thing is important because the town-exploration that is required by the player can really bog down the game if it isn't good. \n- Overall, I'd say that the story is good. It doesn't take a front-seat in this game, but it is able to find a place in a game where you are suppose to be an adventurer discovering the world, helping people, and saving the land from demons and destruction. The story is mostly established as you explore the land and talk to various NPCs. The story isn't handed to you on a sliver-platter, and I think that this is a good thing for this type of game.\n- Oh yeah. the game has an RAAAAAAAAAAAD soundtrack\n\nCons:\n\n- A very large number of the enemies in the game behave in the exact same way, and the way you fight them is the same a lot of the time. Just run into their side, and beat them. If the enemies each had different patterns of movement and different ways that they could damage you, the game would be much better, but at least the bosses are good. This is where the \"bump-to-attack\" mechanic shows its flaws. This is perhaps the worst part of the game. . . . .boring enemy design. (not in visuals but in the the way that enemies fight) \n- It also becomes very boring fighting enemies when you're lv. 20 while fighting lv. 1 enemies. Also, being able to rest on the overworld at the player's leisure just decreases the tension and fun that one could have from fighting enemies normally. This is a natural symptom to RPGs, but. . . . it still is true.\n- There isn't a world map, and it is fairly easy to get lost since the screen is zoomed in, and it's hard to orient yourself to the map when the different parts of an area are indistinguishable. I suppose that the game is old-school though, and perhaps there can be some fun found in drawing your own maps with pencil and paper.\n- Back-tracking to open treasure-chests that you already found but didn't have the key at the time isn't. . . . .particularly fun. It feels more like busy-work.\n\nSo, my conclusion. . . . generally good gameplay, and a good story that works well with the gameplay-focus of this game.  Oh yeah, did I also mention the AWESOME MUSIC????\n\n7.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1483325904, "timestamp_updated": 1483326199, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.612688", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28925319": {"recommendationid": "28925319", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014832954", "num_games_owned": 196, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 721, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483320730}, "language": "english", "review": "I was really interested in starting to play the Ys Series, since I grew up on SNES Jrpgs, Secret of Mana/Evermore, Final Fantasy, Lufia, Terranigma, Chrono Trigger etc etc. The graphics were really compelling and the series seems to be quite successful given how many sequels there are. So I thought I start out with the first two installments and give it a try. Well...having played through the first one on Normal up until the last boss:\n\nNope, not recommended.\n\ntl;dr: grinding, backtracking, unbalanced difficulty, generic linear story with no \"red line\" to guide through, stupid gameplay/core mechanic. Nice combat music - overall, keep playing the classics and save it on this one.\n\nThis is a prime example of a game that aged really badly.\nHorrible, downright unacceptable game design by today's standards, that was *maybe* acceptable 20 years ago.\n\n- Core game mechanic: \"bumping\" into enemies is not only trivial and uninteresting, it's also random af. Hitting an enemy and getting no dmg vs getting hit, because the enemy turns around and hits you back in the last second is not only a world of difference, but there's nothing you can do from your side to \"safely\" execute it. You just bump into enemies sideways and \"hope for the best\"; no strategy or thinking/planing involved.\n\n- Unbalanced and outright ridiculous difficulty. It starts with you being laughably underpowered and you having to GRIND at the very start of the game to even get your starter equipment to sort of start your quest. Then one or two levels down the line your enemies go from almost unbeatable to oneshots. Its like playing WOW, where you constantly either fight a mob that is 3 or more levels above you, or you are fighting lvl 1 critters. And the last 2-3 bosses are plainly insane, even on normal difficulty.\n\n- Generic, bland story & characters & villain: Not the worst thing in the world, if the narrative was interesting at least, however...\n- NO narrative whatsoever. You basically have to run around and guess what to do next. Not even at the start of the game do you have a clear objective, where to go and what to do next...it just sort of plays itself out because the number of locations is very small and eventually you would have talked to everyone.\n\n- Grinding.....seriously..grinding in a SINGLEPLAYER game is a cardinal sin. There should be NO REASON to ever having to grind other than OPTIONAL late game stuff, like secret bosses (FF series). When you have to grind to progress in the MAIN PLOT, there's something wrong with your game balance guys..and not only that...but grinding at the START of the game? Like right off the bat grinding for your START EQUIPMENT..holy fuck.\n\n- Backtracking... a lot. What you are dealing with here is an ordinary linear rpg, except almost all areas are open to you at once and you HAVE to have certain items or spoken to a certain person to progress. And if that person ist literally 9 dungeon floors in the back..too bad, happy backtracking or you shall not pass. \n\nBacktracking is just like grinding: In almost every case it's bad game design, plain and simple. And this has nothing to do with the age of the game either. There is no grinding or a lot of backtracking in any RPG that I mentioned above. There's no \"this game is old\" excuse. I could probably write a paper on everything what's wrong with this game, but I have to stop for now...\n\nThe music in the Chronicles version however was really awesome in some places and the graphics are indeed quite nice. But that doesn't cut it. If you are interested in retro rpgs - play any of the ones I mentioned in the beginning and save yourself the time. \n\nSadly the first game in this series ruined my desire to play any sequels, and even though I know this might be unfair - the difference between good and bad Final Fantasy or Breath of Fire installments for example is, they are independent story arks. The Ys series however seems to be in continuity and if I didn't like the first game, whats the point of playing the rest?", "timestamp_created": 1483325468, "timestamp_updated": 1483326138, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.397905", "comment_count": "10", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28892583": {"recommendationid": "28892583", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124738753", "num_games_owned": 1515, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 1350, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483585212}, "language": "english", "review": "A bundle of the first two games that launched the large and expansive Ys series, modernized but still in the spirit of the originals.

As such, they still retain the same basic gameplay and design as their original 80's counterparts, so the gameplay takes some getting used to. You don't have an attack button, you run into enemies off-center to kill them. You don't have a plethora of healing items, you have a single potion, and otherwise just stand still.\n\nYs I is a fun and short adventure, clocking out on an average of 5 hours, even if you're completely lost. It's a fun adventure with a simplistic story but a great, connected world with a lot of lore. However, nearly all of the boss fights are terrible, and are only difficult through arbitrary means. It's still definitely a game worth playing, though, as it leads directly into Ys II.\n\nYs II is a damn incredible game, and improves on the original in every way. A more expansive world, a deeper storyline, incredibly fun boss fights, absolutely beautiful music. There's not much else I can say except for the fact that Ys II is worth all the trouble you'll have in Ys I. And hey, don't like Ys I? The good news is that you can completely skip it and just go straight to the second one if you so choose (though you might be a little lost on the story at first).\n\nLong and short of it, Ys I & II Chronicles+ is a collection of two very old but classic action RPGs.

I cannot put my finger on exactly what it is, but VERY few games, if any, nail that exact formula today (The most recent I can think of that I played being the first Golden Sun). Despite the limited graphics and simple gameplay, there is just something that makes the stories and characters seem to come to life and the world just call out for every house, forest, cave and secret to be explored. I would be tempted to chock it all up to nostalgia, except that I had never played a single Ys game until recently here on steam. Thus far, I have finished Ys I and cannot wait to move on to II. This game, originally released in the late 80s and updated with beautiful 32-bit style gameplay graphics and hand drawn anime style cut-scenes and character profiles, nails that formula. It's been given a nice new paint job and some optional updated musical scores, but even with all these things the old heart and soul of this classic game still shines through, perhaps all the brighter, and even to a new comer like myself. I am reminded of the first time I played The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past (so perhaps there is some form of nostalgia at play here after all).\n\nI was VERY skeptical of the strange \"bump combat\" system at first.  I still wouldn't say it's ideal. I'm glad it did not become a standard in games, but after spending some time with it, and leveling up a little, it actually is nowhere near as bad as it seems at first and becomes quite enjoyable.\n\nThe graphics, artwork (of which you can select 2 versions), and music (of which you can select a few versions) are absolutely beautiful.  The characters and dialogue are interesting, fun, and memorable.  The story is engaging. The puzzles are fun.

XSEED went above and beyond the call of duty with this release: they took the Ys I & II Complete release from 2001 and updated it with the content from the later Chronicles release on the PSP circa 2009.\n\nYs I & II Chronicles+ recounts the first two adventures of Adol Christin, better known as \"Adol the Red\" in the continent of Esteria and the mysterious lost continent of Ys. If you've played an earlier iteration of these games (the most popular version was the TurboGrafx-16 release), you're probably familiar with the storyline, though there have been a few changes here and there -- including a brand new area at the beginning of Ys I.\n\nThe gameplay is a far more refined version of the classic \"run-and-bump\" gameplay associated with the series. Adol attacks his enemies by ramming into his enemies off-center, while getting rammed or ramming into them on-center deals damage to Adol instead. This is expanded on in Ys II with additional magic attacks, such as the ability to shoot fireballs, warp and Adol can even disguise himself as a creature, in order to talk to monsters.\n\nThe graphics aren't breathtaking by any means, but they're the best-looking iteration of these classic games out there. There are some nice full-motion video cutscenes as well, though some may argue they lack the \"charm\" of those present in the TG-16 version. Music is amazing as always: some have even argued that the new rearrangements made for Chronicles rival those of Ryo Yonemitsu. Additional unused tracks have been reimplemented into the game, to add more diversity to the soundtrack compared to earlier versions.  As a bonus, the game also includes the option to use both the classic PC-88 soundtrack (the original versions of Ys I & II), as well as the remixed music from Complete.\n\nIf the game has any major flaws, I'd have to say it's the fact that both Ys I & II are considered separate games -- both in the Steam library, as well as in general. That is to say, you don't actually need to complete Ys I in order to play Ys II, unlike the TG-16 version which wove both games into a seamless experience. By extension, this means that any experience gained in Ys I doesn't carry over to Ys II. Therefore, Ys I retains the somewhat uneven levelling and low level cap (you can only reach Lv. 10) from earlier iterations.\n\nIf you've never played a single Ys game before, this would be the one to start with. While the \"run-and-bump\" battle system was replaced with a more traditional hack-and-slash mechanic in the other games currently available on Steam, it's still an interesting system that deserves to be enjoyed by all. If you've played Ys I & II before, you can probably skip out on this one -- though I'd consider this version to be the definitive version.", "timestamp_created": 1480121299, "timestamp_updated": 1480121299, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565136", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27561902": {"recommendationid": "27561902", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092672505", "num_games_owned": 172, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 258, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480113383}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6cd5\u8001\u63a7,\u7f51\u763e\u5c11\u5973\u7684\u9752\u6625", "timestamp_created": 1480114138, "timestamp_updated": 1480114138, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27558984": {"recommendationid": "27558984", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040567917", "num_games_owned": 549, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 495, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511394543}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a very good remake of the classic game Ys.

Sicherlich handelt es sich um ein Remake, jedoch basiert das Grundger\u00fcst immer noch auf dem originalem Ys, welches Anno 1987 ver\u00f6ffentlicht wurde. Der schnelle Spielablauf sucht seinesgleichen und es wird eine hervorragende Balance zwischen Simplizit\u00e4t und Anspruch geboten. Man kann sich direkt ins Spiel st\u00fcrzen ohne irgendwelche Anleitungen zu w\u00e4lzen, aber wer Ys durchspielen m\u00f6chte, sollte schon ein gewisses Ma\u00df an Geschicklichkeit und Verstand mitbringen. Kurz gesagt: Ein echter Retro-Klassiker und absoluter Pflichttitel f\u00fcr jeden Retro-Spieler und Freunde des Action-Rollenspiels!\n\n\nPro und Kontra:\n\nPro:\n- sehr flotter Spielablauf\n- simples und geniales \u201eAnrempel\u201c-Kampfsystem\n- wundersch\u00f6ne Sprite-Grafiken im 16-bit-Stil\n- cooler J-Rock-Soundtrack mit Ohrwurm-Garantie\n- erfordert Eigeninitiative bei der Erforschung der Spielwelt und L\u00f6sung der Item-R\u00e4tsel\n- zahlreiche, sympathische Nebencharaktere\n- fl\u00fcssige und konfigurierbare Tastatur- und Controller-Steuerung\n\nNeutral:\n- ca. 5-7 Stunden Spielzeit\n- bietet nur eine kleine, aber daf\u00fcr offene Spielwelt\n- eine klassische Handlung ohne echte Besonderheiten\n\nKontra:\n- k\u00f6nnte f\u00fcr manchen zu \u201eRetro\u201c sein, weil man eben selber gucken muss wo man bleibt\n- das \u201eAnrempel\u201c-Kampfsystem d\u00fcrfte wohl auch nicht jedem gefallen\n- einige Bossk\u00e4mpfe wirken unfair, da man eingesteckten Schaden oftmals nicht verhindern kann und es noch nicht mal erlaubt ist Hilfsmittel wie Heiltr\u00e4nke in einem Bosskampf einzusetzen\n\n\n================================================\n\n\nYs II: Konsequente Fortsetzung eines Klassikers\n\nWer den ersten Teil mochte, wird auch den Zweiten m\u00f6gen. Die Kernspielelemente, welche den Vorg\u00e4nger so gut gemacht haben, wurden beibehalten und durch neue Dinge erg\u00e4nzt. So bekommt Adol ein paar Zauberspr\u00fcche zur Verf\u00fcgung gestellt und der Umfang des Spiels wurde mal eben verdoppelt. Abseits einiger kleinerer \u00c4nderungen, die ohnehin in den Bereich des pers\u00f6nlichen Geschmacks fallen, kann eigentlich nur der Soundtrack als echter Kritikpunkt genannt werden, und das auch nur, weil er nicht an die Ohrwurm-Brillanz des vorherigen Spiels heranreicht. Dies ist jedoch Meckern auf sehr hohem Niveau, denn auch Ys II ist ein klasse Action-Rollenspiel, welches Fans von Retro-Games und Action-Rollenspielen sehr viel Freude bereiten wird.\n\nYs I & II Chronicles + ist einfach ein hervorragendes Remake und eine tolle Compilation f\u00fcr all jene, die schon immer mal die Anf\u00e4nge dieser sch\u00f6nen Action-RPG-Saga miterleben wollten. Der Preis von 11,99 \u20ac ist obendrein sehr fair gehalten.

The controls are responsive and the hit detection is very good.\n\nThe music, as for every Ys game, is absolutely kick-ass\n\nYs I is fairly short, but it's a great build-up for Ys II which is even better than Ys I.\n\n\nI'd recommend this to everyone who's looking for a fastpaced action game, with a few RPG elements in it.\nDo keep in mind that the game isn't, of course, for everyone.

First of all, it's two games in one, and both games are of stellar quality. Excellent sprite and artwork, an absolutely stunning soundtrack, endearing characters, especially that of the main character, Adol, and a surprisingly efficient and fast-paced combat system.\n\nWhen a game features combat but 'not' an attack button, that would give any gamer pause. On paper, that would seem clunky at best and unintuitive at worst. However, the \"bump system\" implimented renders the need for an attack button practically obsolete, to the point where I actually question the very existence of what is otherwise an unquestionably essential feature in an action game. \n\nWhat the bump system does is automatically calculate your attack, your defence, and your receiving of damage upon colliding with any enemy, and the chances of how that collision will play out change depending on which angle you bump into the enemy. If you hit them from behind or from an angle, typically your mow through them like a lawn mower. If you get bumped into yourself, you'll take damage, and if you collide face first with an enemy, you and the enemy will either take damage or block, and both will be knocked away. \n\nOnce you master the bump system, you'll literally mow down enemies at a much faster pace than you would a Zelda title, which this game resembles aesthetically. In fact, the Ys series is, in many ways, the Sonic to Zelda's Mario. Where Zelda is a more balanced and safe experience, where you can always expect a blend of puzzles and combat, Ys games, typically, are faster, flashier, and more experimental than any Zelda title. While this has had mixed to poor resulte for Sonic, I've yet to play an Ys game I didn't like.\n\nIf you're looking to get into the Ys series, this is definitely the game(s) to do it with.", "timestamp_created": 1476782461, "timestamp_updated": 1476782461, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504638", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26081126": {"recommendationid": "26081126", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960960793", "num_games_owned": 263, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 567, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476421488}, "language": "english", "review": "I recommend it but only to those who like simple \"old\" school ARPG.

You wont be sifting through tons of loot, and you wont be spending stats or making builds.  You will instead be engaging in lots and lots of combat, which is the games biggest flaw. The fights in this game are very rudimentary, and they happen to the point of ad nasuem.  Sadly the progression elements render any kind of strategy null, as you'll either be far beyond any enemy in power, or unable to take two hits from them.  \n\nI may be ragging on the game a bit here, but Ys 1 & 2 are actually good games. The music is pretty decent, the visuals, especially the updated ones, are pleasant and harken back to high fantasy from the 80s/90s.  The world and environment really hammer the fantasy atmosphere home.\n\nThe story and characters arent all that intriguing, but that is owning, again, to the games dated nature.  The narrative here is nothing new, but it isnt annoying.  Faint praise, I know\n\nHonestly, I do recommend this game, but cautiously.  If you enjoyed a lot of old high fantasy material, or you played some of the more recent games, give the game a go.  It may surprise you.

It actually contains both the Chronicles (2001) and Complete (2009) editions, including updated visuals and soundtracks.\n\nThe Ys games are known for not dilly-dallying around and is a fast paced action game with light RPG elements. You run around bumping into enemies, leveling up, earning gold and buying better equipment.\n\nThe first game is not as good as the sequel, but is a solid introduction to the series nontheless. The story is that some ancient evil power thing is causing monsters to roam havoc in Ys and Esteria. One day Adol falls out of the sky and lands in this very land, becoming the protagonist and saviour of the land.\n\nBoth games features a bump system where you basically walk into enemies to take them out. The first game requires you to hit enemies off center to take them out without taking damage and this is further expanded upon in the sequel where you also can bump successfully diagonally. This makes the battles way easier, ensuring you're staying alive longer.\n\nWhile the first Ys I is a bit easing on the mechanics, it does feature harder bosses than the sequel. It's around 6-7 hours in length, while Ys II Vanished the Final Chapter is around double the length, at around 12-14 hours. It is by far the superior of the two, featuring a much bigger world and alot more items to procure.\n\nSpeaking of items, both games requires you to do A-LOT of backtracking and won't hold your hand in telling you where all of them are. These are the type of games that enforces you to explore, run around and figuring it all out for yourself. If you're not using a guide, expect to get stuck some times as it is not always clear what to do next. Both games also features some highly missable (and some VERY doubious) achievements as well, like shoving a girl and a boy up in a corner to \"measure\" them. The game does feature plenty of humor too, though and like its tongue-in-cheek moments from time to time.\n\nFor the price you're getting a decent pack of entertainment here. Even better if you get it on sale (which happens pretty often). The story may not be very inspiring, but the soundtrack is stellar. Falcom is known for always composing great soundtrack for their games and this is no exception. \n\nRating: \nYs I: 5.5/10\nYs II Vanished The Final Chapter: 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1474602997, "timestamp_updated": 1474602997, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25616428": {"recommendationid": "25616428", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022025488", "num_games_owned": 1186, "num_reviews": 147, "playtime_forever": 319, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474451984}, "language": "english", "review": "Have you ever thought what'd it be like to be a dude running between pong paddles while a big blue asshole shooting fireballs is constantly being batted at you?\n\nWhy?

Ele sempre teve o sonho de partir para uma aventura e foi inspirado pelo pai. N\u00e3o \u00e9 a toa que ele sente que precisa ir para uma ilha atualmente dominada por monstros chamada Esteria. De acordo com boatos, todos que v\u00e3o para l\u00e1 n\u00e3o retornam com vida, mas mesmo assim nosso her\u00f3i decide percorrer o caminho dif\u00edcil e chegar em Esteria. L\u00e1 ele descobre que os monstros dominam o lugar e ele precisa salvar aquelas pessoas e esse \u00e9 o resumo de tudo...\n\n[h1]*Jogabilidade:[/h1]\n\nPrimeiro que como trat\u00e1-se de uma cole\u00e7\u00e3o q inclui 2 jogos em 1. Os 2 jogos tem jogabilidade similar, mas n\u00e3o a mesma:\n\n*YS I: Aqui o estilo de batalha \u00e9 um pouco diferente dos tradicionais (por turno). Em realidade a batalha se d\u00e1 em tempo real, bastando apenas encostar no monstro para ele ser derrotado, mas n\u00e3o de frente e sim atacando de lado (nas extremidades do monstro). Eu sei que quem estiver lendo vai estar se perguntando \"huh? n\u00e3o entendi!\", mas \u00e9 complicado explicar. Quando voc\u00ea sair da primeira cidade \u00e9 mostrado uma imagem explicando como funciona a batalha...\n\n*YS II: O estilo \u00e9 o mesmo que no 1, a \u00fanica diferen\u00e7a \u00e9 que Adol poder\u00e1 lan\u00e7ar magia, bastando carregar para soltar uma poderosa bola flamejante.\n\nAo falar com os personagens, basta encostar de frente que aparecer\u00e1 o di\u00e1logo, mas o mais importante \u00e9 que caso fale pela 2\u00b0 vez com o mesmo personagem poder\u00e1 ter uma surpresa do que ele poder\u00e1 falar.\n\nNo YS II al\u00e9m de os personagens falarem pela 2\u00b0 vez algo diferente, voc\u00ea poder\u00e1 presentear NPCs com objetos e algumas vezes poder\u00e1 ganhar algo valioso em troca.\n\nNo YS II voc\u00ea tamb\u00e9m poder\u00e1 se converter em um monstro chamado \"Roo\" e assim comunicar-se com os monstros no qual voc\u00ea derrotou. No caso, infelizmente n\u00e3o \u00e9 poss\u00edvel presentear um monstro at\u00e9 porque cada personagem desse jogo, o modo de falar \u00e9 diferente, alguns s\u00e3o mais calmos e outros mais agressivos.\n\nOutro ponto que vale lembrar \u00e9 al\u00e9m de tudo isso que falei, cada personagem (pessoas e monstros) tem um nome diferente e absolutamente nenhum tem o mesmo designer.\n\nNo momento de enfrentar bosses, voc\u00ea \u00e9 incapaz de recuperar vida, ou seja ou vence o boss com esta limita\u00e7\u00e3o ou pode tentar subir um pouco mais de n\u00edvel at\u00e9 que possa enfrent\u00e1-lo, mas a maioria n\u00e3o \u00e9 t\u00e3o dif\u00edcil e perdendo, voc\u00ea poder\u00e1 assimilar os momentos certos para atacar.\n\n[h1]*M\u00fasica:[/h1]\n\nPor que voc\u00eas acham que eu tenho a vers\u00e3o Premium para PSP? Simples as m\u00fasicas desse jogo s\u00e3o incr\u00edveis e memor\u00e1veis, mesmo saindo do jogo voc\u00ea ir\u00e1 lembrar de algumas que achou bastante interessantes. A vers\u00e3o da Steam infelizmente n\u00e3o inclui Soundtrack, mas poderia ter tamb\u00e9m seria algo interessante.\n\n[h1]*Curiosidade:[/h1]\n\nPara as pessoas que nunca jogaram as vers\u00f5es antigas ou as vers\u00f5es remasterizadas, o jogo inclui mudan\u00e7a de gr\u00e1fico e mudan\u00e7a das m\u00fasicas. Quero dizer voc\u00ea pode altenar entre os gr\u00e1ficos (imagens dos npcs, como mostra no trailer) de 2001 ou de 2006, como as m\u00fasicas dessas respectivas datas ou a de 8 bits de SNES, o que \u00e9 muito interessante. (Na vers\u00e3o de PSP que \u00e9 chamada Chronicles, tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 poss\u00edvel altenar gr\u00e1ficos e m\u00fasicas)\n\n[h1]*Opini\u00e3o pr\u00f3pria:[/h1]\n\nO jogo \u00e9 muito bom, bom mesmo... N\u00e3o inclui m\u00fasicas, mas pode ter certeza de que vai n\u00e3o se decepcionar. Eu tenho apenas quase 30 horas, pois fico mais com a vers\u00e3o de PSP mesmo, por\u00e9m aqui tem conquistas e l\u00e1 n\u00e3o, ent\u00e3o basicamente o meu tempo aqui foi pegando conquistas e completando no modo mais dif\u00edcil pela primeira vez.\n\n[spoiler]Outra coisa que vale falar, quem conseguir vencer Dark Fact no modo nightmare, BOA SORTE, POIS VAI PRECISAR BASTANTE...[/spoiler]\n\n[b][i]Nota: 10/10\nTotalmente recomendado![/b][/i]\n\n\n[h1]*Ordem de hist\u00f3ria:[/h1]\n\nBasicamente esse n\u00e3o \u00e9 o in\u00edcio da s\u00e9rie, apesar de ter sido o primeiro jogo lan\u00e7ado.

The bash system mainly is running into the enemy to attack, but for them to not attack, you would have to hit them at an angle and not head on. \n\nOnce you get the combat system down, the game is very enjoyable and coming from Origins, I expected the boss fights to be a challenge. I'll spoil this now because I'm thinking about it, but after 1/4th into the game, money is literally useless.

Most of the two games surround one of the main 'evils' encountered, which manifest in two forms -- one at the end of each game.\n\nCombat in Ys I & II is awkward at the beginning, as it involves Adol bumping into enemies to attack them.

Notice I'll keep saying game beacuse this \"collection\" is really 1 game that when it origanaly came out they had to split it in two it verry much fells like 1 great game. Every pice of equipment you pick up is basicly neccary to continue and ys1 brillently makes you max out your level half way through the game so you can no longer grind and have to get gud.\n\nIf you haven't played a ys (I have only played this and orgin so far I'm onto 3 next) one thing you should know is that it's an action game with slight rpg elements and world. The clear foccous of the game is quick stressful battles. most bosses can be taken down in under a minute or two but on the nightmare difficulty you need to be close to perfect in your exicution or you will die quickly. That goes for the rest of the game as well a small mistake can quickly end in your death you'll need to keep saving in order to get through this but it keeps the game exciting from biging to end. It also has the darksouls feeling of you felling epic when you have to back through an area that you were stuggling with earlier when you relize not much has changed but your skill.\n\nThe only complaint I have is nightmare for ys one feels unfair on a couple of the end game bosses. Serisously I ignore most games if someone dosn't say they are hard. Ys 1 nighmare is not to be taken lightly and make sure you have v-sync enabled or the game can be unbeatable at the final boss. I wish I had done hard for ys1 and nightmare for ys2 I probably would have had a better experance. Also compaired to the rest of the game ys2 final boss feels like such a push over it's sad but I can't complin too much after every other boss being a blast and differnt from the rest.\n\nAlso keep in mind that the two games make up what you would expect to be and avrage game for this type of thing and 2 is verry much just a continuation of 1 maybe slightly better and feels more fair but still hard.\n\ndespite it being old you deffently get your $s worth at $15 and on a sale this is a steal.", "timestamp_created": 1471205989, "timestamp_updated": 1471205989, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24897807": {"recommendationid": "24897807", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075537487", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 602, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1440630168}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Ys \u00e9 um jogo simplista.\nMas n\u00e3o leve a afirma\u00e7\u00e3o acima como um dem\u00e9rito, Ys, como grande parte de quem estiver lendo analises aqui j\u00e1 deve saber, \u00e9 um RPG, e n\u00e3o \u00e9 um dos mais faceis, mas n\u00e3o diria que \u00e9 dos mais dificeis tamb\u00e9m. \n\nO estilo gr\u00e1fico \u00e9 simples, o que \u00e9 comum pra jogos desse tipo, e a jogabilidade \u00e9 simples e responsiva, embora a pr\u00f3pria possa acabar gerando algumas dores de cabe\u00e7a pela forma que o combate ocorre no jogo, mas nada exagerado, consideando tudo acho ela muito boa mesmo se tratando de algo, como j\u00e1 dito, simples.\n\nA hist\u00f3ria \u00e9 contada em partes, e assim como todo bom RPG voc\u00ea acaba travado em algumas partes na maioria dos casos e se pergunta \"mas o que \u00e9 que eu tenho que fazer pra passar daqui?\", o que novamente n\u00e3o \u00e9 um dem\u00e9rito, \u00e9 uma caracter\u00edstia do estilo, o jogo n\u00e3o \u00e9 t\u00e3o bonzinho a ponto de te entregar todas as respostas e formas de se comportar em determinados locais e ou situa\u00e7\u00f5es. \n\nYs \u00e9 um jogo bom, que cumpre muito bem com o que promete e tem um pre\u00e7o, ao meu ver, bem camarada. \nN\u00e3o \u00e9 grandioso como Chrono Trigger e nem famoso como Final Fantasy, mas Ys n\u00e3o deixa a desejar, pelo menos, ficou acima das minhas expectativas. \n8.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1471128759, "timestamp_updated": 1471128860, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481132", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24894240": {"recommendationid": "24894240", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124942043", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497377947}, "language": "english", "review": "Feena!!!", "timestamp_created": 1471118723, "timestamp_updated": 1471118723, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24819488": {"recommendationid": "24819488", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029246048", "num_games_owned": 228, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 764, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471195189}, "language": "english", "review": "I started this series with Ys Origin, so it took a while to get used to the bumper car combat.

The two games are essentially one, with II being a direct sequel to I.  Unlike most Ys games, where the events are loosely connected and don't need to be played in any particular order, Ys I and II should be played together, in order.  I also personally recommend these games as an introduction to the series, as they introduce some of the main recurring characters of the series.  Both games come with 3 soundtracks - the original PC88 version, the Ys I & II Complete version, and the Ys I & II Chronicles version.  While I personally have a love for the FM synth of the original (PC98 VGM is amazing), all 3 soundtracks are fantastic and there's really no \"best\" version.  Having multiple choices was a very nice touch from Falcom.  With introductions out of the way though, let's get into the individual games.\n\n- Ys I - \nYs I is a mediocre game with an odd charm.  While not nearly as good as its sequel, it's still a nice game.  Much of the time there's little clue where to go or what to do, but something about freely roaming the world talking to NPCs to find a clue as to what to do next reminds me of a simpler time and just has a nice feeling to it.  Also, unlike many RPGs, every NPC has a name and a small sense of uniqueness that makes the interactions with them more enjoyable.  This is honestly one of my favorite parts of this game, and of Falcom games in general.\n\nThe combat is pretty simplistic in Ys - bumping into enemies will damage them, but hitting them head-on will hurt you a lot as well, so you must hit them from off-center to avoid taking damage.  It's a nice system, and I like it, but it wasn't executed as well as it could have been in this game.  You reach the maximum level about halfway through the game, which makes fighting enemies feel unrewarding for the remainder.  The boss design also a bit poor, which is sad.  They're functional and not really \"bad\", but they're still some of the poorer-quality bosses of the series.  That said, while the gameplay is a touch mediocre, the characters, story, and music still work well to make the game feel nice despite its flaws.\n\n- Ys II -\n\nYs II is the direct sequel to Ys I, taking place immediately after the events of its prequel.  This game takes everything that made Ys I good, and makes it better.  Then it takes everything that was bad about Ys I, and makes it good.  The game's progression feels so much smoother and more straight-forward than the first, and the combat system has been improved by adding magic to the mix.  Early in the game, Adol will gain access to his first spell, a chargable fireball spell, giving more choice in combat alongside the traditional bump-combat.  The boss design has also stepped up from mediocre to magnificent.  Ys II's bosses are very much up to par with the later installments of the series, and are by far the best of the 2d games.  Most bosses can only be damaged by the fireballs, giving them a shoot-em-up type feel, where you must dodge their attacks while shooting them with your charged up fireballs.  Also, unlike the first game, Adol will level up continually throughout the entire game, and experience gains are now adjusted relative to the difference in levels from enemies, helping to keep the player from being over or under leveled.  There's also lots of small touches to the game that add so much to it, such as being able to give gifts to NPCs for additional dialogues or other small secrets.  Ys II is a fantastic game and one of the best in the series, definitely standing up well alongside its 3d successors.

It's a little quirky, and weird, but once you get used to it, it's fun, because it makes for super fast battles. Even Boss Fights are generally very fast, however they aren't easy, at all. Ys 1 however, while fun, was a little bland because it was all about bumping, and had some stuff that really needed improvement. But that where we got to Ys 2.\nYs 2 improves the Bump System, adds a Magic system, and improves alot on what was in Ys 1. It was much more fun. If there is one thing to criticize in Ys 2 however, it was that it was too maze-y, without having a Mini-map. Doesn't reduce the fun much tough (except if you keep going full circle for hours like i did in some Areas xD). Ys 2 has also some nice Story as well (not to be compared with Trails, Falcom's Other Series, tough)\n\nI recommend Ys I & II Chronicles+ for:\n-Ys fans who didn't play it yet. Especiallly those who only played Origin, as it explains the events 700 years after Origin.\n-ARPG fans who love some fast Action. The game, as i said, is really fast. \n-Those who want to try something unique (I don't know any games with a fast bump system) and simple.\n-Touhou fans will love the boss battles starting from Ys 1 Final boss. Touhou fans should play this on Nightmare.\n-And even if you don't play such games, you can buy it just for the Music. Yes, it's that good.\n\nNow to go play the other Ys games i didn't play yet.", "timestamp_created": 1468115743, "timestamp_updated": 1469724670, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498992", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24115494": {"recommendationid": "24115494", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042481547", "num_games_owned": 368, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467792535}, "language": "english", "review": "I hate bats", "timestamp_created": 1467743526, "timestamp_updated": 1467743526, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497479", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24066342": {"recommendationid": "24066342", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998316515", "num_games_owned": 376, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 603, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456710317}, "language": "english", "review": "its ys, you run into shit to kill stuff\n\nwhat more do you need to know", "timestamp_created": 1467593767, "timestamp_updated": 1467593767, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.468625", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23971661": {"recommendationid": "23971661", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061198415", "num_games_owned": 393, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507593549}, "language": "english", "review": "[strike]Bumper Cars: The RPG[/strike] Ys is one of the grand-daddies of the modern JRPG with more remakes than Blade Runner. This version is based on the excellent PSP compilation that came out in 2009. It's basically Zelda with more anime and less attack button, but it's awesome nonetheless. You run into enemies to kill them, which sounds boring, but it makes backtracking and grinding far less tedious than in other RPGs, and the length of the game is fairly brief, which feels like a breath of fresh air in an RPG industry full of sprawling, 80+ hour, open-world epics. The localization work by XSeed is fantastic, and they actually licensed a really well-made fan translation of the original Japanese PC game for this release. The art design and soundtrack are godly. Especially the soundtrack, which is composed by the legendary Yuzo Koshiro, of ActRaiser and Streets of Rage fame. The story is fairly generic (this is a game from 1987, after all), but it doesn't outstay its welcome and it gets the job done. The gameplay is where Ys truly shines, though. I didn't think I'd be able to buy the idea of killing enemies by bumping into them, but it actually works and it's insanely fun. It's an arcade-y sort of RPG, and it holds up remarkably well.\n\nThis compilation contains the first two games in the series. The first one is fairly short and mainly exists to set up the story for the second game, which is more of the same, but with magic spells and bigger, more annoying mazes.

Until then I didn't really know anything about this series, I mean, I heard things about it but never paid much attention to it. At the time my friend said that YS was famous for having a notorious difficulty and he certainly wasn't lying about it! Well, after having so much fun with Origin, I've turned my attention to the first games of the series and I must confess that in the beggining I was quite disappointed with the change of the gameplay mechanics. I mean, instead of having to press any button in order to attack the foes, you'd only have to ram against them, pretty much like a football tackle. I won't deny that it took me a while to get used to it but after that everything went pretty smooth. The story is nice, the graphics are awesome and the soundtrack is insanely good (another remarkable feature of the series). Besides this, there're also the trading cards and some achievements to look for (although some of them are kinda weird to say the least). Overall, YS is definitely a great series and I absolutely recommend it to anyone who loves a good challenge (aka rage quits and shattered teeth).", "timestamp_created": 1466693229,

Essentially, at least two bosses require the kind of patience of a Jedi Master because the controls and the gameplay are so inconsistent. Still, there are plenty of laughs to here, and I liked the way Reena is built in the game.\n\nAnd yet, Ys 2 is amazing comparatively. Not only are the fighting mechanics improved, but throughout the game they change accordingly to the story. Compared to Ys 1, Ys 2's battles feel more mature and feel more satisfying in victory. Furthermore, the story is fantastic in Ys 2, with amazing detail for everyone you meet. Even the monsters you fight have things to say, and I was really impressed.\n\nYs 2 is without a doubt a masterpiece and together the story fits perfectly in a book or movie (there are some shows, but it was early Anime and not much effort is given). I loved how the game pulled me into the story, made me feel nervous and desperate as Adol races towards the top of a tower in one of the focal points of the game.\n\nLikely, you'll beat Ys 1 and call it conquered, but Ys 2 will be the game you will nostalgically remember and play again.

A simple RPG with an equally simple combat mechanic: no button-mashing or commands, just run around and bump into enemies. Direction and angle are the only factors involved.\n\nThe updated version gives this game a whole new life and feel. What was once before a barebones plot akin to the games of the late 80s (here's a paragraph of exposition, now go be a hero) is now a storyline you can follow and become involved in. Cutscenes and NPC movement add to the narrative, and a few NPCs\u2014and even some items\u2014that were once inconsequential have purpose to the story. And all the NPC now have little stories of their own. The monsters have a 'bestiary' as well now, and you're encouraged to fight them more to learn all there is to know about each one.\n\nThe graphics and sounds are both greatly improved, giving it a feel of a later-generation game. Even the simple combat is improved with the addition of sword-slashing animations and SFX, and enemy death animations. Rings can be swapped with a press of a button, you can toggle the display of stats and equipment (or turn them off completely), and there's even an option to turn off the blood effect, if you want the game to be more kid-friendly. Also, the controls are now configurable with 'righty' and 'lefty' options, one giving you the classic NumPad/arrow key movement and the other the now-standard WASD movement.\n\nThe only downside, and I hesitate to call it that, is that like many other old 'remastered' games, it removes the inherent advantage of hardware lag and makes some gameplay elements harder than the original. For this remake, it's mostly in the boss fights. While a couple of them are actually *much* easier than the original, the rest are significantly harder and rely on luck a little more than is fun. This is especially true for the final boss, which is now a 99% luck-based bullet hell DPS race with an instant death factor. To be fair, it's the same exact fight as the original, but the original's hardware limitations at least gave you a fighting chance. However, the remake has introduced difficulty levels (though personally, I can't even begin to imagine beating the final boss on Nightmare), so you can make those tough boss fights a little easier. \n\nAll in all, a great older title that paid for itself many times over in every way, and a fun nostalgia trip to boot. If you're at all a fan of the old school JRPGs, Ys Chronicles is well worth picking up.", "timestamp_created": 1457678940, "timestamp_updated": 1457678977, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21739303": {"recommendationid": "21739303", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098683023", "num_games_owned": 236, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 437, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479042338}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u542c\u8d77\u5c0f\u65f6\u5019\u719f\u6089\u7684\u97f3\u4e50~\u597d\u6000\u5ff5", "timestamp_created": 1457573618, "timestamp_updated": 1457573618, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543568", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21667509": {"recommendationid": "21667509", "author": {"steamid": "76561198178983811", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 247, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457579606}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice tale, attractive background and splendid BGM.", "timestamp_created": 1457278907, "timestamp_updated": 1457278907, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21623115": {"recommendationid": "21623115", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116714219", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 204, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493530502}, "language": "english", "review": "it's an old RPG from the 80s that's aged well.Tight af.

Also not available until Ys II[/i]\n[i]***Disclaimer 3: Fuck bump system[/i]\n\nSerious time. This series started in 1989 on the PC-Engine, predeccesor to the TurboGraphX 16. Betcha haven't heard of either of those, have you? I grew up with a TGX, but i believe the PCE was Japan-only. *ahem* Now, these aren't the original games, obviously. This is Chronicles+. The steam version of Chronicles, which was originally released on the PSP, as a remake of the originals. there's also Ys I&II Eternal, Complete, and a (Terrible) DS version: Legacy of Ys.\n\nIf you've never heard of these games before, Ys is widely-known for it's balls-hard difficulty, bosses in particular. Unfortunately, the bosses in these two games aren't very fun. In Ys I, you get a [i]VERY[/i] small window of attacking for all of them, save for two which you just have to tank all the damage for and hope you can out-damage them before they kill you.\nYs II is a bit better, though every boss [spoiler]Except for Dalles and Darm[/spoiler] Can only take damage from [spoiler]Fire magic.[/spoiler] It's about as lengthy as you'd think.\n\nLet's talk music, which is easily the best feature out of all of the Ys games. It kicks some serious ass. Give it a listen.\nYou also have diffrent options for the music, i might add. Heading into options, you can swap out your reorchestrated masterpieces for... er... the original PC-88 chiptunes? And the soundtrack from Complete, which is like a remix of the chiptunes, and actually sounds good! Like it came right out of a good SNES game.\n\nBut gameplay, oh boy...\nIf you're playing the series in chronological order and you just came here from Origins? Prepare for an ass-whoopin', sonny. These games use a \"Bump System\". Which you will hate. It goes against all logic you'd expect of a gamer and it'll screw with your head by the end of this.\nSo what [i]IS[/i] this bump system? Well, you attack enemies by running into them. But if you don't do it off-center, you'll take damage. There is no attack button. You swing your sword automatically. This is PAINFULLY bad, especially in Ys I, as you have no other means of attacking. It's a big learning curve, but it's actually quite fun when you get used to it. When i moved to Oath in Felghana, i actually subconsciously started running into enemies.\nYs II handles this [i]MUCH, Much better.[/i] For starters: You only take damage if the enemy is facing right at you when you hit them. this is a GODSEND. You can also attack diagonally, which is reaaaally helpful, and makes the system a lot more fun. There's also Magic, if you hate the bump system as much as i do. Fire magic, Light magic, Return magic, Alter magic, Time magic, and Shield magic.\n\nThe story is also great! Though there are a few plotholes if you've played Origin.\n[spoiler]\u2022Gee, Darm tower sure has changed drastically in the past 700 years even though no one can go inside.[/spoiler]\n[spoiler]\u2022So apparently, the whole land of Ys went up to the sky, and not just Solomon Shrine? I thought the land of Esteria WAS Ys.[/spoiler]\n[spoiler]\u2022No mention of Hugo or Yunica. Cain being Darm isn't adressed either. *sigh.*[/spoiler]\nAs well as others that i either can't recall or won't bring up here.\n\nOverall, these are great games. I reccomend giving them a shot when they go on sale, but if you're in it for the story, play Origin first.\n\n[b]YS I: 5.5/10[/b]\n[b]YS II: 7/10[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1456565095, "timestamp_updated": 1456565312, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518594", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21433594": {"recommendationid": "21433594", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984313211", "num_games_owned": 2326, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 401, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456354188}, "language": "english", "review": "Classic game with stress-free combat system - just BUMP into enemies to damage them.

Dessa vez a trama se passa em Esteria, e nosso protagonista Adol Christin decide se aventurar nesse pa\u00eds em busca de respostas sobre por que esse lugar ficou amaldi\u00e7oado.\nBom, primeiro os pontos fracos:\n>[b]Dificuldade desequilibrada:[/b] Durante o jogo padr\u00e3o, \u00e9 um desafio bem mediano, nada muito imposs\u00edvel nem nada muito f\u00e1cil. Assim como o jogo inteiro, precisa prestar aten\u00e7\u00e3o nos inimigos, um simples descuido pode fazer com que um esqueleto de armadura te prenda de jeito numa parede e te massacre sem d\u00f3. O jogo usa o sistema de colis\u00e3o, algo que n\u00e3o foram muitos os Action RPGs que usaram. Por\u00e9m em Ys I Chronicles requer que o jogador saiba bem utiliza-lo. E tipo, muito bem. [b]Mas Kadox, e os bosses??[/b] A\u00ed que t\u00e1 o fator da dificuldade desequilibrada: ou os bosses s\u00e3o chatos e demorados, ou os bosses s\u00e3o uma piada de t\u00e3o f\u00e1cil, ou s\u00e3o praticamente imposs\u00edveis de t\u00e3o dif\u00edceis (e numa dificuldade injusta ainda por cima). S\u00e3o apenas 7 bosses, por\u00e9m eles ser\u00e3o experi\u00eancias \u00fanicas \u2014 nada agrad\u00e1veis, mas \u00fanicas (talvez masoquistas jogadores de danmaku como eu gostem de enfrentar o \u00faltimo chefe xD). E esse \u00e9 o motivo pelo qual n\u00e3o consegui uma conquista que faltava para colocar Ys I Chronicles na minha lista de jogos completados: o Time Attack. \u00c9 frustrante demais passar dois chefes extremamente chatos e quatro chefes extremamente rid\u00edculos, para chegar aquele Dark Fact e se vc n\u00e3o tiver [strike]sorte[/strike] habilidade e memoriza\u00e7\u00e3o a niveis sobrehumanos, vira um \"tentativa e erro\";\n>[b]Level Up falho:[/b] O limite \u00e9 o n\u00edvel 10, e \u00e9 poss\u00edvel ating\u00ed-lo antes mesmo de enfrentar o terceiro boss, ou seja, metade do jogo. Talvez deixe a dificuldade mais arcade dependendo unicamente da sua habilidade (o que eu gosto), mas como \u00e9 um RPG...\n\nAgora os pontos positivos:\n>[b]Jogabilidade din\u00e2mica e empolgante:[/b] Como falei acima, usa o sistema de colis\u00e3o, que consiste em voc\u00ea literalmente ir para cima do inimigo numa posi\u00e7\u00e3o certa para mete-lhe dano (assim que sair da cidade no come\u00e7o do jogo, aparece uma mensagem explicando o sistema de colis\u00e3o). A jogabilidade \u00e9 simples, flu\u00edda, din\u00e2mica, empolga, \u00e9 incr\u00edvel;\n>[b]Trilha sonora de arrepiar:[/b] N\u00e3o \u00e9 coincid\u00eancia Nihom Falcom possuir a sua pr\u00f3pria banda e ainda ter recebido v\u00e1rios pr\u00eamios ao longo desses trinta anos de exist\u00eancia. Com a majestosa composi\u00e7\u00e3o de Yuzo Koshiro e o arranjo fenomenal da Falcom Jdk, criou essa obra de arte que \u00e9 a trilha sonora de Ys Chronicles. Absolutamente nada a reclamar, muito pelo contr\u00e1rio, tenho muito a aplaudir;\n>[b]Gr\u00e1ficos simp\u00e1ticos com ar de retr\u00f4:[/b] Se voc\u00ea procura gr\u00e1ficos de \u00faltima gera\u00e7\u00e3o, ent\u00e3o Ys n\u00e3o \u00e9 para voc\u00ea em nenhuma hip\u00f3tese. A s\u00e9rie Ys \u00e9 retr\u00f4 em toda sua linhagem (bem, temos que esperar o Ys VIII sair pra ver se vai ter um ar totalmente moderno :v), e esse aqui n\u00e3o \u00e9 uma exce\u00e7\u00e3o. Mas caso voc\u00ea ainda curta gr\u00e1ficos 2D retr\u00f4, fique feliz: Ys Chronicles n\u00e3o o decepcionar\u00e1 de maneira alguma. Sprites bonitos (sem contar as artworks), cen\u00e1rios bem feitos, inimigos interessantes, etc.\n>[b]Personagens carism\u00e1ticos:[/b] todos os personagens do jogo, NPCs inclusive, possuem uma personalidade \u00fanica, que te faz vontade de ler todos os di\u00e1logos e interagir ao m\u00e1ximo com todo mundo. S\u00e3o bastante envolventes, e tu consegue se identificar com o elenco.\n\n[b]Nota final:[/b] 8,7/10. excelente jogo, din\u00e2mico e intuitivo, com trilha sonora divina, por\u00e9m possui o terr\u00edvel defeito da dificuldade idiota e o level up de enfeite. Mas ainda assim vale a pena. T\u00edtulo obrigat\u00f3rio para quem \u00e9 f\u00e3 de Ys que nem eu e quer saber de detalhes importantes da hist\u00f3ria de todos os t\u00edtulos da s\u00e9rie, e um t\u00edtulo \"ame ou odeie\" para quem for come\u00e7ar a s\u00e9rie por esse (o que n\u00e3o \u00e9 recomend\u00e1vel, eu mesmo comecei pelo Ys Seven de PSP), embora ainda seja interessante v\u00ea-lo mesmo assim.\n\n\nYs II, uma sequ\u00eancia extremamente direta do Ys I (\u00e9 extremamente recomend\u00e1vel tamb\u00e9m voc\u00ea ter jogado o Ys I em qualquer hip\u00f3tese devido a hist\u00f3ria), que dessa vez se passa na ilha flutuante de Ys. Seu objetivo agora \u00e9 desvendar os mist\u00e9rios do santu\u00e1rio de Salomon e o segredo das Deusas g\u00eameas, al\u00e9m de dar um fim nesses dem\u00f4nios de vez.\nAmbos Ys I quanto Ys II s\u00e3o muito semelhantes, mesmo motor de gr\u00e1ficos, ainda possui o sistema de colis\u00e3o, fato \u00e9 que devido a isso eles s\u00e3o vendidos juntos em colet\u00e2neas, sendo essa da Steam apenas mais uma :v por\u00e9m h\u00e1 uma grande inova\u00e7\u00e3o: magias. Ao longo do jogo vamos encontrando magias para nos auxiliar em batalha ou at\u00e9 mesmo prosseguir na aventura.\nAgora os bosses est\u00e3o muito mais equilibrados, nenhum ridicularmente f\u00e1cil, impossivelmente dif\u00edcil ou extremamente chato. Todos d\u00e3o um bom desafio na base do shoot'em up usando a magia de fogo \u2014 sim, Ys \u00e9 uma s\u00e9rie que mistura shooting game com Action RPG, s\u00f3 prestar aten\u00e7\u00e3o no final boss do I e em boa parte dos bosses do II, e nos inimigos em geral do resto da s\u00e9rie. Mas n\u00e3o pense errado, os dois \u00faltimos bosses a gente enfrenta no mesmo estilo do Ys I, usando o bom e velho sistema de colis\u00e3o.\nTrilha sonora ainda uma master piece, nada a reclamar, apenas amar sz\nE creio ser o detalhe mais importante: um sistema de level up bem feito! Tendo um limite bem maior que o do Ys I, \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio fazer grind em certos trechos. Um elemento caracter\u00edstico de qualquer RPG finalmente bem executado!\n\n[b]Nota final:[/b] 9,8/10. Por inovar e arriscar bastante misturando de vez shoot'em up com action RPG, entendo que talvez seja um pouco desagrad\u00e1vel para quem apenas procura um RPG aleat\u00f3rio para se divertir. Al\u00e9m de ser consideravelmente curto para seu g\u00eanero (para mim isso \u00e9 um b\u00f4nus e tanto, prefiro muito mais jogos curtos), 10 a 20 horas cada gameplay. Por\u00e9m nada disso anula suas qualidades: ainda \u00e9 um excelente jogo, aclamado e com raz\u00e3o. Como falei, t\u00edtulo obrigat\u00f3rio para quem \u00e9 f\u00e3 da franquia e t\u00edtulo recomendado n\u00e3o apenas para conhecer, mas para jogar tamb\u00e9m.", "timestamp_created": 1455265876, "timestamp_updated": 1455266143, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.614035", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21112975": {"recommendationid": "21112975", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077849529", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 468, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449870193}, "language": "french", "review": "Simple et efficace.\nIci pas de long dialogues, mais beaucoup d'actions.\nLe jeu est court, son sc\u00e9nario est tr\u00e8s basique mais on s'ennuie pas.\nYs est parfois difficile, frustrant pour certains et amusant pour d'autres dans tous les cas quand on bat un bosse, on est heureux.

The graphics and videos all transcribed from their original version perfectly, and the quests are in full-fledged happiness. The only problem I ran into was attempting to find out where all the keys went. \nThe first time I played Y's: The Vanished Omen, I was 10. I had hand-drawn maps for all the various caves and towers to help find my way around, and small hints to remember to grab the wings or mirror this boss... It was a time before people sent cat pictures to each other and spent days arguing over who obtained the greatest HP in SWAG.\nAdol's questing also taught young me something else: that everyone in the village has a voice in the storyline, and even if people aren't the main character, sometimes the least important character offers the most information - and it's best to treat people equally.\nThankfully, the conversion process from Falcom kept 95% of the voices and music (oh man, the MUSIC...) in tact, and simply walking around the fields and various cities brought me back to a much simpler time in my own life, when rushing home off the bus and staring at a 13\" color Quasar television on a rickety pile of Yellow Pages was the absolute highlight of the week. \nGames like Y's, Phantasy Star, Warhammer, and Final Fantasy may still have influential portions in titles today, but nothing like the shape in the designing of those of us who played them until mom flicked the power breaker in the kitchen.\nSave often.

As I already played Ys Origin (that I really liked) I expected having similar fun, though I knew from beginning that this games have different (unique) combat system.\n\nAll combat is done by bumping to your enemies - you bump his back/shoulder, you deal damage. If you bump your enemy directly in the front, he'll also deal some damage back to you. It's not complex at all, it's pretty much undemanding. But here comes the right question - Is it fun?\n\nWell, it might be fun for the first time, but after you beat tenth NPC? What about hundredth NPC? If you are going to play Ys I & II, plan for grinding. There's a lot of grinding for experience and gold with obsolete formula - if NPCs around you are too hard to beat, return to previous zone and kill as many enemies as you can. Once you get stronger, get back to the following zone and beat everybody, thinking about how easy it is.\n\nThe game even encourages you so hardly to grind enemies that you'll clearly see that any NPC you kill is respawned in few seconds.

Ein wenig stumpf, aber ich denke es ist gut so. \n\nIm Laufe des Spiels findet man eine vielzahl von Items, die man an bestimmten Orten benutzen muss, die im Kampf helfen oder an NPCs weitergegeben werden m\u00fcssen. Dazu auch Waffen, R\u00fcstungen, Schilde und nat\u00fcrlich magische Ringe. Jeweils 5 kann man im Spiel finden. W\u00e4hrend Ausr\u00fcstung einfach nur st\u00e4rker wird und in Einzelf\u00e4llen Plotrelevant ist, helfen einem Ringe, indem sie entweder die Angriffskraft verdoppeln, erlittenen Schaden halbieren oder die Geschwindigkeit der Gegner (nicht von Bossen) verringern. Auch hier wurde auf Einfachheit gesetzt, mit Erfolg wie ich denke, \n\n[b]Spielfluss[/b]\nHier kommen wir zum gro\u00dfen Manko des Spiels. Einen Roten Faden gibt es zwar, man wei\u00df wo man was als n\u00e4chstes tun muss, allerdings wird es einem wirklich leicht gemacht, plottrelevante Items zu \u00fcbersehen und in dem Fall grast man entweder alles nochmal ab oder man schl\u00e4gt in der L\u00f6sung nach (Google ist dein Freund). An anderer Stelle hat man passagen, wo man eine S\u00e4ule, die genau so aussieht, wie alle anderen im Bereich mit einem Hammer zerbr\u00f6seln muss, allerdings ist nur diese eine S\u00e4ule zerst\u00f6rbar. An anderer Stelle befindet sich in einem Monstervers\u00e4uchten Stockwerk eine Geheimt\u00fcr, die man nur dann und wirklich nur dann findet, wenn man eine Maske anlegt, die Geheimnisse aufdeckt, aber eben Gegner verbirgt (was ich nicht seh\u00b4 tut auch weh). Im Herkunftsland Japan kommt das vlt gut an, ich pers\u00f6nlich finde es allerdings st\u00f6rend.\n\n[b]Schwierigkeitsgrad[/b]\nWer \"Dark Souls\" f\u00fcr kacken schwer h\u00e4lt, wird sich hier umgucken. Zumindest bei einigen Stellen.\nSchon auf normal verlangen einem manche Bosse (vorallem der letzte) wirklich einiges ab und mit grinden kommt man nicht weit, denn das Levelcap liegt bei 10. Ja richt, Zehn!! Alles in allem nicht tragisch, da man diesen Level erst am Ende also im letzten Dungeon erreicht, wenn man nicht gerade grindet und ich denke wirklich dass es so ein knappes Levelcap erst ist, das ein Spiel wirklich fordernd macht, da man nicht wie in DarkSouls Stundenlang grinden kann und dann den Boss mit \u00fcberleveltem Status wegputzt. Hier braucht es gewisses K\u00f6nnen und wem \"Normal\" zu leicht ist, der kann noch \"Schwer\" und \"Alptraum\" versuchen. Wer ein \"schweres\" Spiel sucht, der hat es gefunden. Ist zumindest meine Affassung.\n\nYS2 empfand ich insgesammt als einfacher als den ersten Teil.\n\n\n[b]Grafik[/b]\nDie Grafik vom Spiel selbst ist gut, vorallem wenn man Retrofan ist.

Keep in mind that this is based on a game released in 1989, so some of the system's features are strictly bare-bones, but the remake has been upgraded in some aspects to make the game a much smoother experience than the '89 original. Boss encounters are a bit hit and miss, and usually rely on you being a certain level or having certain equipment to beat, but are enjoyable all in all. Not especially tough, but they can still be challenging enough for you to have to retry a few times before you understand the patterns. I played it on normal, but if you find the game too easy there is always the option to try a higher difficulty setting.\n\nThe music is great, also, as is usually the case with Falcom games. Also, there's an option available to switch to/from classic and remade tunes, which is always nice.\n\nThe minimalistic story is interesting and Adol Christin is a cool protagonist, but don't expect a convoluted epic; this is a standard tale of a dualistic nature, with good and evil, dark and light. \n\nProgression through the game is generally uncomplicated, and the areas you are supposed to visit are few and easy to find, but the game can, however, be a bit cryptic when it comes to what you're supposed to do next, so if you're a newcomer you should expect to get stuck a few times before you are able to proceed. That said, the game is pretty short, short enough to be suited for speedrunning and such, for sure. \n\nI mostly play it for nostalgic reasons nowadays, but, nostalgia aside, it is still a pretty good game and still holds up fairly well even today. Thoroughly recommended.\n\nYs I score\n7.5 / 10\n\nYs II\n\nYs II continues the adventure of Adol Christin and concludes the story of Ys I & II Chronicles. \n\nThe bump system is back, and not much has changed. Included, however, is the ability to use magic, which have a variety of uses ranging from an attack spell to spells useful to progress the game. Basically, if you liked the first game's system, there should be no reason for you to disike the one in Ys II, as they are pretty similar. Boss encounters are a bit more challenging than the ones in Ys I, but sometimes it comes down to just finding out cerrtain gimmicks in order to beat them.\n\nThe music is at least as good as in Ys I and has some of my favorite Ys tunes of all time. Definitely one of the highlights of the game, and the abiity to switch between classic and remade tunes is a plus. Top notch.\n\nThe story in general has a bit more depth than Ys I, and is less melancholic, but all in all it's still pretty simple. There are some surprises down the road to make it interesting though, so it is fairly well conceived, although I don't feel like the villains are as intimidating as the ones in Ys I. I liked the first one better, but it's all a matter of taste. \n\nProgression through the game is fairly linear, but there were a number of times where I got stuck and didn't know how to proceed. It usually boils down to not having the required items or paying close attention to your environments, though, so if you can't proceed there is probably something you've missed an area accessible to you at your current point in the adventure. The game is probably twice as long as Ys I, but can be completed fairly quickly if you know what to do and where to go.\n\nRecommended.\n\nYs II score\n8 / 10\n\nScore for both\n8 / 10", "timestamp_created": 1453175532, "timestamp_updated": 1453178533, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20577939": {"recommendationid": "20577939", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004155257", "num_games_owned": 427, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 393, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452428233}, "language": "english", "review": "(Ys1) The game is really difficult for stupid reasons; but it saves itself by offering up a decent story, and lead ins  to the sequel. It suffers from the lack of tangible enemy ai that just wander around the area beyond the few that are sentient enough to know that Adol exists. Bosses are the big issue with this game since it's more RNG than skill based, if you mess up while attacking, you simply got a bad pattern if you're competent in using the awkward bumping system to attack. Despite it's shortcomings, it's oddly fun to redo fights over and over again because the save system is so flexible. You will however be unable to Save during boss fights... I can't recommend the first one because it is simply not worth playing if you're not looking to play the entire series. It's very short in length, and is very Vague at times as to what to do during your progression of the game. \n\n(Ys2) This is where it starts to actually get good beyond the soundtrack or updated graphics of this Remake. This time around you actually have a competent way with dealing with bosses and enemies using the magic system. Enemies also seem to have fair to competent ai, so you will be challenged in your ability to either use the bump system or magic to defeat them.

Vu que le jeu original Ys 1 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 assez critiqu\u00e9, et semblait assez lent, j'\u00e9tais un peu m\u00e9fiant, en plus un remake PC adapt\u00e9 d'un remake sur PSP ... mais bon je me suis lanc\u00e9 et ... Wow ! Pour des jeux de 1988/89... c'est vraiment r\u00e9ussi ! Attention, c'est du A-PRG oldschool, du vrai, du pur.\n\nGameplay\nLe syst\u00e8me de combat, le \"Bump System\" me semblait trop simpliste et juste adapt\u00e9 \u00e0 une manette 2 boutons d'anciennes consoles, c'est ce qui me faisait le plus peur en fait. Mais en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 c'est juste g\u00e9nialement simple et ultra efficace en fait ! Le but est de rentrer dans les mobs pas en face d'eux, donc un peu d\u00e9call\u00e9 sur les cot\u00e9s, c'est pas si facile qu'il n'y parait vu que le jeu est bien rapide sur cette version, du coup on a un APRG qui frise la perfection niveau dynamisme/enchainement de mob/progression, les seuls temps morts sont les erreurs du joueur le for\u00e7ant \u00e0 se heal. Dans Ys 1, \u00e7a devient assez vite redondant et on essaye vite d'esquiver les mobs les plus chiants car le jeu nous met tr\u00e8s vite level max, max gold, et \u00e0 part le HF du collectionneur d'infos sur les mobs, les combats ont peut d'int\u00e9r\u00eat contre les mobs classiques au final. Dans Ys 2 les d\u00e9fauts du Bump System sont corrig\u00e9s et \u00e7a frise la perfection. La magie fait son introduction, sans \u00eatre cheat\u00e9e (exept\u00e9 le dernier spell qui ne servira que sur le last boss et fera de vous un gros fragile). Du coup la monotonie des combats n'est plus, de m\u00eame que les allers-retours \u00e0 la con entre les maps. De plus il est possible et m\u00eame carr\u00e9ment encourag\u00e9 texto par l'aide du jeu, d'attaquer les mobs en diagonales, du coup c'est plus facile niveau combat et encore plus dynamique, en revanche les mobs ne se contentent plus de vous foncer dessus aussi, mais utilisent d\u00e9sormais des attaques sp\u00e9ciales en plus !\nJe ne comprends pas pourquoi on a jamais repiqu\u00e9 ce syst\u00e8me de combat sur d'autres jeux tellement il est efficace ici !?!\n\nNiveau difficult\u00e9\nC'est parfaitement dos\u00e9. Les premi\u00e8res difficult\u00e9s sont easy, et le mode Nightmare est un v\u00e9ritable challenge pour celui qui aime \u00e7a. C'est du tout bon, except\u00e9 quelques \u00e9l\u00e9ments pour Ys 1 : le 3\u00e8me boss est LE CANCER du random et de la luck, et le dernier boss c'est \u00e0 peu pr\u00eat la m\u00eame chose mais en moins inf\u00e2me. Une fois qu'on a pig\u00e9 le truc c'est bon, mais il reste quand m\u00eame une part de chance ind\u00e9niable qui fait transpirer de l'anus tant que le combat contre ces deux boss n'est pas termin\u00e9.\n\nBande son\nCa d\u00e9chire FFS !!! Falcom, go release la bande son sur Steam !!!\u00a7\u00a7!\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7!!\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7\nLe jeu est dispo avec les musiques remasteris\u00e9es de la version PSP qui sont tr\u00e8s rock, mais il est possible de switch pour celles de la version PC-Engine !!!!! (Et idem pour les artworks !!) C'est un \u00e9norme cadeau pour les fans ! On ne peut que remercier Falcom pour ce fan service servi sur un plateau en or.\nLa Falcom Sound Team JDK est juste une des meilleure team de musicos' pour les jeux \u00e0 mes yeux, et cette BO confirme cel\u00e0.\n\nGraphismes\nC'est du RPG old school pure souche. Donc en 2D style SNES/PSX avec am\u00e9lios diverses + artworks style mangas 90's/2000. Perso j'accroche. Comme dit pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment les fans de la premi\u00e8re heure appr\u00e9cieront que les artworks de la version PCE soient disponibles !\n\nSc\u00e9nario\nPour Ys 1 heuuu bon.... Le sc\u00e9nario principal est digne de celui de tout RPG des ann\u00e9es 80/90. On se retrouve avec le paysan du coin qui doit sauver le monde en gros. Ici on \u00e0 Adol Christin qui voit une \u00eele entour\u00e9e d'une temp\u00eate monstruseuse, qui est infest\u00e9e par le Mal depuis peu, mais il sent tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s fort qu'il doit quand m\u00eame s'y rendre...\nLe background derri\u00e8re la s\u00e9rie est tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressant par contre, et dans cet \u00e9pisode, c'est surtout la relation entre les personnages [spoiler]d'Adol et de Feena[/spoiler] qui est int\u00e9ressante. Dans Y's 2 le sc\u00e9nario est meilleur sans transcander pour autant, et le background est toujours aussi int\u00e9ressant.\n\nAu final\nCe que j'ai vraiment appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 avec ces jeux, c'est le feeling ressenti au jouant. Le dynamisme est quasi-irr\u00e9prochable, les interractions avec les PNJ sont tr\u00e8s sympatiques. Dans Ys 1 l'ambiance est assez inssouciante et plut\u00f4t dynamique grace \u00e0 la musique \u00e9norme de la bande son du jeu. L'ambiance dans Ys 2 prend une tournure bien plus dramatique et ce d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but du jeu... C'est bien plus prenant et s\u00e9rieux du coup, avec drama, feels & chills.\nJ'appr\u00e9cie \u00e9norm\u00e9ment le cot\u00e9 brise-code de cet opus ou on \u00e0 pas forc\u00e9ment un happy-end pour tout le monde o\u00f9 tout finit bien sans avoir eu de casse... [spoiler]Feeeeeenaaaaaaaaa, noooooooooon.... :'( [spoiler]\n\nJe pense au final que Falcom \u00e0 r\u00e9ussi un excellent coup.

Este es un juego que recomendaria a aquellos que han jugado algun Ys en el pasado y desean ver los origenes de esta saga.\n\nLa historia es bastante sencilla, Adol naufraga tratando de llegar a Esteria, es rescatado y ahora le toca salvar estas islas del mal que yace en ellas, todo muy sencillo, pero los Ys no suelen tener plots grandilocuentes y este bien que cumple su funcion.\n\nUna vez empiece nuestra aventura podremos ver, o mejor dicho, escuchar, lo hermosa que es la m\u00fasica, uno de los puntos m\u00e1s fuertes en el departamento tecnico de este juego, la m\u00fasica no decepciona y nos acompa\u00f1a en las, mas o menos 5-7 horas que puede durar esta aventura.\n\nSi tuviese que ponerle alguna pega a este juego es la curva de dificultad: El nivel m\u00e1ximo del juego es 10, y antes de llegar a ese nivel, todo es muy f\u00e1cil, no obstante, llegas al nivel m\u00e1ximo a mitades del juego y este ESPERA que seas ese nivel. El tercer boss te exige tener nivel maximo y el mejor equipamiento disponible del juego, y a partir de ah\u00ed todo se vuelve m\u00e1s dificil pero tu no te vuelves m\u00e1s poderoso a pesar de que aun queda la mitad del juego.\n\nQue las Diosas de Ys se apiaden de vuestra alma si intentais jugar el juego en Nightmare, el final boss en dificultad m\u00e1xima es es RIDICULO.\n\nEn lineas generales, Ys I es un juego que tiene su encanto y que recomendaria quien busque una experiencia renovada de un clasico o a un fan de los juegos de Ys para ver sus origenes, el juego tiene sus defectos, pero es normal teniendo en cuenta la edad de este. \n\nEste remake demuestra que, si bien Ys I esta lejos de ser el mejor Ys, es un juego que a envejecido bien, y siendo que el original es de 1987, es todo un logro del que pocos pueden presumir.\n\n\n\nYs II\n\nYs II es la secuela directa de Ys I, donde coge todo lo que el original hizo bien, y lo mantuvo. Pero ademas de eso, todos los problemas que tenia Ys I (Principalmente, de balanceo) los arregla.\n\nEn Ys II, el nivel m\u00e1ximo es 55, con lo que no sufre del problema del original de \"llegar a nivel maximo a mitad del juego), siempre estaras a un nivel aceptable para la situacion en la que te encuentras.\n\nLa dificultad de este juego (En Nightmare) diria que es m\u00e1s elevada que la del juego original, pero tambien es mucho m\u00e1s justa, no hay locuras como las de Dark Fact, pero los jefes ponen un buen desafio. Todas las peleas contra jefes se basan en proyectiles, como lo fue la pelea contra Dark Fact. La gracia esta en que, en dificultades bajas, como en normal, la cantidad de proyectiles que disparan es baja, mientras que en Nightmare son JODIDOS DANMAKUS. Nunca se sienten tan sobrecogedores como para decir \"Eso es imposible de esquivar\", pero si que te obligaran a estar siempre alerta.\n\nEntre las mejoras que hizo del original y el que sea la secuela directa, Ys II es la mejor forma de terminar la duologia de Ys Chronicles, la saga original de Ys. Nuevamente, es un juego viejo con un sistema de combate obsoleto, pero merece la pena viajar a los origenes de esta saga, los juegos merecen la pena.", "timestamp_created": 1452441744, "timestamp_updated": 1453142987, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20379496": {"recommendationid": "20379496", "author": {"steamid": "76561198204690079", "num_games_owned": 170, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 716, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462796582}, "language": "english", "review": "Bumper cars the game\n\n\nEdit: Lilia is the best waifu", "timestamp_created": 1452189733, "timestamp_updated": 1459981727, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20368635": {"recommendationid": "20368635", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067476441", "num_games_owned": 1105, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 893, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452233223}, "language": "english", "review": "I have been intrigued about these games since one of the re releases that came out in the early 2000's.

You must also sniff every girl who needs rescuing and frolic in their beds when they aren't looking... Also one boy became the target this one time. >_>\n\n[Difficulty - good]: I've heard myths of the higher difficulty levels of some bosses, you won't be disappointed if you want a challenge. For those with poor reflexes, easy is totally playable and you shouldn't have too much trouble even on the most difficult bosses.\n\n[Story - good]: Ys I: Climb a tower and leave nothing alive as you climb to the top. Ys II: Climb a variety of places while leaving nothing alive[spoiler]fireballs now included[/spoiler]. It may be short and simplistic but it's still well-written and easy to understand...besides, this is an action rpg and you're really here to kill things. :)\n\n[Combat - excellent]: It's really a pity that Ys I & II are the only games to ever use the \"bump\" mechanic because I ended up having a blast using it. Ys I did not have magic but Ys II fixes that and polishes the \"bump\" mechanics a little more to make it even better. You can't go wrong with combat that allows you to literally plow through enemies and thus never have to stop moving to make for a very fast progression through the lands and dungeons.\n\n[Graphics - good]: Though everyone has preferences for graphics, I'm in the retro crowd and prefer older games. Besides that, there's a lot of animation and detail packed into these games and they even included the option of the original character art or a newer style AND it has some rather beautiful cutscenes.\n\n[Music - head bangingly awesome]: Seriously, you will get at least one song in either of these games stuck in your head at some point. They offer 3 variations of the musical score including the original score. I ended using the most recent variation which is orchestral and rock which was really well done.\n\n[Replay - average]:  It would actually be bad but given the challenges some like to do on higher difficulties, there's the option to make it last longer. It does have amusing achievements though.\n\n[Overall - good]: Ys I & II's combined playtime is about 10 hours on easy, give or take idling time. I had a lot of fun with both and really hope more Ys games will make it to Steam one day...

[/h1]\n\n The amount of times these games have been redone is truly mindblowing, but then again Ys has been around since 1987. What we have here is an enhanced port of a PSP port of an enhanced edition of a windows remake of a combined turbografx-16/pc-engine remake of a pair of games on an ancient japanese pc. Rolls right off the tongue and I'm not even gonna get into how many ports the original games themselves got. I'm fairly certain this won't be the last remake either.\n\nNow that I got that bit of nonsence out of the way let's move on to the review.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\n\n The island of Esteria which is known for its trade in silver has been cut off from mainland Europe by a phenomenon called the stormwall for the last six months. Enter Adol Christin, a 17 year old young man with a passion for adventure and measuring women [spoiler]and little boys[/spoiler]. He sails to Esteria from the port town of Promarock (or Promalock depending on the translation) but his boat gets caught in the stormwall and he shipwrecks off the coast of the island. He is found by villagers and taken to the nearby town's clinic. This is where the game starts. From here on cue battles with monsters, ancient civilizations, saving the world and the usual business when it comes to JRPGs.\n\n Overall the story is not a groundbreaking epic that will shock you with amazing plot twists, but it is really well written and will suck you in if you take your time with it. Even the most trivial NPCs usually have something new and interesting to say as the story moves forward (this is something Nihon Falcom does a lot). Ys II takes place immediately after Ys I, so my recommendation is to play both games in one go. There's also a bit of humour added by XSEED which fits quite well since it's put in the right places and doesn't feel forced.\n\n[h1] muh grafix [/h1]\n\n If you've read the nonsence at the top or looked at the screenshots you should already know what to expect in terms of graphics. Enhancements or not you're looking at slightly improved visuals from a 1997 Windows game. That said Chronicles does have a nifty feature where you can pick from the original PC interface or the PSP one as well as picking between the original late 90s anime artstyle or the more modern artstyle for the character portraits. That's all there is to be said about the graphics, wether you like them or not is up to you, but I wouldn't judge the game based on looks alone.\n\nPS: There is no FPS lock, so stop whining, you babies.\n\n[h1] Music [/h1]\n\n[b] INCREDIBLY BIASED OPINION INCOMING [/b] \n As far as I'm concerned Falcom Sound Team JDK are musical gods and I'll fight anyone who says otherwise.\n\n With that out of the way, you have the option to pick from three different renditions of the soundtrack in the options menu (or just mod in whatever the hell you want because PC). The original PC-88 soundtrack from 1987, the PC Complete soundtrack from 2001 or the new Chronicles soundtrack from 2009. All three are great, though which one you go with depends on you. My personal recommendation is to mod the turbografx-16 audio in and enjoy one of the best versions of the soundtrack (why they never bothered to use it again is beyond me), some dude posted a mod for both games on the forums, you can find it if you look around.\n\nLong story short: Music is 11/10.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\n \n While the rest of the games in the series are more traditional in terms of combat, Ys I & II are more of an acquired taste. The reason for this is because unlike most action RPGs at the time here you don't press a button to attack enemies. Instead you ram into them (slightly off center), that's it. In Ys II you get some spells which allow you to attack at range but the meat of the combat is once again dryhumping things with your sword (hence why a lot of people call it the bumper cars system).\n\n Personally I wouldn't call the lack of an attack button a bad thing since in this case it makes the combat LIGHTNING FAST. I'm not even joking, you'll be murdering masses of monsters with such rapid speed it'll make someone like Guts look like a pansy in comparison (you don't mess with Adol Christin, the guy's a walking apocalypse). It also makes the usual grinding in JRPGs almost nonexistant which for me is a plus. I don't hate it mind you, but it gets stale fast if the game relies on it too much. Anyway on normal difficulty you'll be swimming in cash and exp before you know it.\n\n The boss battles are the highlight of the series. In Ys I they are mostly hit and miss. Some are really good and there are others like Vagullion aka THAT !@(*$^ BAT and Dark Fact known as Dalk Fukt in Japan (if you manage beat him on nightmare mode you have the full right to rub that in everyone's faces because you earned it). Things get much better in Ys II, but it's also the better game. Ys I is essentially a glorified prologue but you shouldn't skip it since you'll miss half the story.\n\n[h1] TL;DR [/h1]\n\n This is where the Ys series started from. The games are great but they are not for everyone.

I figured that since they had high ratings they were some sort of hipster rpg games that you've never heard about.\n\nBoy was I wrong. I played through the first one in one sitting on normal. The next day, I played it on easy to get missed achievements. Next day, started playing II. Next day (today) started the first one on Nightmare.\n\nThey're simple games. You bump, you gain exp, you do a few quests, and you die. On nightmare. You die a lot. On easy it's a breeze, don't stand in fire and all will fall before you. But they're so goddamn addictive! I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a game as much as these two. First time runners: unless you're looking for something to just kill some time start with *at least* normal. Skipped from normal to NM so can't tell how the game is with hard, but I doubt it's anything you can't overcome.\n\nAnd the best thing. The goddamn soundtrack. I've had my share of game OSTs but this went to the #1. Even now I'm listening to soundtrack on Youtube. It's just unbelievable. Well, some might disagree.\n\nWhy you should buy this game? Great arpg, simple but addicting combat, bosses are actually bosses (the bat doesn't exist) and the challenge is always there, but almost always it feels fair.\n\nWhy you shouldn't? If you're looking for a deep story, character customization and/or a long playthrough following a single campaign, this isn't propably your ideal game.

Rarely have I felt so much satisfaction after defeating a video game boss (specially the last one of Ys I, which I can proudly say that I defeated on nightmare - and which I am ashamed to say, took me a few days to do).\n  Needless to say, this is not for everyone: you will see the game over screen a lot. But the game is not unfair, every boss has a weakness or pattern of attack that can be exploited (though it still requires some skill to do so).\n  The other strong point os this game is the soundtrack, the developers really put their efforts in it. The soundtrack of Ys is, by far, my favorite.\n  After playing this game I became a fan of the series. The mechanics of the game changed a lot over the years, but the difficulty, awesome music and memorable boss fights remained. If you are a hardcore RPG gamer, give this one a try (or try the prequel, Ys Origin, it has a more modern action/RPG type of gameplay that became a standard of the series).", "timestamp_created": 1442527217, "timestamp_updated": 1442527217, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.648642", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17976872": {"recommendationid": "17976872", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099769887", "num_games_owned": 229, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 894, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457651182}, "language": "english", "review": "The game's config gave me a desktop Waifu.", "timestamp_created": 1441933593, "timestamp_updated": 1441933593, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17976104": {"recommendationid": "17976104", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993376667", "num_games_owned": 637, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 590, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442970286}, "language": "english", "review": "YS II is a fantastic game despite a few rough spots (Escort Mission, cough cough) but overall is a classic, well designed Jrpg that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys the genre. True the combat can take adjusting to, but it has it's charm - which is why it wasn't updated. YS II is balanced and well made, and therefore not hampered by the antiquated combat system. \n\nYS I is also a great game. To a point. There will come a point in the later game, where you will encounter a boss. We'll call him \"Mine Bat Boss\" because you will need to Google this a lot to find \"helpful tips\" on how to \"beat\" him. Don't expect this to happen however, as it is literally impossible without cheating. \n\nThe boss in question is the biggest exposure of the weakness in the \"Run into him really mean like\" combat system Ys was born on. My character, at max level, with the best equipment, cannot beat him. It can't be done. I have tried for over a year and just plain gave up - watched the ending on YouTube and moved onto the 2nd game. \n\nYs II is worth the price of admission. And Ys 1 is great, if you want to play 3/4 of the way through before questioning the existence of a loving god. It does have lots of important story aspects for those 3/4 though, and should you beat the boss in question. I applaud you.

En mi opini\u00f3n Ys I & II no lo hacen. Aunque no se trata de malos t\u00edtulos, de hecho en su momento fueron muy buenos, arrastran defectos muy importantes que hace que estos t\u00edtulos no sean para todo el mundo.\n\nAvanzo que este an\u00e1lisis se ha realizado jugando directamente en el modo de dificultad m\u00e1s alto.\n\n+A FAVOR:\n\n*Los gr\u00e1ficos fueron muy buenos en su momento y siguen conservando cierto encanto.\n*La m\u00fasica remasterizada ha quedado bastante bien.\n*El sistema de topetazos... realmente no se si es bueno o malo. Hace que el juego sea muy r\u00e1pido y te lo ventiles en nada, al contrario que muchos otros JRPGs\n*Sirven como introducci\u00f3n a otros juegos de la saga m\u00e1s modernos y jugables.\n*El factor nostalgia, si en su momento disfrutaste de \u00e9stos grandes t\u00edtulos.\n\n+EN CONTRA:\n\n*La limitaci\u00f3n para avanzar en las primeras horas de juego, m\u00e1s que por habilidad o desarollo del personaje, es el grinding puro y duro. Por muy h\u00e1bil que seas con el sistema de topetazos, si no llevas el equipo y/o nivel requerido avanzar es inviable. Sin embargo, apenas a la mitad del juego ya se ha alcanzado el nivel m\u00e1ximo. En este punto, los enemigos son m\u00e1s un estorbo a evitar m\u00e1s que otra cosa, ya que al llegar al m\u00e1ximo de experiencia y dinero no aportan beneficio o reto ninguno. A menos que quieras el logro de desbloquear todo el bestiario. En esa caso te puedes hartar, ya que tienes que derrotar a una veintena de enemigos de cada tipo (aproximadamente, no recuerdo tantos) para desbloquear su ficha completa.\n\nMINI-SPOILER ALERT\nAdem\u00e1s s\u00f3lo se puede llevar una poci\u00f3n encima y aproximadamente 1/3 del juego se desarrolla a partir de un punto de no retorno en el cual no puedes volver a por m\u00e1s, con lo cual s\u00f3lo puedes salir a recuperarte con la regeneraci\u00f3n pasiva + anillo de regeneraci\u00f3n a las zonas sin monstruos para recuperarte. Mata 6-10 bichos (seg\u00fan tu habilidad) y luego sal un minuto y medio a curarte...\nFIN DE LA ALERTA\n\n*Algunos de los bosses (especialmente el de la mina) se basan m\u00e1s en la suerte que en la habilidad. Suerte y haber llegado con el equipo/nivel m\u00ednimo, por supuesto. Cuando lo terminas m\u00e1s que sensaci\u00f3n de alivio o victoria queda la frustraci\u00f3n de los trys y el tiempo echado a perder porque el patr\u00f3n de movimiento del enemigo ha variado levemente y te ha quitado en un momento 1/5 de la vida.\n\n+CONCLUSION\n\nPor mucho que me duela, no se lo puedo recomendar a cualquier jugador.

Los gr\u00e1ficos son agradables y vistosos, la BSO es magn\u00edfica por momentos y la jugabilidad es un tanto irregular. \n\nEl sistema de combate, que consiste en estamparse contra los enemigos para atacar de forma autom\u00e1tica, es algo dif\u00edcil de controlar al principio, especialmente porque debes evitar encararte en l\u00ednea recta con los monstruos. Sin embargo, una vez cogido el tranquillo, es bastante ligero aunque, cuando se alcanza el nivel 10 (m\u00e1ximo), se vuelve innecesario y es m\u00e1s pr\u00e1ctico ignorar a los enemigos hasta el pr\u00f3ximo jefe final.\n\nPor lo dem\u00e1s, la jugabilidad se basa mucho en encontrar objetos con los que poder avanzar en la trama, por lo que tenemos que explorar hasta el \u00faltimo rinc\u00f3n del mapa en el orden preciso y sin tener muchas indicaciones. \u00c9sto puede ser un problema para los jugadores menos pacientes pero aquellos a los que no les gusta que le lleven de la mano disfrutar\u00e1.\n\nUn RPG recomendable, buen remake y disfrutable a pesar de algunas mec\u00e1nicas anticuadas. Adem\u00e1s, es corto, pudiendo superarlo en apenas 5-6 horas.\n\nEn lo que respecta a su secuela, es m\u00e1s y mejor. Se mantienen las opciones y calidad audiovisuales pero el sistema de combate se mejora debido a que se puede atacar de forma m\u00e1s sencilla en diagonal. Tampoco existe ya un nivel m\u00e1ximo (o, al menos, va m\u00e1s all\u00e1 del 50) y la jugabilidad basada en encontrar objetos se mantiene con un poco m\u00e1s de variedad y dificultad.

N\u00e3o \u00e9! O review \u00e9 dos dois!\n\n[b]Vers\u00e3o resumida:[/b] \n\nYs I & II Chronicles+ traz vers\u00f5es remasterizadas de dois jogos que, apesar de um pouco desconhecidos aqui no Brasil, possuem jogabilidade original e divertida, gr\u00e1ficos a m\u00e3o charmosos e bem feitos, trilha sonora FODA do mesmo autor das m\u00fasicas da s\u00e9rie Streets of Rage e enredo envolvente, mesmo que hoje em dia um pouco manjado. \n\nJuntando tudo isso e considerando que em menos de 30 horas d\u00e1 pra terminar os dois jogos numa boa, o veredicto \u00e9: Ys I e II s\u00e3o cl\u00e1ssicos do g\u00eanero.\n\n____________________________________________________\n\n\n[b]Vers\u00e3o Extendida:[/b]\n\nComo eu nunca joguei essa s\u00e9rie na \u00e9poca que ela saiu (anos 80!) eu tinha pouca expectativa de gostar, pois sem nostalgia normalmente fica dif\u00edcil com esse jogos antigos.\n\nEnt\u00e3o uma palavra que resume Ys Chronicles \u00e9: surpreendente!\n\nA primeira coisa que chama a aten\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 a jogabilidade bem original. Voc\u00ea tem que trombar com os monstros em um certo \u00e2ngulo para acert\u00e1-los. E como o personagem, Adol Christin, \u00e9 um espadachim, sim essa \u00e9 a \u00fanica maneira de acert\u00e1-los. Se trombar com eles no \u00e2ngulo errado, leva dano; se ELES \u00e9 que trombarem com voc\u00ea, leva dano; se eles te atirarem alguma coisa e te acertarem... adivinhou: dano. \u00c9 um pouco injusto, mas depois que voc\u00ea se acostuma, fica bem divertido.\n\nNo I essa jogabilidade e alguns chefes meio apel\u00f5es (principalmente o \u00faltimo) deixam o jogo bem desafiador, mas nada imposs\u00edvel. No II \u00e9 tudo muito mais balanceado, por exemplo ao acertar um monstro na diagonal voc\u00ea SEMPRE vai tirar vida dele, sem perder nada. Al\u00e9m disso, temos magias, o que deixa o jogo mais variado e tamb\u00e9m f\u00e1cil.\n\nOs gr\u00e1ficos, mesmo remasterizados, continuam sendo simples, mas os desenhos a m\u00e3o s\u00e3o muito bonitos. As CGs tamb\u00e9m s\u00e3o muito bem feitas, bem ao estilo dos bons jRPGs antigos. No II al\u00e9m dos gr\u00e1ficos charmosos, os personagens tamb\u00e9m usam uns \"emoticons\" para se comunicarem, o que d\u00e1 uma gra\u00e7a a mais \u00e0s interpreta\u00e7\u00f5es.\n\nA trilha sonora \u00e9 simplesmente FODA, muito rock n' roll misturado com piano e batidas eletr\u00f4nicas. \u00c9 t\u00e3o boa que fui procurar mais sobre o autor e \u00e9 nada mais, nada menos que o sr. Yuzo Koshiro, o mesmo de algumas outras trilhas inesquec\u00edveis como as das s\u00e9ries Etrian Odissey e Streets or Rage!! Eu sinceramente n\u00e3o sei como esse cara n\u00e3o \u00e9 mais cultuado, porque ele realmente manda muito bem.\n\nE pra mim o ponto principal de qualquer RPG: a hist\u00f3ria. Como o jogo j\u00e1 t\u00e1 indo pra 30 anos do seu lan\u00e7amento, agora fica f\u00e1cil de dizer que \u00e9 manjada e \u00e9 clich\u00ea, mas se levarmos em considera\u00e7\u00e3o o que existia naquela \u00e9poca, d\u00e1 pra dizer que al\u00e9m de bem trabalhada e envolvente, \u00e9 um enredo at\u00e9 original e bem dentro do estilo de RPGs japoneses.\n\nJuntando todos os elementos expostos acima, d\u00e1 pra perceber porque considerei os primeiros jogos da s\u00e9rie Ys como CL\u00c1SSICOS de um g\u00eanero que hoje j\u00e1 n\u00e3o consegue mais produzir coisas com tanta alma.\n\nPode jogar sem medo.", "timestamp_created": 1437930657, "timestamp_updated": 1437930910, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519790", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17198155": {"recommendationid": "17198155", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165778106", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 757, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1437321719}, "language": "english", "review": "These 2 games are very good.

DO IT. DO IT NOW. Instead, this is just some thoughts on the nature of the latest round of remakes and how, it seems, Falcom is just stuck in their ways.\n\nThe one thing that bothers me the most about the first Ys is that, no matter how many times it's remade by Falcom, they never once increased the level cap. The DS remake by another company did this, albeit simply by halving the stat boosts you got, effectively making you have to work twice as hard for the same stat boosts in any other version. Couple this with the fact that you should in no way be lower than max level before entering Darm Tower voids any reason for enemies to give EXP, other than to have yet another number for your bestiary. Also, not being able to harm Dark Fact without the whole set of silver gear, which is NOT Cleria (even though the silver sword should technically be a Cleria weapon via Origin) and is inferior to the battle set also makes no sense, other than that Falcom is so set in their ways that they refuse to modify anything outside of the graphics and music in any remake of Ys I.\n\nYs II, for all the hidden content and overall amazing upgrade, has undergone exactly one change, content wise, which is the inclusion of mascot key chains. In all of these years, that's the best Falcom could manage? Again, much like the first game, it seems as though they are stuck in this mindset that the first two games should never be changed in any radical way, while the other remakes, Oath and Memories, have gone through such radical changes that it's hard to believe that they're from the same company.\n\nWhy are Ys I&II meant to lanugish so, chained to a past that Falcom doesn't seem to want to forget, yet other remakes are free to be so different? I don't think anybody will ever know for sure, and I'm positive that in 20 years time and after several more remakes, I will still be asking why Adol has a level 10 cap and why he can't win with the battle set in Ys I Ultra Hyper Turbo Redux Mega 2035 Special Edition that came with a life size Feena figure.\n\nAlso, YES, YOU SHOULD BUY THESE, PLAY THEM AND LOVE THEM.

In realt\u00e0 Ys I ha dei punti negativi non lievi: il livello bloccato al decimo, storia corta e mancanza di quel po' di pathos che avevo invece riscontrato in Ys:Oath in Felgana. Ebbene, tutto assume altro aspetto se invece si considera che Ys I \u00e8 solo la prima parte di un gioco complessivo che si evolve da Ys I fino a Ys II:  ed \u00e8 questa infatti la prospettiva giusta, cio\u00e8 il gioco Ys I & II Chronicles +.  La caratteristica pi\u00f9 controversa del gioco \u00e8 la modalit\u00e0 di combattimento molto arcade: dico subito che non mi ha disturbato come ho sentito che ha fatto con altri, solo che bisogna accettare questo modo originale di combattere; infatti non ci sono le classiche battaglie fondate su skill, buff o turni, ma una semplice modalit\u00e0 di attacco fisico, molto immediata, unico modo di offendere almeno finch\u00e8 non si scoprir\u00e0 ed apprender\u00e0 l'uso la magia. Infatti si fatica a classificare Ys I II + come un GDR, piuttosto lo penso come un action con progressione del personaggio, peraltro molto semplice: Adol, il famoso personaggio principale, infatti, nel progredire diventer\u00e0 semplicemente pi\u00f9 forte, aumentando vita,mana e potenza di attacco e difesa. Ci sono chiaramente le armature, le armi e gli oggetti equipaggiabili, in variet\u00e0 limitata, per la verit\u00e0, ma a me non dispiacciono i giochi che ti fanno sudare per recuperare gli oggetti unici di tutto il gioco, senza ricorrere a tonnellate di oggetti tutti simili sparsi casualmente in giro. La storia \u00e8 coinvolgente, anche se un rifacimento moderno del gioco con l'aggiunta del parlato gli avrebbe dato altra carica emotiva. Le musiche sono buone. Ho trovato singolare la scelta degli sviluppatori di non far esprimere Adol direttamente ma tramite un commentatore, che illustra il suo parlare.

Then I bought and played Ys Origins and loved it immediately because of the close resembelance of the action RPG meganics that Ys online used. In the mean time I've bought the whole series aside from Ys seven (can grab it for my PSP) and all of them are action RPGs.\n\nYs I & II are not like the rest of the series at all. These two are more like the old NES / RPG maker jRPGs with a twist. First off, the battle system sucks balls. They prolly thought it was innovative for the time to use a 'bumb' system to attack. This also means that you probably won't be able to use ranged attack (I really can't see why XSEED didn't change the combat system in the 2009 version of the game - there are 2 versions of each game, the old one and the revised one).\n\nThen the story. Most of the old NES / RPG maker jRPGs it takes you about 10-15 minutes to get into the story and you can say if you like it or not. Ys I & II are different there and after half an hour and having spoken to every one in the village you wake up I still had no clue what I was to do, other than just leave town and see where it'll bring me. Truth be told, the main plot was explained, but from there on not the slightest hint of where to go or what to do.\n\nSomehow YS I & II just lack something for me that other NES / RPG maker alike jRPGs  had and I definately won't recommend this game to anyone, unless you've played them back in the days and want to play them again.\n\nBefore anyone starts bitching to me about not knowing NES / RPG maker alike jRPGs, I have played (most of them never completed, but that's normal for me) Final Fantasy 1 trhough 4, Star Ocean 1 and willing to play 2, Tales of Phantasia (still ongoing on the PSP, means when I'm traveling).

It's buttonless, and you attack by charging around the battlefield, with Adol (the protagonist) swinging his sword as he hits enemies. They will hit back unless you come at them from a corner or just off centre. Initially its a bit hard to get a hang of it, but once you do its a blast. There's very little grind after half way through the first game, meaning you can just rush through areas you've already gone through, trashing weak opponents quickly and cutting down backtracking time.\n\nThe bosses are the real highlight, most of them are very challenging and rewarding to fight (with one exception...) with the final boss being a strategic fight as much as an action-packed brawl. \n\nThere are also puzzles; some of them can be a bit obtuse, but I never had to use a guide until I was trying to get some of the more obscure achievements.\n\nIn terms of level design I found the mine dungeon confusing to get through but apart from that it was fairly reasonable. \n\nYS II \nThe combat gameplay is kept largely the same, with the introduction of new unique spells like the fireball, which gives a lot of variety, especially for most of the boss fights. The other spells are nice, especially this one that adds a stealth element shall we say (I'll say no more for fear of spoilers.)\n\nThere is another mine in this and it is just as confusing, as well as this temple thing near the end that sometimes feels like a maze (not as bad as either of the mines though). \n\nGraphics/Aesthetics\n\nYI+II\n\nNothing amazing, but I fins the combination of sprites for gameplay and portraits for talky-bits well-executed and with some retrocharm in there as well. The aesthetic design for the character portraits is very 90s -JRPG, so if anything animeish reduces your enjoyment of a game, you have been warned.\nIt won't blow your socks off though.\n\nSound\n\nYS I+II\n\nThis WILL blow your socks off. The music is this crazy good rock music that stands apart form the usual JRPG faire and suits the frenetic pace of the combat. The boss themes in particular are heartpounding. It sounds great and complements the gameplay perfectly so it knocks it out of the park as far as I'm concerned.\n\nStory \n\nYSI + II\n\nNothing spectacular. Held back by a silent protagonist and a rather simple world (which improves marvellously in the second game). However, it is well told and well paced, with some great supporting characters to keep it going. There are definitely some standout moments. Most importantly, it is well written (thanks be to XSEED, long may they localise) and never lets the talking get in the way of the action.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt's well worth the price; solid retro action and a decent story. The one thing I will say is that the challenge level is reasonably high, especially for a JRPG. This is particularly true of the final parts of the first game since grinding is not an option. \n\nI'll say this as well, its made me very interested in the sequels and Falcom's Legend of Heroes series.\n\nAt a guess it takes about 10-15 hours to beat both games.", "timestamp_created": 1431183810, "timestamp_updated": 1431183810, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15725761": {"recommendationid": "15725761", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025153447", "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 447, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1430948867}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Ys Chronicles incluye los 2 primeros juegos de la saga Ys, una saga de ActionRPG pr\u00e1cticamente desconocidos en Europa, pero muy populares en Jap\u00f3n y USA.

It\u2019s hit a number of different platforms, including the PC88, TurboGrafx, PC, Nintendo DS, Sony PSP, and now PC, each with their own tweaks to the game to fit the platform they were released on. XSEED Games and Falcom, who started their partnership  with the release of Ys Seven, have set out on bringing the definitive version of Ys I & II to the PC. The question is, how does this port in the long list of existing ports fare?\n\nOriginally released in the late 1980s, Ys I & II definitely shows their roots in their story presentations. You play the role of Adol Christin, a (now very well-known) red-haired adventurer who sets off on a journey of excitement and ends up washing up in a nearby coastal city where he learns of demon attacks which are driving the country\u2019s citizens into hiding. As you progress through the game, it becomes clear that things aren\u2019t as simple as they seem, with items called the Books of Ys being collected as you progress through your journey. These later become important to unraveling exactly what is causing this country\u2019s plight and showing how to set things right.\n\nMost memorable for its combat, Ys I and II combine all the elements of a traditional JRPG: towns, shops, NPCs, equipment, character levels, exploration, and even some minor side quests and secrets. Ys I is more simplistic than its sequel, but both games are strikingly similar and tell two parts of the same narrative, even if those parts are two nearly identical story arcs. Each game can be beaten in less than ten hours, both have moments of great frustration, and they both climax in thrilling and memorable bosses. Ys I and II may be most well known for their shared \"bump\" combat system in which our hero Adol collides with enemies to injure them (and to be injured by them). The lack of an attack button and Adol's swift running speed make the action so frantic as to be absurd, and at times I found the red-haired sprite's action downright hilarious. I was skeptical and critical at first, but I learned to enjoy the simple combat, particularly during boss fights, which require much more thought than the dull standard enemies. Unfortunately, diagonal attacks are so overpowered in Ys II that regular enemies are slain with ease, and both games suffer from clumsy menus and balance issues. \n\nBeing that this is an older RPG, there are some grinding issues present in this release. Ys I, being merely a prelude to Ys II, only allows for Adol to level up to Level 10. Levels control whether you win or lose in Ys I, and at times you\u2019ll have to grind in the initial dungeons to get through some of the bosses. This issue becomes a bit worse in Ys II, which ups the level cap to 55, but lessens the EXP gained from enemies as you level up. This requires players to, at times, spend time farming enemies in one area of a dungeon, lest they get instantly killed by enemies in a later part which Adol can\u2019t touch with gaining more levels and grabbing enough gold to get the best weapons for that period in the game. Some of the latter bosses are particularly unfair in this regard, forcing players to gain 3-5 levels above what the enemies are at just to get through the boss fight with a sliver of life remaining. While this only occurs in a few parts of the game, it\u2019s still an annoyance that could have been fixed with a few slight tweaks by Falcom for this release. Players who enjoy a challenge will find no problems with this though.\n\nAs both titles were released back in the 1980s, the RPG mantra of including key items in obscure places holds true. Numerous times in Ys I players will be unable to progress through the story because they forgot to talk to or walk into a specific story event that was either barely mentioned or not mentioned at all. While Ys II fixes this for the most part, there\u2019s one key item in one of the final dungeons which requires players to go to a unmentioned room instead of a house in town, which is where players would assume it was located due to the game\u2019s dialogue. The game could have greatly benefited from some streamlining for newer fans of the series.\n\nEven with those negatives, as with most Ys titles, the first thing players will notice is the game\u2019s soundtrack, which like in Oath and Seven, runs circles around most other games. The soundtrack, composed by video game music legend Yuzo Koshiro of Etrian Odyssey fame, along with Falcom stalwart Mieko Ishikawa, is easily the shining gem of this compilation. As explain before, Ys I & II have appeared on numerous platforms in the past, so the game compliments this by allowing players to choose between three different versions of the music.\n\nOne of the most impressive parts of Ys Chronicles outside of the soundtrack has to be the game\u2019s storyline and translation. For a title which was released back in the 1980s, the story still stands shoulders above many other titles of that era, as well as some of the RPG hits of the 1990s. This combined with the music and the general artistic presentation of the game makes for some very heartwarming moments. The main storyline was translated in a way which feels authentic without falling into the \u201cye olde\u201d trap that most remakes of classic RPGs fall into. XSEED also threw in a couple pop culture jokes in some of the more obscure areas of the game for those who take the time to check out everything.\n\nDespite some of the negatives I've listed here, I thoroughly enjoy playing through these adventures. Being a long time Ys fan I owed it to myself to play the adventures that started them all. There is magic in Ys, and everyone should get a chance to see it.\n\n[h1][b]Highly Recommended[/b][/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1430619533, "timestamp_updated": 1485058654, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 68, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.796953", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15657843": {"recommendationid": "15657843", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017074932", "num_games_owned": 289, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 759, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1374690596}, "language": "english", "review": "5/5", "timestamp_created": 1430592697, "timestamp_updated": 1430592697, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15641769": {"recommendationid": "15641769", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995447845", "num_games_owned": 2287, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 819, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431611376}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ucc3e\uc544\ub3c4 \uc5c6\ub294 \uadf8\ub798\ud53d \ud30c\uc77c \ucc3e\uc9c0 \ub9d9\uc2dc\ub2e4. \uc608\uc804\uc5d0 \ub098\uc628 \uc815\ubc1c\ud310\uc5d0\ub9cc \uc788\ub294\uac70\ub2c8\uae4c\uc694.\n\nps. \uc138\uc774\ube0c\ub97c \uc790\uc8fc\ud558\ub294 \uc2b5\uad00\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uae38 \ucd94\ucc9c\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc65c\ub0d0\uace0\uc694? 2\uc2dc\uac04 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uac00 2\ubc88\uc774\uc0c1 \ub0a0\uc544\uac00\uba74 \uba85\uc791\uc774\uace0 \ubb50\uace0 \uc548\ud558\uace0 \uc2f6\uc5b4\uc9c0\uac70\ub4e0\uc694....\n\n\uac8c\uc784\ud3c9\uac00\uc694?\n\uc74c\ubc18\ud68c\uc0ac\ub85c \uc720\uba85\ud55c \ud314\ucf64\uc758 \uc720\uba85\ud55c \uc8fc\ub825 \uac8c\uc784\uc0c1\ud488\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \n\ub9d0\uc774 \ub354 \ud544\uc694\ud55c\uac00\uc694?", "timestamp_created": 1430507430, "timestamp_updated": 1430507430, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558844", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15618349": {"recommendationid": "15618349", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994264572", "num_games_owned": 511, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 338, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1430364524}, "language": "english", "review": "Its an RPG that skips the grind and you kill enemies by bumping into them.

Now sure it sounds antiquated and lame but once you get used to it, it's kind of fun and is quite fast since if you land on your target right you land alot more hits.\n\nAlso since these are faithful remakes of two old 1987 Japanese action RPGs orginally made for a old series of 8bit computers the game is fairly grindy but not too bad at least on difficulties lower then hard, I found myself reaching the max level in Ys 1, which is 10 btw, by time I reached the third boss which was in the second dungeon and had almost all but the highest level gear and in Ys 2 I bearly level grinded at all and still did alright of course in Ys 2 I found myself getting lost so often that I end up killing tons of monsters anyway. Yeah Ys 2's levels can get pretty maze like the worst is the last level.   Also in Ys 1 there is some slight padding especially in the final dungeon where you will find yourself reaching the final floor of the tower only to have to back track back down to level 11 to speak with one guy to get one item that you need to unlock the final door and fair word of warning the last boss of Ys 1 is the hardest boss in the series all I can say is watch where you attack him as for every hit you land on him he takes away the peice of the floor you were standing on when you hit him so you have to watch for that and the massive rain of fireballs that come down during the fight. \n\nAnd the story in Ys 1 is pretty weak but that's mainly do to the fact it's a set up for Ys 2, all the story is there for is to lay the foundation of what you get in Ys 2. The music is fantastic and you get 3 renditions of them the newer arraganged version which I personally love which was done in house by Falcom's in studio band, the 2000 midi versions and the orginal PC 88 version. While it would of been nice to have been able to get the TG-16 CD/PC-engine CD-rom version of the soundtack as well but eh what can you do. \n\nI know it sounds like I am being hard on these but you got to point out the low points. But I do love this series and these two in paticular there is a reason why I keep going back and playing Ys 1 and 2 after all these years, I just love them and they are that damn good if you can look past the few old school flaws.

These games were released in 1987-1988. Despite ports on many platforms and numerous remakes (including this one), the game-design has remained unchanged. This is interesting, considering that Ys III was given a complete re-imagining in 2005 (Oath of Felghana). While I'm sure many people would love a Felghana-level version of Ys 1 & 2, there's something to be said about allowing a classic to stand on its own.\n\nThere isn't much to say about Adol Christin. He's the guy fate calls for when evil threatens the world. Every adventure seems to start off with him showing up at just the right time. Either that or he's just prone to shipwrecks. He's not particularly talkative, aside from his knack for explaining the current situation. In Ys 7 and Memories of Celceta he even says a few words during battle. He's not mute, but he's usually surrounded, by extremely talkative NPCs that do the talking for him. Adol prefers to keep quiet, so he can save his strength for the next fight.\n\nActually, the Ys series doesn't fit the description of \"action-rpg\" all that well. This is especially apparent in the first game. The level-cap is a mere 10, and you'll be max-level before the first 1/3 of the game is completed. Money will cease to be relevant half-way through Adol's adventure. In fact, the latter half the game takes place in the lovely Darm's tower. The average play-through should run about 5 hours, maybe a bit more due to the freakin' backtracking right before the final boss. \n\nAs it has been stated time and time again, Ys 1 has a \"bump2win\" combat system. There aren't any buttons to swing your sword, you simply run into the enemy. Not directly of course, that would be suicide. This off-center approach represents the entirety of your interactions with monsters. Aside from the bosses, you don't have to worry about projectiles, sword slashes, clawwing attacks, or anything else when facing demons. Combat can get annoying, especially if you choose to leave diagonal-controls turned on. Like I said though, once you max out your level, there isn't any incentive to fight. The boss battles are definitely challenging, since they fill the screen with dangerous crap, and it isn't always apparent when they can be damaged. For the most part however they are fair and entertaining to fight.\n\nExcept for Dark Fact of course. He is one truly bull shit piece of shit. Fighting this jerk on normal is what caused me to grow my first white hair. I'm not ready for nightmare-level Fact.\n\nOn the bright side, once you defeat him you can move onto the much-improved sequel.\n\nYs 2 employs numerous changes to the combat system. On the surface it's still \"bump2win\" but there's a bit more to it. Well, maybe less depending on who you talk to. The off-center approach works just as well as before, but now enemies can be diagonally attacked. This simple move is far more effective. The enemies of Ys have seen changes to somewhat counteract this. Enemies will now fire projectiles, swing weapons, and generally move around just a bit more. The game has still become easier, but it's also become more dynamic, and more fun.\n\nThe combat changes include the ability to cast spells. Early on, Adol receives a fire rod. This weapon completely changes almost all of the boss-battles. Now you're not expected to run into the openings, you just have to blow them away. The boss-battles somewhat resemble a 2D shooter, or one of those genre mash-ups like The Guardian Legend. \n\nUnlike the previous game, Adol explores a larger variety of locales. The final dungeon is pretty massive, but it doesn't take up half the game like Ys 1. Instead you get to explore great locations like a fire cavern, some mines, a land filled with snow, sewers...Hey where are you going? Oh...yeah I guess going through the same areas as every other videogame can be really tiring. Keep in mind that this was all really novel for a game made in 1988. Of course, this excuse doesn't fly when Ys 3 (1989!) also features a fire cavern, some mines, a land filled with snow, and sewers. \n\nThe entirety of Ys 1 & 2 isn't just running through dungeons and bumping into foes, there are some light adventure elements as well. At a certain point in Ys 1, Adol has to wear a mask to see hidden passages (at the expense of seeing dangerous monsters). There's a staff in Ys 2 that allows Adol to change into a Roo, and actually converse with demons. Some additional scenes can be viewed by fulfilling certain conditions (most of which also award achievements). While they don't affect the game-design, they're a nice touch all the same, especially for fans of the series.\n\nThe first entry in the Ys series can be difficult to appreciate. The story isn't anything special, the combat -- while not without its charm -- isn't even a patch on Ys 6 and beyond, and there are some flat-out dull moments. Early on you're practically required to grind for experience and cash. I still believe that it's worth a play-through. If nothing else, you get to embark on an adventure without a lot of fat, and see the humble beginnings of a classic action (with RPG elements) series. I think Ys 2 holds up far better. It's more approachable, still retains its identity, and is generally more fun.", "timestamp_created": 1428382414, "timestamp_updated": 1428466328, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.651829", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15164076": {"recommendationid": "15164076", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992407255", "num_games_owned": 364, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 607, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457979765}, "language": "english", "review": "The care and charm put into these remakes is truly remarkable.

The combat, at times, resembles what would occur if 'the legend of zelda' and 'geometry wars' had a baby.  It's hard to describe, but it's tremendously satisfying.  \n\nWhat is truly outstanding about this game is the personality which pervades every corner.  The random townsfolk all seem to be part of a bigger picture, and have a myriad of dialogue options depending on how you interact with them.  They all seem to have a bit more individual personality than the common run of the mill NPC, and it's easy to grow attached to them.  Not only that, but under certain circumstances, even the enemies can be conversed with (in ys 2 at least).  Not just some of the monsters, but ALL of the monters have their own character and dialogue trees.  Even the steam achievements made me laugh out loud on more than one occasion.\n\nTruly this package lets you relive a bit of gaming history without it being some sort of archaeological exercise.

Has two different versions of the game, controller support (which you'll probably want in a game like this), and three different versions of the soundtrack that you can switch between at any time during gameplay.\n\nI only have a few complaints:\n\n1: The hitboxes for enemies are a little wonky. It feels like the game favors the enemies over the player in terms of what counts as you hitting them Vs. what counts as you getting hit, so be ready to die a lot. This goes double for bosses, since you can't heal once you enter a boss room and several of them can ignore your defenses outright. Save often, and you'll save (*rimshot*) yourself a lot of trouble.\n\n2: Grinding is an outright necessity. If you don't max out your level, you can't beat the game. In fact, you probably can't even get to the final dungeon if you don't. Luckily, level grinding doesn't take too long and the level cap is pretty low, being only 10. It's more the fault of the way RPGs were when the original game was released than truly poor game design.\n\n3: The game doesn't come with the OST. Major missed oppertunity, since the music is the best part.\n\n8.5/10, probably going to buy every Ys game on Steam just for the music.", "timestamp_created": 1422879414, "timestamp_updated":

I can now write my review of this classic RPG title.\n\nYs I & II Chronicles+ is a mix of both the first and second titles that I have no clue how I never knew about. It is one of those amazing JRPGs that perhaps not many know about.\n\nYs I is a very short and simple game compared to the slightly longer Ys II, but it introduced me to a unique battle system I didn't expect, the Bump system. Tho I was a bit weirded out by this, I quickly started to enjoy the combat, I started to believe that some recent RPGs like Half Minute Hero may have been influced by Ys, but now I'm just rambling away. Going back to the review, Ys I will not hold your hand and lead you to the quest, that is for you to discover, something I honestly enjoyed as many games tend to hold your hand and lead you without thinking for yourself.\n\nThe music for both titles is absolutely amazing and well done, personally my favorite was the Complete version, and I played that soundtrack in its entirety through both games the majority of the time. The world of Ys itself is beautiful to view, even with the good old graphics. The game is filled with great characters to meet and talk to, you may grow attached to some of them on your journey.\n\nThe story of Ys I & II will captivate you, it presents a great story for such a small package. The enemies are difficult depending on how much you grind and what weapons you buy/find on your journey. I advise those to grind a few extra levels for good measure, especially the 2nd game as the first, you'll max out very quickly.

The problem is the enemies change directions almost constantly so it's nearly impossible to attack skillfully.\n\nAnother huge issue is that for a lot of people the \"Use Item\" key simply doesn't work. The only way to use an item is the \"Use Item\" key and there are several points, apparently, wher you must use an item manually in order to progress the story.

The origin of the awesome music that Ys is renowned for, and the intriguing story though simple and perhaps something you've seen alot in for instance certain anime, it is still one of the early RPGs and therefore also quite original for its time.\n\nThough some boss battles are easy and some quite difficult, the fighting mechanism is but running towards enemies in certain directions (no use of mouse or any attack key whatsoever). It's all about your dodging skills, reflexes and reaction. Also having the proper equipment for certain \"dungeon adventures\" and also boss battles is important to take notice of. But in the end with such an awesome music accompanying the game, it makes the gaming experience all the better. Though I finished the game on normal difficulty, for those \"masochists\" that dare take the challenge till the last boss fight on nightmare mode are welcomed to try this little sucker out.

Retro. Action RPG. While we're at it, Ys Chronicles+ kicks Major Ass (this is an E rated review)! The game mechanics are so simple and so addictive that you can literally spend hours grinding monsters, just because! And then you look at the clock and think, \u201cHoly Pants! It's tomorrow! ...But maybe just a little longer...\u201d and then you turn into a zombie. Yea, this is a hyperbole, but it's not as much of an overstatement as you might think.\n\nAnd did I mention that this is a package of two games? Quick history lesson. When Falcom was developing Ys, limitations forced them to split the epic into two, resulting in two games, Ys I and II, collectively called (in this case) The Ys Chronicles (Ys Complete, Ys Eternal, Ys Epic Remake VII, these two games have seen a plethora of remakes, and Ys Chronicles+ is the latest and arguably greatest).\n\nPros:\n- Impossibly good soundtrack\n- Addictively simple (or simply addictive) gameplay\n- Epic, just epic\n- Two games in one\n- Too many subtle little things to list\n\nCons:\n- Some bosses (Ys I only) can be frustrating\n- A few very minor things\n- Review doesn't do it justice (but hopefully comes close)\n\nYs soundtracks are... you know what, there is no word that can properly describe how phenomenally awesome the music in Ys games are. In fact, Ys soundtracks should have their own special term. No really. I'm going to make one up right now: Ystoundingtrack. ...Maybe a work in progress. If you think the music doesn't somehow contribute to the addictiveness of this game, think again. The gameplay is addictive on its own. Now throw in the energizing rock music from the Ystoundingtrack and suddenly you have such an unstoppable locomotive of energy that you just want to cheer every time an enemy explodes into the aether (what a mouthful). The track that stands out the most in this respect is the Ys I overworld music. It's perfect. The rest of the Ystoundingtrack in both games are kick-ass (darn E rating), but it's that overworld theme that's going to awesome the hours away.\n\nSpeaking of gameplay, Ys Chronicles has one of the most unbelievably simple yet inhumanly addictive gameplay ideas to every grace the world of video games. You ready for this? You sure? Well here it is: you bump into enemies, and they die. That's basically it. The game is presented in the standard top down perspective of retro RPG fame, and all you have to do is bump into enemies off centre to damage them, and then they die (if you run into them dead centre from the front or they run into you, you take damage... it's a little hard to explain with words alone). Now you might be thinking, \u201cbut how can something so mind-numbingly simple be so mind-numbingly addictive?\u201d This gameplay element has been described by it's creators as the game equivalent of popping bubble wrap - they're not wrong. The gameplay results in very tight, fast paced action, and that only helps contribute to the energy of the game.\n\nOther than the basic gameplay element, this is also an RPG. In Ys I, the RPG element is very downplayed, and by the time you reach the big mid-boss of the game, you basically have to be at max level (level 10) in order to face him. In Ys II, the RPG element is more developed and balanced. You also get the additional gameplay mechanic of magic in Ys II through the use of magical rods (bologna! they're magic wands - for those who don't know, bologna is pronounced: boloney). Ys II has a lot added features compared to Ys I (I'll get into some of these as I go along). In Ys I, the only thing enemies do is run around at varying speeds. It gets repetitive. Fortunately, Ys I is a short game, and it makes up for it's repetitive nature with creative and interesting locations (extra points for the enemies looking cool). In Ys II, however, every enemy has its own unique attack in addition to the regular means of damaging you.\n\nThe bosses are where Ys I becomes fiendishly hard. Don't believe me? The big bad mid-boss is a monster! A superboss!! Add to the fact that you can only properly fight him with... well I won't give it away, but if you've talked to everybody, you should have an idea of what you need to fight this boss. And that's not even the hardest boss in the game. That trophy goes to Ys I final boss. Every other boss can be defeated on skill alone, once you know what to do. The final boss, however, has such a luck factor involved that it's... awesome! Unbelievably, they somehow managed to make a luck based boss that's, in addition to frustrating, so frakin fun to fight that it's awesome. Don't ask me how, I honestly don't know. The bosses in Ys II aren't as challenging. In fact, that's the one thing I though was a downgrade from Ys I. The challenging bosses in Ys I is one of the things that I found made the game so enjoyable and memorable. Don't get me wrong, there's plenty of enjoyable and memorable to be had in Ys II. And the bosses are challenging and fun, just not as challenging as I would have liked. Also, most of the bosses can only be killed with fire magic. It would have been nice to have some of the other magic come into play, but... oh well.\n\nYs II makes up for this by being a huge game compared to Ys I with a much grander story to go with it. The story in Ys I is more basic with fewer characters, and because it has fewer characters, it feels like they had more time to focus on and develope them. In Ys II, while the many characters do get time for developement, it's hard to focus on any one character because there's just so many of them. Heck, there's also a present system in Ys II, and if you give people presents they'll say something different than before. Heck+, with the right spell, you can TALK TO EVERY ENEMY IN THE GAME! Did I mention you can BURN VILLAGERS?! (They don't die, they just say something funny). Everyone and everything has something unique to say, and often more than one solitary thing. The most memorable characters of both games leave a lasting impression for one reason or another (in one case, literally because of a hole in the wall). The plot of both games is basically the same, and it's RPG generic, but the story weaves its way around the plot in such an interesting way that it transforms the simplicity of the plot into a foundational strength. That takes serious skill. While not what I would call a perfect story, the characters, the locations, the events, it all works together to make for a truly fun and enjoyable experience.\n\nAs a retro RPG, these games do have some minor annoyances. In Ys I, there is one point where you have to talk to a character about something pointless before being able to proceed to the final dungeon of the game. All the other stuff you have to do makes sense, but this short conversation... doesn't. Why was it necessary (maybe it's a bug)? Ys II doesn't have this problem. Instead, it has the hide important gameplay elements issue. There is a very minor gameplay element that is critical for dealing with one boss (you can technically fight the boss without it, but that's nearing the realm of impossible). So, what do they do with the explanation of this gameplay element? As far as I know, one of the characters tells you about it, but only if you give them enough presents, and there are a huge number of characters in this game. Personally, I don't think stumbling onto gameplay elements is good game design. It's always fun to have some puzzles in a game, but these puzzles should be a unique application of the gameplay elements you already know, not somehow stumbling onto the fact that if you press a certain control a certain way for a certain magic, something different will happen (as an Easter egg it would be OK though).\n\nYs Chronicles+ are two phenomenal games filled with great energy and fast paced fun.

Let me just give you a quick overview:\n\n+you fight your enemies by bumping into them at specific angles. Your weapons will auto-attack them, and if you attack at the right angles, they won't be able to counterattack. Takes time to master, but it's very rewarding. I think this is actually a viable replacement for traditional turn based combat, odd as that may seem. You just surge through the game's dungeons at a brisk pace. Difficulty can be adjusted, allowing you to breeze through if it's too hard, but giving you an alternative if it's too easy.\n+I'm very surprised how much I liked the story. It wasn't in-your-face like most story-heavy RPGs, and it knew when it to ease you into something big. I give it a nice plus because of it. \n+soundtrack is beautiful, and you get a nice choice between the chronicles version, complete version, and nostalgic version. I recommend all three\n+graphically the game is beautiful. It has a top notch sprite team, and it was very revolutionary back when it first came out. Even today it still holds up.\n-the only downside I would consider is that the game doesn't hold your hand, which is normally a good thing, but this game gets downright cryptic. You need to remember every single thing about your world, and remember all of your items and their various uses. You will be tested on how good your puzzle and memory skills are. Myst and Riven have nothing on this.\n\nThe bottom line? Get. This. Game. It put a tear in my eye, a smile on my mouth, and a very small dent in my wallet. I truly fell in love with Ys because of this. So get a move on and give this game your time. Once you master the combat, I guarantee you won't regret it.

I personally prefer to use a gamepad for MOST of my gaming, and with my Logitek controller playing this feels just like the good ol' days of 8- and 16-bit RPGs.  However, if you want to use your keyboard and mouse, that is fully customizable as well.  Also, you can choose to play the game with the map taking up the entire screen area, OR in the classic bordered (\"windowed\") view from the originals.  You can also choose the graphics style -- classic or the new updated version.  For me, it seems an obvious choice to play it fullscreen (within the game and on the monitor!) with the updated graphics -- as everything is absolutely beautiful and really keeps the feeling and spirit of the original while updating it for a new era.  As much as I love the classic look and feel of the oldschool stuff, when an update is done this well it truly does come off even better than the original.\n\nThe first two installments of Nihon Falcom's classic series are brought to life in an excellent way, and I highly recommend this game (and the other Ys games on Steam)!", "timestamp_created": 1419126264, "timestamp_updated": 1419126264, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13474150": {"recommendationid": "13474150", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043516181", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 460, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1419161278}, "language": "english", "review": "I went in to these games with a mind set of I wanna see the story but fuck the bump System and I have to say I was wrong WHile I love and prefer the combat of latter Ys games it was nice to go back and play how they started out and I have to say it was a fantastic experience.\n\nI had heard complaints about the games lack of direction and the fact that I would need a guide to get through this game and I have to say thats pretty much false while it is true that the game can be pretty half arsed with directions sometimes its normaly pretty easier to work out where to go and when it doubt talk to the last relevent story NPC.\n\nThe game seems to have aged well for a 2001/9 port and I had no graphical or performance issues", "timestamp_created": 1419088087, "timestamp_updated": 1419088087, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13469988": {"recommendationid": "13469988", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999101599", "num_games_owned": 1494, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1557, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1426096016}, "language": "english", "review": "Marvelous hard bumper cart RPG", "timestamp_created": 1419074973, "timestamp_updated": 1419074973, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471971", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13466602": {"recommendationid": "13466602", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128425249", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 380, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1419060408}, "language": "english", "review": "Although I was highly disappointed with the game, I can still recommend it cause it will no doubt appeal to someone out there who is looking for a very short \"appetizer\" and condensed version of a JRPG. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1419060599, "timestamp_updated": 1419060599, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13439109": {"recommendationid": "13439109", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067836601", "num_games_owned": 410, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 643, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1434060102}, "language": "spanish", "review": "El \u00fanico juego donde podr\u00e1s hacerlo todo (hablar con npc's, atacar a los enemigos, abrir cofres...) \u00fanicamente haciendo placajes xDDD En serio.

A game for ants??? You fight monsters by bumping into them. You interact with townspeople by bumping into them.  You pick up items by bumping into them. You solve puzzles (in the loosest sense of the word) by (you guessed it) bumping into them. They should have called this game 'Blunder Boy and the Uncredibly Bumpy Dungeon'.\n\nThe graphics are weak (even for 2001). The music isn't bad, but highly repetitive, even with the Complete Pack. Stat leveling is completely automatic (and one-dimensional). There are no powers, secondary abilities, or any sense of growth other than the number of times you have to bump into an enemy to kill them (typically 1 once you're high enough level). Quests are also automatic - you have no choice in their resolution or even to accept them or not. You just initiate them once you... bump into them.\n\n4/10 would not buy again.\n\nPS If you still want to buy the game, a controller is highly recommended. Played this with a kb and with a shield controller, and the controller massively improved the playability of the game (such as it is).

I am hoping the second one adds something to this system as im sure I am not going to like it if it is the same thing for another 4 hours.\n\nThere are also a lot of strange solutions to progressing in this game that you are going to need a guide for if you dont want to be annoyed.\n\nThe soundtrack is very good.

Ich kann mir nur vorstellen das es zu dieser Zeit verdammt frisches Gameplay war, gepaart aus einem Platformer mit schneller, unkomplizierter Action und RPG Elementen, verzweigten, labyrinthartigen Dungeons und vielen Secrets die ohne gro\u00dfe Informationsflut entdeckt werden wollen und teilweise m\u00fcssen. In einer abgewandelten Form hat mich der Verlauf, die Dialoge doch sogar etwas an die Souls Spiele erinnert.\n\nF\u00fcr ein J-RPG hat Ys 1 doch eine \u00fcberraschend kurze Spieldauer, wom\u00f6glich lag es auch an den damaligen SPeicherplatzverh\u00e4ltnissen, wie ich gelesen habe war Ys eines der ersten Spiele f\u00fcr CD-ROM und hat dank aufwendigen Animationen und Cutscenes und dickem Soundtrack einiges gefressen. \nAllerdings wurde Ys auch damals zweigeteilt. Ys 1 und Ys 2 sind eigentlich 1 Spiel, wohl auch ein Grund warum beide in dem Chronicle Bundle verf\u00fcgbar sind. \n\nChronicles+ bietet vor allem \u00fcberarbeitete sch\u00f6ne und auch sehr rockige Musik die den Spielfluss bestens unterst\u00fctzt, zwei Artwork Modi, entweder die Original Artworks oder die neuen der Chronicles Version (gilt f\u00fcr die Dialogbilder der Charaktere), wobei mir die neuen besser gefallen haben. Einen Fullscreen Modus der das Bild nat\u00fcrlich deutlich ranzoomed und die Pixelbracht deutlich hervorhebt und eine 4:3 Frame Version die mir pers\u00f6nlich besser gefallen hat.\n\nMit Ys hat sich mir eine weitere J-RPG Reihe erschlossen die mir bis vor einiger Zeit v\u00f6llig unbekannt war, aber schon jetzt mit meinen bisherigen Favoriten, der Final Fantasy und der Tales of... Serie, mithalten kann, da es erfrischend anders ist. Freue mich auf Ys 2 und die neuaufgelegte \u00fcberarbeitete Version von Ys 3 (The Oath of Felghana) und Ys Origins. \n\nIch hoffe das noch mehr J-RPGs es zu Steam schaffen.\n\n8,5/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1406796180, "timestamp_updated": 1406796180, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510544", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11487998": {"recommendationid": "11487998", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096233300", "num_games_owned": 152, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1388897990}, "language": "english", "review": "I have always been a fan of the YS series as well as the Legend of Hero Series.

By the way, most of this will focus on Ys I.\n\nYS I\n\nFor a remake of a game dating back to 1987 (and also remade before), Ys I remains a fun excursion.  It goes to show that some games can stand the test of time, even if their more current competitors are more high-toned and fancy.  For instance:\n\n*The \"bump\" combat is a refreshingly simple system.  While appearing simple, it did have a considerable amount of minutiae to keep it engaging.\n*The musical arrangements now come with three options and styles.  I personally chose to listen to the Chronicles version, and I enjoyed many of the songs.\n\nHowever, there is a darker side to these same points.....\n\n*At times it feels like the \"bump\" system relies a little too much on luck.  While it looks like you hit the enemy just to the side of head-on, the foe will still get a counter-attack in like you hit them head-on.  This is particularly concerning early on in the game while you are weaker than the enemies.\n*Due to the limited programming options of the original release, there is not much variety with the music, which means you may get tired of hearing the same songs over and over again.\n\nOther pros and cons to take into consideration are:\n\n*Pro: The graphics look amazing, considering the source material. \n*Con: At times the difficulty is low, and then suddenly there is something disproportionally challenging.\n*Con: At times it can be difficult to figure out what you have to do, or there is a specific order that things must be completed in if you want to progress.\n*Pro: While I had difficulty understanding some facets of what I had to do at times, there was a very rich backstory.\n*Pro: The game's clarity improved over time.\n\nEven with these flaws, I found myself enjoying the game considerably.  In addition, many of these issues are improved or corrected in Ys II.\n\n\nYS II\n\nYs II is a lot like Ys I, except for several key facts:\n\n*It's much clearer than its predecessor in terms of what to do.\n*There's magic now, which offers a brand-new dimension and means by which to combat enemies.\n\nThese changes create a much easier to work with game, and I am enjoying it more than the first one.  However, something to keep in mind: the bosses can be INSANELY difficult.  Yet they are still really fun encounters.\n\n So if you like action RPGs, I recommend taking a look at these classic Ys games, and have fun bumping off some foes.", "timestamp_created": 1405536296, "timestamp_updated": 1411408516, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481383", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11250289": {"recommendationid": "11250289", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044458165", "num_games_owned": 1006, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 349, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1405447708}, "language": "french", "review": "Ys I : \n\nUn petit jeu (quelques heures en prenant son temps), bien cod\u00e9 et fluide.\nEnti\u00e8rement lin\u00e9aire, avec un peu d'exploration pour passer le temps/farmer, on atteint assez rapidement un personnage \"maximal\" avec lequel il faut faire l'autre moiti\u00e9 du jeu (et donc survivre face \u00e0 des ennemis comparativement de plus en plus forts).\nLe syst\u00e8me de combat est assez original, et demande un certain temps pour s'y habituer.\n\nUn gros point positif : la cin\u00e9matique de d\u00e9but.

HOWEVER, if you do not like classic JRPG games the game might feel a little too simple for you. The bump battle system turns off a lot of people due to its' simplicity; it was implemented in a time where it had to deal with the limitations of the Sega Master System, and the Famicom. I suppose you could say this is one of the original ARPGs due to Ys' unique active battle system. Like most Falcom games the OST is pretty good so that shouldn't be an issue. If you want to take advantage of the replay value of these games; there is a Time Attack mode available for anyone who wants to speedrun the game. These games however are not difficult at all, and you can take advantage of the bump system VERY easily.

It's a remake of a NES game that's so simple you don't even have an attack button, you just bump into the enemies at off-center angles to deal damage.\n\nYs 1 hasn't aged too gracefully, even with all the updates. The entire game is basically a fetch quest. Most of the boss fights are simple to the point of not being much fun and the game tries to compensate for its small world with constant backtracking. The power curve is also screwy since the max level is 10, so a boss will be impossible until you gain a level at which point it'll be a cakewalk. Funny enough it actually improves during the final dungeon which takes up half the length of the game.\n\nYs 2 is much better, the bumper combat has been improved so that it feels like less of a crapshoot, and the power curve is much smoother. The boss fights are still simple, but the new magic system makes them fun, and there's far less backtracking than in Ys 1. Both games are very uncaring towards the player. Ys 2 will let you kill yourself against a boss over and over again without telling you that you need to learn how to throw fireballs to damage it, it's usually not too hard to figure out you're missing something, but there's that.\n\nThe music for both games is pretty rad, you even get the choice betweeen the original PC soundtrack, the Chronicles soundtrack or the soundtrack from the 2001 port.

This is an extremely well-ported remake of the first two Ys games, 100% compatible with any modern windows operating system (7, 8, 8.1) and it runs smooth as butter out of the box - all that's required is to set your screen resolution in the config program. It will automatically recognize your xbox 360 joypad (I'm using a ps3 joypad with a 360 joypad emulator) and it can run at any refresh rate (I'm playing at 120hz @ 120fps which is an incredibly smooth and pleasant gameplay experience with super responsive input.\nThe gameplay is extremely enjoyable. I had played Ys: oath in felghana before and I absolutely loved it, but Ys I & II blew me away. The combat system is unlike anything I've ever seen before: you basically have to bump into enemies at precise angles to maximize damage without getting hurt and your character will automatically attack as you bump into the enemies. This makes fighting extremely entertaining, with its extremely simple yet fast-paced and challenging-to-master mechanics.\nThe game is filled with cool secrets / extras that add tons of replay value along with the newly added steam achievements which will make you want to play through the game all over again.\nThe soundtrack is asbolutely amazing and I loved every single track of it.

Plus, the lore and mysticism holds up, and it's a solid foundation for the sequels. It's a PC port of a rerelease of a PC remake from over a decade ago and it shows, but the artwork when communicating with villagers and during cutscenes is still top-notch, and the music is incredible. The bump attacking system requires you to ram into enemies at off angles to avoid taking damage yourself, and takes some getting used to. It tends to be called 'basic', while amusingly being more demanding of precision than the 'tap button for wide arc or poking sword attack' of similar games..The stat gains an strength differences between each level up can be pretty stark, so if you get through one dungeon rather smoothly without much bumping, you're gonna have to grind a level. It also starts slow, since you're almost useless until you gain your first level-up... The bosses start extremely easy, but the last couple are a nightmare. One is a severe battle of attrition where he spends 90% of the time taking up far too much space and chasing you around the chamber. He's completely invulnerable and chipping away at your health with random movement patterns that require tricky maneuvering, before deciding via what seems like RNG to make himself a target for like a 5th of a second. lol Some of the required actions to advance or gain an almost necessary edge in terms of equipment can be slightly obtuse, and finding quest important items in random chests in dungeons is kind of jarring, if not vaguely explained away in-game. It's rather linear too, but segues into the sequel nicely.

You don't swing a sword or cast spells in this game, you simply run into enemies and depending on the trajectory of your bump, you do x amount of damage and take y amount of damage from the enemy.  There's something to say about just bashing into your enemies, like how any Pac-Man action game should've played out.  You still get equipment and stuff, but it just affects how much damage you do and how much you take.  Level-ups are also a huge thing in this game.  They make big differences and an enemy that was giving you trouble on Lv.4 is trivialized by being Lv.6.  It's also very likely you'll hit the level cap a ways before the end of the game.\n\nThis version of the game has a few different alterations to choose from.  You can change the character portraits between a classic and remake version and there's also a number of different soundtrack styles to pick from.  This is a cool feature more remake games should try to implement.\n\nBeing a remake of an older game, Ys I gives you a bit more freedom to go about things than a more modern game of this type would.  It doesn't give you equipment to start the game and it's quite likely you'll head into your first dose of bump combat outside the initial village and die.  That said, annoying as that can be, it also lets you find good accessories and armor early on by not gating certain areas, so if you feel like running around a mine dodging enemies, you can loot the place a number of levels before you're supposed to head there.  There's a decent bit of interesting things like this in the game.\n\nThe game lets you save wherever, whenever.  Thank you Falcom for this.  I don't care for arbitrary save-points, and this being a a PC game, I like being able to save a step away from a boss in case I die and not have to re-run parts of the dungeon.  As for the bosses, there are two in particular that are just extremely annoying and got me this close to putting the game away for good.  This is mainly because bump combat makes fighting them a pain.  The story is completely throwaway.\n\nAll said, a solid 2-D action/RPG that's fairly short.  Has some interesting old-school conventions in not holding your hand at times but can be frustrating due to game mechanics and how reliant the game is on levels.", "timestamp_created": 1403709863, "timestamp_updated": 1403710006, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467980", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10781928": {"recommendationid": "10781928", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050981100", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 256, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1373823943}, "language": "english", "review": "okay", "timestamp_created": 1403669925, "timestamp_updated": 1403669925, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10763288": {"recommendationid": "10763288", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031537605", "num_games_owned": 164, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 524, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1375148936}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is very fun and a great pick for any classic fantasy games !

I never played the originals but I remember reading about them in gaming magazines and had some brief experience with one of them on the Super Nintendo so long ago.  Ever since then I've always beeen curious to see what the Ys games are about.\n\nThe game is fast paced with a very simple interface.  The entire combat system is bump based.  Just run into badies and they die.  The challenge is that you cannot hit them directly on center or you will take damage.  It takes quite a bit of getting used to and you can quickly impale yourself on your enemies sword on Nightmare difficulty.  The music is just as energetic as the gameplay and keeps you moving along.  The xp system like all xp systems allows you to grind but you'll find no need to do so.  The character seems to level fast enough without the need to spend extra time smashing bad guys for no reason.  Which you'll probably do anyway because why not tackle everything in sight?!\n\nThe story is fairly short and seems oddly familiar like most games of its era.  For some this may be disapointing.  I honestly enjoyed playing through the game with it's clear story that stays on track.  So many JRPGs of late take steps way out into the realm of crazy and confusing.  This game keeps it simple.  By the end I was satisfied but don't expect to spend countless hours in this game because it has no side quests or objectives at all.\n\nFinal Verdict: Neutral \nBuy this game if you're a fan of Ys and like short games.

You don't need to hit an \"attack\" button to smite your foes, and you don't need to hit a \"dodge\" or \"block\" button to deftly evade their attacks. Frankly, you could play most of this game with one hand. If that doesn't sound particularly entertaining, this game probably isn't for you.\n\nStory-wise, you're looking at a pretty generic JRPG plotline - some warrior-type wakes up in some village, and goes on a quest to slay monsters and ultimately save the world/kingdom/etc. It's a little more detailed than that (as one might hope), but I'm sure any prospective players would prefer to not have the spoilers.\n\nAnyway, if you want an action/RPG that's a bit on the light side, this is as good a game as any. $15 is a pretty reasonable price tag for two games, and if you snag it on sale, so much the better.", "timestamp_created": 1397534301, "timestamp_updated": 1397534301, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9755263": {"recommendationid": "9755263", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053785400", "num_games_owned": 378, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2469, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503843431}, "language": "french", "review": "Ys r\u00e9sonne comme un nom magique et mystique, et se veut l'\u00e9cho d'un \u00e2ge d'or r\u00e9volu, d'apr\u00e8s une cit\u00e9 bretonne perdue mais aussi une qu\u00eate des origines du monde, de l'humain, du Divin et du Mal. On incarne dans ces deux jeux Adol Christin, un jeune homme \u00e0 la chevelure rouge singuli\u00e8re qui le d\u00e9signe presque d\u00e9j\u00e0 comme quelqu'un \u00e0 part et un \u00e9lu, originaire de la France peut-\u00eatre bien, qui voyage vers Esteria \u00e0 travers un myst\u00e9rieux voile maritime, pour s'assurer de ce qui se passe vraiment dans cette contr\u00e9e r\u00e9put\u00e9e maudite. Adol d\u00e9couvre un pays dont les quelques villes sont quasiment assi\u00e9g\u00e9es par des hordes de cr\u00e9atures d\u00e9moniaques qui, depuis six mois, m\u00e8nent la vie dure \u00e0 des habitants parmi lesquels certains d\u00e9sesp\u00e8rent, et d'autres s'organisent pour r\u00e9sister.

Les graphismes sont soign\u00e9s, color\u00e9s, tandis que les nouveaux formats permettent de profiter des \u00e9crans larges actuels. Il faut souligner la tr\u00e8s bonne qualit\u00e9 des introductions anim\u00e9es des deux opus, ainsi que celle des artworks qui repr\u00e9sentent les personnages les plus importants de l'histoire, artworks qui existent en deux versions (Complete et Chronicles). Ces personnages en deviennent d'autant plus vivants et attachants. A ce propos, si les villes sont assez peu nombreuses dans le jeu, elles disposent toutes d'une identit\u00e9, surtout dans le 2 visuellement parlant, et les personnages ont tous une personnalit\u00e9, de mani\u00e8re assez \u00e9tonnamment cr\u00e9dible au vu de la date de la premi\u00e8re publication de ces jeux. Ainsi, les dialogues de chaque personnage \u00e9voluent avec les phases de jeu qui s'encha\u00eenent, faisant r\u00e9agir la population aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui surviennent au cours des aventures d'Adol - on poss\u00e8de m\u00eame un carnet r\u00e9pertoriant chaque personnage rencontr\u00e9, avec une petite description, tout comme pour les monstres. Les s\u00e9quences sc\u00e9naris\u00e9es impliquant ces personnages ne sont pas rares, contribuant \u00e0 rendre le jeu plus vivant. A mettre au cr\u00e9dit de la r\u00e9alisation, les musiques contribuent puissamment \u00e0 rendre Ys et ses contr\u00e9es enchanteresses, m\u00e9lancoliques, mystiques, joyeuses, bucoliques ou... endiabl\u00e9es, tant les arrangements et reprises du JDK Band font montre d'un rock ma\u00eetris\u00e9 et entra\u00eenant qu'on ne se lasse pas d'\u00e9couter, et qui en deviendrait presque un pr\u00e9texte \u00e0 jouer.\n\nLes combats constituent une des originalit\u00e9s les plus \u00e9videntes de ces deux jeux, puisqu'il ne s'agit pas d'appuyer sur une touche pour enclencher une action en maniant quelque arme, mais bien de foncer sur l'ennemi pour le blesser ! Attention, se jeter en pleine face de son opposant serait une grave erreur, le bump system implique de d\u00e9centrer l'assaut, voire d'attaquer par derri\u00e8re ou en diagonale dans l'id\u00e9al. Cela requiert un temps d'adaptation, mais cr\u00e9e un dynamisme ind\u00e9niable (privil\u00e9giez l'emploi d'une manette avec un stick cela dit), alors qu'un peu de difficult\u00e9 n'est pas malvenue. Ys est en effet un jeu qui n'est pas sans d\u00e9fis : pour assez court qu'il soit (encore que prendre le temps de parler \u00e0 chacun, de compl\u00e9ter la liste des monstres et de leurs statistiques, ou jouer en nightmare puisse changer la donne !), le joueur n'est pas pris par la main comme dans nombre de productions actuelles. On ne poss\u00e8de pas de journal pour s'orienter vers la prochaine \u00e9tape de l'aventure (m\u00eame s'il s'agit de demeurer attentif \u00e0 ce que disent les gens principalement, \u00e0 qui on peut donner des cadeaux dans Ys 2 pour leur d\u00e9lier la langue un peu plus) ; on n'a pas plus droit \u00e0 une carte du monde (la surface est assez r\u00e9duite, Ys 1 comportant un peu plus de verdure au d\u00e9but) ou des donjons (Ys 1 comportant une mine et une tour finale assez labyrinthiques) ; il n'existe pas de magie de gu\u00e9rison (mais on peut se reposer en attendant pour que l'\u00e9nergie remonte, sous certaines conditions), et Ys 1 ne dispose pas d'objets de gu\u00e9rison, quand le 2 est l\u00e9g\u00e8rement plus souple sur ce point. Ce dernier opus introduit d'ailleurs un emploi de la magie qui, avec des attaques \u00e0 distance notamment donc, facilite ou plut\u00f4t enrichit la jouabilit\u00e9. Les boss sont ce qu'il y a de plus terrible dans le jeu en mode nightmare, certains \u00e9tant r\u00e9put\u00e9s en faire baver, tout particuli\u00e8rement dans le premier l\u00e0 encore, et les vaincre exige concentration, observation et pers\u00e9v\u00e9rance.\n\nEn r\u00e9sum\u00e9, Ys I & II Chronicles respire la douce fragrance d'une \u00e8re ancienne des jeux de r\u00f4le qui faisait se combiner une atmosph\u00e8re charmante, po\u00e9tique, l\u00e9gendaire et myst\u00e9rieuse, ne n\u00e9gligeant pas pour autant l'humour (celui-ci est tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9sent dans les dialogues et certaines situations gentiment loufoques, sans compter qu'on peut parler avec les d\u00e9mons dans le 2 pour un c\u00f4t\u00e9 souvent d\u00e9cal\u00e9 !), avec une jouabilit\u00e9 efficace et dynamique, au service d'une trame qui apporte son lot de d\u00e9fis et invite \u00e0 se d\u00e9passer.", "timestamp_created": 1396889055, "timestamp_updated": 1396889055, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9742548": {"recommendationid": "9742548", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060610528", "num_games_owned": 299, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 903, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1417345528}, "language": "english", "review": "A briliant version of the first two games.

The game itself is very frustrating, but not in a good way that encourages you to grind more and level up (the player's level caps at Level 10 and I reached that after the second boss of I think seven), but in a demotivating way, that makes you wanna dump this insult to the RPG genre. The frustration does not come from the difficulty of the game, but from the ridiculously bad battle system - you basically have to ambush the enemy from a certain angle to damage him without being injured, what becomes very boring and annoying - especially during boss battles. And it always is a gamble.\n\nNow that we talk about boss battles, I have to mention something: The bosses don't have ANY relation to the story and fighting them is even more repetetive than grinding. The player needs to think of a different approach for every boss, which  I quite liked, but once he figured out what to do, the boss battle loses everything that made it interesting - and even that was little. Especially the second to last boss had nothing to do with having fun playing a game. It was mere routine and repetitive ambushing from a certain angle for about 5 minutes.\n\nIn short: If you have the money and want to experience this failure of developers and an insult to RPGs and RPG fans, then go ahead and buy Ys I. Else I'd recommend buying 14 cheese burgers with the cash. I certainly regret not having done that.\n\nI have only played Ys I and I will give Ys II a chance, but not just yet.

It was very easy to pickup and immerse myself In. It it reminiscent of old SNES games in both the style of artwork, play style and difficulty. The combat system is easy to learn, but it takes real skill to master. Basically you run into enemies until they explode. This makes for really quick gameplay and doesn't take away from the pace of the game. This is one of the few games I've played where difficulty actually dictates the game, the hardest difficulty isn't like most games, enemies aren't just stronger, the bosses have different attack patterns, are less forgiving and gold and xp are harder to come by, also every enemie after a certain point has max health. I have beat the game on Nightmare, for my first playthough I was enjoyable, and not soul crushing as most games on the hardest difficulty are, as you can save basically whenever except boss fights. A couple of drawbacks that Ys I has is that you reach the max level fairly early, as LVL 10 comes quick when your grinding for a new set of gear, and you'll almost always do Darm's tower at the max level. Ys 1 is also a fairly short game when you get down to it but, the final boss, Dark Fact, singlehandedly one of the hardest bosses I've ever faced. Also filling the bestary takes a load of time and makes it seem to fall into the department of redundancy department when your slaying megabeasts just for the entry at the top of Darm's tower.

Das oberste Level Limit ist 10 (ja genau 10), Geld brauchte ich nicht ausgeben ausser zum Anfang weil ansonsten das Spiel nicht weiter geht. Im ganzen Spiel brauchte ich nicht kaufen, da das ganze Equipment in den Paar Dungeons die es gibt versteckt war. Das Kampf System ist eher defensiv man rempelt die Gegner seitlich an und verletzt sie dann damit, man kann nicht selbst mit dem Schwert zuschlagen oder mit dem Schild blocke. Die Dungeons sind mit Gegnern und Endbossen versehen.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGrafik:\n\nIst sehr sch\u00f6n gemacht, Grafisch eher mit Terranigma zu vergleichen.

I'd say if your a fan of the game get it, but if your like me who never even heard of ys I'd totally pass. Its a game for games sake but that is about it to be honest. As soon as I finished it I deleted it and never plan on going back. I was disappointed. Thankfuly this was a christmas gift so I got it for free, my friend claims he can beat it in 30 minutes and I still think he's lying as it took me  4 hrs via using google taking pics of the maps with my phone and going back into the game so that I could figure out where I was and what I needed to do.

The game is largely unforgiving and boss fights will make you want to tear your hair out as they rely more on luck and chance than actual skill. When starting the game for the first time, I highly recommend normal difficulty and secondly, to save often as there is no automatic save feature. All in all, the game is a 3.5/5.\n\nOriginally for the PC-Engine, Ys was released in 1987 and received critical and commercial acclaim. It paved the way for Ys being a flagship RPG title in Japan and with localizations in the US. Interestingly enough, the story may have roots in the mythical city of Ys (Is) that was built off of the coast of Brittany in northwestern France, a city that had befallen the same plight as Sodom and Gomorrah and due to the sinfulness of its' inhabitants found itself swallowed up by the sea. The world of the game Ys however, takes place on an island called Esteria, where the ancient kingdom of Ys once stood. A young adventurer named Adol Christin decides to cross the Stormfront, a massive seastorm isolating Esteria, and finds himself shipwrecked and rescued. Nursed back, Adol adventures through the land and a seer named Sara guides him into collecting the books of Ys. Six books that tell of the history and downfall of the ancient kingdom of Ys. As Adol goes forth to collect these books, he will meet a host of characters that shape and guide his adventure until the fateful encounter on top of Darm Tower.\n\nPlot-wise and of course understanding that this is a remake, I found no real issues, things generally made sense and where I needed to go next was generally not a problem. There are only a few characters that you will meet reoccuringly, but given that the game is roughly 5-6 hours long, you won't develop any strong bonds with any supporting characters.\n\nThe gameplay probably needs the biggest explanation as it really doesn't fit nicely into any game I've played. Sure, the easiest way to explain it is, \"it's like The Legend of Zelda,\" but even then there are some big differences. You don't control any type of attack animation, to attack an enemy target you simply move Adol into them. If you're offset, or hit them from the side or behind, you do damage and avoid damage to Adol. This can be frustrating sometimes, find enemies in a narrow corridor and your options are limited, enemies move at the last moment and you get damaged. Just remember that saving often is imperative in this game, there is no auto-save and you will die alot...ALOT. Just the first few battle sequences are challenging and once you start your first boss battle it will be harsh and unforgiving. Adol does level up with each monster he defeats, but there is a cap at Level 10, which you will probably have by mid-game. You can't simply farm yourself or strongarm yourself through the game, and being anything less than level 10 by the time you tackle Darm Tower is suicide.\n\nThere are some bosses that will just make you livid and frustrate you. The final boss is the perfect example, because it's simply a matter of luck and chance rather than skill that will carry you to win. The first boss can also frustrate new players because of how unforgiving one wrong move can be, but remember to save before each boss battle and to just keep trying. It took me about 40 tries to get the final boss, and the more you play it the easier it will become to predict his pathway.\n\nThe graphics is so-so, it's a remake but obviously there are limitations in how much could be changed without alientating the fans. The music is fantastic in some levels, especially when you start up Darm Tower, and although I never played the original, I'm guessing that they are remakes from the original PC-Engine tunes.\n\nOverall, if you want a quick but challenging action-RPG, I would recommend Ys I. I'm planning on playing the second game, and with everything I've read it should improve on everything from the first game. 3.5/5", "timestamp_created": 1390689155, "timestamp_updated": 1390689155, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8839333": {"recommendationid": "8839333", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999512560", "num_games_owned": 383, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 955, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1390641123}, "language": "english", "review": "Too hard to be fun.", "timestamp_created": 1390641573, "timestamp_updated": 1390641573, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.376373", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8838036": {"recommendationid": "8838036", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982493025", "num_games_owned": 2959, "num_reviews": 157, "playtime_forever": 310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1397346500}, "language": "english", "review": "Wandering Aimlessly: The Game", "timestamp_created": 1390629450, "timestamp_updated": 1390629450, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490534", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8832405": {"recommendationid": "8832405", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002854407", "num_games_owned": 223, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 768, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1390358712}, "language": "english", "review": "Ys Chronicles+ is a decent two-for-one package, though mostly only for the second of the two games provided.\n\n[u][b]Ys I[/b][/u]\n\n[i]Ys I[/i] was originally developed in the 80's as one of Falcom's first games, and its age clearly shows. Normal enemies are all incapable of anything but walking in the four cardinal directions and attempting to ram your character for damage, with the only difference between enemies being the damage they deal, the amount of hits it takes to kill them, and the speed at which they move. It ends up making for pretty dull, repetitive combat once you get the handle of the bump combat system. This is slightly broken up by the boss fights, but sadly boss design typically only falls into one of two categories: Ridiculously easy, or obnoxiously random/luck based. \n\nMoney and exp distribution in [i]Ys I[/i] is somewhat unbalanced as well. You'll most likely reach the low level cap well before even starting the final dungeon (which makes up about half the game). You'll also get tons of money drops in the final dungeon, all of which is completely useless since you can't backtrack out of the last dungeon to buy more items. There is a positive side to this, however, as it does mean you can bypass late-game enemies without worrying about missing out on anything (unless you're an achievement completionist).\n\n[i]Ys I[/i] does have a few redeeming traits, though. There's a wide selection of difficulty levels to accomodate any player. The combat system is extremely simple and easy to pick up, and as a whole, the game is short enough for the combat to avoid getting [i]too[/i] tedious and repetitive. The story is decent with a fairly wide variety of characters. The updated visuals look nice, and the rearranged rock soundtrack is absolutely kickass.\n\nOverall, [i]Ys I[/i] is not [i]that[/i] bad of a game, but its age clearly shows. I would only recommend [i]Ys I[/i] to players who are already fans of the Ys franchise. For those just looking to get into the Ys universe, I'd instead recommend starting with this game's prequel, [i]Ys Origin[/i]. \n\n[b]Overall: 6/10[/b]\n\n[b][u]Ys II[/u][/b]\n\nNow this is a massive step up from before. [i]Ys II[/i] pretty much addresses everything that was wrong with [i]Ys I[/i] fantastically. \n\nCombat is [i]much[/i] more engaging. Basic enemies can now move in more than the basic four directions, and have varying traits beyond boasting different strength, HP, and speed values. Some enemies are immune to certain types of damage, some have projectile attacks, and some have much more erratic movement patterns than others. Boss design is much stronger in this game as well. Successfully taking one down feels like a good accomplishment, rather than being a free victory or a matter of getting a good dice roll.\n\nAnother big change is the introduction of a magic system. This allows for alternative combat options to the old bump system. You can use fire magic to attack at a range, time magic to freeze enemies and make them easier to kill, or alter magic to turn yourself into a demon and avoid enemies altogether. The amount of detail put into the alter magic is impressive; every single enemy spawn in the game has unique dialogue that you can trigger while in demon form.\n\nThe level system is now broken up from a short 10 level system to a more game-length-appropriate 55 level system. This allows for more consistent growth throughout the game with level-ups occurring at a fairly frequent pace. There is also a significantly higher amount of items for purchase throughout the game, ensuring that gold keeps its value throughout the duration of the game without abruptly becoming totally useless halfway through.\n\nThe strong traits from [i]Ys I[/i] are also present here: Good variety of difficulty levels, strong storyline and cast of characters, nice visuals, and a robust modernized rock soundtrack. The game is somewhat longer than [i]Ys I[/i], but thanks to all the fixes to the problems mentioned above, that instead simply amounts to there being more of a good thing.\n\nOverall, [i]Ys II[/i] manages to take the same formula from [i]Ys I[/i] and turn it into something pretty impressive, especially considering its age. It still stands up remarkably well today, and it's a game I would not hesitate to recommend to anyone who is interested in a more old-school action RPG.\n\n[b]Overall: 8.5/10[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1390589281, "timestamp_updated": 1390621423, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.573580", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8825460": {"recommendationid": "8825460", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097382921", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 1212, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1434122426}, "language": "danish", "review": "a Great classic  Ys is one of my most loved game series \ni reccomend this game to all that like good old rpg action adventure \nwith no turnbased waiting in battles \nit looks and plays very nice and the music is great as allways with Ys \nif you like classic rpg action adventure then you show give it a try :)", "timestamp_created": 1390531562, "timestamp_updated": 1390531562, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8812925": {"recommendationid": "8812925", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975101989", "num_games_owned": 430, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 386, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1390275494}, "language": "english", "review": "As far as remakes go, this isn't half bad.

The sprite and character portrait artwork, whether you choose the older or newer style for portraits, is beautiful. As are the soundtracks. Likewise the bump combat system is fun and fast once you get into it (I highly recommend using a controller) and the magic system mixes things up a bit for boss battles in Y II. \n\nWhile I don't think there's a bad song in either game, they do suffer a bit from a shortage of tracks. Most areas have only one song, and some songs are spread out over several areas. This problem is alleviated somewhat by the ability to change which version of the soundtrack you're listening to on the fly. Tired of the Chronicles orchestration? Switch to the Complete edition's midi rendition, tired of that? Switch to the original PC-88 version. You can do the same for character portrait style if you want to change that at any point in the game.\n\nProbably the biggest problem with this package is the bosses for Y I, in that they're all terrible and mostly very easy. The Ys I end boss battle is especially bad because it hinges a great deal on luck. But don't let these minor annoyances stop you from enjoying two beautiful and surprisingly touching classics of the jRPG genre.

While the first game is 5 hours long, the second one will take you around 8-13 hours to beat. \n\nAudio: If you don't like Yuzo Koshiro for some odd reason, then you shouldn't get this game.

There are obviously a few flaws to the game such as an awkward leveling system (only in the first one), and inconsistent difficulty between bosses (also more prevalent in the first one), but the pros definitely outperform the cons for this fantastic epic.\n\nAlso as a side remainder, there is a heavy lack of jRPG ports on PC from Japan to America. This is indeed a very sad, but real problem that we have had for the past many years now. XSEED is famous for making ports like these a reality for many of us niche players, as well as other rpg-gamers who enjoy these sort of games. This is why I urge anyone who actually enjoys jRPGs and especially the Ys franchise to support XSEED and purchase all 4 Ys games they've published so far (Ys I and II are packed, so it's 3 in the store along with Oath and Origins). With continued support we can expect XSEED to translate and pot even more jRPGs in the future, and that's the kind of thing that I could only dream of for so long up until now.\n\nSo please, I know many people tend to pirate games since money is indeed a hard thing to come by, but make an exception to this great franchise, especially since it tends to go on sale once in a while for 75% off. It's how we can secure a good future for the ported/translated pc jRPG market.", "timestamp_created": 1388853032, "timestamp_updated": 1388853032, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8554922": {"recommendationid": "8554922", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008816635", "num_games_owned": 318, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1179, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453854362}, "language": "english", "review": "Good old school rpg.\n\nThis game contains some interesting story telling although it's a bit unpolished, but it's still good for its time.\nThis game also require frequent saving as you may die anytime because of the bumping system.\n\nThe boss may need some strategy to defeat, it is punishing but rewarding.\n\nSpoiler Free.\n- Don't give up hope when fighting the last boss.

I highly reccomend this game to anyone that are fans of RPG,s / action titles.\n\nI have yet to start YS 2, but YS 1 truly hooks you right away with a great style of presentation that the series is known for, although a little on the short side [10-15 hours or so] thats only the first title of the game. It intially threw me off guard that you need to run into enemies to do damage but that quickly subsides after an hour or so. Ys games are well known for their difficulty and amazing music and boss fights and this game does not dissapoint in the slightest. The soundtrack is fantastic and always fit the mood/setting perfectly. it is just pure joy to hack and slash dozens of monsters while exploring this intriguing envronment.  the boss fights are also challenging and on thing i love about the game is it does not hold your hand, you are free to explore wherever you will even if that means multple deaths trying to reach that elusive chest or just testing the waters in a new area, that lack of linearity is something i love about the YS games and this is no exception.\n\nA simple yet dynamic equipment system, a great bestiary and plenty of personality in the NPC's is something i love about the YS titles and this one delivers in that regard yet again. this game came out quite long ago [1997 or so] and i can definitely say it has stood the test of time as it is very enjoyable which is an impressive feat in itself.\n\nHonestly, i reccomend this game to its fullest extent. the YS series is one of the most unique and under appreciated RPG series out there and it deserves much more recognition. With the new YS game on PSP Vita just coming out, im hoping this series continues to excel at what it does best. Amazing soundtrack, Fun hack and slash elements, fantastic NPC's,  great sense of exploration, and a simplistic yet great plot are thing you will find in Ys 1+2. \n\nI sincerely reccomend it!\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1388694673, "timestamp_updated": 1388694673, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8509247": {"recommendationid": "8509247", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042297826", "num_games_owned": 828, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1388672186}, "language": "french", "review": "Ys est une s\u00e9rie bien connu dans le J-RPG, elle a put se faire un petit nom et sur Steam le publique occidental \u00e0 le droit au deux plus mauvais jeux de la s\u00e9rie!\nSi c'est pas beau \u00e7a, on vend pas assez bien chez nous alors on peut tenter d'aller refourger nos merdes au reste du monde, quel belle fa\u00e7on de faire des affaires...

S\u00ed; tiene dise\u00f1os bonitos, los sprites est\u00e1n bien detallados y en general, luce bien para ser el juego que es. Adem\u00e1s, la banda sonora es pegadiza, y las ilustraciones con est\u00e9tica manga que acompa\u00f1an algunas conversaciones ayuda a la est\u00e9tica del juego.\n\nPERO... no puedo recomend\u00e1rselo a nadie.

Y encima tienes que moverte sin un mapa. \u00bfTan dif\u00edcil es programar un jodido mapa? No me jodas... muchas veces tienes que ir corriendo de zona en zona hasta que encuentras el camino correcto.\nHasta el escenario est\u00e1 programado como el ano, porque al entrar por una puerta, una vez dentro del edificio te ponen la puerta al rev\u00e9s de por donde has entrado, por lo que si sigues tirando para adelante, entras en un bucle de entrar y salir del edificio.

As spoiler-free as possible. It started out pretty straightforward, and once I accidentally discovered some game mechanics which for some reason weren't mentioned in game at all, it wasn't too challenging early on (which it shouldn't be anyway, on Normal).\n\nLater on, there didn't seem to be much direction whatsoever, and I eventually just got into the habit of checking a walkthrough every step of the way just because I wanted to finish it. Half the time after following the directions I just laughed, thinking \"how the hell was I supposed to know to do that?\". There is vague direction, but it's mostly trial and error if you're trying to move on with only the information the game gives you. I don't know if it's supposed to be like that, maybe figuring out the randomest things imaginable is supposed to be the actual challenge of the game. The challenge certainly isn't from the bosses, those are either pathetically easy or laughably luck-based. I liked the easy ones more.\n\nThe final boss is just the worst, without spoiling things, I can only say that it has absolutely nothing done right about it. It's flat-out horrible in terms of story, gameplay, and, well... The music isn't that bad actually, the first few times. Unfortunately if you can't get the luck you need to beat him early, you may wind up listening to the same music for hours.\n\nThat's generally how the music in this game is, throughout the whole game. The game doesn't really have any bad music, but most of it is heard for too long, making it tedious, and it gets annoying after a while. If you want to simulate the experience without playing the game, look up one of the songs on YouTube or something, listen to it once. It's pretty good, right? Now listen to it again, for about an hour, and see if it's still good. One positive thing is that there are three different versions of music you can choose from, one from what I assume was the original version of the game, one from this modern version, and one from in between.

The story is pretty simple and the hero is a bland, enthusiastic young kid but the gameplay easily supports the game's few negatives. And after you're done the achievements are a lot of fun to go back and solve.\n\nYs I: The leveling system is so perfect in the first game. Every level makes you feel more powerful and that you've achieved something. The maps are serpentine but not too frustrating. The areas feel distinct and the art is just beautiful. The boss battles are really quite wonderful and the final boss was easily the hardest part of the game for me. It involved so much genuine strategy and forethought that finishing the game felt so darn satisfying.\n\nYs II: Very similar to the first game in music, art, maps, story, and combat but with the introduction of magic. One spell basically dresses you in a kangaroo onesie so you can talk to enemies. Every enemy. I honestly felt bad for killing hoardes of enemies that just wanted to go home but were there because I was their badguy. The biggest negative would have to be the final boss. They were a joke and the easiest boss in the game due to the items they give you beforehand. The third boss gets a special mention because they may be the most horrifying thing I have ever seen in 16-bit.

Instead of pressing buttons to use your weapon, you run into enemies to hurt them.\nYes, you run into them. \nThis is the first game I've ever seen to use such combat mechanics. And no, I'm not saying it's bad, but it really needs some getting used to, especially at the start of the game, when you have very low health and many monsters can kill you pretty quickly.\nYou also run into NPCs to talk to them, which can be annoying once in a while, because they tend to walk around aimlessly, often crossing your path, which leads you to run into them, which triggers a conversation (or a monologue, to be exact).\nAfter you familiarized yourself with the combat, you shouldn't have too many problems along the way, although some of the boss fights might be a tad annoying (especially the end boss).\n\nOther than the combat, the game is pretty much your standard fantasy action RPG. You have lots of characters to talk to, many places to visit, monsters to fight, equipment to get and so on and you really should pay close attention to everything or you might miss some rather important things. And I'm not talking story here, I'm talking equipment, that is rather vital to your survival and progress.\n\nThe game features not only a great soundtrack, but it also looks really nice. Reminds me of the good old action RPGs of the past, which this game actually is, too, as it was first released around 1988.\n\nThe combat is rather strange, but apart from that this is an absolutely great and fun game, albeit a bit challenging from time to time.\nIf you've played The Oath in Felghana and/or Origin, give this game a try, too, even though the combat is vastly different.\nAnd if this is your first Ys game and you didn't like it (because of the combat), give Origin and The Oath in Felghana a try, because it has pretty much your standard action RPG combat.\n\n\n[b]ADDITION:[/b]\nJust finished Ys II, but as you can't write a separate review for it, I'll add it to the review on Ys I.\n\nThe sequel takes place pretty much right after the end of Ys I.\nAfter killing Dark Fakt, you're transported to Ys, where you have to once again defeat evil.\n\nThe story is, obviously, pretty standard for a JRPG: save the world from evil and stuff.\n\nGameplay-wise it didn't change much, but additionally to the bump combat you now get to use magic, too, which I only used in the boss fights (where you have to use it, because most bosses are immune to melee attacks). The bump combat stayed pretty much the same, although I found it to be much easier to kill enemies now. Just run diagonally into them and keep on doing that and the enemy can't evade or counter in any way. You obviously have to look out for other enemies while doing that.\n\nThe graphics, imo, have aged pretty well. While it certainly isn't some fancy 3D stuff, the graphics look absolutely beautiful, especially when you consider that the game is over 25 years old.\n\nThe soundtrack, again, is quite good, too and you can even find the whole soundtrack in your Steam folder! And not just the new arrangements, but the original versions, too :)\n\nIf you liked the first game, then playing this should be a no-brainer, especially because you already own it anyway :P", "timestamp_created": 1388414209, "timestamp_updated": 1389606536, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495050", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8418763": {"recommendationid": "8418763", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990552908", "num_games_owned": 225, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 697, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451895298}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty good, I decided to put the difficult to Nightmare even though it almost made me give up in Ys 3 and Origin, however it ended up being a good choice since the was pretty easy overall anyway.

The game rewards you for exploring everthing especially when the game now has achievements. One last thing you will love about them is the great presentation.The games visuals are astounding even when in the animated cutscenes.

Equipment and story progression is fairly single-track and are not very deep in and of themselves. It\u2019s impressive when you factor in the time and situation in which the game originally released, but it just doesn\u2019t hold up.\n\nThe art and music are great, and there is just enough story to hold everything together. It was quite interesting to see the \u201ccallbacks\u201d to Origin, having played them in the chronological order instead of the release order. I probably derived more enjoyment from these ties rather than from the game itself. The music is fantastic, and I probably enjoyed this soundtrack here more than that of Celceta.

Apesar disso ela possui grande quantidade de jogos com qualidade incontest\u00e1vel, sendo obrigat\u00f3ria para qualquer f\u00e3 de RPGs que se preze.\n\nYs I: Ancient Ys Vanished \u00e9 o primeiro jogo da franquia, lan\u00e7ado originalmente pela Nihon Falcom em 1987, inicialmente para o PC-8801. Houve muitos relan\u00e7amentos para as mais diversas plataformas ao longo dos anos, Ys I Chronicles + \u00e9 a ultima e mais atualizada vers\u00e3o do jogo, lan\u00e7ada na Steam em fevereiro de 2013, numa colet\u00e2nea contendo os dois primeiros jogos da serie, denominada Ys I & II Chronicles +.\n\nO jogo narra as primeiras aventuras do jovem espadachim de cabelos vermelhos Adol Christian, grande protagonista da s\u00e9rie. A aventura se inicia com Adol navegando pelo mar, rumo a ilha de Esteria a fim de investigar a violenta tempestade que apareceu na regi\u00e3o, impedindo qualquer um de entrar ou sair do lugar, quando \u00e9 subitamente pego por ela e tem sue barco naufragado e vai parar na ilha. Adol \u00e9 salvo por Slaff, chefe da mil\u00edcia da cidade portu\u00e1ria de Barbado, ap\u00f3s acordar na casa de um medico, ele lhe explica que a tempestade apareceu a cerca de seis meses e junto com ela monstros e dem\u00f4nios come\u00e7aram a assolar a regi\u00e3o inexplicavelmente, Adol ent\u00e3o decide ajudar a investigar o ocorrido. Durante a aventura ele vai receber a ajuda da cartomante Sara, que diz que ele vai desempenhar um papal fundamentou no destino de Esteria, e que para salvar aquele lugar ele precisar reunir os seis livros de Ys, que contam a hist\u00f3ria da ascens\u00e3o e queda do reino de Ys, e assim se inicia a jornada de Adol.\n\nA hist\u00f3ria pode parecer chicle para os padr\u00f5es de hoje (considerando a \u00e9poca que ele foi originalmente lan\u00e7ado, n\u00e3o era), mas no decorrer da aventura a trama vai se tornando mais complexa. A hist\u00f3ria foi muito bem desenvolvida (como se espera em um bom RPG) e consegue prender o jogador do come\u00e7o ao fim. H\u00e1 tamb\u00e9m muitos personagens carism\u00e1ticos e marcantes, muitos deles v\u00e3o desempenhar um papel fundamental na hist\u00f3ria do jogo, que s\u00f3 \u00e9 conclu\u00edda no segundo capitulo da serie (Ys II Chronicles +), por isso \u00e9 essencial se atentar aos acontecimentos durante o jogo.\n\nAdol n\u00e3o possui falas, cabendo ao jogador entrar na pele do personagem, interagir com os NPCs e ler manuscritos para entender um pouco mais sobre os acontecimentos.\n\nO jogo possui um mapa aberto, que pode ser explorado a qualquer momento pelo jogador, ou seja, voc\u00ea pode ir e vir passear pelas cidades, mapas e cavernas sem necessariamente ter que fazer isso em uma ordem especifica. Esse sistema de explora\u00e7\u00e3o foi muito revolucion\u00e1rio para a \u00e9poca, sendo Ys e The Legend of Zelda os pioneiros em oferecer esta possibilidade, mas assim como o titulo da BIG N voc\u00ea tem um sistema de quests bem linear, onde para avan\u00e7ar na historia \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio cumprir um objetivo e s\u00f3 assim avan\u00e7ar para o pr\u00f3ximo.\n\nComo dito anteriormente Ys I teve diversas vers\u00f5es ao longo dos anos, com diversas melhorias, principalmente nas partes gr\u00e1fica e sonora do jogo, mas um elemento que ficou intacto foi o sistema de batalha, que \u00e9 o principal defeito do jogo. As batalhas acontecem em tempo real atrav\u00e9s de um sistema conhecido como Bump\u00b4n\u00b4Slash, onde n\u00e3o \u00e9 preciso apertar um bot\u00e3o para atacar e sim ir em dire\u00e7\u00e3o aos advers\u00e1rios, mas se voc\u00ea bater de frente com eles vai levar dano, sendo necess\u00e1rio escolher o melhor \u00e2ngulo para desferir um golpe e sair ileso, isso pode parecer simples, mas dado o baixo HP do personagem e o alto poder dos advers\u00e1rios, recorrer a uma boa estrat\u00e9gia \u00e9 essencial para n\u00e3o morrer, principalmente quando voc\u00ea estiver cercado.\n\nOs monstros do jogo s\u00e3o relativamente fortes, sendo necess\u00e1rio treino e pratica para n\u00e3o morrer nos primeiros n\u00edveis. Mas o que faz o jogo ser realmente dif\u00edcil s\u00e3o as batalhas contra chefes. Primeiramente voc\u00ea n\u00e3o pode acessar o menu, sendo assim n\u00e3o poder\u00e1 trocar de equipamentos ou utilizar itens como nas batalhas normais, al\u00e9m disso os chefes s\u00e3o bem fortes e \u00e1geis, o que requer do jogar muita habilidade e conhecimento pr\u00e9vio das mec\u00e2nicas de cada um deles para poder se dar bem, isso vale para todos os outros jogos da serie Ys (os que eu joguei pelo menos).\n\nO jogo \u00e9 limitado a apenas 10 n\u00edveis que podem ser alcan\u00e7ados rapidamente pelo jogador, al\u00e9m disso, ha uma pequena variedade de equipamentos que voc\u00ea poder\u00e1 comprar e/ou encontrar durante a jornada, isso inclui espadas, escudos, armaduras e an\u00e9is com efeitos variados e s\u00f3. H\u00e1 tamb\u00e9m alguns itens que voc\u00ea pode utilizar, mais a maioria ser\u00e1 utilizada apenas em quests mesmo. Evoluir o personagem, e principalmente ter um bom equipamento vai ser essencial para progredir at\u00e9 o fim da aventura.\n\nO grande destaque vai para a trilha sonora, eu posso falar que \u00e9 uma das melhores trilhas sonoras que j\u00e1 tive o prazer de ouvir em um jogo, composta por ningu\u00e9m menos que Yuzo Koshiro, respons\u00e1vel pelas m\u00fasicas de jogos como Streets of Rage, Shenmue, Shinobi, alguns da franquia Sonic e a Castlevania. \u00c9 realmente incr\u00edvel como cada ambiente tem uma trilha sonora \u00fanica que combina exatamente com o momento e lugar. Todas as m\u00fasicas do jogo foram remasterizadas, melhorando e muito as vers\u00f5es originais, em todo caso \u00e9 poss\u00edvel escolher entre as vers\u00f5es original (8 bits) e a da vers\u00e3o Complete (n\u00e3o remasterizadas), para ouvir durante a jogatina. \n\nYs I \u00e9 relativamente curto, voc\u00ea pode termina-lo facilmente com 5 a 7 horas de gameplay na dificuldade normal, h\u00e1 tamb\u00e9m a dificuldade Nightmare para os jogadores mais dedicados. Ao terminar o jogo o modo Time Attack \u00e9 desbloqueado, nele voc\u00ea deve derrotar todos os chefes do jogo no menor tempo poss\u00edvel, isso com n\u00edveis e equipamentos ajustados a cada advers\u00e1rio, por conta disso a dificuldade ao enfrenta-los se torna ainda maior.\n\nA vers\u00e3o da Steam conta com sistema de conquistas e rank para o modo Time Attack, al\u00e9m de suporte a salvamento em nuvem. Al\u00e9m de uma boa gama de op\u00e7\u00f5es gr\u00e1ficas, podendo inclusive escolher entre os modos de exibi\u00e7\u00e3o de tela e itens semelhantes a vers\u00e3o do PSP.\n\nApesar da serie Ys ser uma franquia antiga e ter jogos sendo lan\u00e7ados at\u00e9 os dias de hoje, ela ainda \u00e9 pouco conhecida no ocidente, muitos ao ver o jogo com gr\u00e1ficos simples, podem ter o pensamento err\u00f4neo de ele ser apenas \u201cmais um jogo indie com gr\u00e1ficos 16 bits\u201d, quando ele n\u00e3o \u00e9 um a coisa nem outra, realmente vale a pena dar uma chance ao jogo principalmente os f\u00e3ns de RPGs cl\u00e1ssicos. Ys I Chronicles + \u00e9 com certeza um dos melhores RPGs que tive o prazer de jogar, a hist\u00f3ria, personagens e principalmente a trilha sonora s\u00e3o incr\u00edveis. O jogo possui alguns poucos problemas, como a jogabilidade datada e a dificuldade alta que podem afastar os jogadores mais novos, mas quem realmente quiser se aventurar pelo universo de Ys n\u00e3o vai se arrepender.  Ys I & II Chronicles + pode ser adquirido na Steam por R$ 24,99 numa colet\u00e2nea com os dois primeiros cap\u00edtulos da serie, incluindo este e o segundo denominado Ys II: Ancient Ys Vanished \u2013 The Final Chapter.\n\nO QUE PODE AGRADAR:\n\n- Hist\u00f3ria e principalmente trilha sonora magnificas.\n- Visuais remodelados com sprits muito bem animados e artworks \u00f3timas, tudo muito bonito e bem detalhado.\n- Boa gama de op\u00e7\u00f5es gr\u00e1ficas op\u00e7\u00f5es de customiza\u00e7\u00e3o de Hud, para um jogo 2D.\n- Um action RPG cl\u00e1ssico, com todos os elementos que consagraram o g\u00eanero.\n\nO QUE PODE DESAGRADAR:\n\n- Jogabilidade arcaica para os padr\u00f5es de hoje.\n- A dificuldade alta, principalmente nas batalhas contra chefes.\n- O jogo \u00e9 relativamente curto, mas contando que vem dois jogos no pacote isso n\u00e3o chega a ser um problema.\n- O jogo possui somente o idioma ingl\u00eas, dificultando o entendimento da hist\u00f3ria para quem n\u00e3o tem dom\u00ednio da l\u00edngua.", "timestamp_created": 1387106643, "timestamp_updated": 1387202906, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.802499", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8046254": {"recommendationid": "8046254", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982460446", "num_games_owned": 792, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 601, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472593905}, "language": "english", "review": "YES.

It has a rather unique \"bump\" attack system where you run into enemies to attack. It's not as easy as it sounds though, and has more depth than it would seem as well.\n\nPersonally, I find the bosses in Ys I to be rather lack luster, if not cheap. However, this is much improved in Ys II, along with much much more.\n\nAdditionally, you're getting 2 versions of each game (\"Chronicles\" from the PSP, and \"Complete\", the original (or previous, at least) PC release) with 4 difficulties, 2 diferent art styles (Complete and Chronicles, configurable ingame at any time), and 3 soundtracks (also configurable ingame at any time). That's quite the bang for your buck if you ask me.\n\nIf you're picky like me and don't like image filtering, I recommend using the 4:3 aspect ratio mode (Complete) as opposed to 30:17 (Chronicles, which is secretly 16:9, and shall be referred to as such from here on).

Personally I didn't find it to be a problem - in fact, it makes the game even more action-packed this way. The two games also sport absolutely phenomenal music - some of the best I've ever heard. Ys I though is very archaic in its design - it's easy to get lost, and the game doesn't give you enough clues to tell you what to do next. The map is confusing. The game also doesn't have much variety - just ram into enemies and talk to villagers. Ys II, on the other hand, corrects all the problems of Ys I. The inclusion of magic makes the combat significantly more fun, and the game now has a ton of variety of scenarios - my favorite is disguising as Roos. Ys II is just pure, unadulterated fun.

In Ys II you do get some direct magical attacks, though they are mostly useful for boss fights.  It keeps the pace of combat pretty quick and really almost relaxing.\n\nThe storylines aren't bad for a JRPG, the music is really high quality and the games aren't all that long assuming you don't try to be more comprehensive with achievements and such.  The games are designed to encourage grinding before boss fights, but I never had to spend unbearable lengths of time doing so in order to progress. There are sections of both games that can be a bit convoluted or would require a bit of running around/backtracking to figure out and find missable or hidden items, so I would suggest using walkthroughs for a number of areas in the interest of time.\n\nThe only bug I encountered was with the final boss of Ys I, where running the game in fullscreen causes him to spam projectiles at insane speeds, so change it to windowed mode before then and then back to fullscreen before the ending if you prefer.  Might only occur on 120hz displays.\n\nBoth games come with a launcher that lets you set the visual mode to Chronicles+, which gives you a better fullscreen view without all of the fluff around the edges, adds improved art and I think more cinematics as well.  Definitely turn that on, as I don't think it is by default.\n\nIn the end, if older JRPG games appeal to you then these are great quality PC releases.

The story is elegant in its simplicity while the remade vendor graphics and sprites are charmingly well done so it\u2019s like an indie game if it were made by real people in the late 80s. The explores are pretty phat too. Phat explores. A JRPG title with this little substance is never going to happen again folks. I\u2019m trying to think of more to talk about but that is literally it.

That said, these are still charming action RPGs with a fun and unique battle system, well-designed bosses, and what are still some of the best soundtracks in the history of video games\u2014and you get three versions of them!\n\nYs I & II Chronicles is too similar to earlier versions of the games for me to highly recommend it to people who have already played them, yet different enough that I can't quite call it the definitive version.

If you're like me and got into the game at Complete, then having the music from both that version, and the PC-88 will make you feel happily nostalgic. The translation is beautifully done, and while I dislike some of the changes from the Complete translation Deuce originally released (Rance being Lance makes sense but I dislike it, Zeptic being Zepic just doesn't sound as good, etc) it corrects some that were... bothersome... (Lair was the original translation for Reah, afterall!)\n\nIf this is your first time playing an older Ys game, it will feel primative. It came before Zelda, before Hydlide, from the game makers that set standards to be improved upon by themselves and others. Bump combat is archaic in many ways, but can be so much fun. Ys II's addition of magic gives you more tools to work with, but most of the games your combat is about aligning properly with an enemy, and bashing them as hard as you can with Adol's body. This is easier in Ys II as the enemies gain attack animations and diagonal becomes more of an effective tactic. \n\nFor completionists theres plenty to do, people to meet in a rich world where everyone has a house to live in and feels like it could actually work within the rules of its own universe, and there are plenty of easter eggs to find. As a 100%er myself, I loved the achievements they added to the games to give you more reason to play.\n\nBoss Rush in these games is also different from later games, in that if you die its game over. You can't just retry. Boss Rush for Ys I suffers in this regard I find, because Vagulion (the bat boss) is frustrating to fight repeatedly just to get the chance to die against Dark Fact. But it is so satisfying when you succeed!\n\nIf you like Zelda, and want to be drawn into a world that has more of a focus on combat, no confusing timelines, and amazing rockin' soundtracks, this is your game. When I first played Ys I Complete years ago it made me need to play Ys II, Felghana, Mask of the Sun, Kefin, Napishtim, and Origin as quickly as I could.

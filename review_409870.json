The team has had ample time to add these features back into the game, but being a busy game design company as NISA/NIS is, NISA/NIS have decided that they will not be making any more money off of this game if they update it.\n\nIt is odd that the game was not prioritized towards making more of the features previously available in the PSP version for the PC, while still adding code to the game that changed mechanics from the WII version. The most notable of these differences being that the icons stating the elemental type of an attack has been removed; however, there are moves that need these icons to make the damage system make sense, like the space/time type move that occurs late in the game. Also, the special items that are not supposed to be available to the player, were available to the player so long as they were able to cheese the system. Items like the magenta core and Marona's seashell are now permanently unavailable as the devs decided to hardcode the inability to take these items home from battle as demonstrated by videos in the community.\n\nI bring up random updates like this to showcase the refusal of the NISA/NIS team to prioritize their updates for the features in this game. Players wanted better graphics and upscaling and the players got a bicubic filter, instead of actual updates to the game's maps; which are desperately needed in the game currently, as sprites are constantly being shoved UNDER the maps. Also, spheres denoting the player's ability to hit a set amount of characters are not representative of the player's ability to hit a set amount of characters, just approximations. IIRC The spheres were correct in the PS2, WII, and PSP versions of the game, but not now.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1511726942, "timestamp_updated": 1511726942, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.592808", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37571672": {"recommendationid": "37571672", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045861999", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2859, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512675875}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game, decent story, lots of features and ideas.

I think both of them are great, as far as japanese SRPGs go.\n\nThe story revolves around a young girl named Marona who's lost her parents and has a spirit guardian named Ash filling the role of her older brother and sort of mentor/protector. Ash is a ghost whom only Marona can see, and the only being who cares and looks out for her. Most of the people Marona encounters consider her an abomination for seeing ghosts and talking to them. She also gets incredibly brutal and unfair treatment because she's seen by everyone as an orphan girl with a freaky and dangerous power. Despite that, she never gives up. No matter how harsh the people treat her, how difficult and unfair her circumstances are, she endures them all, and when you play the game, it feels incredibly genuine and not just because Marona is \"such a nice and friendly girl!\". Her willingness to help those who are treated even less fairly than she is, those who are struggling, is genuine and heart-warming, and it's Marona's own way to cope with all the harsh treatment and loss she has to endure. It's a tale of a very selfless girl whose kindness knows no bounds, and perhaps her kindness would inspire the players in turn. \n\nThe gameplay relies heavily on grind, which is a staple for Disgaea series and its spinoffs. However, the gameplay takes its own unique turn with Marona's abilities to summon spirits, or \"phantoms\" who fight alongside her, as well as picking up stuff scattered around the stages to use as weapons, alongside the usual weapon choice like swords, spears and staffs. Even a measly rock and a random weed have an incredibly power lying dormant in them! Which is, of course, pretty awesome. Leveling up weapons also offers the player an opportunity to completely break the game because you're free to make them as overpowered as you desire. The phantoms can only be summoned for a limited number of turns, and Marona can only summon a limited amound of those from her roster, so you have to plan out many of the more difficult fights ahead (or keep replaying till you get them right). The stages also offer your units opportunity to more or less free roam, which is slightly more confusing when it comes to positioning compared to grid and more predictable and fixed positioning.\nDifficulty level expects you to grind a lot and can get pretty brutal if you don't commit enough to grind, and straight out impossible if you choose to neglect grinding altogether. If you don't enjoy grinding, this isn't the game for you.\n\nThe soundtrack is incredibly nice and has an easy-going, yet somewhat somber and melancholic feeling to it; it's never about pure carefree joy, which further enhances the general direction of the story and Marona's character. It also makes even the sloggiest of the stages and the grindiest of grinds a better experience. \nThe graphics, however... Well, the 3D part of the stages looks ok, as well as the backgrounds; unfortunately, pixel sprites are blurry and feel very out of place because of said blurriness. The PC version is pretty much an emulation of the PS2 game, which PB originally was, and it's definitely not meant to be viewed on modern HD monitors. Which is a shame, because the sprite work is really detailed and varied, but it turns out to be such a mess on the actual screen.\n\nOverall, the game is really good if you're willing to commit effort to grind. The only downside I can really point out is the blurry pixel sprites, which is a glaring shame on a game that's otherwise pretty much flawless.", "timestamp_created": 1499538316, "timestamp_updated": 1499538630, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534400", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33045434": {"recommendationid": "33045434", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079482512", "num_games_owned": 186, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 17, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498526609}, "language": "english", "review": "great\n", "timestamp_created": 1498839829, "timestamp_updated": 1498839829, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.437067", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33035467": {"recommendationid": "33035467", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067472246", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1971, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511722585}, "language": "english", "review": "Just add a way to disable mouse in the game so it doesn't always drag the game to the side when I'm in a battle and doing something on my other screen.

The game does feature several fundamental differences, however, the major ones being that the game isn't grid based and instead lets you traverse the map freely and that the introduction of the \"Confine\" system means that rather than summoning characters permanently from a base you instead summon them using items on the map via the main character, Marona.\n\nEach of these things come with their own pros and cons.  Having your phantoms on a timer seems annoying but it adds another layer of strategy to the game and whether that's better or worse for you really depends on how you vary your regalia.  As for the lack of a grid, this freedom can lead to some odd behavior and questionable AI logic at times but it clearly allowed them to make gameplay that was more dynamic than something you would get out of a Disgaea or a Soul Nomad, largely thanks to terrain effects and physics.\n\nAs far as the story is concerned, starting out you have two options: [b]New Game[/b] and [b]Another Marona[/b].  [I]Another Marona[/I] is a standalone story that was introduced in the game's Wii port, [I]Phantom Brave: We Meet Again[/I], and because it includes characters and allusions to the main story, it's best to save this for after having beaten the game at least once (it can also be accessed through the New Game+ option after beating the game, though it's best played starting at level one).\n\nStarting a new game, you'll run into an unskippable tutorial and unskippable cutscenes.  Don't let these leave too big of a negative impression on you because in general the game's cutscenes are short and all of them past the first are skippable, so it's mostly replay-friendly.  You play as a chroma (basically someone who deals in various types of odd jobs) named Marona, an orphan who can see and summon phantoms.  While some would consider this a gift, most see the girl as a witch who is possessed by phantoms and is filled with malintent.  This couldn't be farther from the truth, of course, as Marona is about as pure as her age implies and all she really wants is to help others.  While a character and setup like this could easily be annoying, it's played to pretty great effect as Marona is torn down over and over again before it looks like she has any chance of standing on her own, and this is made better by seeing how the mail that she gets reacts to current events (and the mail is probably some of the darkest content in this game, which says a lot more than it sounds like).\n\nMuch like Disgaea, Phantom Brave is a level-based Strategy RPG that takes place over a series of maps.  Put simply, if you like Disgaea's gameplay, you'll like this after you get used to it.  And then you'll like it more when you realize that each different type of item that can be found on a map has its own skill set.  Then you'll like it more when you realize you can use the Fusionist to combine items together to give them really interesting skills and stat buffs.  And then you'll like it even [B]more[/B] when you realize just how fun and satisfying giving custom titles to your characters and their items can be.  \n\nPhantom Brave's gameplay is by no means perfect and has a fair few imperfections, some of the more major ones I mentioned above, but the emphasis on customization and use of the environment as well as generally interesting map designs just makes it one hell of a fun romp that isn't much like any other game NIS has put out, even its spiritual successor, Makai Kingdom.\n\nAs for the graphics, they're ugly as sin.  Absolutely ugly as sin.  Normally, I would just say they're dated, because that's what they are.  Normally I wouldn't be so hard on the game.  But normally a game like this that didn't even have all that big of a following doesn't get 3 subsequent ports over 10 years on variably stronger hardware without anyone doing anything about the fact that the game looks like it was made for the PS1 after the PS2 had already been out for 4 goddamn years.  Thankfully, the UI fonts and textures have been brought up to date, and though that does make the sprites feel even more uncanny, it's at least nice to see that some effort was made.\n\nAnd finally, the music.  It's always amazing to me how Tenpei Sato manages to make his games feel unique.  If you blindfolded a NIS fan and played tracks from several different NIS developed games, they'd somewhat easily be able to tell you what was from Rhapsody, what was from Disgaea, and what was from Phantom Brave, because the guy tailors his sound to his series rather than to the situation or any one style for all of his work.\n\nAnd here, his work shines just as brightly as it ever has. Because Phantom Brave is one of the more somber and melancholic games he's worked on, rather than the usual frantic or chaotic melodies heard in Disgaeas 1-3, here we find that songs his are generally slower and themed based on context.  This might seem like it betrays my previous statements, but that speaks more to exactly how the characters and maps of the game are designed than anything of himself.  But rather than trying to convince you with words, I'll leave these here and let you be the judge.\n\n[url=https://youtu.be/fe4PMzz8SAY]R&R Junkie[/url]\n[URL=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CtTmZBteKE]The End of this Passionate Feeling[/URL]\n[URL=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCm6Uvby3Q0]Snowberry[/URL]\n\nIf you're a fan of Disgaea then you probably knew whether you liked this pretty early off.  If you're new to SRPGs or just want to try something different, Phantom Brave's worth checking out, largely because you won't find much else like it (even if you look to its cousins) and it gets cheap pretty often.

I remember playing this as a kid, and revisiting it years later, it still holds up really well.

Sure, the story has its funny moments, but for the most part it's a bit more on the serious side, and there's nothing wrong with that. Great characters, nice voice acting (my man Steve Blum's here, and that always helps!), and a decent story to move you through the gameplay.\n\nGameplay is the real reason to be here, though. Simple yet deep, Phantom Brave shines in inviting and personalized combat and team structure. Tons of different unit types to start and even more to unlock makes it easy to customize your team exactly the way that you want. The only equipment that you need to worry about is your weapon, but you can use everything from standard RPG Swords, Axes, and Spears to weirder options like Books, Scrolls, and Logs, to things that don't make sense like Trees, Trolley Cars, Weeds, and even other units! Tons of special attacks, lots of units specialization through the Fusion system, and easy access to almost every item make it easy to try and blend everything!\n\nCombat doesn't take place on a grid; instead, your units have a circular distance count and can move anywhere on the map on their turn within that circle on their turn, making positioning more fluid, and position strategy is as precise as you want it to be. This is helped by your deployment system: Rather than having a whole army on the field, you have your main character, who summons units (Phantoms) into objects on the battlefield. After a few turns, they'll vanish, leaving room for another ally. So you can have as many allies on standby as you want to make, and pick the best for any situation.\n\nThis review doesn't truly do the depth of the game justice.

Staats, everywheeeeeere!\n\nA very much worthy game for Japanese T-RPG enthusiasts. Definitely not NIS's best game (Soul Nomads? Makai Kingdom? It's been a while but I enjoyed their fighting mechanics more), it's not even as good as the Disgaea games. It is, though, their most endearing, with a clich\u00e9d but sad & cute story centered around a 13yo who thinks she can get away with her weirdness by being nice to people. It doesn't work in real life but it's good to perservere I guess.\n\nI could discuss the game for hours, but I found it more enjoyable once I enabled a mod to multiply game speed by 2 (the game is really too slow-paced otherwise), and even better, after I made my way to LV100 through cheating the game (there are various methods documented in FAQs, or you can just install a 1-hit kill trainer if you don't want to bother). This helped me complete the fights faster and just focus on the story. (Yes, the game is really challenging and requires a lot of grinding, and exploiting leveling tricks that aren't explicited in the game like ranked titles, random RPGs, etc.)\nIt's too bad that the later post-game EX maps have high requirements (finishing a 1000-floor dungeon, really?!), because they have stories tied to them. Well, I guess I'll just watch those on YouTube. While I did spend hundreds of hours on other NIS games, I'm too old for that now (and I have too many games on Steam).\n\nAlso, a few minor hindrances: while everything is remastered well, the zoomed 2D sprites are really distracting in story sequences. And why do they call scenes 'demos' anyway? And the last scene after the final boss? It's like, \"eh?\". Did they remove something for that release? If you're going to add a last-minute emotional twist to your story, maybe don't act like it never happened just a few seconds later..? Oh, and the soundtrack isn't Tenpei Sat\u00f4's best I'm afraid. Not a single great song here, just generic happy-RPG stuff. Not my favorite composer overall, but at least his Disgaea themes are funny and recognizable.\nThe worst thing in the game would have to be the combat UI. I couldn't find a shortcut to end a turn. Given that you'll be selecting that option once per turn, that is up to hundreds of times per fight, and you'll have dozens of fights to go through, I'm not sure that went through their head.\n\nYes, I probably won't play it again because some other games will have priority over it, but I really liked the universe depicted in-game, the interesting characters, some game mechanics, the humor and the dungeon-RPG aspects.", "timestamp_created": 1483725500, "timestamp_updated": 1483725500, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.637014", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28465037": {"recommendationid": "28465037", "author": {"steamid": "76561198263459815", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3966, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471978823}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like Disgaea, then this game is perfect for you. \nThe story is interesting, the characters development is solid,\nand the game play mechanics are overwhelming good. \n\nI played the ps2 version long ago, and always wished for a PC version. \nI give it 9/10.", "timestamp_created": 1482143774, "timestamp_updated": 1482143774, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528679", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28381615": {"recommendationid": "28381615", "author": {"steamid": "76561198255276037", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 6916, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481769379}, "language": "english", "review": "I was formerly familiar only with NIS' Disgaeas and ZHP, so this was a small gamble that [i]really[/i] paid off.

I'm crossing my fingers for some reworked sprites, but I have to say right now that the game on my 27\" monitor doesn't look NEARLY as bad as Square's Android to Steam ports that have your characters taking up more than a third of the screen.  The menus are sized perfectly, and the controls allow you to navigate exactly like you needed to on the PSP.  If I remember correctly, they removed a vital stat from the Wii version in which this port is based, but a recent update remedied that.  Even if they drop the effort and don't at least fix some of the ugly sprite scaling (and some 3D artifacts that appear when rotating the camera) I still intend to play this game as I have many times in the past.  \n\nOverall, as a unique entry in a landscape of very diverse turn based strategy games, Phantom Brave, to me, is special.  Story progression is entirely at your own pace, and offers a nice middle-ground difficulty between FFT 1.3 (Insane) and Disgaea 1.  The character class roster is huge and the random battlefield/dungeon generation is quirky and simply FUN.\n\nI never would have thought a SRPG that centered around a single character who served as, essentially, your main menu, but was also required in every single major battle to fight alongside you could work- the concept itself is baffling at first- but Marona functions marvelously and switches things up a bit when similar titles rely on more standard planning and execution.  \n\nI mean, this kid who can see ghosts can \"confine\" them to just about any inanimate object to have them fight for her is awesome and absurd; the fact that the game offers so much content for even basic stuff like [I]environment objects serving as useable weapons with their own stats and attack properties[/I], huh?  The best thing is that it works, somehow.  \n\nNot for everyone, Phantom Brave has a decent hardcore underbelly but never once takes itself seriously- and there's bound to be a ton of fans complaining about the unfortunate scaling with the sprites and that's NIS's fault, because it most assuredly deserves the polish of a redraw and texture update.  This is one of those games that you either love or hate and there really isn't any way to sway you otherwise.  For the amount of time I played it on PSP, the price is more than fair.  If you've never played it but you enjoyed Disgaea or FFT, give it a shot, because this game offers up MASSIVE content and countless hours of enjoyment.", "timestamp_created": 1475739841, "timestamp_updated": 1475740293, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504390", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25880217": {"recommendationid": "25880217", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978714898", "num_games_owned": 233, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 740, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481595576}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good rpg elements.

Why?  Well, while NIS did some great work cleaning up the backgrounds and menu graphics, they left the original sprites alone.  So, you have these crisp and clear backgrounds, this great text, etc, until the characters walk on the screen.  Pixellated what?  It's rather unfortunate.  For all I know, Marona could be Ash!  Seriously, it's not that bad, but it's not exactly great either.\n\nFurther, rather than port the PS2 version or even the PSP version, the team at NIS chose to port the WiiU version (again, as they did this for Disgaea, but at least Phantom Brave didn't have the launch issues Disgaea did).  Here, rather than being glitchy and almost unplayable for a month or two, the menus leave out some important information that was included in the PS2 and PSP versions, which wasn't included in the WiiU.\n\nOne such glaring omission occurs when trying to fuse two items together using the Fusioner's mechanics.  Fusion is already an obtuse and obfuscated mechanic already, so to hide your weapon's base equip percents is ridiculous (look to the discussion boards to see that a majority of players are flummoxed and befuddled by this omission).\n\nFortunately, the base stats are shown, and the altered stats due to the equip percents, so if you're good with math, you'll be able to make the calculations necessary to determine your raw equip percents.  \n\nBut again, why choose to port the worst version?  Likely because it's the most recent, I suppose, and the one the devs are most familiar with, so I understand the choice.  But really, don't just port and run, D-bags; there are always issues with old games getting ported, which might need more care than a simple \"port-and-done\" schema.  \n\nI hope the devs don't pull this same BS with their other NIS titles they plan to \"bring to PC.\"  But I'm sure they will.  And I, the fool, will probably still buy it and recommend it.  Why?  Well, when you've got the only game in the house I'm interested in, this player's gotta play...  So, I'll cautiously recommend this game to previous owners of the title, and those who enjoy NIS or SRPGs.\n\nEditor's note:  So, my main gripe about not seeing item equips in fusions was updated recently.  Apparently the staff at NISA agreed with my and other gamers' opinions and redid that particular part of the game to be like the PS2 version, showing the item equip % values.  So, the game is improved (though Marona still looks like Ash!).

Naturally, I played that first and thought it was pretty bad. The stages themselves were quite interesting, but the story felt like bad fan fiction. The whole side plot was wishy-washy and a chore to go through for me. Thankfully, the main game was just as good as I last remembered it, which made the purchase worth it. Maybe this way of storytelling appeals to some people, but if you're planning to get this game to try Another Marona like I did, be prepared for a huge contrast in the tone of the story. \n\nOther than that, the gameplay is pretty solid, though several in game mechanics can still be exploited (example: climbing on top of enemies may sometimes confuse the AI into not attacking). Whether this is a good or a bad thing depends on you. I will admit that sometimes it feels like I'm battling against the system as well as the enemy characters with its not very precise selection controls, but I'm still having a lot of fun wtih the game. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1472641520, "timestamp_updated": 1472641520, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536290", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25215944": {"recommendationid": "25215944", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018804497", "num_games_owned": 156, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471877933}, "language": "english", "review": "I can't put into words what this game meant for me once.

Now keep in mind, like many Nippon Ichi games, most of your roster is made up of generics.  In Phantom Brave, the only non-generics are Ash and Marona (until post game).  It is the development of other characters throughout the story that make it so good.  And of course, because of Marona.  It's quite depressing for the first few chapters.  Then things start going better for her and you love her even more.\n\nYou won't spend a week resetting to perfect items\nLike Nippon Ichi's Disgaea series, Phantom Brave's items are able to level up and become stronger.  If I compared this to Disgaea 2, this system is 100% better.  Disgaea 2 requires extensive knowledge of how it works and hundreds if not thousands of resets to \"perfect\" your equipment.  It's quite a headache.  Phantom Brave is MUCH simpler.\n\nA Blacksmith levels up items and opens skills, a Fusionist combines items together.  That's it.  You can level up items to increase their stats, open a variety of skills and transfer them to other items or characters, combine the raw stats of items together and gain the difference, or increase the efficiency% and confine%.\n\nA huge variety of useful skills\nReally.  You could spend days just tinkering around with skills, Find hidden gems on absurd items like Rolling Wood on some Driftwood.  Putting together a list of useful skills that work with a particular character's aptitude and stats can make a big difference.  Or you could just have fun with silly stuff.  If you've played Disgaea you will appreciate Phantom Brave's non-grid system, skills have a lot more freedom and are much less restricting and easy to pull off.\n\n**BAD**\n\nLow resolution sprites\nAlthough the story scenes have gorgeous high definition backdrops, character sprites are as pixelated as they were on the PS2.  I understand that it would require a lot of work to make the sprites look better, but I wish they could have at least improved on them during cut scenes.  Try to use 4:3 resolution and if you have a huge monitor, play in windowed mode.  That'll lessen how bad it is.\n\n***EDIT: These percentages have been added!***\n[strike](Especially for you PS2 players) efficiency%'s are hidden\nThis game's GUI is based on the Wii version.  Yeah, I played this on the PS2, and when I unlocked the Fusionist...I realized they no longer show the percentages.  This is part of the Wii version.  You have to pull out your handy windows calculator.  I forget the name for these if \"efficiency\" is wrong.  Every stat has a % that determines how much of a boost you get from equipping the item.  If your sword with 500 Attack has 50% efficiency in attack, you will gain +250.  By combining items with a Fusionist you can raise that percentage well over 100%.  The hidden percents takes getting used to, and is more confusing for new players who don't understand how the system works.  Phantom Brave supposed to be easy and workable without having to look things up on the Internet.[/strike]\n\nIt's too easy to become overpowered\nPhantom Brave's systems make over-leveling VERY easy.  You have to limit yourself and make rules for yourself if you want to avoid feeling like you're cheating.  Some of my own rules include no mana farming, no combining with failure titles or higher level items, no confining characters to items you brought with you that are higher level than natural items on the map...really, it is WAY too easy to take advantage of things and become ridiculously powerful.  I also avoid random dungeons when I want to play story mode, instead doing dungeon-only games. (I do this with Disgaea's item world too)\n\nLike I said in the first sentence, this is one of my favorite games of all time.

You've got arbitrary resolution support, instant switching of controller prompts/keyboard input, stability (not one crash or frame rate issue in the 40 hours I've played) and dual audio. \n\nNippon Ichi SRPG's are mainly about finding enjoyment in making the numbers go up, and Phantom Brave probably scratches that itch best for me among their various SRPG's.  Unlike most SRPG's, you have a circular movement radius instead of grid-based movement.  This does cause issues with path-finding and targeting at times, but I like the feel of it and the freedom of movement it gives you.  It's somewhat similar to Valkyria Chronicles to give a point of reference.\n\nAnother aspect of PB that's a bit different is that you only have one \"permanent\" party member.  Marona is always on the field, but you summon your allies by confining them into various objects that increase/decrease certain stats and/or provide various types of protection/debuffs to your allies and enemies.  Summoned allies also have turn limits before being removed for the rest of fight, so you have to use some actual strategy at times when it comes to deploying your characters.  There's a real sense of asset management here if you play the game as a straight SRPG instead of the usual Nippon Ichi \"power level your character/item until you're unstoppable\" type of gameplay.  That said, you're free to power level to your heart's content if that's what you want to do, just making a point that PB has more strategic gameplay than you might expect.\n\nThe fusion system is your primary method of making the numbers go up and basically consists of mashing together two weapons and making the stats go up, along with the choice of adding new attacks to the weapon.  Fusion also works between characters and items and serves to provide very useful passive and active skills along with level cap increases.  There's more stuff to crazy stat increases like titles, failure fusions, etc, so your numbers go up hankering should be sated.  There's just something about the fusion system that appeals to me more than Disgaea's Item World stuff.\n\nPhantom Brave leaves a lot to the player to figure out on their own, which might be a plus or negative depending on how you like your games.  There's an extended tutorial, but there's just too much to the gameplay to make it all digestible to a new player without overwhelming them.  This probably isn't the worst game to look up a beginner's guide to get some tips as you figure out how to play, especially if you aren't familiar with Nippon Ichi games.\n\nIn short, if you've played Phantom Brave in the past and are wondering if this is worth picking up again, then the answer is yes.  If you've never played a Nippon Ichi game before, be warned that all the systems and numbers might be a bit overwhelming at first, but if it clicks for you, you'll probably find yourself abandoning the main storyline to level your characters and weapons to the point where the AI can't even make a turn before you kill all of them.  If that doesn't appeal to you, it can also be played as more a \"normal\" SRPG, more so than Disgaea.

The units summoned, phantoms, only exists for a limited number of turns. It adds a layer of strategy in which encourages the player to think about unit placement and whether or not to use which phantom for what task. \n\nThe only issues that I personally have with the game so far is the lack of explaination on some game mechanics and overall clutter. An example of lack of explaination would be item and character prefixes, progression of skills, passives of characters like merchant, oldman, ect. The clutter becomes an issue when there are an overwhelming amount of characters and items. Both in which you have to check on who has what and what prefix is currently applied on the item.\n\nHad this game for the PS2, story was better when I was younger.

I don't need to play through the game again to prove that I love this game. But I can at least vouch for the port.\n\nPhantom Brave isn't a perfect game or a masterpiece. It's not too hard to make the game easy, and the battle system, while different, isn't the deepest out there. That all said, the game is great and I highly recommend getting it if you're interested in a more serious SRPG compared to Disgaea.\n\nThe story centers around Marona and her guardian phantom: Ash. Much of the themes of the game revolve around prejudice and hope. Marona constantly gets burned by the people she helps, as their hate for what they see her as makes them treat her like dirt. Despite constant absue, Marona sticks to her parents' ideals they taught her in the hopes that she will one day be rewarded for her efforts. While it may be a bit irksome for some to have her be so optimistic, I do find it at least grounded by the fact that she's not inherently that pure. It is because of the support of Ash that she is able to hold on to these ideals; not because she's some pure person who can take all of this on her own. The secondary story, titled Another Marona, isn't quite as good as the main one. It does shed a bit of light on all the characters that one couldn't see in the main storyline, so it does offer something to those that enjoyed the characters and wanted to see more of them.\n\nThe meat and bones of the game is the gameplay. The battles play out in a turn based format on a girdless field. Characters have a set limit to their movement represented in DMs, but can move as many times as they want until the number of DMs is fully depleted. You can summon phantoms by confining them to various objects on the field, which grant certain bonuses. Phantoms have a set number of turns they can stay in battle, and when that depletes they leave the battle. Marona is the only character that stays on the field permanently, though there are ways to make some phantoms stick around as long. Attacks themselves have various ranges and AOE \"shapes\" in which they can effect the field. If you find the going to get rough, then you can pick up and throw allies to better position them, or even toss enemies out of bounds at the cost of slightly empowering the other enemies(though the last enemy standing is immune, if I recall). Any items that a phantom has been confined into has a chance of being \"stolen\", as well. \n\nThere also a number of sub systems within the game. Titles can be bestowed upon any phantom or weapons you have, and each title has various stat bonuses. Some titles even contain special attack skills. You also enter random dungeons, fuse items and titles, and migrate any non-unique skills. There's a lot of customization available to players in this game. You can also \"reincarnate\" characters, which resets them to level one, but allows you to increase their base stat points in order to increase their overall strength.\n\nThe visual design is one of the few things that doesn't quite hold up. Sprites are somewhat simple, but not particularly ugly(unless you don't disable the filter they use in the options). That character design is pleasant, and there's a lot of variety in overall character design. The background art scales up well, and looks quite lovely. The game performs well, too, with easy 60 fps in most situations.\n\nThe audio design in the game is quite good. The English voice actors for the main story perform quite well, and the voices fit their characters. There's also a Japanese voice option for those who do not like dubs. The Music in the game is pleasant, varied, and is arguably some of the best that composer Tenpei Sato has put out in quite some time.\n\nIn terms of replayability, Phantom Brave has a lot to offer. There are a lot of items to collect through confining, characters to unlock, titles to find, and even a New Game Plus option. Delving through dungeons to power up can take a lot, or a little(if you know what to do), time. \n\nIn summation: The game is a great value at $20. The story, gameplay, and audio are great, with only some bits of the visuals not holding up quite as well. The port is functional, runs well, and contains all the content from every iteration of Phantom Brave. This is the definite experience, and is well worth your consideration.", "timestamp_created": 1469982751, "timestamp_updated": 1470228493, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 1,

More dramatic, more epic, more serious. Nippon Ichi carved a niche for itself with Disgaea, a silly RPG that tried to be as un-serious as possible. It was more of an episodic anime, full of comedy and parodies. It was in the right place at the right time, and got a lot of attention. \n\nHowever, Phantom Brave took a riskier path. It was a \"serious\" story, yet instead of a fantasy epic, it aimed to be a gentle slice-of-life. You're not the center of the universe, but just a person in a tropical archipelago filled with strange and diverse characters. The story is about the orphan girl Marona, innocent and naive, watched over by her jaded phantom bodyguard, Ash. She tries to make her own way through the world, but her optimism clashes when it comes up against reality's cynicism and prejudices. This kind of character-driven story was very rare in games at the time, but is something that's become much more accepted in the past few years.\n\nThe gameplay system is also far ahead its time, though it may be still too advanced for us in 2016. There's a lot more freedom in this compared to the usual tactical RPG map battle. For one thing, you can free-roam instead of moving within a square grid. I like it better this way, but I have to admit it's a little clunkier just trying to move where you want. And there's more.... Confining phantoms to objects such as trees and rocks, which give different stat bonuses, yet they only last a limited number of turns in battle, so you have to pace yourself depending on the map. There's so much to keep track of. Yet there's no short-term pleasures like the team-attacks in Disgaea, it's all about the long-term strategy in each battle.\n\nSame for outside of battle, you're given incredible freedom to customize and build your characters; even your ITEMS gain their own levels and new skills. You can even fuse characters/items together to break past the old limits of their potential.  It's not a regular RPG where you grind for a linear increase in power, but you use your brain and tinker with multiple systems to gain *exponential* boosts in power. The max level is 9999 for a good reason, not just to extend playtime. Yet this can be very overwhelming to a new player, as unlike Disgaea there's very little indication of what's effective RIGHT NOW, just hints of how godlike you can become later after you've \"cracked the code.\" I don't recommend this at all for people who want a comfortable casual time, and to be honest it's too much even for me sometimes. I enjoy this kind of abstract stat manipulation stuff, yet this game was aimed at someone *even more hardcore* than me.\n\nIt's strange how such an accessible heartwarming story was fused with an inaccessible challenging game. It's definitely not for everyone (if you don't like complicated RPGs you might want to watch a LetsPlay instead). But it's bold and unique, and I love it anyway.", "timestamp_created": 1469895831, "timestamp_updated": 1469896439, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 108, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.908900", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24608681": {"recommendationid": "24608681", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121571438", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2687, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478533083}, "language": "japanese", "review": "2016/10/11 \u8ffd\u8a18\n\n\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30c7\u30fc\u30c8\u3067\u88c5\u5099\u7387\u304c\u8868\u793a\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3000\u3044\u3084\u3063\u307b\u3045\uff01\n\u3053\u308c\u3067\u6c17\u517c\u306d\u306a\u304f\u904a\u3079\u308b\u306d\uff01\n\n\n\u203b\u4ee5\u4e0b\u306f\u30a2\u30d7\u30c7\u524d\u306b\u66f8\u3044\u305f\u30ec\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306f\u3068\u3066\u3082\u9762\u767d\u3044\u3093\u3060\u3051\u3069\u81f4\u547d\u7684\u306b\u6b8b\u5ff5\u306a\u70b9\u304c\u4e00\u3064\n\n\u3053\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306f\u88c5\u5099\u3067\u304d\u308b\u30a2\u30a4\u30c6\u30e0\u306b\u300c\u88c5\u5099\u7387\u300d\u307f\u305f\u3044\u306a\u3082\u306e\u304c\u5b9a\u3081\u3089\u308c\u3066\u3044\u3066\nATK\u306e\uff8a\uff9f\uff97\uff92\uff70\uff80\uff70\u304c1000\u306e\u6b66\u5668\u3067\u3082ATK\u306e\u88c5\u5099\u7387\u304c\u300c50%\u300d\u3060\u3063\u305f\u5834\u5408\u306f500\u3057\u304b\uff8a\uff9f\uff97\uff92\uff70\uff80\uff70\u306b\u53cd\u6620\u3055\u308c\u306a\u3044\u3053\u3068\u306b\u306a\u3063\u3066\u308b\n\n\u3053\u306e\u300c\u88c5\u5099\u7387\u300d\u307f\u305f\u3044\u306a\u306e\u3092\u5408\u6210\u3067\u3069\u3093\u3069\u3093\u4e0a\u3052\u3066\u898b\u308b\u898b\u308b\u4e0a\u304c\u3063\u3066\u304f\uff8a\uff9f\uff97\uff92\uff70\uff80\uff70\u306e\u30a4\u30f3\u30d5\u30ec\u304c\n\u3068\u3066\u3082\u6c17\u6301\u3061\u3044\u3044\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306a\u30cf\u30ba\u306a\u3093\u3060\u3051\u3069\uff65\uff65\uff65\n\u4eca\u56de\u306f\u96a0\u3057\uff8a\uff9f\uff97\uff92\uff70\uff80\uff70\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3044\u3066\u3001\u3053\u306e\u300c\u88c5\u5099\u7387\u300d\u307f\u305f\u3044\u306a\u306e\u304c\u753b\u9762\u4e0a\u306b\u8868\u793a\u3055\u308c\u306a\u3044\u3002\u4f55\u6545\uff01\uff1f\n\n\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306f\u5909\u308f\u3063\u3066\u306a\u3044\u304b\u3089\u8003\u3048\u3066\u5408\u6210\u3059\u308c\u3070\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u306b\u88c5\u5099\u7387\u3068\uff8a\uff9f\uff97\uff92\uff70\uff80\uff70\u3068\u304b\u306f\u3061\u3083\u3093\u3068\u5f37\u5316\u3055\u308c\u3066\n\u4eca\u307e\u3067\u3068\u540c\u3058\u7d50\u679c\u3092\u5f97\u3089\u308c\u308b\u3051\u3069\u3001\u898b\u3048\u306a\u3044\u304b\u3089\u7d50\u5c40\u3069\u3053\u307e\u3067\u4e0a\u3052\u305f\u304b\u308f\u304b\u3093\u306a\u304f\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3046\u308f\u30fc\u3063\u3066\u306a\u308b\u3002\n\n\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30c7\u30fc\u30c8\u3067\u3082MOD\u3067\u3082\u306a\u3093\u3067\u3082\u3044\u3044\u304b\u3089\u3069\u30fc\u306b\u304b\u3053\u306e\u300c\u88c5\u5099\u7387\u300d\u307f\u305f\u3044\u306a\u306e\u304c\u898b\u3048\u306a\u3044\u3068\u3084\u308b\u6c17\u306b\u306a\u308c\u306a\u3044\u3088\uff01\uff01\n\u305b\u3063\u304b\u304f\u304a\u3082\u3057\u308d\u3044\u306e\u306b\uff01\n\n\u203b\u904e\u53bb\u4f5c\u300cPS2\u7248\u300d\u300cPSP\u7248\u300d\u3092\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3057\u305f\u4e0a\u3067\u306e\u611f\u60f3\u3067\u3059\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1469856072, "timestamp_updated": 1476199601, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 82, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.860094", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24606146": {"recommendationid": "24606146", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023785036", "num_games_owned": 708, "num_reviews": 189, "playtime_forever": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469841196}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u3084\u306f\u308a\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u5973\u306e\u5b50\u306f\u6700\u9ad8\u3067\u3059\u306d", "timestamp_created": 1469841221, "timestamp_updated": 1469841221, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497653", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24605831": {"recommendationid": "24605831", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009553736", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3861, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493729667}, "language": "english", "review": "Port quality--\nIts the original with basic PC options. It's not a remake with a ton of added features, but everything works great and the PC developers deserve a lot of credit considering what some ports end up like.\n\nMusic--\nFirst off, the music is just excellent in this game. Buy the game if you like VGM in any way, shape or form. Who knows what Tenpei Sato was on when he did the music for PB, but I love this shit and its much more fun than his other works. Often extremely catchy and/or powerful, whenever battles start, the music exists to get the player in the mood for battle with great effect. Outside of battle its all over the place in terms of style and intensity but is often beautiful and creative.\n\nGameplay--\nPB is a game with a slightly \"different\" take on the SRPG. From character building, development and battle. In some ways, akwardly branching out where it doesn't really make any headway, in ways where it feels like there's nothing more going on than backpeddling an already perfectly functional form of standardized SRPG gameplay. \n\nThe movement in battle is where the game falls flatter than Marona's...attack stat, its completely different than almost all other titles in its genre for seemingly no reason other than to be unique. The unique form of movement can be akward and even frustrating at times. This isn't a constant problem by any means and it definitely isn't a GAME BREAKER, but it does abrupt the flow of battle, sometimes causing numerous attempts at getting a character to attack or to be in a proper position. Whats frustrating is that other games like this one would play just perfectly in these scenarios, and really, this has to be by far PB's biggest flaw.\n\nThe core gameplay is mostly solid and theres a ton of fun in building a team together, though. Its somewhat barebones compared to a modern sandbox SRPG you would find today, but is also a lot less overwhelming. The distinct style and gameplay is largley refreshing to those familiar with the genre.\n\nStory/Closure--\nWhile not something I personally care deeply about with these types of games, the characters often grabbed me in different ways and are easy to love/hate. Unlike with most anime and japanese games, I found the characters to be very relatable in different ways. PB's story is touching and enjoyable overall. \n\nPB has a fanastic charm of its own that feels much more down-to-earth than its bigger and much more popular brother Disgaea. As a game it definitely holds its own and some ways excels over its brother. Overall its a very creative take on the genre with a superbly catchy soundtrack.", "timestamp_created": 1469839541, "timestamp_updated": 1469847327, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24605670": {"recommendationid": "24605670", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968695343", "num_games_owned": 549, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 8444, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511034847}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u9b54\u5c0e\u5408\u6210\u3067\u88c5\u5099\u9069\u6b63\u3092\u3042\u3052\u308b\u3068\u3053\u308d\u304c\u3069\u3046\u3084\u3089\u306a\u3044\u3063\u307d\u3044\u3067\u3059\n\u6b63\u78ba\u306b\u306f\u8868\u793a\u3055\u308c\u306a\u3044\u3063\u307d\u3044\u3067\u3059\n\u79c1\u306f\u305d\u308c\u304c\u3084\u308a\u305f\u304b\u3063\u305f\u306e\u3067\u975e\u5e38\u306b\u6b8b\u5ff5\u3067\u3059\n----\u8ffd\u8a18----\n\u4fee\u6b63\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3088\u3046\u3067\u3059", "timestamp_created": 1469838716, "timestamp_updated": 1490968481, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.687002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24604420": {"recommendationid": "24604420", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988368913", "num_games_owned": 306, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 657, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469874261}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty great port from an excellent game that can entertain you for hours!", "timestamp_created": 1469832691, "timestamp_updated": 1469832691, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24591950": {"recommendationid": "24591950", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070907784", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1881, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475150569}, "language": "english", "review": "amazing as hell.", "timestamp_created": 1469782222, "timestamp_updated": 1469782222, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.462264", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24582515": {"recommendationid": "24582515", "author": {"steamid": "76561198209146699", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 8246, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513176312}, "language": "english", "review": "A girl left home alone while her parents goes on vacation becomes haunted by the late friend of her family; she gets through life by inventing imaginary friends to take on an ultimate evil, stopping an attempt to save endangered species and undermining a mortally ill man from getting his medicine in the process.  10/10 would fuse Blinding Light on Marona for easy Heart leveling again.", "timestamp_created": 1469736970, "timestamp_updated": 1469737008, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.437177", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24579981": {"recommendationid": "24579981", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001961650", "num_games_owned": 938, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 1429, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470333688}, "language": "english", "review": "Great port of the game I played for hundreds of hours on the PS2 and PSP.\nNIS's best and most unique game, with whimsical fantasy and unique, player-defined combat and objectives.

This is a game that will not disappoint in the long-run. I have played Phantom Brave for over ten years(first time in 2005) and everytime I dive into it with a fresh start, I always learn something new. \n\nJust to get this out of the way, this game comes as basically TWO games. The default story of Marona, then \"Another Marona\" playthrough which is basically an entirely new story mode, in which it can carry-over all your phantoms' strength AFTER you've beaten the default story.\n\nAs a strategy RPG it serves as both a dungeon crawler(optional, but used more for power leveling to obtain insane power levels and weapons for end-game, just like in Disgaea) and an extremely compelling story of a orphaned girl. Marona, seemingly hated by the world because of her unusual powers to communicate and summon Phantoms to aid her in battle, earning her the nickname \"The Possessed\". Her one true ally and guardian, Ash, a phantom, watches over Marona everyday as she deals with the struggles of being despised. As you progress through the story it'll tug at your heart-strings up until the final battle. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll get angry, you'll cry more, then you'll keep on playing.\n\nThis is easily my favorite NIS title to ever have dropped even more than Soul Nomad and the Disgaea series in its incredible entirety. A time-less RPG that will never disappoint with hundreds of attacks, dozens of character classes, hilarious/elaborate/highly detailed/unique particle effects/combination /over-the-top overkill type attacks. When I say hundreds of attacks, I'm not exaggerating, the game literally has hundreds of attacks, maybe even thousands of unique animations if you involve a fusionist into the mix.\n\nIt's incredibly difficult to find anything bad to say about the game, as someone who's played it for consistantly on and off for 10 years, \n\nIt's easy to say I have over several thousand hours logged on this game outside of steam, and it never gets boring seeing what kind of badass your heroes turn into.

Seus char n tem praticamente nenhuma habilidade, e as armas s\u00e3o como personagens ganham xp, mana evoluem, ganham novas habilidades (atrav\u00e9s do ferreiro).\n\nFerreiros:\nPara ter novas habilidades ou aumentar os level das armas \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio ter um ferreiro, que voce consegue nos primeiros mapas do jogo, para ter novas habilidades ou melhorar \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio apenas mana, s\u00f3 cuidado para ver se ter\u00e1 algum personagem que consegue usar aquela habilidade.\nMana \u00e9 individual de cada char e item ent\u00e3o pode aproveitar\n\nSkil:\nPrimeiramente, voc\u00ea n\u00e3o tem uma barra de mana que \u00e9 usado para skill, tem pontos em 7 classes de habilidades e cada char tem um nivel de aptid\u00e3o em cada uma, que v\u00e3o de F at\u00e9 S e para utilizar as skill voc\u00ea precisa dos pontos necess\u00e1rios naquela habilidade especifica.

This game means a lot to me, so here I go trying to put it into words.\n\nThis game follows a young girl named Marona, whose only companions are the phantoms that she has the power to communicate with. Notable among these is Ash, who was allowed to live on as a phantom as a result of Marona's parents' dying wish. Marona remains optimistic and cheerful because of Ash's guidance, and the advice of her late parents, despite that the rest of the world seems opposed to her.\n\nThe dialogue is beautifully written, and is excellently voice acted by Sandy Fox and Lex Lang among others. Watching Marona slowly win over the people of the world of Ivoire, and seeing the effects of her efforts, not to prove everyone wrong, but just to be nice to everyone, is one of the most touching things I have ever experienced. The joy of Marona making her first friend, and the tragedy of the mysterious Walnut, are very heartfelt and earnest moments of storytelling.\n\nThe battle and leveling systems are wonderfully designed and mechanically complex, as you can expect from NIS. This is a game where you can use any item, including other characters, as a weapon. You go around the map, attaching phantoms to trees, rocks, etc. as Marona yells \"confine!\" and they can use regular weapons like normal, but you can also just pick up a brick that's just laying there and use that. This is the kind of game where you can really just do whatever you want and I love that. It is a SRPG, but there is no grid, which gives the feel of even more freedom. If you like watching numbers go up, you'll be right at home here, there's a lot of that and it's great.\n\nAs far as this PC port specifically goes, I couldn't ask for more. It includes all of the additional content from both the Wii and PSP remakes. The backgrounds and character portraits are high res, though the battle and cutscene sprites are the same as the original, which is a good thing because those look good. There is zero slowdown, at least on my setup, which was an issue on the PSP version, and I've played all the way up to EX-10 and it hasn't crashed once. Mouse support is okay and makes it easy if you want to browse the internet while playing, but I prefer to play it how I did originally, with a Dualshock 2.\n\nPhantom Brave may not have the same kind of humor that you expect from a Disgaea game, but it has so much else to offer that makes it something special. This game had a huge impact on me when I first played it, and continues to, whether I'm replaying it or just thinking about it. Marona is my greatest role model, and I strive to live by her example.\n\nAnd remember:\n\"People will judge you because they can't understand your gift, but don't hate them... You were blessed with that power so you could help people. Grow up compassionate and kind; help even those who hurt you. Then, one day, everyone will come to like you.\"\n\n(Full disclosure: In order to be honest I checked the box that says I got this game for free.

The friend however managed to survive with the help of her father's miracle, but wasn't fully revived, turning him into a Phantom, who are beings not exactly alive or dead. Because of his presence, Marona is shunned by the outside world, thinking that she is possessed. Despite this, she still tries to help the very people who shunned her, believing in her motto that someday, people will like her. Unlike its predecessor (in Steam anyway) Disgaea, the story is much more serious. It is a story of the young girl (Marona) striving to become more liked, at first being treated badly, and then eventually finding people who believe that she does actually do good in her jobs and then finally treating her well. In my opinion, this is one of the main selling points of the game (the story, I mean).\n\n[b]TL;DR: It is a tale of young girl who from being hated due to having her friend as a Phantom becomes more liked due to never giving up and people seeing the fruits of her labor.[/b]\n\n[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]\n\nThe gameplay of the game might be surprising to newcomers as they it doesn't make use of the grid system. Instead, you can freely move across the map, having a set distance you can move per turn. Of course, objects can obstruct your movement, so the circle shown during gameplay is not accurate at all. Another mechanic this game has is the \"Turn\" system. It's a mechanic wherein all phantoms will \"go home\" after a set number of turns of being summoned by Marona, with the exception of this being Marona (obviously), who is not a Phantom ([spoiler]Carona, for balance purposes I assume, also has a limit, despite not being a Phantom[/spoiler]). After this the phantom cannot be deployed again. As a result of this mechanic, the player must think in whether or not deploying the Phantom immediately or waiting for another time. Each phantom can be summoned by Marona from an item ([spoiler]Carona can be summoned and summon as well[/spoiler]), in a big circle around her, unobstructed by height or objects. Bare in mind that there are limits in summoning phantoms, as there can only be a certain amount of Phantoms in the map at any time (items also count as Phantoms). As soon as one Phantom goes home, you can summon another Phantom to take its place.\n\nIn battle, much like Disgaea where you can pick up each other; you can pick up items, players or dead bodies (to equip them) and throw them. This allows for strategic summoning (an example) where Marona throws the item she is equipping and then immediately summons a Phantom there, for long distance action.\n\nEach item/character gives stats to the player equipping it/him/her. Only items however can be used in fusion to increase their stats, their level caps and add new skills (characters can be used in fusion, but cannot gain stats this way, only increase their level cap and add new skills). This allows for some really lame looking weapons to be really overpowered. Generally, unless you are looking for a no-weapon playthrough of the game, this will be the main way of strengthening your characters (leveling up is another way of course, but it's much easier to use fusion instead of grinding levels).\n\nIn replacement of the item world we all know and love from Disgaea, the game has a random dungeon system, where dungeons are generated randomly by a DungeonMonk (yeah... no spaces). These can vary in level (linked to the DungeonMonk's level), in title name, floor number, size of the map, the number of enemies in the map, the type of enemies in the map, the ground type, the items that are spawned in the map and item restrictions.\n\nThe game also has titles, which are leveled up through going through dungeons with them. Each title can hold up to four skills and has a cap of 100% across the board of stats (the left side of the board anyway). Although you can do this, it isn't really needed, as grinding to get this kind of title is long and tedious. You don't even have to do this to finish all the extra maps.\n\nDespite all these differences, I still think that it has that Disgaea feel to it. I also really feel that it's very strategic in the sense that you have to know when to summon Phantoms and the fact you can throw items around and then summon Phantoms there. For gameplay, I'd say this game is very solid and unique.\n\n[b]TL;DR: Lots of mechanics. Good game. Play it.[/b]\n\n[h1]Music:[/h1]\n\nDisclaimer: I can't do music reviews for ship. But I can try.\n\nSince that disclaimer is there, I can only really review on the music on whether or not it fits the game (in my opinion) or if it disturbs the player.\n\nThe music in the game is repeated quite a number of times, but even then, it doesn't feel like it's too bad. It also tends to fit the theme of the game and doesn't really feel out of place. So in my opinion, music is also a pass.\n\n[b]TL;DR: Music. Good. I think.[/b]\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nWith all that said, I think the game is great and will definitely recommend it for people to play. If you're worried about the quality of the port, I will just say that this port is much better and much less buggy.\n\n[b]Mega TL;DR: Good story, less laughs like Disgaea. Gameplay wise this is pretty solid. I think the music is great as well.

I waited roughly 10 years for a PC release, and here it is now, not disappointing me in the slightest. I could not be any happier right now.\n\n[h1]Kind-of-quick general story/gameplay summary for new/unfamiliar players:[/h1]\n\nThe story takes place in the world of Ivoire, and revolves around Marona, a 13-year-old Chroma (a mercenary that takes on odd jobs for payment) who can summon Phantoms to battle for her. She lost her parents eight years before the story kicks in, and lives in a blissful version of hell called \"I love to help everyone but no one else likes me,\" thanks to her ability \"Chartreuse Gale,\" which allows her to summon and talk to Phantoms. She commonly gets underpaid for this reason (despite working hard to complete the job), and basically everyone who knows of her refers to her as \"The Possessed One\" instead of using her actual name. She travels with her Phantom, Ash, who \"died\" along with her parents in the prologue, but was saved from [i]actual[/i] death when Marona's father turned him into a Phantom before they all got killed. Ash now watches over and protects Marona as she takes on her Chroma jobs and tries to win everyone who hates her over with kindness.\n\nThe game plays like a \"turn-based\" RPG in battles. Characters appear in a queue, with faster characters being able to attack first. You move your character around in a defined space, perform an action (attack, heal, etc.), move again if you have not already depleted your movement range, and then end the turn. Enemies follow this process, as well. Back on the home island, you can recruit new Phantoms, get healed, buy new items and weapons, and so forth. And on the world map, you can choose what (unlocked) locations you want to visit and play in.\n\nOh, and since this is a Nippon Ichi Software game, you can grind your characters all the way up to [b]level 9,999[/b]. So, if you like being the physical manifestation of overpowered super death, that is something to work up to. I personally have never managed to accomplish this feat before, but goddammit, I will this time.\n\nAlso, this version includes 100% of the content created for this game. Everything from the base PS2 version and from the versions that were later made for the PSP and Wii are present here. If you want the \"complete\" game, then you will want to buy this one.\n\nAll in all, this is a game that will absolutely rob you of countless hours of your life. But in a good way, so it is very much worth it in the end.", "timestamp_created": 1469472275, "timestamp_updated": 1469474105, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.762721", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24522689": {"recommendationid": "24522689", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053965587", "num_games_owned": 305, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1589, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "last_played": 1516292997}, "language": "english", "review": "Phantom Brave is a fantastic if very unique SRPG. \n\nBased on the Wii version of Phantom Brave, but having all of the extra content of the PSP version, Phantom Brave PC is about a girl named Marona whose family was killed by a monster several years ago, with the exception of her brother, whose magical abilities allowed him to live in a state between life and death as a phantom. Now living alone with her brother, she is shunned by the outside world. Because of her brother, many assume she is posessed and want nothing to do with her. So she sets out to do work as a chroma helping people, hoping that someday people may appreciate her. Its a really heartwarming video game; the relationship between Chroma and her brother is endearing, and you can really tell he cares about her and will do whatever he can to keep her safe. The isolation that Marona feels is constantly heartbreaking, and you can feel the pain and struggle she goes through to be viewed and treated properly. In this lies one of Phantom Brave's strengths; unlike its Disgaea predecessor, the game is much more serious and down-to-earth. The characters are realistic and believable, so the game can really scratch at your heart.\n\nGameplay wise, unlike traditional SRPGs, this game is not grid-based. Instead, you can freely move across the map, having only a set amount of distance you can travel per turn as your limit for movement. Added to this, with the exception of the main character, Marona, you can only have your units on the battlefield for a few turns before they can no longer be used again. As a result, the player must struggle to best determine when and where to summon a unit, for it may be a waste to try and move a unit all the way across the battlefield to strike at an enemy. In this, I find that the game is a bit more strategic than other SRPGs; you can't rely on every unit at once, as doing so would waste your characters. You can't summon characters just anywhere on the battlefield. Every character summoned must be somewhere near Marona. Because of this, you also need to carefully protect Marona, because if she dies, the number of turns you have is limited to how long the remaining units on the battlefield have before they vanish for the rest of the battle. The game is challenging and rewarding. That's not to say that the gameplay is perfect though. The mouse and keyboard controls are a tad clunky. They're servicable to be sure, but ideally I would recommend playing this game with a controller. The game is also somewhat grindy. Its not TOO bad about this, especially if you know how to properly utilize the fusionist character, a unit you can create on the main hub world before going to a new level. With the fusionist you can combine weapons and characters to make better weapons and characters, but if you don't properly utilize this you'll be stuck replaying a few levels a few times over. The fusionist is a bit confusing to get the hang of, and replaying missions you already beat can get dull after a while. But its important to have a strong and sizable team, so you must do these things. Without a sizable party, you may run out of characters to summon too early, thus leaving you stuck with Marona to fight, which may not be ideal depending on how you've strengthened her.\n\nDisregarding all that, the music of this game is really beautiful and relaxing, utilizing a violin as the main instrument.  The main menu theme, Angel Breath, is relaxing and comforting, befitting the more down-to-earth tone of this game. Then boss battle tracks like Game Breaker and Strange Wind offer a much faster pace for fights to make things a bit more exciting, however they continue to utilize an instrumentation that sounds almost like something you'd expect to hear out of classical music, though with a few more modern instruments. Game Breaker in particular makes good use of the acoustic guitar for its main melody. All in all, the music is really great, and a huge step up from Disgaea 1 in my opinion.\n\nAll in all, the game is great and I definitely recommend giving it a try!\n\nAlso, if you're worried about the game port: Don't be! Unlike Disgaea PC, this port is much cleaner and almost entirely devoid of bugs, complete with more menu options than its predecessor.

It's also pobably their most serious in terms of story, even though there are still many comedic moments in that more dramatic overall framework.\n\nHowever, what makes the game unique are really its gameplay systems, and most directly 3 of its features:\n[LIST]\n[*]Free movement and positioning on the map - unlike in most SRPGs, particularly those developed in Japan, you are [B]not bound to a grid[/B], or hexes, or any other fixed partitioning. This also means that all spells and attacks have ranges which are expressed in 3D shapes, not sets of tiles.\n[*]All your units except Marona are Phantoms which are [B]\"confined\"[/B] into objects on the battlefield. Depending on which objects you use this causes significant effects on stats. Furthermore, phantoms only remain on the battlefield for a limited number of turns (depending on some factors).\n[*]Both battlefield objects and units can be equipped as items, and often grant item-specific skills.\n[/LIST]\nThere's more to it of course, including the N1 staple character and item leveling, as well as a random dungeon generation system, and so on and so forth. But the 3 points above are what make it very unique even in the space of N1 SRPGs.\n\nThe PC version of the game is marketed as DEFINITIVE, and as far as I can tell that is absolutely the case. It includes all the content from all previous releases (including dual audio tracks), supports[B] arbitrary resolutions and 60 FPS[/B], and includes recreated HD UI graphics as well high-res 2D art. Both mouse/keyboard and gamepad controls are supported and work well. Outside of recreating all the sprites - which is understandably out of scope for a port such as this - it's about as great a version of Phantom Brave as we are ever likely to get.\n\nIn addition to the unique gamplay, the game also features a fantastic soundtrack, probably one of the best in any N1 game. [b][i]Overall, it's a must play for all SRPG fans, especially those who have not played any of the game's previous versions.[/i][/b]\n\n(Oh, and I did play its previous versions, so this review is based on the entirety of the game, regardless of what the hour count says)", "timestamp_created": 1469468684, "timestamp_updated": 1469472325, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 223, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.921919", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24522258": {"recommendationid": "24522258", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045223183", "num_games_owned": 199, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 17, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473357995}, "language": "english", "review": "Just recommending the game here :)\n\n#5mins_Reviewer", "timestamp_created": 1469468645, "timestamp_updated": 1469468695, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.141754", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24521913": {"recommendationid": "24521913", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057217695", "num_games_owned": 3262, "num_reviews": 98, "playtime_forever": 1782, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469779717}, "language": "russian", "review": "[quote=\u0414\u0436\u043e\u0440\u0434\u0436 \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u043d. \u00ab\u0411\u0438\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u041a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0439\u00bb]\u0424\u0430\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043c\u044b \u0432\u043e\u0434\u044f\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432\u0435\u0437\u0434\u0435. \u041c\u044b \u043d\u043e\u0441\u0438\u043c \u0438\u0445 \u0441 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0439, \u043a\u0443\u0434\u0430 \u0431\u044b \u043d\u0438 \u043e\u0442\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0441\u044c.[/quote]\n\n\u0422\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u044f\u043f\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0440\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 [b]Phantom Brave[/b] \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043e \u0437\u043d\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043c \u0436\u0430\u043d\u0440\u0430. \u0412 2004 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0443 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0432\u044b\u0448\u043b\u0430 \u043d\u0430 [b]PlayStation 2[/b], \u0437\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043c \u0432 2009 \u043d\u0430 [b]PSP[/b] \u0438 [b]Wii[/b] \u0432\u044b\u0448\u0435\u043b \u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u0439\u043a \u0441 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u044d\u043f\u0438\u0437\u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c\u0438, \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0436\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0438, \u0430 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0436\u0435 \u0443\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0439, \u0441\u0430\u0443\u043d\u0434\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0438 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 \u0443\u0434\u043e\u0431\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0444\u0435\u0439\u0441\u043e\u043c.

Much of the post-game is finding strategies to tweak and break the standard grind, allowing power-levelling and building ludicrous stats.\n*Unlike most strategy RPGs, Phantom Brave has a free-movement system, which, while occasionally finnicky, allows for unit movement and placement unrestricted by grids. \n*Phantom Brave actually has a good story. Focusing around Marona, a girl who can see ghosts and summon them to fight for her, and Ash, a deceased friend of Marona's long-dead parents. Marona remains upbeat, chipper, and honest in a world that considers her cursed. \n*Infinite random dungeons.", "timestamp_created": 1521098173, "timestamp_updated": 1521098173, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40754133": {"recommendationid": "40754133", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025290721", "num_games_owned": 277, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 952, "last_played": 1521594404}, "language": "english", "review": "NIS is known for their strategy games, and each one has a special charm, but Phantom Brave will always be my favroite NIS title, and my favorite SRPG. \n\nThe game is very unique in the way it condutcs itself. On the surface, it seems like its just a typical turn based strategy game, but Phantom Brave puts out two unique twists to the genre:\n\n1). you can freely move about the map, there are no tiles. If you have the movement stat, you can go pretty much anywhere\n\n2). you start each battle with one character. You summon units, called \"phantoms\" by channeling their spirit into objects. Each unit you summon also has a set amount of turns they can be used before they dissapear for the remainder of the battle.\n\nThese two aspects of the game make it such a unique and fun experience, and it defenitely makes you think about each battle.  It also forces the player to train other units and establish an army, because if you have 1 OP unit, you cannot have him go around and kill everything, you need to utlize other characters and classes, otherwise you will run out of characters and will most likely get a game over. \n\nAs for the music, there are some tracks that are truly memorable (the title screen for instance), and there are tracks that are just \"ok\" but nothing that will strain your ears. \n\nThe story isn't too much to write home about in my opinion. It's not a waste of time, and it does well to complement the gameplay, but it's not the best part of the game. \n\nIf you are a fan of NIS, SRPGS, or RPGs in general and want something truly unique, then this game is for you.\n\nThis is also the defenitive version of the game.

I had to set the resolution and other settings each time I opened the program.\n- The default character filtering setting is cancer.  Seriously, I can't play the game with the default \"Character Filtering: 1\" quality setting.  It makes me nauseous.  Filter: 2 isn't quite as bad, but I prefer to have it OFF.  Give me the unfiltered sprites; I can handle it.
